---------00:18----------
and they're designed to be like


---------00:19----------
advocates support


---------00:20----------
sort of your your personal healer or a


---------00:23----------

---------00:51----------
let's just start with


---------00:52----------
introductions so can you tell us um we


---------00:55----------
can stop with


---------00:56----------
start with uh bobby um why don't you


---------00:59----------
just tell us a little bit about kind of


---------01:01----------
who you


---------01:01----------
are and and what's your involvement in


---------01:04----------
the smash community


---------01:06----------
yeah absolutely what's up dr k thanks


---------01:08----------
for having us here


---------01:09----------
yeah man good to see you again yeah


---------01:12----------
likewise likewise


---------01:13----------
uh i'm bobby scar i'm uh been a melee


---------01:16----------
player since 2006


---------01:17----------
uh and you know i switched into


---------01:21----------
ranked number 69 best player of all time


---------01:24----------
uh i'm actually trying to get back into


---------01:26----------
the game i want to get good again


---------01:27----------
so we'll see if i can get better than


---------01:29----------
69th


---------01:30----------
in 2020 i think that hugo what do you


---------01:33----------
think if i'm top 50


---------01:34----------
in like a year you give me top 100 all


---------01:37----------
the time right


---------01:39----------
yeah easy if you could hit tactics you


---------01:41----------
could do it but that's a big if because


---------01:43----------
so the melee community's grown two times


---------01:45----------
since i was big 2013 there was a huge


---------01:47----------
surge


---------01:48----------
and now it feels like more people are


---------01:50----------
getting in the game so uh


---------01:51----------
it's an exciting time to play melee


---------01:53----------
because of the competition but uh


---------01:56----------
yeah uh the past couple years i've


---------01:58----------
mostly been commentating so


---------02:00----------
yeah coming back to the game it'll be


---------02:01----------
hard but um yeah happy to be here and


---------02:04----------
talk about uh things that are i guess


---------02:07----------
outside of the game but super important


---------02:09----------
to


---------02:09----------
uh being a player in the melee community


---------02:12----------
the smash community and


---------02:13----------
you know what it means i feel like we're


---------02:15----------
talking about what it means to be in a


---------02:16----------
gaming community


---------02:17----------
in general so it's a topic really


---------02:19----------
important to me


---------02:21----------
cool thanks man jisoo


---------02:25----------
uh yeah so um i mean first and foremost


---------02:29----------
i'm just like


---------02:30----------
i guess like a community artist and i


---------02:32----------
got my start


---------02:33----------
super early on like i've been in the


---------02:34----------
scene since i was like literally a


---------02:37----------
child like 15 um which now now i'm 22


---------02:41----------
and there's like it's crazy because


---------02:43----------
growing up i was like one of like the


---------02:45----------
youngest people if not like


---------02:47----------
i'm not probably not the youngest but


---------02:49----------
you know like i was like part of the


---------02:50----------
younger crowd and now there's like i


---------02:52----------
i'm growing up like that i see like 15


---------02:54----------
14 even like 12 year olds like playing


---------02:56----------
the game


---------02:57----------
and they like quadruple like shine your


---------02:59----------
shield and they can like


---------03:00----------
like perfect frame one wave shine out of


---------03:03----------
it and it's like it's crazy but anyways


---------03:05----------
anyways um yeah like i would i've been


---------03:09----------
to like all the tournaments and stuff


---------03:10----------
and i kind of started the whole like


---------03:12----------
selling your art there kind of thing and


---------03:14----------
it started off as a hobby


---------03:16----------
but as smash grew um like all these


---------03:19----------
tournaments and stuff got bigger so


---------03:20----------
that's kind of how i established myself


---------03:24----------
cool sparkly piggy


---------03:27----------
and tell us what you guys want to be


---------03:29----------
called i'm just reading your discord


---------03:31----------
names


---------03:33----------
you can call me piggy that's fine okay


---------03:36----------
yeah so can you tell us a little bit


---------03:37----------
about yourself yeah sure


---------03:40----------
so uh let's see my name is kyle i have


---------03:43----------
been in the smash community for six or


---------03:45----------
seven years


---------03:46----------
um chicago scene for the most part i


---------03:48----------
started out


---------03:49----------
as a commentator at my locals just that


---------03:51----------
was the way that i liked experiencing


---------03:53----------
the game


---------03:54----------
um and then when i entered grad school


---------03:55----------
for psychology cognitive neuroscience


---------03:57----------
i started researching the expertise


---------04:00----------
acquisition of smash


---------04:02----------
so uh i have both um oh


---------04:06----------
thank you community experience and


---------04:07----------
research experience but i think the


---------04:09----------
thing that's going to matter most today


---------04:11----------
is that i've been working uh


---------04:14----------
directing running the scenes um


---------04:18----------
attempt at a grassroots code of conduct


---------04:20----------
for the last two years


---------04:21----------
so there's a lot of


---------04:25----------
things i would love to say or


---------04:26----------
communicate or discuss today because


---------04:28----------
i've got a lot of opinions having been


---------04:30----------
on the front lines for the last two


---------04:31----------
years


---------04:32----------
experiencing harassment experiencing


---------04:35----------
unpopular decisions experiencing lack of


---------04:37----------
support so i'm really glad to have


---------04:39----------
everybody


---------04:40----------
else here today uh to to talk about that


---------04:42----------
aspect


---------04:43----------
because there's a lot of feels and a lot


---------04:44----------
of thoughts uh


---------04:46----------
that we should address and are finally


---------04:49----------
because of the events of july


---------04:51----------
being given the attention they deserve


---------04:54----------
awesome thank you very much piggy um


---------04:57----------
tk is that hi uh


---------05:00----------
yeah ck breezy or tk it doesn't matter


---------05:02----------
uh i guess


---------05:03----------
tk's probably easier but uh yeah i'm tk


---------05:06----------
breezy i commentate


---------05:08----------
smash i've been commentating for the


---------05:10----------
last like i don't know 10 years


---------05:12----------
um mostly mostly the not


---------05:16----------
melee game like so whatever is like


---------05:18----------
going on the side of melee i'm pretty


---------05:19----------
much doing that but i do commentate


---------05:20----------
melee as well because i mean


---------05:22----------
it's just a fun game to talk about um


---------05:26----------
i don't know i've grown up in the smash


---------05:27----------
community like since you know since i've


---------05:29----------
been in it for so long


---------05:30----------
and you know things it's nice to see


---------05:33----------

---------05:34----------
uh from the way things were before you


---------05:37----------
know there's a lot of stuff that i feel


---------05:39----------
like


---------05:39----------
we look back on we're kind of like and


---------05:41----------
it's uh it goes even further


---------05:43----------
past like with everything going on with


---------05:44----------
the metoo movement it's just like in


---------05:46----------
general like how people spoke and how


---------05:47----------
people interacted


---------05:48----------
a lot of that has like changed uh and a


---------05:51----------
lot of that i've been able to see since


---------05:52----------
i've been around for so long


---------05:54----------
and it's nice to see but obviously uh we


---------05:56----------
have a lot more to still work on and i'm


---------05:58----------
glad to be part of


---------06:00----------
this conversation and talk about what we


---------06:02----------
can do to continue to move forward


---------06:04----------
um and make this place a safer place and


---------06:06----------
a


---------06:07----------
and a more inviting place for everyone


---------06:09----------

---------06:11----------

---------06:37----------
hugo i've been


---------06:38----------
competing in smash uh since about 2004


---------06:42----------
and


---------06:42----------
unlike my friend bobby scar here i am


---------06:45----------
part of the top 100 old-time


---------06:47----------
uh true credit words do yeah uh no no so


---------06:50----------
i've been playing for a long time and


---------06:52----------
i've seen the


---------06:53----------
scene grow up from it's super super


---------06:56----------
early stages


---------06:58----------
up until all the way uh to where we're


---------07:00----------
at now


---------07:01----------
and i've seen a lot of progress i've


---------07:02----------
seen a lot of change but then there


---------07:04----------
are always things that we can work on um


---------07:07----------
and so this conversation seemed like


---------07:10----------
something i definitely wanted to be a


---------07:11----------
part of


---------07:12----------
um just because i've seen so much and


---------07:16----------
especially after the events of july so


---------07:19----------
yeah happy to be here and happy to


---------07:21----------
actually hear all your voices again it's


---------07:23----------
been a while


---------07:25----------
cool thank you guys very much for coming


---------07:28----------
so let's start with this what happened


---------07:29----------
in july


---------07:30----------
because the events of july


---------07:35----------
a lot damn i don't even know where to


---------07:38----------
start who's gonna be the storyteller


---------07:39----------
because to be honest i've been on


---------07:41----------
i've been uh not as embedded right so i


---------07:44----------
mean i can tell the story from a more


---------07:45----------
outside perspective


---------07:46----------
you know what what i heard but does


---------07:49----------
anybody want to volunteer


---------07:50----------
i think about it but i also feel like


---------07:53----------
there are


---------07:54----------
like jisoo your actions directly


---------07:56----------
impacted


---------07:58----------
what unfolded so i i don't know if


---------08:00----------
you're comfortable telling me i mean


---------08:02----------
okay so i'm not gonna i'm gonna first


---------08:05----------
and foremost say that i don't know


---------08:06----------
every single story like i think we all


---------08:10----------
can


---------08:10----------
like confidently say that there was like


---------08:13----------
i mean the kotaku article was like


---------08:15----------
there's 50 plus like different


---------08:17----------
allegations i don't think all of us i


---------08:18----------
don't think any of us had time to go


---------08:20----------
through


---------08:20----------
all 50 plus of those and like do the


---------08:23----------
whole thing


---------08:24----------
do the whole like crazy wall like let's


---------08:27----------
piece all the like


---------08:28----------
stories together and like figure that


---------08:30----------
stuff out i just know


---------08:31----------
like what i know and basically


---------08:35----------
what happened was that like so i'm i was


---------08:38----------
kind of on the sidelines too


---------08:40----------
because i was actually like on a break


---------08:41----------
from social media like i was taking a


---------08:43----------
break from smash


---------08:44----------
i was just focusing on school like


---------08:46----------
artwork my career


---------08:48----------
um and like i would like loosely like


---------08:51----------
peek back in


---------08:52----------
you know like sometimes my friends would


---------08:54----------
show me things and like it's not like i


---------08:55----------
like didn't care about the smash


---------08:57----------
community anymore but


---------08:58----------
i saw that like you know


---------09:01----------
and for those who don't know me i have


---------09:03----------
my own like uh story


---------09:05----------
and kind of background that makes me


---------09:07----------
very familiar


---------09:08----------
with like you know like situations of


---------09:10----------
like harassment or like feeling like you


---------09:12----------
can't


---------09:13----------
come out with your story right so i


---------09:15----------
always felt like


---------09:16----------
even though i did make my statement i


---------09:19----------
didn't make a full statement i didn't


---------09:20----------
like go into detail


---------09:22----------
i didn't divulge publicly you know


---------09:25----------
what exactly i went through and


---------09:28----------
how long ago was that that was a long


---------09:30----------
time ago right it was a long long time


---------09:32----------
ago i was


---------09:33----------
like i said um most of it happened when


---------09:35----------
i was like


---------09:36----------
15 to 17 and then i came out with it


---------09:38----------
when i was like 18 19


---------09:40----------
um and then i just kind of held on to it


---------09:42----------
for years and


---------09:44----------
it wasn't until i saw that


---------09:47----------
people like other people in the


---------09:49----------
community you know they were finally


---------09:50----------
starting to come forward with their


---------09:52----------
stories and i think it's just because of


---------09:54----------
like


---------09:54----------
the whole you know the world right now


---------09:56----------
it's like we're in a really tense place


---------09:57----------
like this whole pandemic


---------09:59----------
like we're all kind of like in a


---------10:00----------
standstill staying at home


---------10:02----------
being able to like actually have the


---------10:04----------
time to self-reflect and it's not just


---------10:05----------
the smash community that this was


---------10:06----------
afflicted with it was uh


---------10:08----------
like i mean obviously there's a bit


---------10:10----------
there's been a ton of big streamers like


---------10:11----------
in league


---------10:13----------
dota uh i think like the quake scene i


---------10:17----------
don't i don't know but


---------10:18----------
basically there's this whole movement


---------10:20----------
now for people to finally get like the


---------10:22----------
retribution acknowledgement and justice


---------10:25----------
and um that obviously spilled over into


---------10:28----------
smash


---------10:29----------
and i saw that there are a bunch of


---------10:31----------
people finally


---------10:32----------
starting to speak out and it almost felt


---------10:35----------
like cathartic for me


---------10:36----------
like i always felt like i always knew


---------10:39----------
like especially as a woman


---------10:40----------
um and and a woman and a minor and just


---------10:43----------
like


---------10:44----------
like just a minority within the


---------10:45----------
community it doesn't you don't have to


---------10:47----------
be like a woman or a minor just


---------10:48----------
if you're some kind of non-majority


---------10:50----------
group there are like things that you


---------10:53----------
face


---------10:53----------
that are hard to bring up just like in


---------10:55----------
any other community because you're not


---------10:57----------
the front-facing personality


---------10:59----------
you're not you're not the the main


---------11:01----------
experience that everyone else has so


---------11:03----------
it's hard to get people to empathize


---------11:04----------
with that so i think people stayed quiet


---------11:06----------
but finally you know people are getting


---------11:08----------
the strength to come out with their


---------11:09----------
stories


---------11:10----------
and that's kind of what prompted me to


---------11:12----------
come back and be like


---------11:14----------
you know i've been like waiting for this


---------11:16----------
moment for so long


---------11:17----------
and i think like the way i came about it


---------11:19----------
on social media because this is how i've


---------11:21----------
always been but like i'm


---------11:22----------
i come off kind of i don't know if this


---------11:24----------
is the right word but i come off very


---------11:25----------
like confident or snarky and like people


---------11:27----------
kind of took that


---------11:28----------
the wrong way they almost painted me


---------11:29----------
like a villain figure because they're


---------11:30----------
like


---------11:31----------
they're like what do you why like why


---------11:33----------
are you painting why are you saying this


---------11:35----------
in such a like


---------11:36----------
like vindictive way and it's just like i


---------11:38----------
i feel like if you've


---------11:39----------
lived with something like this for years


---------11:41----------
you know it's like


---------11:43----------
it's like i said it's cathartic it's


---------11:44----------
relieving um


---------11:46----------
but yeah that's kind of what tumbled


---------11:48----------
it's kind of what like started


---------11:50----------
everything into this big like tumble


---------11:51----------
and like i don't want to list any names


---------11:54----------
because that's that's


---------11:56----------
we're just going to open up a big can of


---------11:57----------
worms but like there are a ton of big


---------12:00----------
commentators


---------12:00----------
players um and just like known community


---------12:04----------
members who


---------12:05----------
were either like abused or you know the


---------12:09----------
the accused


---------12:10----------
and later you know admitted to it and


---------12:13----------
i i have to say because i am


---------12:16----------
i knew in my position as one of the


---------12:20----------
more well-known like minorities within


---------12:22----------
the scene


---------12:23----------
i felt like almost like a duty


---------12:25----------
especially because i know these


---------12:26----------
struggles i almost felt like a duty to


---------12:30----------
do whatever i can to push the movement


---------12:33----------
as much as possible and like i said i


---------12:36----------
try to do with as much


---------12:38----------
due diligence as possible like i it's


---------12:40----------
not like i played


---------12:41----------
every single situation correctly which


---------12:42----------
by the way i don't think you should ever


---------12:44----------
expect


---------12:45----------
anybody who has that much burden or like


---------12:49----------
just information to be able to play


---------12:52----------
like play like play-by-play handle such


---------12:55----------
a sensitive topic


---------12:56----------
in a perfect way that if anything that'd


---------12:58----------
be that would be more suspicious to me


---------12:59----------
but anyways like


---------13:01----------
um you know especially with the whole


---------13:03----------
like cancel culture


---------13:04----------
rhetoric you know i had this whole i had


---------13:06----------
this these waves of people coming abby


---------13:08----------
be like but you're doing this for clout


---------13:10----------
or this or that it's just like no


---------13:11----------
like why would i take a year off


---------13:14----------
can i just jump in for a second so so


---------13:17----------
jisoo i get the impression that you're


---------13:19----------
talking


---------13:20----------
around a lot of stuff so like people


---------13:23----------
will say like


---------13:23----------
the movement and then things started to


---------13:26----------
happen


---------13:27----------
and you're kind of like you're kind of


---------13:28----------
dipping just right along the surface so


---------13:31----------
like let's take a step because i


---------13:32----------
actually don't


---------13:32----------
know i haven't followed much right so


---------13:36----------
let's just start like what


---------13:37----------
started happening sexual assault


---------13:40----------
allegations


---------13:42----------
of major smash figureheads players


---------13:44----------
commentators


---------13:45----------
they ranged from um outright rape to


---------13:48----------
drug facilitated violence


---------13:50----------
to soliciting nudes from minors to


---------13:53----------
actually sexually assaulting minors


---------13:56----------
there are 90 cases right now


---------14:00----------
the i think the most shocking ones were


---------14:02----------
the sexually related


---------14:03----------
uh accusations um and there there have


---------14:06----------
been several careers that have been


---------14:07----------
ended just straight up ended


---------14:09----------
because of the things that were revealed


---------14:11----------
on social media


---------14:13----------
and do you guys have a sense of like


---------14:15----------
what


---------14:16----------
so jisoo had sort of mentioned that


---------14:18----------
sometimes it's hard to speak


---------14:20----------
which i i think is common when it comes


---------14:22----------
to issues of like


---------14:23----------
sexual assault or other kinds of


---------14:25----------
predatory behavior


---------14:27----------
does anyone have a sense of what caused


---------14:30----------
people to


---------14:31----------
start the movement or like what what


---------14:33----------
happened well like


---------14:35----------
how did these elevators i think it only


---------14:37----------
took i think it only took one person


---------14:39----------
so like obviously there's a lot that is


---------14:42----------
behind the scenes that people weren't


---------14:44----------
willing to say because they weren't


---------14:46----------
uh they weren't sure of the consequences


---------14:49----------
and to be honest i mean like


---------14:50----------
some of those consequences were exactly


---------14:51----------
what you thought they were like where


---------14:53----------
you would


---------14:53----------
someone will come up with a story and


---------14:55----------
instead of people being like


---------14:56----------
oh man we believe you you know they want


---------14:58----------
to be like oh we need proof


---------15:00----------
oh you're just trying to do this to ruin


---------15:01----------
this person's career when like


---------15:03----------
you know that's that's not the point you


---------15:06----------
know i mean it's it's just like


---------15:07----------
the point was basically to let you know


---------15:09----------
that you know your heroes basically


---------15:10----------
aren't


---------15:11----------
the people that you think they are you


---------15:12----------
know like it wasn't every person


---------15:14----------
every top player isn't like a good


---------15:16----------
person and every top commentator is a


---------15:17----------
good person


---------15:18----------
and it didn't even have to be just top


---------15:20----------
players top commentators some of those


---------15:21----------
people were like


---------15:22----------
you know o2 people people just go to


---------15:24----------
your local it just


---------15:26----------
though i think the point they were


---------15:26----------
trying to show was that like you know uh


---------15:29----------
enough is enough and i don't know who


---------15:32----------
exactly did the first


---------15:33----------
first one but i know that it was


---------15:35----------
basically a chain reaction like one


---------15:37----------
person


---------15:38----------
put out a big story and then after that


---------15:40----------
it was like


---------15:41----------
just dominoes i remember being up one of


---------15:43----------
those nights i can't remember which


---------15:44----------
night it was but i remember being at one


---------15:45----------
of those nights until like 7 a.m because


---------15:47----------
like a new story came out like every


---------15:49----------
30 minutes and uh i was sitting in this


---------15:51----------
call with tony big shout outs to tony


---------15:53----------
and we just like every time i'll be like


---------15:56----------
all right man i think i'm gonna go sleep


---------15:57----------
people like wait wait wait did you see


---------15:58----------
this and then we would have to like read


---------16:00----------
another one


---------16:01----------
and um i i can't remember which night


---------16:03----------
that was but i know that


---------16:04----------
that same night i think that was


---------16:06----------
probably the same night that nairo got


---------16:07----------
outed


---------16:08----------
that like seven war stories came out uh


---------16:10----------
at the same time


---------16:11----------
and um yeah just to me i don't really


---------16:14----------
know what like sparked the first person


---------16:15----------
to do such but i do know that like it


---------16:17----------
was more


---------16:18----------
a lot it was probably like a lead by


---------16:19----------
example type deal with


---------16:21----------
everybody else who decided to come out


---------16:23----------
uh with their stories after


---------16:25----------
i think the nairo thing was the first


---------16:27----------
thing i saw like the first notable


---------16:29----------
i don't like using the word notable but


---------16:31----------
like known player


---------16:32----------
on like a big pedestal that was also


---------16:35----------
involved with


---------16:36----------
another really known player which i


---------16:37----------
think is another reason why people felt


---------16:39----------
so encouraged and like


---------16:41----------
really that they could actually talk


---------16:43----------
about this stuff because it's not just


---------16:44----------
like it's not just randoms anymore


---------16:45----------
can you guys tell tell me who naira is


---------16:48----------
and what happened with naira


---------16:50----------
nairo is well nairo's pretty much the


---------16:53----------
face of like the other side of the smash


---------16:55----------
community like he


---------16:55----------
he was any of the like the brawl the


---------16:59----------
uh smash four and the ultimate like he


---------17:02----------
was pretty much at the forefront of that


---------17:04----------
for like a long time uh he was also


---------17:06----------
i think he probably was the biggest


---------17:08----------
streamer uh for smash on twitch


---------17:10----------
um yeah if it was it was pretty him and


---------17:13----------
mango well


---------17:14----------
mango's probably bigger than him but as


---------17:15----------
far as like not melee he was


---------17:17----------
pretty much the biggest and uh he


---------17:21----------
um he had a


---------17:25----------
sexual relationship with a minor um


---------17:28----------
like i guess three years two years ago


---------17:30----------
or whatever and covered it up by paying


---------17:32----------
said person with hush money


---------17:33----------
and uh and i guess they both covered up


---------17:36----------
the story for a long time because that


---------17:38----------
that rumor had been around for a while


---------17:40----------
and then um on this said night


---------17:44----------
uh captain zack the uh other member


---------17:47----------
decided to


---------17:48----------
tell the truth and the truth was that


---------17:50----------
that like you know they did have like a


---------17:52----------
relation


---------17:53----------
uh ship of some sort um before it was


---------17:56----------
legal like captain zach's 18 now but you


---------17:58----------
know at the time i think he was 15 or 16


---------18:00----------
when it when it happened


---------18:03----------
so nairo and captain zach are both males


---------18:07----------
yeah yes okay and and so


---------18:12----------
i i guess so s captain zach sort of


---------18:15----------
said that this did happen and then yeah


---------18:18----------
sort of what


---------18:19----------
what happened after that uh nairo


---------18:22----------
deleted his account


---------18:23----------
um and then came back to say i guess


---------18:27----------
like he apologized


---------18:28----------
for letting everybody down and then he


---------18:30----------
deleted his account again


---------18:31----------
and his like i'm sure that i'm sure that


---------18:34----------
he lost the sponsor


---------18:35----------
because i mean he was sponsored by


---------18:37----------
energy that's gone


---------18:39----------
um i think his twitch account just got


---------18:41----------
banned


---------18:42----------
and uh yeah he's kind of he's been gone


---------18:45----------
ever since like we have


---------18:46----------
ever since that day like we have not


---------18:47----------
heard anything from him uh i don't think


---------18:49----------
he has twitter accounts up or anything


---------18:50----------
like that


---------18:52----------
okay and so there was a case involving a


---------18:56----------
well-known ultimate player named ally um


---------18:58----------
in which the code of conduct gave him a


---------19:00----------
lifetime ban for having a


---------19:01----------
underage relationship with zach as well


---------19:04----------
so there's a lot


---------19:05----------
a lot of layers and


---------19:08----------
uh complexities to that case as well to


---------19:12----------
nara's case as well


---------19:13----------
um and i'd say that the other big name i


---------19:16----------
got


---------19:17----------
bobby were you gonna say something i was


---------19:18----------
just gonna ask would you all agree that


---------19:20----------
like


---------19:20----------
when you get into the deed like some of


---------19:21----------
the details are kind of messed up in


---------19:23----------
other words like that that's the way


---------19:24----------
that it went down but kind of like the


---------19:26----------
way in which the hush money and the


---------19:28----------
um you know my my impression was that


---------19:30----------
captain zach had a hell of a time


---------19:32----------
um you know was not it wasn't just uh


---------19:36----------
like there's details that make it worse


---------19:38----------
yeah don't agree with that like most of


---------19:39----------
these stories it's like


---------19:41----------
there's a story and then you kind of


---------19:44----------
it's like okay that sounds not good uh


---------19:46----------
but you don't know until you hear the


---------19:48----------
details and then the details usually


---------19:49----------
make it worse


---------19:50----------
like considerably worse it's like it's


---------19:52----------
hard to talk about people are not really


---------19:53----------
treating one another with respect and


---------19:55----------
people are forcing


---------19:56----------
generally what i've heard is that people


---------19:58----------
with power and with the ped you know


---------20:00----------
people who have


---------20:02----------
called clout which we should probably


---------20:03----------
talk about they've generally like


---------20:05----------
abused their power um and people who do


---------20:08----------
not have power have really suffered


---------20:10----------
and we heard a lot about it and the


---------20:12----------
stories that came out were


---------20:13----------
over i would have to say like a 10 year


---------20:15----------
span i mean i feel like we heard about


---------20:17----------
stuff that happened in 2011 2012


---------20:19----------
so the floodgates really opened up um


---------20:22----------
would you all agree that those are the


---------20:24----------
go ahead i was just going to say so so


---------20:25----------
hugs kind of commented that it's


---------20:27----------
it's hard to share the details why is


---------20:29----------
that


---------20:31----------
um well that month when all of that went


---------20:33----------
down i think that was


---------20:34----------
probably the roughest of the whole


---------20:36----------
pandemic and one of the roughest months


---------20:38----------
that i've ever gone through because


---------20:39----------
a lot of these people at one point were


---------20:42----------
my friends


---------20:43----------
and um when you would read the details


---------20:47----------
you had to um acknowledge that


---------20:50----------
they weren't the people that you thought


---------20:52----------
they were they weren't uh good as you


---------20:54----------
thought they were


---------20:55----------
and um it was really a battle throughout


---------20:57----------
that time


---------20:58----------
to cope with that and so to uh


---------21:02----------
discuss details is to re-acknowledge


---------21:04----------
what had happened


---------21:05----------
and um that not that


---------21:09----------
not that you shouldn't right but it's


---------21:10----------
just it's just a difficult thing to


---------21:13----------
to to get into detail about and some of


---------21:16----------
it is just uh straight up uh


---------21:18----------
unpleasant to hear about period like


---------21:20----------
whether it was a friend or not


---------21:22----------
so um yeah it's it was all


---------21:25----------
[ __ ] up yeah yeah


---------21:28----------
yeah for lack of a better term that's


---------21:30----------
that's really what it is i mean it's


---------21:32----------
it's the language that you're just not


---------21:33----------
used to using i don't think i've said


---------21:35----------
sexual assault or rape in like this much


---------21:36----------
any long time um or like just


---------21:40----------
you know like things of that nature and


---------21:42----------
then on top of that it's the people


---------21:44----------
that it is uh seeing that like you know


---------21:46----------
when it comes to


---------21:47----------
like the commentators that i had got


---------21:51----------
um outed a lot of these people like you


---------21:53----------
know i sat next to you like i worked


---------21:54----------
with


---------21:54----------
i considered them friends you know and


---------21:57----------
uh


---------21:58----------
and it's like you don't expect to


---------22:01----------
oh just to to feel those people kind of


---------22:04----------
fade away


---------22:05----------
just just to sit next to someone for to


---------22:07----------
have these people as friends and and


---------22:09----------
kind of read about


---------22:11----------
you know what i'm almost hearing is like


---------22:13----------
there's some amount of like protection


---------22:15----------
you can offer yourself


---------22:17----------
as long as you hear things in in broad


---------22:20----------
strokes


---------22:21----------
but once the details start to come out


---------22:23----------
what i'm hearing from hugs is that


---------22:24----------
there's like


---------22:25----------
there's actually like a challenging


---------22:27----------
internal


---------22:28----------
emotional experience yeah i mean


---------22:33----------
it's like for


---------22:36----------
instance like me and senpai are like


---------22:37----------
really close you know i'm saying like we


---------22:39----------
uh prefer


---------22:40----------
for uh contact senpai was one of the


---------22:43----------
first people that outed


---------22:44----------
um she was a female commentator she had


---------22:48----------
a sexual relationship with a minor um


---------22:51----------
that rumor has been going on for years


---------22:53----------
uh


---------22:54----------
sometime i think it was like around 2015


---------22:56----------
2016


---------22:57----------
um and that remember going on for years


---------22:59----------
and then this person


---------23:00----------
uh finally came out and said that that


---------23:03----------
rumor is true and it had like


---------23:05----------
explicit detail all that good stuff so


---------23:07----------
uh she has since


---------23:08----------
not said anything she has not uh she


---------23:10----------
didn't make like a tweet like a


---------23:12----------
apologize and no nothing she just


---------23:13----------
literally ghosted she hasn't streamed


---------23:16----------
she hasn't tweeted none of that um she


---------23:19----------
and her really quote huh that one was a


---------23:22----------
10-year age gap right


---------23:24----------
yeah 14-24 yeah yes yes yes yes


---------23:27----------
so um she has you know like we were


---------23:30----------
really close because like i


---------23:31----------
originally she approached me about how


---------23:33----------
to get into like commentary and i was


---------23:35----------
like oh word like


---------23:36----------
it would be nice to see some more you


---------23:37----------
know uh women faces on commentary like


---------23:39----------
let's


---------23:40----------
work on your craft or whatever so like i


---------23:42----------
would do a lot of locals with her


---------23:43----------
whatever whatever and thus we end up


---------23:44----------
getting close


---------23:45----------
um and then to for that to come out


---------23:48----------
like it was a shock to the point where i


---------23:50----------
like i had texted her like before and it


---------23:52----------
got big and i was like bro is this like


---------23:55----------
is this like really fast and she never


---------23:58----------
texts me back so i just


---------23:59----------
you know it's like a a knee-jerk


---------24:01----------
reaction you're like i want to


---------24:03----------
believe that you're not this person but


---------24:05----------
like i have no reason


---------24:06----------
to do that outside of like i don't know


---------24:09----------
blind stupidity like all the facts are


---------24:11----------
here


---------24:12----------
and i'm getting so now i'm getting like


---------24:14----------
this new mental image of you


---------24:16----------
and it's hard to like balance it with


---------24:17----------
the current mental image i have of you


---------24:20----------
and yeah that's like oh sorry no go


---------24:22----------
ahead


---------24:23----------
oh no i was gonna say that was the


---------24:24----------
hardest part with that is that you have


---------24:27----------
this image that you've crafted of this


---------24:28----------
person through all the years that you've


---------24:30----------
known


---------24:30----------
these different people and then now you


---------24:32----------
have to


---------24:33----------
uh you know match that with what you're


---------24:37----------
seeing


---------24:37----------
now and this awful person that you're


---------24:39----------
reading about and then um


---------24:43----------
it's a challenge to to to know a person


---------24:45----------
one way and then discover them another


---------24:47----------
and then having


---------24:48----------
that's that's what that whole month


---------24:50----------
that's what made that entire month so


---------24:51----------
difficult


---------24:52----------
it's just that that idea of changing a


---------24:55----------
person that you knew


---------24:57----------
um for all those years and turning them


---------24:59----------
into what they


---------25:01----------
were actually doing um


---------25:04----------
i've never had to do that in my life so


---------25:06----------
it was what was that like difficult time


---------25:08----------
bugs terrible um


---------25:11----------
because um it kind of it shakes you


---------25:14----------
because


---------25:15----------
uh there are i i wouldn't say it makes


---------25:18----------
you mistrust people it's more that um


---------25:22----------
um you had these people that you made


---------25:25----------
yourself vulnerable with


---------25:26----------
uh to to allow them into your life to be


---------25:29----------
your friend


---------25:30----------
etc and to find out that they could be


---------25:32----------
this way towards other people


---------25:35----------
it just um


---------25:39----------
i i don't know it i'm sorry i can't


---------25:42----------
describe it very well but it was just


---------25:44----------
[ __ ] terrible


---------25:45----------
sorry you feel me right i feel like the


---------25:48----------
community is like what i've seen is that


---------25:49----------
people feel betrayed


---------25:51----------
by a lot of people betrayed um


---------25:54----------
also uh also you wonder if like if you


---------25:58----------
could have done something about it if um


---------26:01----------
you know if if you had any hand in


---------26:06----------
in letting them get away with this even


---------26:07----------
though that's kind of silly


---------26:09----------
right like no one could have done a lot


---------26:11----------
about


---------26:12----------
a lot of these things that happened but


---------26:14----------
um yeah you just kind of go through


---------26:15----------
those


---------26:16----------
uh motions when you're hearing that kind


---------26:18----------
of news


---------26:20----------
so i'm hearing betrayal i'm hearing


---------26:22----------
bizarrely and let's remember that


---------26:24----------
sometimes


---------26:25----------
feelings aren't logical but


---------26:28----------
i'm i'm almost almost wondering whether


---------26:30----------
hugs sort of feels some amount of


---------26:31----------
irrational responsibility


---------26:34----------
yeah for sure but i mean that also comes


---------26:37----------
with the territory of these people being


---------26:39----------
a part of


---------26:40----------
our community so you you feel like this


---------26:43----------
is something that was happening under


---------26:44----------
your own roof


---------26:45----------
and in that sense i think a lot of us


---------26:47----------
here have been


---------26:49----------
um have felt responsible for the


---------26:52----------
community in some kind of way like we've


---------26:54----------
contributed it


---------26:55----------
uh to it a lot throughout the years


---------26:57----------
every single person here


---------26:59----------
and so when this thing happens under


---------27:01----------
your own roof


---------27:02----------
you do take uh some kind of


---------27:06----------
uh sense of responsibility or at least


---------27:08----------
thinking what you could have done to


---------27:10----------
prevented it uh to prevent it and um


---------27:15----------
yeah and then yeah even uh then there


---------27:17----------
are also even thoughts of


---------27:18----------
self-reflection like how how


---------27:20----------
you might have been uh problematic at


---------27:22----------
some point


---------27:23----------
for different people not to the same


---------27:24----------
degree but you know


---------27:26----------
it was just a whole lot of reflection


---------27:29----------
for all these different kinds of things


---------27:34----------
interesting yeah i think i think the


---------27:35----------
self-reflection was a really big one to


---------27:37----------
you because


---------27:38----------
like you know you you um


---------27:41----------
[Music]


---------27:42----------
like it's almost like the


---------27:43----------
self-reflection plus also seeing like


---------27:45----------
certain patterns that you may have not


---------27:47----------
recognized uh before


---------27:49----------
you know like you you have you're you're


---------27:51----------
like one wild friend or whatever and


---------27:53----------
like you would write it off oh it's just


---------27:54----------
wild you know whatever whatever but then


---------27:56----------
like


---------27:56----------
after everything started coming out you


---------27:57----------
really start to look at some of your


---------27:58----------
interactions with


---------28:00----------
like your friends and like man that


---------28:01----------
actually wasn't okay and i should have


---------28:02----------
said something


---------28:03----------
and so now with this current new


---------28:06----------
knowledge


---------28:07----------
that's like if we ever get back to


---------28:08----------
tournaments you know going


---------28:10----------
barred uh or sent away that like we have


---------28:13----------
this new knowledge of you know what we


---------28:14----------
can do to help


---------28:16----------
um in the heat of the moment instead of


---------28:19----------
like waiting for


---------28:20----------
moments like this where everything has


---------28:22----------
to come tumbling down we could just


---------28:24----------
say something in that moment uh


---------28:27----------
that like we'll get the point across hey


---------28:29----------
bro like she said no a bro like


---------28:31----------
you know you're being a little too like


---------28:33----------
aggressive something like that you know


---------28:35----------
just


---------28:35----------
simple stuff that could literally uh


---------28:37----------
change the whole narrative that night of


---------28:39----------
that outcome


---------28:40----------
just by making someone aware that maybe


---------28:42----------
the way that they are


---------28:43----------
acting or or the way that they are um


---------28:46----------
like you know appearing or whatever is


---------28:48----------
not uh


---------28:50----------
it's not okay what i'm hearing from tk


---------28:52----------
is that they're


---------28:53----------
in hindsight there may have been a


---------28:54----------
couple of red flags


---------28:57----------
you know yeah and and so like what are


---------28:59----------
some of those red flags


---------29:00----------
i see soon nodding emphatically


---------29:04----------
like i'll just tell you straight up as


---------29:06----------
like


---------29:07----------
i think it's not to blame guys but


---------29:10----------
i think it's hard when like you're not


---------29:13----------
like their main target


---------29:14----------
right like if you're let's say you're a


---------29:17----------
girl you walk in the venue


---------29:18----------
and like i think for some people it's


---------29:21----------
really hard to speak or hard to see


---------29:22----------
especially if you're new to the scene


---------29:24----------
but like


---------29:24----------
you know guy walks up to you is like hey


---------29:26----------
do you want to play some games or like


---------29:28----------
do you want to get food or like what's


---------29:30----------
your name and they just have this really


---------29:31----------
vested interest in you for whatever


---------29:33----------
reason total stranger


---------29:34----------
and like you know when i came to my


---------29:37----------
first tournament i


---------29:38----------
i was just young and naive like i just


---------29:40----------
thought these guys were really nice


---------29:41----------
but i quickly learned very quickly


---------29:44----------
i was like you know i i immediately


---------29:46----------
learned i'm like


---------29:47----------
okay this this is kind of weird because


---------29:49----------
they're very insistent and then


---------29:51----------
that's when it hit me i'm like oh


---------29:53----------
they're just i don't know what kind of


---------29:54----------
language you guys use but they're


---------29:56----------
just thirsty as [ __ ] so like that's


---------29:59----------
that's that's like how did you learn


---------30:02----------
that jesus


---------30:04----------
i mean they'll just like they'll they're


---------30:06----------
there's like the normal boundaries of


---------30:08----------
like wanting to get to know someone like


---------30:09----------
so


---------30:11----------
like like you know i i consider myself a


---------30:14----------
pretty interesting person


---------30:15----------
so i wouldn't i would give the best of


---------30:17----------
the doubt if some random person


---------30:18----------
regardless of their identity wants to


---------30:20----------
get to know me it's like hey we can just


---------30:22----------
have a conversation but like


---------30:24----------
that's that's organic that's natural you


---------30:26----------
know


---------30:27----------
um if it starts veering into territory


---------30:29----------
where


---------30:30----------
they pursue you and i use the word


---------30:33----------
pursue very


---------30:34----------
like carefully because like like you


---------30:37----------
know things can develop naturally like


---------30:38----------
i'm friends with a lot of these people


---------30:40----------
in the scene and like things are totally


---------30:43----------
platonic and fine


---------30:44----------
but there are people who you can tell


---------30:46----------
like they'll they'll be flirty


---------30:48----------
um they'll try to like get you into


---------30:49----------
their room they'll


---------30:51----------
they'll use really like slimy methods to


---------30:53----------
like


---------30:54----------
initiate some kind of like physical or


---------30:57----------
like sexual relation with you or maybe


---------30:59----------
maybe they'll start off emotionally you


---------31:00----------
know like they'll like try to like


---------31:03----------
like psychologically or emotionally like


---------31:04----------
bring you into like being


---------31:06----------
dependent or like them being dependent


---------31:08----------
on you and


---------31:09----------
um like okay like


---------31:12----------
like a really good example of this for


---------31:14----------
instance right uh


---------31:17----------
like the whole the whole d1 thing which


---------31:19----------
by the way


---------31:20----------
that was horrible like he he's like he's


---------31:23----------
such a big figure in the scene


---------31:24----------
um and i've like he just to give you


---------31:27----------
guys


---------31:27----------
some context like he would i literally


---------31:29----------
grew up with him and like he would call


---------31:30----------
me like his little sister


---------31:32----------
and it's just like it's it's messed up


---------31:34----------
but anyways


---------31:35----------
um when i thought d1 who was d1 and what


---------31:39----------
happened


---------31:41----------
he's just um so he's like a super


---------31:44----------
veteran in the scene and like like


---------31:46----------
hugs hugs would know him all i mean all


---------31:49----------
of us know him really well


---------31:51----------
and he was just like a front-facing


---------31:52----------
community member like nintendo loved him


---------31:55----------
he was always at every big like public


---------31:59----------
event and he's like this big commentator


---------32:01----------
personality


---------32:03----------
and like you can't go through like any


---------32:06----------
major smash video without d1 in it like


---------32:08----------
it's just


---------32:09----------
that's just like fact um and


---------32:12----------
um basically like you know there's


---------32:16----------
there's a story of him that came out


---------32:18----------
during july


---------32:20----------
where um he basically like and


---------32:24----------
this this story told a lot like he he


---------32:26----------
lured a girl


---------32:28----------
a new girl into his hotel room under the


---------32:31----------
guise


---------32:32----------
of like hey how as a woman


---------32:35----------
you know what's your experience in the


---------32:37----------
community but what it actually turned


---------32:39----------
out to be


---------32:39----------
was him using that as a vehicle to try


---------32:43----------
and take advantage of her um and like


---------32:46----------
you can you can like search these


---------32:47----------
stories up like they're not


---------32:49----------
they're like all publicly out there but


---------32:51----------
the point being is that like you know


---------32:53----------
he knew that he knew using that topic as


---------32:57----------
the opener


---------32:58----------
like that that was him trying to


---------33:00----------
emotionally like connect with her


---------33:02----------
and make him seem like he's her friend


---------33:05----------
but his end goal was you know just take


---------33:08----------
advantage of her and


---------33:09----------
there's there's repeated this happens


---------33:11----------
like repeatedly from people like that


---------33:13----------
like from predators


---------33:15----------
and you'll that's a pattern that you'll


---------33:16----------
see once like if you go over all these


---------33:18----------
stories like you know


---------33:20----------
you can't just be friendly with a girl


---------33:23----------
but if you're doing it multiple times


---------33:26----------
and


---------33:27----------
doing manipulative things like that you


---------33:29----------
know that's definitely a red flag


---------33:33----------
so can i also say oh go ahead go for it


---------33:36----------
peggy you haven't


---------33:37----------
had a chance to jump in a little while


---------33:39----------
so


---------33:40----------
i just wanted to return to this idea of


---------33:42----------
emotional reactions to what has occurred


---------33:44----------
because my reaction has been very


---------33:46----------
different than what um like


---------33:47----------
hugo and tk are describing so when all


---------33:50----------
these allegations started coming out


---------33:52----------
um all these accusations and people


---------33:54----------
feeling shocked and betrayed


---------33:55----------
i really just felt searing white rage


---------33:59----------
because like risu i've experienced so


---------34:01----------
much uh


---------34:02----------
predatory behavior um sexual advances uh


---------34:06----------
and harassment by the community


---------34:07----------
disbelief by the community you know your


---------34:09----------
average guy you tell them like oh that


---------34:10----------
guy's creeping me out and they're like


---------34:11----------
no he's a good guy


---------34:14----------
so none of this surprised me i mean the


---------34:17----------
fact that like zero made it as far as he


---------34:19----------
did without getting called out


---------34:20----------
or nairo or d1 like that that's a little


---------34:23----------
surprising that shows


---------34:24----------
an enormous systemic problem right but


---------34:27----------
but the fact that people do bad things


---------34:28----------
to each other


---------34:29----------
and people leverage a minority status


---------34:32----------
for example or


---------34:34----------
or power imbalances whether it's because


---------34:36----------
of fame and not fame


---------34:38----------
all of those things are a given for me


---------34:40----------
about human behavior and especially


---------34:42----------
behavior within esports because we have


---------34:44----------
no safety protocols


---------34:45----------
um that would otherwise discourage those


---------34:47----------
kinds of things from happening


---------34:48----------
so when we talk about the emotions of


---------34:51----------
all these things are coming out


---------34:52----------
my first was like why didn't you listen


---------34:54----------
to any of us before


---------34:56----------
you know when these things would come


---------34:57----------
out every six weeks everyone would find


---------34:58----------
an excuse to like oh well she


---------35:00----------
actually did this but it took an entire


---------35:02----------
outpouring of 90 stories for you


---------35:04----------
to like look at your fellow friends and


---------35:07----------
be like maybe i need to hold this guy


---------35:08----------
accountable


---------35:09----------
i'm not saying anybody here like has


---------35:11----------
done anything wrong um


---------35:13----------
with all of you and you know i wouldn't


---------35:15----------
want to be talking with you if i didn't


---------35:16----------
feel comfortable


---------35:18----------
yeah but like like it was messed up that


---------35:21----------
like


---------35:21----------
with all the credibility that i have


---------35:23----------
because i've never most people don't


---------35:24----------
even know what i look like


---------35:26----------
like online until pretty recently and


---------35:29----------
like i've had people think that i was a


---------35:30----------
guy for years


---------35:32----------
but like i thought it was messed up when


---------35:34----------
like i was saying everything i was


---------35:36----------
saying


---------35:36----------
and immediately because i'm trying to


---------35:39----------
cancel one of their favorites they're


---------35:40----------
like oh there's like absolute zero


---------35:42----------
credence and it took it didn't take


---------35:44----------
me fighting for myself it took me going


---------35:46----------
to my friends who are guys who had


---------35:48----------
bigger platforms


---------35:49----------
to back me up and it took multiple of


---------35:52----------
them for them to believe me it's like


---------35:53----------
what


---------35:54----------
like i'm never alive why would i lie


---------35:56----------
about this right now


---------35:58----------
peggy what happened when so it sounds


---------35:59----------
like you had tried


---------36:01----------
to speak up or things had happened to


---------36:03----------
you in the past and


---------36:06----------
i'm sort of getting when you sort of say


---------36:08----------
white hot rage


---------36:10----------
i'm i'm sort of hearing that maybe


---------36:13----------
you've been


---------36:14----------
like this was expected and this has been


---------36:16----------
going on and you knew it was a problem


---------36:18----------
for a long time


---------36:19----------
and that people didn't listen so


---------36:22----------
can can you share with us like what you


---------36:24----------
tried to say in the past


---------36:26----------
or what your experiences of harassment


---------36:28----------
were


---------36:29----------
um so i wrote an article i'll send you


---------36:32----------
the link because it goes into the


---------36:34----------
history a little bit more


---------36:36----------
than i can in the space of time we have


---------36:37----------
today but some things


---------36:40----------
within six months of entering smash the


---------36:41----------
only other girl that i hung out with at


---------36:43----------
the event at my locals was sexually


---------36:46----------
assaulted she told rto


---------36:47----------
he's like you don't have any proof so


---------36:51----------
uh nothing was done um so she started


---------36:53----------
going to smash fests which are smaller


---------36:55----------
parties that happened at people's houses


---------36:56----------
rather than organized venues with


---------36:58----------
tournament organizers


---------36:59----------
and she was sexually assaulted there by


---------37:01----------
another guy


---------37:02----------
who said he was comforting her about her


---------37:04----------
first sexuals


---------37:05----------
and you know i'm like 21 and i'm like


---------37:08----------
wow that's messed up


---------37:09----------
what can we do so i talked to her we


---------37:10----------
talked about police reports but guess


---------37:12----------
what police


---------37:13----------
are not designed to handle sexual


---------37:15----------
violence because the kinds of proof


---------37:17----------
that emerge out of sexual violence cases


---------37:19----------
are not um


---------37:20----------
have never been prioritized by the law


---------37:22----------
so for example


---------37:23----------
uh the people people like to talk about


---------37:26----------
emotions versus logic hard versus soft


---------37:28----------
proof


---------37:28----------
but in the end there are um for our


---------37:31----------
complex phenomenon there are going to be


---------37:33----------
multiple different sources of


---------37:36----------
information that are going to say okay


---------37:37----------
this is what most likely happened right


---------37:39----------
but because uh police and the law are


---------37:42----------
trying to actually limit someone's


---------37:43----------
physical freedoms


---------37:44----------
there's a higher standard of proof right


---------37:46----------
but we're in smash community here and


---------37:48----------
uh there so if somebody says a guy raped


---------37:51----------
me


---------37:52----------
why isn't that enough um and of course


---------37:55----------
you have to


---------37:56----------
you have to get uh as much confirmation


---------37:59----------
as you can


---------38:00----------
right but like we're not locking


---------38:01----------
somebody away


---------38:03----------
but if when an accusation like that


---------38:05----------
comes out we're just saying i don't want


---------38:06----------
to play this guy in bracket anymore


---------38:08----------
um so from the very first beginning of


---------38:11----------
smash


---------38:12----------
then to me trying to educate about


---------38:15----------
gender differences for example in


---------38:17----------
a reaction time and stuff like that and


---------38:18----------
people are like oh testosterone


---------38:20----------
and trying to make giant diff


---------38:24----------
sorry trying to uh make the differences


---------38:27----------
between like men and women


---------38:28----------
uh justify their treatment their


---------38:30----------
different treatment of women right like


---------38:32----------
that's


---------38:33----------
i've seen that harassment myself my work


---------38:35----------
uh i've been tried to be fired


---------38:37----------
uh since july because people said i knew


---------38:39----------
about the narrative situation


---------38:41----------
and i didn't but what can you do you


---------38:43----------
can't you can't prove that


---------38:44----------
but someone on the internet can look up


---------38:46----------
your work address and decide to email


---------38:47----------
your whole department saying what a what


---------38:49----------
a pedo protector you are


---------38:50----------
um and i submitted one story


---------38:54----------
uh in the july events i um described an


---------38:56----------
interaction


---------38:57----------
with um somebody that made me


---------38:59----------
uncomfortable because it matched up with


---------39:01----------
the stories or several other people


---------39:02----------
but other than that i have not uh


---------39:05----------
accused anyone of anything


---------39:06----------
um because i've walked through the smash


---------39:08----------
community my entire life in fear


---------39:10----------
i've never left a drink alone i've never


---------39:12----------
gone to a guy's hotel room without


---------39:13----------
somebody else knowing where i was


---------39:15----------
i've always roomed with other women uh


---------39:18----------
i've done


---------39:18----------
so much i've been so hyper vigilant to


---------39:20----------
protect myself because i knew


---------39:22----------
what people are capable of from the very


---------39:24----------
first get-go


---------39:26----------
so i i just i feel raged because


---------39:29----------
i've seen dozens of these stories come


---------39:32----------
out


---------39:32----------
over the years and i just want to say so


---------39:35----------
p you and you've been working


---------39:37----------
really hard like on the front lines of


---------39:39----------
the code of conduct initiative so


---------39:40----------
piggy's been like


---------39:42----------
putting uh you put a lot of your own


---------39:45----------
time and energy in over a course of


---------39:47----------
years to try to make a difference in the


---------39:48----------
community and


---------39:50----------
that is a thankless job and there's very


---------39:52----------
i mean if you try to make cultural


---------39:53----------
change it's a really slow uh


---------39:56----------
and yeah it's like so it's a hard fight


---------39:58----------
to fight so


---------39:59----------
uh just wanted to make that known you


---------40:02----------
know the rage is super justified because


---------40:04----------
i mean i've seen


---------40:05----------
piggy struggle for a long time to make a


---------40:08----------
positive impact and like


---------40:09----------
help people feel safe at tournaments and


---------40:12----------
yeah to feel


---------40:13----------
that a lot of people don't give a [ __ ]


---------40:14----------
or you know are critical of the work


---------40:16----------
that


---------40:17----------
um that they've done like i don't know


---------40:19----------
that's kind of


---------40:20----------
i understand the rage like that seems


---------40:23----------
like completely


---------40:24----------
yeah that's what i would expect yeah and


---------40:26----------
i would say that what i've been saying


---------40:27----------
to you just now what i've been speaking


---------40:29----------
about is


---------40:29----------
only my personal experience i haven't


---------40:31----------
even scratched the surface of like code


---------40:32----------
of conduct systemic


---------40:33----------
answers to what exactly yeah i'm trying


---------40:35----------
to say there's layers to your rage yeah


---------40:38----------
you're only talking about one slice of


---------40:39----------
it


---------40:40----------
so you want to sorry you were you wanted


---------40:42----------
to say something is it risu or jisoo


---------40:45----------
so i i get that there's there's another


---------40:47----------
girl her name is friso in the community


---------40:49----------
and that happens all the time okay


---------40:52----------
um so you wanted to say something juicy


---------40:55----------
yeah so


---------40:56----------
i mean i think one of the main concerns


---------40:58----------
because like i think


---------40:59----------
like like i i totally empathize like


---------41:03----------
with dr piggy's like with your


---------41:04----------
perspective but i think just like


---------41:06----------
like since we're on such a large


---------41:08----------
platform right now like you know saying


---------41:09----------
things like


---------41:11----------
oh like if there's no proof we need to


---------41:13----------
believe women like obviously


---------41:14----------
this is this is actually something that


---------41:16----------
i addressed um because i had this other


---------41:19----------
big talk with a bunch of other community


---------41:20----------
members like right after this all


---------41:22----------
happened like in july


---------41:23----------
um because i think it's hard for people


---------41:26----------
to understand


---------41:27----------
where a victim is coming from


---------41:31----------
um and like you know like logically


---------41:35----------
speaking


---------41:35----------
yeah it sounds absurd to like not demand


---------41:39----------
proof


---------41:40----------
um but like you know let's let's just


---------41:42----------
take like anecdotal


---------41:43----------
evidence for instance right let's say


---------41:44----------
you're a girl you go to a tournament and


---------41:46----------
then some guy walks up and like


---------41:48----------
just like touches you you like very


---------41:50----------
inappropriately like he touches your


---------41:52----------
boob or something it's like and you're


---------41:54----------
not you're not gonna have like a


---------41:55----------
camera on you at all times like that's


---------41:56----------
just like that's insane


---------41:58----------
um and like you know there's a then you


---------42:00----------
get into all the the


---------42:03----------
what's the word the slippery slope


---------42:04----------
arguments like oh she was acting a


---------42:06----------
certain way oh she was dressed like this


---------42:08----------
so she was


---------42:08----------
you know she was asking for and it's


---------42:10----------
just like no no no one ever


---------42:12----------
is you know nine times out of ten


---------42:13----------
they're really not um


---------42:16----------
and i you know there are stories


---------42:19----------
that of people making stuff up obviously


---------42:23----------
um like we're not going to pretend like


---------42:24----------
there aren't self-interested


---------42:26----------
like by the way i think those people are


---------42:27----------
even like not not to put on like a moral


---------42:30----------
scale but like if you make [ __ ] up to


---------42:31----------
cancel someone like actually


---------42:33----------
just for like your 10 seconds of fame


---------42:34----------
you're a piece of [ __ ] so anyways


---------42:37----------
like if you you know there are people


---------42:39----------
who do that and that's totally


---------42:41----------
acknowledged


---------42:41----------
but this problem the problem is still


---------42:45----------
like the systemic issues with the world


---------42:47----------
at large because


---------42:49----------
in my case i had years of proof i had


---------42:51----------
years of chat logs i had photos i had


---------42:54----------
messages i had me i had tons of


---------42:55----------
anecdotal evidence a lot of people


---------42:57----------
volunteer coming up to me being being


---------42:58----------
like hey if you need a witness


---------43:01----------
i'm i'm here for you and like even when


---------43:04----------
i presented this to a lawyer


---------43:06----------
and like you know i'm not i'm not i'm


---------43:07----------
not going to tiptoe bar on this anymore


---------43:08----------
like i was just straight up like


---------43:09----------
statutory raped like i was groomed for


---------43:11----------
years


---------43:12----------
um like they just


---------43:16----------
they just didn't care and even with all


---------43:19----------
this proof


---------43:19----------
and keep in mind i'm already putting in


---------43:21----------
the time to go to this lawyer go to


---------43:23----------
multiple of them and it costs money to


---------43:25----------
do that


---------43:25----------
you know they cost like 50 an hour so


---------43:28----------
they they a lot of them the one that i


---------43:31----------
stuck with


---------43:32----------
um he he actually said he would prefer


---------43:35----------
to go about in a business direction


---------43:36----------
because


---------43:37----------
if you go about it the other way it gets


---------43:38----------
really messy and


---------43:40----------
i'm like i don't know how it could be


---------43:42----------
any i don't know how it could be any


---------43:44----------
more clean cut than what i have because


---------43:46----------
there's literally proof


---------43:47----------
you know from free years worth of proof


---------43:50----------
but they wanted to go about that way


---------43:51----------
and even when i had you know when i was


---------43:54----------
being threatened like oh i'm gonna


---------43:56----------
leak these nudes and like they like sent


---------43:58----------
it to me which by the way were taken


---------43:59----------
without my


---------44:00----------
permission like and so that that you


---------44:03----------
know those the first times i've seen i


---------44:04----------
was in shock


---------44:05----------
i uh i called the police i was freaking


---------44:08----------
out obviously


---------44:09----------
and like i showed them everything and


---------44:11----------
they said they can't do anything


---------44:13----------
it's like what the what do you mean you


---------44:15----------
can't do anything and like i think


---------44:16----------
there's cases even now where like


---------44:18----------
stalkers or girls


---------44:19----------
girl streamers or people online they


---------44:21----------
have stalkers and like there's literally


---------44:23----------
mounds of proof like everyone can tell


---------44:25----------
that this guy's a problem but like the


---------44:27----------
police won't do anything and it's


---------44:28----------
because


---------44:29----------
police the law is designed to be


---------44:32----------
reactive


---------44:32----------
not preventative and in cases of like


---------44:35----------
sexual assault it's like that's


---------44:37----------
that's not that's not logical um and so


---------44:39----------
i think like you know if


---------44:41----------
like i said if one one instance of a guy


---------44:44----------
being friendly to a girl whatever


---------44:46----------
okay multiple instances you know i'll


---------44:49----------
use a good example


---------44:50----------
anti like he has a track record of like


---------44:52----------
literally all the women in the community


---------44:53----------
hating him it's like okay maybe we


---------44:55----------
should actually like look into that


---------44:56----------
like maybe one or two of those women are


---------44:58----------
just making [ __ ] up but like i don't


---------44:59----------
think


---------45:00----------
i don't think all 200 of them would you


---------45:01----------
know and i'm sure i'm sure the number is


---------45:03----------
greater to be honest


---------45:05----------
yeah wow


---------45:09----------
that's that's crazy um and and i


---------45:12----------
appreciate you not tiptoeing around it


---------45:14----------
because i think


---------45:15----------
you know you mentioned earlier that


---------45:16----------
speaking out is hard


---------45:19----------
and it is really hard and so i i and you


---------45:22----------
know people are sort of talking about


---------45:24----------
how it's hard to face the details and


---------45:25----------
i'm just trying to


---------45:27----------
figure out you know sure we have


---------45:30----------
emotional reactions


---------45:32----------
that want us to stay silent


---------45:35----------
but my sense is that you know when we


---------45:37----------
let our emotions sort of dictate our


---------45:39----------
behavior without


---------45:40----------
true awareness of like what's going on


---------45:42----------
that's really when we get into trouble


---------45:44----------
it doesn't i mean i'm sure we're talking


---------45:46----------
about sexual and assault assault and


---------45:47----------
stuff right now but i think that's true


---------45:49----------
of


---------45:49----------
all kinds of things that and so i'm i'm


---------45:52----------
kind of curious


---------45:53----------
can you explain to me what the word and


---------45:55----------
if if you don't want to talk about this


---------45:57----------
that's totally fine


---------45:58----------
um but can you explain


---------46:02----------
yeah so let me just take a step back so


---------46:03----------
i think part of the problem with not


---------46:05----------
talking about details is


---------46:06----------
you guys use this term like


---------46:09----------
psychologically manipulative


---------46:11----------
right so you're like oh some people in


---------46:13----------
the scene are psychologically


---------46:14----------
manipulative


---------46:15----------
i'm imagining that there's a 16 year old


---------46:17----------
kid out there


---------46:19----------
who like is walking down the street and


---------46:21----------
then it's like oh that's psychological


---------46:23----------
manipulation like no one knows what this


---------46:24----------
looks like no one knows what it feels


---------46:27----------
like


---------46:28----------
right like if we listen to jesus it's


---------46:30----------
sort of like oh like i think about


---------46:32----------
myself as an


---------46:33----------
inherently interesting person and so


---------46:35----------
when people come up to me


---------46:37----------
i think part of the problem with


---------46:38----------
glossing over details is that


---------46:41----------
no one has known what this looks like


---------46:45----------
and the more explicit we make things


---------46:46----------
like tk saying hey they're like actually


---------46:48----------
red flags


---------46:49----------
which no one knew were red flags and why


---------46:52----------
is that i think it's


---------46:53----------
probably because some things are not


---------46:55----------
explicit


---------46:57----------
and so can you tell us if you feel


---------46:59----------
comfortable


---------47:01----------
what grooming looks like


---------47:05----------
yeah i mean like i said my story is like


---------47:08----------
all out on the table


---------47:10----------
um it's not it is always hard to talk


---------47:13----------
about it so


---------47:14----------
like again like if anybody if you're


---------47:16----------
ever facing the situation where


---------47:17----------
somebody's like you can see it happening


---------47:19----------
like i would


---------47:20----------
try to be as understanding towards them


---------47:22----------
as possible and that all being said like


---------47:26----------
you know in my case in a lot of these


---------47:29----------
cases frankly it's


---------47:30----------
pretty obvious um and it starts with


---------47:35----------
it starts with the power imbalances for


---------47:37----------
sure


---------47:38----------
uh like if you're to just isolate even


---------47:41----------
just like the ages


---------47:42----------
of a lot of things like with my dude


---------47:44----------
he's like 10 years older than me


---------47:46----------
um and like you know and puppet's case


---------47:49----------
does the same thing


---------47:50----------
and like in all in almost all these


---------47:52----------
cases it starts off with like an age


---------47:54----------
difference and


---------47:55----------
with an age difference there comes like


---------47:57----------
a like a mentality difference too


---------47:59----------
obviously like you know one person's an


---------48:00----------
adult or should be


---------48:02----------
and the other person is literally a


---------48:03----------
child and


---------48:05----------
you know in no case should you ever


---------48:07----------
expect


---------48:08----------
the child or the younger one to make the


---------48:10----------
right decisions


---------48:12----------
you know they're they're they're


---------48:13----------
impressionable they're young that's


---------48:14----------
that's literally by definition what a


---------48:16----------
child


---------48:16----------
is and you know people


---------48:20----------
with predatory mindsets they seek out


---------48:23----------
people who are easily manipulated


---------48:25----------
and that that tends to be children um


---------48:29----------
and like you know if you


---------48:33----------
start off with like just a really


---------48:34----------
obvious fact like that and then you get


---------48:36----------
a bunch of other factors going into like


---------48:37----------
let's say


---------48:38----------
let's say two people are the same age in


---------48:40----------
the smash community okay but then one


---------48:42----------
person has


---------48:44----------
like a hundred thousand followers and


---------48:46----------
then the other one


---------48:47----------
is like literally a newbie but the other


---------48:49----------
one's a girl


---------48:50----------
and like you know the person with 100


---------48:52----------
000 followers they


---------48:54----------
they're like oh i want to like i want to


---------48:57----------
have sex with her


---------48:58----------
and it's just like like they'll they'll


---------49:01----------
do everything they


---------49:02----------
can to this is how you can tell


---------49:05----------
someone's


---------49:05----------
manipulative they'll do everything they


---------49:08----------
can to write up to that certain line


---------49:10----------
where everything's okay but as soon as


---------49:13----------
they realize they can't get what they


---------49:15----------
want


---------49:15----------
they just they skirt okay now some


---------49:18----------
people


---------49:19----------
and these are usually the people who do


---------49:20----------
get caught right they'll if they're not


---------49:22----------
smart about it they'll skirt that line


---------49:25----------
they'll trip and then they'll do


---------49:26----------
something bad


---------49:27----------
and then they'll get caught and they'll


---------49:28----------
face the punishments logically right you


---------49:30----------
know that you would think that happened


---------49:31----------
unfortunately


---------49:32----------
a lot of times it actually doesn't


---------49:33----------
happen but the smart manipulators


---------49:35----------
they'll always ride that line


---------49:37----------
and again that's another reason why that


---------49:40----------
it's been so


---------49:41----------
hard for people to call these things out


---------49:43----------
even like me from my position where i


---------49:45----------
have like literally heard so many rumors


---------49:46----------
i think all of us have


---------49:48----------
it's because we they've like they these


---------49:51----------
big people


---------49:52----------
are smart enough to skirt that line


---------49:54----------
where anything that they're doing


---------49:56----------
they choose victims who they know are


---------49:58----------
never going to speak out or don't have


---------49:59----------
impact or like we won't believe them


---------50:02----------
right


---------50:02----------
and they'll always choose to do their


---------50:04----------
actions outside of the public eye


---------50:06----------
or in a way where it's very ambiguous


---------50:09----------
and


---------50:10----------
they could just feign ignorance and get


---------50:12----------
away with it


---------50:14----------
and i'll say in like the particular case


---------50:16----------
of like grooming


---------50:18----------
like you know like if you're if you're a


---------50:21----------
child


---------50:22----------
and like someone's taking advantage of


---------50:24----------
you um


---------50:25----------
it's really hard for the child to know


---------50:27----------
that especially


---------50:28----------
like in my case i was a runaway like i


---------50:30----------
literally was like


---------50:32----------
i had i almost had like no choice but to


---------50:34----------
interact with the people that i was with


---------50:36----------
um and it was hard for me to separate


---------50:40----------
somebody just caring for me versus like


---------50:43----------
them trying to take advantage of me


---------50:45----------
because i didn't i couldn't really tell


---------50:47----------
the difference like in a lot of ways


---------50:48----------
like oh they are doing this nice thing


---------50:50----------
for me but then


---------50:52----------
you know is it really nice if they're


---------50:54----------
trying they're doing it to get something


---------50:55----------
in return


---------50:57----------
um and i mean the obvious answer to that


---------50:59----------
is no i i hope


---------51:00----------
i hope you all know that so


---------51:03----------
yeah i'm sorry i i just wanted to i


---------51:06----------
wanted to ask you to be


---------51:07----------
and let me know if this is not okay but


---------51:09----------
i wanted you to i wanted to ask you to


---------51:11----------
be more specific because once again


---------51:12----------
you're talking about


---------51:14----------
you know you can't tell the difference


---------51:15----------
between caring yeah go ahead


---------51:17----------
okay screamed when i was 14 by an 18


---------51:20----------
year old guy and the way it started out


---------51:21----------
was a friend


---------51:22----------
introduced us and she was like hey you


---------51:24----------
both like video games so we


---------51:25----------
chat on aim about video games and at


---------51:27----------
some point he's like do you have a crush


---------51:29----------
on anybody


---------51:30----------
and so we would talk about crushes and a


---------51:31----------
girl he liked at school and then he


---------51:32----------
showed me a picture of the girl he liked


---------51:34----------
at school


---------51:34----------
and he's like uh do you think she's


---------51:37----------
pretty and i'm like yeah she's really


---------51:39----------
pretty


---------51:39----------
uh she's also got really big boobs and


---------51:41----------
he's like oh i wondered if he would say


---------51:42----------
something about that


---------51:43----------
so then suddenly it was okay for us to


---------51:45----------
talk about boob and then


---------51:47----------
eventually it got to the point where it


---------51:48----------
was okay for us to talk about do we have


---------51:50----------
do we masturbate


---------51:51----------
do we have sex do we uh and then it got


---------51:54----------
to the point where he's like well what


---------51:56----------
does your body look like


---------51:57----------
you know are you comfortable in yourself


---------51:59----------
and sometimes he would do it in very


---------52:00----------
slimy ways so he would say


---------52:02----------
oh god i just hate the way my chest


---------52:03----------
looks like can you tell me if this is


---------52:05----------
normal and he'd send me a picture of his


---------52:06----------
chest


---------52:07----------
and it'd be like oh yeah you're fine


---------52:09----------
like


---------52:10----------
and so now i'm used to seeing a guy's


---------52:12----------
chest when i'm 14 years old


---------52:13----------
in my am inbox right like these things


---------52:16----------
happen


---------52:17----------
the whole grooming itself is slow


---------52:20----------
eroding of boundaries


---------52:21----------
so if you just walked up to a kid and


---------52:23----------
you like lift your shirt up and said


---------52:24----------
does my chest look normal


---------52:26----------
they're gonna like have a fear response


---------52:27----------
right but grooming specifically


---------52:29----------
is the act of of taking that fear away


---------52:32----------
trying to make somebody safe


---------52:34----------
and until their boundaries are gone and


---------52:36----------
then you can then you can have sex with


---------52:37----------
them if you want right because they


---------52:38----------
don't they think oh i'm special


---------52:40----------
we have a special relationship we've


---------52:41----------
talked about this for a long time


---------52:43----------
this person doesn't want to hurt me and


---------52:44----------
then they just fall for it


---------52:46----------
um and that that's not the fault of any


---------52:48----------
child that's the fault of the adult that


---------52:50----------
that does those manipulative things so


---------52:52----------
if you're a kid 14 15 16 whatever and


---------52:54----------
somebody way more famous than you


---------52:56----------
starts taking an interest or just


---------52:59----------
remember your boundaries


---------53:00----------
you have to remember um what does this


---------53:02----------
person stand to gain from b


---------53:04----------
um and of course you never want to think


---------53:06----------
that about somebody you're talking to


---------53:07----------
you want to think that they're good and


---------53:08----------
they like you right um


---------53:12----------
but we also should be aware that not


---------53:16----------
everybody's good


---------53:20----------
thanks a lot for sharing that um but


---------53:22----------
yeah i think that's sort of exactly what


---------53:23----------
i was kind of looking for because i


---------53:25----------
think that clearly


---------53:26----------
demonstrates i like the way that you


---------53:28----------
sort of talk about


---------53:29----------
eroding the boundaries um


---------53:32----------
and sort of in a gradual way we sort of


---------53:34----------
heard that from g suit ii about


---------53:36----------
you know sort of like a gradual process


---------53:39----------
um


---------53:40----------
also like i mean i'm i'm hearing this


---------53:42----------
theme of power come up a lot like jesus


---------53:44----------
was saying that


---------53:45----------
you were saying that like you know you


---------53:46----------
sort of literally didn't have anyone


---------53:48----------
else


---------53:49----------
and so yeah


---------53:52----------
i mean i i'm forgive me for like


---------53:55----------
stepping around so much because


---------53:57----------
in my case like the story is literally


---------53:58----------
it's literally years long


---------54:00----------
so like you know in the like like dr dr


---------54:03----------
piggy described um it's like they get


---------54:06----------
you to trust them


---------54:08----------
and for me that took years because like


---------54:11----------
this person


---------54:13----------
they they only ever wanted they only


---------54:16----------
they only they painted it like they only


---------54:17----------
ever wanted to be friends but they were


---------54:19----------
so


---------54:20----------
friendly to the point where it was like


---------54:22----------
you know clearly something else is going


---------54:24----------
on and it's weird like we would talk


---------54:26----------
like every day


---------54:28----------
and it would just be about like


---------54:29----------
interesting normal stuff like at the


---------54:30----------
time like i was really into smash and


---------54:32----------
like i'd be like


---------54:33----------
hey can you help me with the game and


---------54:34----------
like that's kind of how it started off


---------54:36----------
and we would talk about like game


---------54:37----------
mechanics we were both really into art


---------54:40----------
i would like talk about art with them so


---------54:42----------
it's like we're just


---------54:43----------
friends um but like slowly over the


---------54:47----------
years


---------54:47----------
uh you know things would get weird we're


---------54:50----------
like you know they're like oh i have


---------54:51----------
feelings for you and i'm like


---------54:53----------
okay well i i don't know what to do


---------54:56----------
about that and at this point like i'm


---------54:58----------
already like


---------54:59----------
i i was already i already ran away um so


---------55:02----------
i was like stuck living with them in


---------55:03----------
like the sky house


---------55:04----------
um and that was basically


---------55:08----------
um so you ran away and you were living


---------55:11----------
with this person


---------55:12----------
yeah so like i started talking to them


---------55:15----------
when i was 15


---------55:16----------
and like at the time like i just i was


---------55:20----------
like


---------55:20----------
super miserable at home um and i just


---------55:23----------
like needed a way out basically


---------55:24----------
and they offered me a way out they're


---------55:26----------
like hey do you want to move in with me


---------55:28----------
and my friends at this like big house


---------55:30----------
and like just like pursue your dreams


---------55:32----------
because all i want to do is art


---------55:33----------
that's like that's that's how i got to


---------55:35----------
know them right i got to get to know


---------55:36----------
them through games and art and we're


---------55:37----------
like yeah we can work on this big


---------55:38----------
project together it'll be great


---------55:40----------
i'm like okay cool so i just like i


---------55:43----------
straight up like


---------55:44----------
dropped out of high school um and i was


---------55:46----------
like i just ran away


---------55:48----------
with them um and like my


---------55:51----------
uh like my


---------55:55----------
my family and stuff they they they


---------55:58----------
talked to my abuser and they were under


---------56:00----------
the guise that it was like some sort of


---------56:02----------
internship or something so that's that's


---------56:04----------
how my family stayed out of it but like


---------56:07----------
my family's so aloof


---------56:08----------
with me that like they like they really


---------56:11----------
don't give a [ __ ] about what i do


---------56:12----------
so um like that's how i got away with it


---------56:16----------
and so i'm living with this person and


---------56:18----------
like like i said it starts off


---------56:19----------
we start off very friendly uh but the


---------56:22----------
friendly interactions were so


---------56:23----------
consistent and like he had such like a


---------56:25----------
vested like like


---------56:27----------
interest in just paying attention to me


---------56:29----------
that that in itself is strange right


---------56:31----------
um but again he would never do anything


---------56:33----------
to cross the line


---------56:35----------
so kind of how it evolved is that


---------56:40----------
once he like came forward to me that he


---------56:42----------
had feelings um


---------56:44----------
and like i was younger and like i had


---------56:45----------
feelings for him too i was like very


---------56:46----------
impressionable and like this person's


---------56:48----------
paying a lot of attention to me


---------56:49----------
and they're like really good at this


---------56:51----------
game and the scene that like and they're


---------56:52----------
all


---------56:53----------
he's friends with like all these higher


---------56:55----------
up players and like they're all super


---------56:56----------
good and wow like


---------56:58----------
you know i thought it was really cool at


---------56:59----------
the time um


---------57:01----------
like that's that's kind of like how i


---------57:03----------
like felt like i got like really like


---------57:05----------
infatuated with it almost


---------57:07----------
and um like


---------57:11----------
i'm trying i'm trying to be specific but


---------57:13----------
also like i said there's just like so


---------57:15----------
be as vague as you want to don't worry


---------57:17----------
about it keep going i mean like


---------57:26----------
just let's just let's just like


---------57:29----------
basically when he when he started to get


---------57:31----------
like sexual with it i was like


---------57:33----------
at that point i was already reeled in


---------57:35----------
like i was already gonna say yes


---------57:37----------
so like he had done his part to make


---------57:40----------
sure i trusted him


---------57:41----------
and before any of this actually happened


---------57:43----------
to this is a really important thing


---------57:45----------
um he made sure that i was isolated from


---------57:49----------
everyone else


---------57:50----------
in my life like when we lived there he


---------57:53----------
immediately from the bat like when we


---------57:55----------
like once we moved in and got to know


---------57:56----------
everybody he told me behind my


---------57:58----------
behind everyone's back he's like hey i


---------57:59----------
don't like these people


---------58:01----------
don't get close to them like he just


---------58:03----------
straight up said that


---------58:04----------
and so you know me only knowing him i


---------58:07----------
was like i just


---------58:08----------
i just trusted him so i mean i always


---------58:10----------
thought that was suspicious but at the


---------58:12----------
same time i had like no one else there


---------58:14----------
because


---------58:15----------
you know it's a sky house and like the


---------58:17----------
other big guy who's in power there is


---------58:19----------
also


---------58:19----------
very sus and i also felt that


---------58:22----------
immediately after that very suspicious


---------58:26----------
um like i don't know if you've heard of


---------58:28----------
all the sky stuff


---------58:30----------
like sky williams he's taken


---------58:34----------
long totaling over like two hundred


---------58:36----------
thousand dollars i know


---------58:37----------
skye is skye has come on the stream


---------58:39----------
several times


---------58:40----------
so i know skye williams well but he's


---------58:43----------
from uh


---------58:45----------
you might want to do some digging you


---------58:46----------
don't have to dig far


---------58:48----------
anyways like he


---------58:51----------
he just like i just had these two


---------58:53----------
suspicious figures to go to but i'm


---------58:55----------
gonna trust the one that i've known way


---------58:56----------
longer obviously and i was really good


---------58:58----------
friends with


---------58:59----------
um and like he wanted to get sexual with


---------59:01----------
it so i just like did whatever he wanted


---------59:03----------
pretty much


---------59:04----------
and um like it


---------59:07----------
it was only after like and i didn't know


---------59:10----------
any better


---------59:10----------
like like i said i was a really


---------59:13----------
misguided youth


---------59:14----------
who like just really all i wanted to do


---------59:17----------
was draw so like as long as i got to do


---------59:19----------
that i


---------59:19----------
really didn't give a [ __ ] but as i got


---------59:22----------
older as an adult


---------59:23----------
and when things were starting to go


---------59:25----------
south between us


---------59:26----------
i like realized you know this person


---------59:29----------
doesn't care about me


---------59:30----------
they only did all these things to take


---------59:31----------
advantage advantage of me


---------59:33----------
um and when i thought that you know they


---------59:36----------
really cared and i think this is kind of


---------59:37----------
the feeling we're all getting from


---------59:39----------
hearing all these stories about these


---------59:40----------
people because they're almost like


---------59:41----------
family members to us at this point it's


---------59:43----------
like hearing like your family


---------59:44----------
do something really shitty and you just


---------59:45----------
can't believe it like this person


---------59:48----------
when we ran like this business together


---------59:50----------
that's another reason why i stayed with


---------59:52----------
him for so long like


---------59:53----------
when it came down to it he refused to


---------59:55----------
like


---------59:56----------
split anything evenly with me and that


---------59:58----------
even included like all my artwork the


---------60:00----------
money


---------60:01----------
like the the resources like the


---------60:03----------
inventory all of that he


---------60:04----------
insisted that it was because of him that


---------60:07----------
i was able to do everything


---------60:08----------
that we had done i was like that was the


---------60:11----------
last draw i was like okay this guy


---------60:13----------
is a piece of [ __ ] like i can't believe


---------60:15----------
i trusted him


---------60:17----------
that like you know he's finally showing


---------60:18----------
his true colors um


---------60:20----------
and like after years and years of being


---------60:22----------
like quote-unquote best friends you know


---------60:23----------
it's hard to erode that


---------60:25----------
like that that really was everything


---------60:27----------
that needed to be said


---------60:28----------
and even worse came came all the


---------60:32----------
troubles when i would try to like


---------60:35----------
basically get him to admit to what he


---------60:36----------
did you know like he


---------60:38----------
he made sure that i was manipulated into


---------60:41----------
not


---------60:42----------
telling anybody about anything until i


---------60:44----------
was legal so that he wouldn't


---------60:46----------
face any like actual legal repercussions


---------60:48----------
which again like i want to say he like


---------60:50----------
he knows the line like he knows that if


---------60:52----------
any of this got out if there's any proof


---------60:54----------
of him doing anything while in the minor


---------60:56----------
he's [ __ ] so he does everything he can


---------60:58----------
to get me to shut up and make sure that


---------61:00----------
he doesn't have anything


---------61:02----------
um on him you know just like how like


---------61:04----------
nairo is giving captain zach two


---------61:06----------
thousand dollars a month to have him not


---------61:08----------
saying anything you know because the


---------61:09----------
all these guys these guys that's what


---------61:10----------
i'm talking about manipulation and


---------61:12----------
grooming is like they know what they're


---------61:13----------
doing


---------61:14----------
they know the laws they know what the


---------61:16----------
consequences are


---------61:17----------
and they're going to do everything in


---------61:19----------
their power to make sure that they don't


---------61:20----------
face them


---------61:23----------
wow that's that's really helpful thank


---------61:26----------
you for sharing all that i


---------61:27----------
i'm kind of noticing


---------61:31----------
in a weird way i like i think it's


---------61:33----------
interesting what what i'm hearing here


---------61:34----------
so


---------61:35----------
you know there's isolation i'm i'm just


---------61:37----------
trying to


---------61:38----------
so let me just take a step back so part


---------61:40----------
of the reason that i was really


---------61:42----------
um in a sense excited although it's a


---------61:44----------
weird word to use in this context


---------61:46----------
to have this conversation with you folks


---------61:48----------
is because


---------61:50----------
i don't know how things change


---------61:53----------
and in my experience if you want


---------61:55----------
something to change you have to


---------61:57----------
understand it first you have to know


---------61:58----------
what it looks like


---------62:00----------
like if i want to diagnose covid in


---------62:02----------
someone i have to know what the symptoms


---------62:03----------
of kovit are


---------62:05----------
and the fact that that the metoo


---------62:07----------
movement is so widespread not just in


---------62:09----------
the gaming community it feels like the


---------62:10----------
gaming community was lagging behind like


---------62:12----------
the rest of the world in some ways


---------62:14----------
but the fact that it's so widespread in


---------62:16----------
systemic


---------62:17----------
makes me think that like this is still


---------62:19----------
going on


---------62:21----------
a bunch of people getting outed in like


---------62:23----------
one wave


---------62:24----------
like people will have calmed down but i


---------62:27----------
think like


---------62:28----------
within a few months or a year or two


---------62:31----------
like this is gonna


---------62:32----------
come up again because i don't think


---------62:34----------
there's been a purge


---------62:36----------
but there hasn't been like any kind of


---------62:39----------
systemic


---------62:40----------
change that's happened yet maybe that's


---------62:42----------
what piggy's been trying to do with the


---------62:43----------
code of conduct or something like that


---------62:45----------
and so my approach is to try to like


---------62:48----------
like what we do on stream is try to


---------62:49----------
educate people and help them understand


---------62:51----------
like what are they looking for or what


---------62:53----------
are they looking


---------62:53----------
at and and the reason that i was i


---------62:56----------
really appreciate what you guys shared


---------62:58----------
is because i'm noticing like now a


---------62:59----------
pattern right so if i'm like a 17 year


---------63:01----------
old kid


---------63:02----------
who is started streaming on twitch and


---------63:05----------
then a group of people like reach out to


---------63:06----------
me


---------63:07----------
and then like what are the things that i


---------63:09----------
like what are the check


---------63:10----------
boxes right that that this person that


---------63:14----------
tries to isolate you that they erode


---------63:16----------
your boundaries and like literally what


---------63:18----------
is that


---------63:19----------
what does that look like that looks that


---------63:20----------
looks like they never do anything wrong


---------63:25----------
if they did a little bit more it would


---------63:27----------
be wrong but they never really do


---------63:29----------
anything wrong yeah and that at least


---------63:33----------
huh at least at least they're really


---------63:35----------
smart ones


---------63:36----------
yeah i think my situation took so long


---------63:39----------
because


---------63:40----------
he literally played everything correctly


---------63:42----------
like like i said the law looked at the


---------63:44----------
situation


---------63:45----------
and anybody who knows what happened they


---------63:47----------
we all kind of looked at it we're like


---------63:48----------
wow


---------63:49----------
you really just got played and that's


---------63:51----------
kind of how you feel


---------63:52----------
after all this yeah so so that i think


---------63:55----------
brings up


---------63:56----------
another really good point which is that


---------63:58----------
from the


---------64:00----------
perspective of the person who's getting


---------64:02----------
groomed


---------64:03----------
i'm noticing that there's a lot of


---------64:05----------
really authentic


---------64:07----------
feeling of caring both ways this person


---------64:10----------
really cares about me


---------64:12----------
and i really care about them we're


---------64:14----------
important to each other right


---------64:15----------
and even in retrospect it may


---------64:18----------
feel false but in that moment i can


---------64:22----------
imagine that it feels like really really


---------64:24----------
caring i'm noticing there's also like a


---------64:27----------
certain amount of like unyieldingness


---------64:30----------
on the part of the person who's doing


---------64:33----------
the grooming


---------64:34----------
right it's like subtle and it's covered


---------64:36----------
in velvet but it's like


---------64:38----------
made of iron that there's some things


---------64:41----------
that they're very very like


---------64:43----------
harsh or strict about don't become


---------64:45----------
friends with anyone else in the house


---------64:48----------
yeah you know yeah um


---------64:51----------
and then i think the other thing that


---------64:53----------
you know just in terms of a red flag is


---------64:55----------
like


---------64:55----------
things that are done in secret


---------64:59----------
right and like like i'm just trying to


---------65:00----------
envision like if i were trying to


---------65:02----------
educate i have two daughters and if i


---------65:03----------
was trying to educate them


---------65:04----------
about like what to look out for you know


---------65:07----------
it's going to be someone who tries to


---------65:09----------
isolate you that you care about


---------65:11----------
that you feel like cares about you and


---------65:13----------
that they ask you to do things in secret


---------65:17----------
and it's your special secret it's not


---------65:19----------
just it other people wouldn't understand


---------65:22----------
exactly and and so if you find yourself


---------65:25----------
having those kinds of thoughts


---------65:27----------
like oh i know that this looks bad but


---------65:29----------
this is different


---------65:31----------
because they really care about


---------65:34----------
like there's a part where i think huh go


---------65:37----------
ahead


---------65:38----------
bobby i was just gonna say the other


---------65:39----------
thing is that a lot of these people were


---------65:41----------
pretty well respected and trusted in the


---------65:42----------
scene


---------65:43----------
so to an outside observer they looked


---------65:46----------
like trustworthy people


---------65:48----------
um and that that to me feels like it's


---------65:50----------
particular that makes it even harder


---------65:53----------
uh yeah right yeah i also want to point


---------65:56----------
out


---------65:56----------
um another sign to look out for


---------65:59----------
is an unreasonable amount of investment


---------66:02----------
in the person


---------66:03----------
where uh you have to ask yourself why


---------66:06----------
is all this investment going into me


---------66:08----------
don't you have other friends don't you


---------66:09----------
have other people that like they isolate


---------66:11----------
themselves


---------66:12----------
too and uh to the point where it just


---------66:15----------
doesn't make sense how


---------66:17----------
this brand new relationship and they i


---------66:19----------
guess they try to convince you that this


---------66:21----------
is different


---------66:22----------
from the outside world when really


---------66:25----------
if you're just like a a nice caring


---------66:27----------
person you should have that relationship


---------66:29----------
with several people


---------66:31----------
in my opinion in some abuse


---------66:34----------
relationship conversations you call it a


---------66:36----------
love bomb when they just


---------66:37----------
100 focus on you and the relationship


---------66:40----------
escalates super quick


---------66:42----------
um and you don't have time to think


---------66:43----------
about is this right


---------66:45----------
am i comfortable yeah


---------66:49----------
yeah that's really help


---------66:52----------
i i i just wanted to kind of offer a


---------66:55----------
perspective i've been thinking about a


---------66:56----------
lot uh you know it has


---------66:57----------
your dr k you you're just asking about


---------67:00----------
uh what you say to your daughters i mean


---------67:02----------
your


---------67:02----------
your duty your responsibility is to them


---------67:04----------
for us you know we feel i think all of


---------67:06----------
us feel


---------67:06----------
responsibility towards the community


---------67:08----------
more broadly one of the things that i


---------67:10----------
thought about a lot is just


---------67:11----------
the environment and in the past


---------67:15----------
like i remember we had a show at the


---------67:17----------
twitch office where people who were


---------67:19----------
under age were


---------67:20----------
oh maybe it wasn't at the twitch office


---------67:22----------
maybe it was somewhere else but


---------67:24----------
people were around booze and they were


---------67:26----------
not old enough and there


---------67:28----------
were people there who were old enough to


---------67:29----------
know that that was a problem but we


---------67:30----------
didn't say anything


---------67:32----------
um i feel that one of the things that


---------67:35----------
helped us change the culture for the


---------67:36----------
better in the past is when


---------67:38----------
people felt comfortable saying that they


---------67:41----------
felt uncomfortable with something


---------67:42----------
and one of the things that this is


---------67:44----------
highlighted for me is that


---------67:46----------
there could be yellow flags going on


---------67:48----------
that we don't that i don't it doesn't


---------67:50----------
i don't have the awareness to say yet


---------67:52----------
and then i'm developing that but the


---------67:54----------
awareness to say


---------67:55----------
hey who's in charge here because like


---------67:57----------
we're doing something messed up and like


---------67:59----------
i want to know that whoever's in charge


---------68:00----------
of this get-together is responsible for


---------68:03----------
making sure that people who are minors


---------68:06----------
uh are like not making bad decisions


---------68:10----------
i feel that one of the things that we


---------68:12----------
could do to help


---------68:13----------
is just get people better connected um


---------68:16----------
because


---------68:17----------
it feels hard to me to to feel like our


---------68:20----------
solution is to help educate minors you


---------68:22----------
know it's like


---------68:23----------
i want to be able to talk to people who


---------68:26----------
are like top players and be able to hear


---------68:28----------
from them or i want them to have people


---------68:29----------
they can talk to when they're saying


---------68:31----------
like hey i'm feeling weird i'm doing


---------68:32----------
some [ __ ] you know what i mean like


---------68:34----------
a lot of this stuff i have to imagine


---------68:36----------
happened without people really talking


---------68:38----------
about


---------68:39----------
what was going on at all you know


---------68:41----------
there's like so much secrecy and


---------68:42----------
i've been thinking about the environment


---------68:44----------
that allows that kind of secrecy


---------68:46----------
where things are just in sight but


---------68:48----------
nobody knows quite what's behind


---------68:50----------
that story right we're talking about


---------68:52----------
rumors that have been around


---------68:54----------
go ahead i'm just saying you bring up


---------68:57----------
the great


---------68:57----------
point that we want to find somebody


---------69:01----------
that our community is missing someone


---------69:02----------
who's responsible right who do you go to


---------69:05----------
at the party that's


---------69:05----------
that's like we don't allow an 18 year


---------69:07----------
old um is it the tournament organizer


---------69:10----------
they're probably pretty busy right now


---------69:11----------
trying to do pools and running things


---------69:13----------
right


---------69:14----------
yes um like who is responsible for


---------69:17----------
looking out for a minor who is


---------69:19----------
responsible for


---------69:20----------
checking ids or seeing who people go


---------69:22----------
home with


---------69:23----------
um and i think there's something


---------69:25----------
interesting about the history of smash


---------69:27----------
the fact that we've been grassroots


---------69:29----------
means that we haven't had the kind of


---------69:31----------
company funding


---------69:32----------
or um uh adults who could come in and do


---------69:35----------
that


---------69:36----------
that job right there hasn't been anybody


---------69:38----------
looking out for anybody's safety


---------69:40----------
um and and that's led to a lot of what


---------69:42----------
we've seen


---------69:43----------
uh a lot of people that's messed up in


---------69:45----------
the first place right that we have


---------69:46----------
environments that people can come in


---------69:48----------
where


---------69:49----------
there really isn't no one's thinking


---------69:50----------
about it like yeah that's you got a wild


---------69:52----------
wild west going on there's going to be


---------69:53----------
some problems


---------69:54----------
in the in the saloon i don't know if


---------69:56----------
that was the right word


---------70:01----------
yeah so i mean what are you guys


---------70:05----------
any other thoughts i mean we've been


---------70:07----------
talking for a little while we've focused


---------70:09----------
uh i've noticed hugs and tk have been up


---------70:11----------
yeah go ahead bobby


---------70:12----------
the the two things that shook me number


---------70:14----------
one i feel i was very naive


---------70:16----------
about power i think it that cloud thing


---------70:18----------
like i thought that was a meme and


---------70:19----------
people just talk about it whatever


---------70:21----------
um seriously i mean jesus do you


---------70:23----------
remember we had a long conversation


---------70:24----------
where i was like i don't


---------70:25----------
i feel like i have no clout you were


---------70:26----------
like are you kidding me i don't i


---------70:28----------
don't understand cloud i have a blind


---------70:30----------
spot towards it but


---------70:32----------
the ways that people who have it can


---------70:35----------
the the privileges that they have and


---------70:37----------
their ability to manipulate


---------70:39----------
that has really uh impacted me and i've


---------70:42----------
thought a lot about it


---------70:43----------
the second thing that's shaken me is


---------70:45----------
that


---------70:47----------
some people a lot of people in in this


---------70:50----------
kind of you know this


---------70:51----------
me too wave they have been predators


---------70:53----------
right like i feel empathy for people who


---------70:55----------
slip


---------70:56----------
up and make a mistake i definitely do


---------70:58----------
because


---------70:59----------
sometimes [ __ ] happens and we make bad


---------71:00----------
decisions we're not proud of but


---------71:02----------
being a predator is different than that


---------71:04----------
being a predator implies intentionality


---------71:07----------
it implies


---------71:10----------
a lot that's not a crime of passion sort


---------71:12----------
of thing and


---------71:13----------
uh at minimum i feel that if we can


---------71:16----------
ha if we can create an environment where


---------71:18----------
at minimum we can catch


---------71:20----------
predators people who are try right with


---------71:23----------
intention who are doing things


---------71:24----------
intentionally then that's


---------71:27----------
a lot better than where we are today


---------71:30----------
yeah i think like i mean in general that


---------71:33----------
actually that swings into that kind of


---------71:35----------
ties this together in a nice way because


---------71:37----------
like dr piggy you were saying like there


---------71:39----------
needs to be somebody that people can go


---------71:40----------
to


---------71:41----------
and just you know with the whole how


---------71:43----------
grassroots the scene is i'm not


---------71:45----------
i i'm like reading the chat i think a


---------71:46----------
lot of people are like kind of lost it's


---------71:48----------
like


---------71:48----------
you know the smash scene it's not


---------71:50----------
regulated by any big


---------71:52----------
organization like it's it's it's


---------71:55----------
literally


---------71:55----------
us up here on the screen right now it's


---------71:58----------
people like us it's the players the


---------71:59----------
commentators the like content creators


---------72:02----------
um it's like we we are the people


---------72:04----------
regulating it but we have


---------72:06----------
regular lives nintendo isn't doing


---------72:08----------
anything


---------72:09----------
and they probably won't i mean i look at


---------72:12----------
it


---------72:13----------
so um like that all being said like


---------72:16----------
you know it obviously can't be perfect


---------72:18----------
but i think it'd be interesting


---------72:20----------
it's one thing people do have to think


---------72:21----------
about is that before all this came to


---------72:23----------
light


---------72:24----------
people would go to people but it's the


---------72:26----------
people in power


---------72:27----------
were the ones with all the clout and


---------72:30----------
you know they're being all buddy buddy


---------72:32----------
with like other really nice people


---------72:34----------
and you know there's this whole kind of


---------72:35----------
just like oh they must be a good person


---------72:37----------
kind of accepted truth


---------72:38----------
and like so they'll go to them and


---------72:41----------
they'll go to people like d1 they'll go


---------72:42----------
to people like


---------72:44----------
i don't know like katar or like just


---------72:46----------
senpai and like they'll


---------72:47----------
they'll their beloved you know


---------72:49----------
front-facing community members and


---------72:51----------
that's kind of why


---------72:52----------
a lot of these people were also able to


---------72:54----------
get away with it because when you have


---------72:56----------
such power and you have so much like


---------72:58----------
there's such a like imbalance especially


---------73:00----------
within a grassroots community where the


---------73:02----------
people in charge are literally just the


---------73:03----------
most popular people


---------73:05----------
um it's like


---------73:08----------
you know there's the only real good way


---------73:10----------
to go about


---------73:11----------
fixing that i i think and like you can


---------73:14----------
dr pig or anyone else here you know


---------73:16----------
you guys have different perspectives on


---------73:17----------
this you can probably try to educate or


---------73:19----------
illuminate more on it but


---------73:20----------
i feel like spreading awareness in this


---------73:23----------
way


---------73:24----------
and kind of establishing it as like the


---------73:26----------
community tone


---------73:27----------
like hey none of us are gonna tolerate


---------73:29----------
this and


---------73:31----------
you know not not doesn't matter how like


---------73:33----------
how big of your


---------73:34----------
your following is like if all the big


---------73:36----------
players like you know like luffin was on


---------73:38----------
my side a lot


---------73:39----------
um like ludwig backed me up and like you


---------73:41----------
know mango all these people they spoke


---------73:43----------
out on it


---------73:44----------
do you know how much power that has and


---------73:46----------
that


---------73:47----------
that doesn't that that doesn't require


---------73:50----------
like nintendo that doesn't require like


---------73:53----------
like years worth of effort or just like


---------73:56----------
going through the trouble of like trying


---------73:57----------
to structurize some kind of


---------73:59----------
like convoluted like like legal system


---------74:01----------
within smash like that


---------74:03----------
alone has so much power and because


---------74:06----------
those people spoke up


---------74:08----------
everyone else who's following them sees


---------74:10----------
those things


---------74:11----------
and now they're aware of it so like i


---------74:14----------
think


---------74:15----------
i think like that plus having like


---------74:18----------
people


---------74:18----------
who they can go to like at events like i


---------74:21----------
would hope that you know people


---------74:22----------
if something was happening people can


---------74:24----------
trust me or like they could talk to us


---------74:26----------
like dr piggy or like maybe you guys


---------74:28----------
um i think that would that's a really


---------74:32----------
good starting point for like actual


---------74:34----------
change


---------74:36----------
and i've got to say um


---------74:40----------
so the code of conduct was created


---------74:41----------
through the community leadership


---------74:43----------
we consulted lawyers did lots of


---------74:45----------
research on it we have this


---------74:46----------
super thorough system to process cases


---------74:49----------
but it turns out that the need


---------74:50----------
is enormous that is with the amount of


---------74:53----------
reports we get


---------74:54----------
we cannot process in a fair manner um we


---------74:58----------
ever since the events of july we've got


---------74:59----------
about 250


---------75:01----------
and in our entire two years of existence


---------75:03----------
because we want to do every case right


---------75:04----------
because we want to hear both sides of


---------75:06----------
the story because we want to confirm


---------75:08----------
it takes about six weeks per case so do


---------75:10----------
the math there


---------75:11----------
that's like we've processed 20 out of


---------75:13----------
250 cases


---------75:14----------
um completely unpaid completely uh


---------75:19----------
no no protections legally um no


---------75:22----------
just out of the goodness of volunteering


---------75:25----------
and and caring about the community


---------75:26----------
um turns out it's not that sustainable


---------75:29----------
um and


---------75:31----------
firsthand i would say costs me an


---------75:33----------
enormous


---------75:34----------
emotional toll


---------75:37----------
and it should never fall to just me or


---------75:40----------
it should never fall to


---------75:42----------
even a group of five you know um so i


---------75:45----------
think what jesus is saying


---------75:46----------
is an important part of a cultural shift


---------75:48----------
i do think we need


---------75:49----------
structure i do think we need some place


---------75:51----------
where a victim can go and say


---------75:53----------
like this is what happened and we can


---------75:54----------
decide what's a fair ban but i don't


---------75:56----------
know how we can do that right now when


---------75:58----------
there's


---------75:58----------
not there's just not enough there's not


---------76:00----------
enough money there's not enough


---------76:03----------
people that care i


---------76:06----------
i'm laughing because you're kind of


---------76:08----------
saying there's not enough


---------76:10----------
right and i sort of get that but


---------76:15----------
not enough has two sides of the equation


---------76:17----------
it has


---------76:18----------
number of predators on one side and


---------76:21----------
number of like let's say code of conduct


---------76:23----------
people on the other


---------76:25----------
and and so the the funny thing there is


---------76:27----------
that i think that the way that


---------76:28----------
you even those odds is by reducing the


---------76:30----------
number of predators


---------76:32----------
and so that that i think gets yeah even


---------76:35----------
20


---------76:35----------
cases run it's better than zero yeah but


---------76:39----------
you know i i still


---------76:41----------
i'm with you i'm not i'm just saying


---------76:42----------
that like i think that if you think


---------76:44----------
about you know you're saying that


---------76:45----------
the number of cases we're getting is too


---------76:47----------
high and that's because


---------76:49----------
there are too many offenders out there


---------76:51----------
right so


---------76:52----------
one solution is to increase your


---------76:53----------
resources which by all means if it's


---------76:55----------
possible awesome


---------76:56----------
but the other thing and this is where


---------76:58----------
sometimes i i kind of wonder because


---------77:00----------
like


---------77:00----------
you know i remember hearing uggs and


---------77:02----------
kind of tk talk at the beginning about


---------77:05----------
how like it's strange because like you


---------77:07----------
knew this person


---------77:09----------
right and like you were close to them


---------77:11----------
and then you have trouble reconciling


---------77:14----------
the person that they sort of turned out


---------77:15----------
to be


---------77:17----------
and this could just be my you know


---------77:19----------
professional experience i've worked in


---------77:21----------
like prisons and stuff


---------77:22----------
and and one of the things that i i've


---------77:25----------
come to appreciate is that like


---------77:27----------
it's not that a person is good or bad


---------77:29----------
which i know sounds bizarre i mean some


---------77:30----------
people really


---------77:31----------
can be predominantly bad i've certainly


---------77:34----------
worked with those people


---------77:35----------
but but i think that even even like like


---------77:38----------
i'm just trying to figure out like if


---------77:39----------
i'm a predator


---------77:41----------
what do i do right so i i think if we if


---------77:46----------
we talk to


---------77:47----------
you know like what do you do like let's


---------77:49----------
say that you're 25 years old


---------77:52----------
you're part of the smash community and


---------77:53----------
in the rest of the world like this is


---------77:55----------
what we see with the community that we


---------77:56----------
work with right so like why do we play


---------77:58----------
games it's because


---------77:59----------
we like who we are in the game i'm a


---------78:01----------
someone


---------78:03----------
and then outside of the smash community


---------78:05----------
like you guys are talking about all this


---------78:06----------
power dynamic and clout


---------78:07----------
and stuff like that outside of the smash


---------78:09----------
community who have a new one


---------78:12----------
and i may have a certain amount of


---------78:13----------
social anxiety because lo and behold


---------78:15----------
like


---------78:16----------
you know since the age of nine instead


---------78:18----------
of developing social skills


---------78:20----------
i developed smash skills and then


---------78:23----------
along comes a 16 year old boy or girl


---------78:27----------
who suddenly like they look up at me and


---------78:30----------
my social anxiety is less because


---------78:33----------
they clearly are into me and i know it's


---------78:36----------
not right


---------78:37----------
to you know start a sexual relationship


---------78:39----------
i wouldn't even know how to


---------78:41----------
but i express interest in them and they


---------78:43----------
express interest in me and boy do they


---------78:45----------
really like me


---------78:46----------
and then i really like them they're


---------78:47----------
really awesome i invest a lot of my time


---------78:51----------
and i really do care about that i try to


---------78:52----------
help them right


---------78:54----------
because they have nowhere else to go so


---------78:57----------
i want to be a nice guy


---------79:00----------
and so i invite them to come stay with


---------79:02----------
me and then something strange happens


---------79:04----------
i've cared about them for so long i've


---------79:06----------
supported about them so long and then i


---------79:08----------
start to develop feelings


---------79:10----------
then what do i do with that


---------79:13----------
right so i think that like this this


---------79:15----------
kind of slippery slope


---------79:16----------
i mean you guys are you're making it


---------79:18----------
sound very intentional and i'm sure in


---------79:19----------
some cases it is


---------79:21----------
but the other thing that i don't know i


---------79:22----------
don't know like what someone in that


---------79:24----------
situation


---------79:25----------
does like how do they learn how to stop


---------79:30----------
a lot of therapy with somebody that


---------79:32----------
actually holds you accountable and


---------79:33----------
doesn't just tell you nice things about


---------79:35----------
yourself


---------79:37----------
i don't know that's my recommendation


---------79:39----------
sure i wouldn't say


---------79:41----------
i was gonna say like that's fine and all


---------79:45----------
until like you know i kind of stand by


---------79:47----------
the idea that people reveal who they are


---------79:49----------
when it really matters


---------79:50----------
and like in the case of like zero for


---------79:53----------
instance


---------79:54----------
the guy took like three different twit


---------79:56----------
longers and like literally


---------79:58----------
tried to manipulate other victims behind


---------80:00----------
their backs because he knew what else


---------80:02----------
was coming like he tried to get them to


---------80:04----------
shut up


---------80:04----------
and like you're you know if you're


---------80:06----------
really sorry


---------80:07----------
i'm sorry i don't care how many


---------80:09----------
characters you type up or what kind of


---------80:10----------
deflections you make with your arguments


---------80:12----------
like if you're really sorry you own up


---------80:14----------
to what happened you say


---------80:15----------
what happened you own up to it and you


---------80:17----------
say you're sorry


---------80:19----------
and in every single case


---------80:22----------
where you know somebody came out with


---------80:24----------
something


---------80:26----------
they deflected like you know d1 he


---------80:29----------
straight up said i don't remember


---------80:31----------
yeah anti was just like yeah oh


---------80:34----------
no these women are out to get me it's


---------80:37----------
like it's


---------80:38----------
why are these women out to get you you


---------80:40----------
know or like or he'll straight up say


---------80:41----------
like oh yeah i did this thing and i'm


---------80:43----------
not sorry for it it's like what


---------80:45----------
and like i think i think that's the


---------80:47----------
difference like there are


---------80:48----------
like like bobby said you can slip up you


---------80:51----------
can do something and make someone feel


---------80:53----------
uncomfortable and that's


---------80:54----------
that is just a part of like growing up


---------80:56----------
and like developing social skills or


---------80:57----------
like just getting to know someone but


---------81:00----------
it what matters is when you're


---------81:01----------
confronted with that truth


---------81:03----------
and how you handle it yeah


---------81:06----------
at the end of the day i think with a lot


---------81:08----------
of people they did not handle oh good go


---------81:10----------
forward


---------81:11----------
tk you haven't said okay i think i think


---------81:14----------
a lot of people


---------81:15----------
did not handle it in a way that


---------81:19----------
like there was no un discernible way


---------81:21----------
where you would think that they're


---------81:22----------
trying to change


---------81:23----------
other than i'm trying to save my career


---------81:25----------
like i think that


---------81:26----------
90 of the people who did come out and


---------81:29----------
put their apology statement


---------81:31----------
wasn't really apology or an explanation


---------81:33----------
or anything like that or like a


---------81:35----------
yes like i've done these things when i


---------81:36----------
was um


---------81:38----------
you know younger or whatever mostly


---------81:40----------
people probably couldn't do that anyway


---------81:41----------
because a lot of this stuff was recent


---------81:42----------
but like for those who may


---------81:44----------
have like stuff that like came out from


---------81:47----------
five years ago or whatever


---------81:48----------
and they have since then like have


---------81:50----------
learned their ways and they are like


---------81:53----------
i've changed the person that you can


---------81:54----------
physically physically you know visibly


---------81:56----------
see that change


---------81:57----------
like that should have been the way that


---------81:59----------
uh at least someone


---------82:00----------
some of them should have addressed it


---------82:02----------
but instead it just seemed like almost


---------82:04----------
everybody who


---------82:05----------
wanted to uh like counter-argue


---------82:09----------
their allegation only did it


---------82:12----------
for the fact of like either trying to


---------82:13----------
disprove the other person or


---------82:15----------
to like save their career as jesus said


---------82:18----------
i mean it really took zero like four


---------82:20----------
times before he told the truth


---------82:22----------
um you know what i'm saying and then


---------82:25----------
slippery [ __ ] when you think


---------82:26----------
about


---------82:27----------
yeah yeah and when you think about uh


---------82:30----------
nairo


---------82:30----------
uh that that situation with him it was


---------82:33----------
swept it was


---------82:34----------
he kept he i mean he paid hush money to


---------82:36----------
keep his career


---------82:37----------
you know what i mean and i think


---------82:40----------
if you're going to address it like that


---------82:41----------
then you're obviously not going to


---------82:44----------
learn from your mistakes i think if


---------82:45----------
you're not like really


---------82:47----------
uh trying to change for the better to be


---------82:50----------
like a better person


---------82:51----------
regardless of your career then you know


---------82:54----------
you're not


---------82:55----------
you're not really learning you're just


---------82:56----------
learning how to hide your i guess


---------82:58----------
predatory instincts better


---------82:59----------
and that's that's not good i mean


---------83:03----------
we a lot of people been making this joke


---------83:05----------
recently about like how


---------83:07----------
um the smash community like you know two


---------83:09----------
months ago


---------83:10----------
everyone was like oh believe women you


---------83:12----------
know oh we need to


---------83:13----------
kick out predators but now like no one's


---------83:15----------
saying that anymore because like it's


---------83:17----------
not the hot topic or whatever because


---------83:19----------
like people didn't actually care they


---------83:22----------
just wanted to appear like they cared


---------83:25----------
uh to look like they were the good guys


---------83:27----------
without actually


---------83:29----------
putting in any like good input um or


---------83:32----------
actually changing their own ways to help


---------83:34----------
out in the future um


---------83:36----------
i won't say that like i vehemently talk


---------83:39----------
about this every day


---------83:40----------
obviously but i still have my own


---------83:42----------
commands to talk about you know things


---------83:43----------
you can


---------83:44----------
you can educate yourself on uh on sexual


---------83:47----------
assault rape and all that good stuff and


---------83:49----------
how you can help out and things like


---------83:50----------
that and on top of that i've just


---------83:52----------
in the last five six years i've been


---------83:55----------
more like on more diligent about like


---------83:58----------
how i


---------83:59----------
i present myself to uh


---------84:02----------
well one women or just to anybody who


---------84:04----------
would like would feel


---------84:06----------
i guess some level of pressure for me


---------84:09----------
because i don't want that like i don't


---------84:10----------
want to


---------84:12----------
i don't want anyone to feel unsafe


---------84:13----------
around me um for like any reason


---------84:17----------
and i think that if more people were to


---------84:20----------
take


---------84:20----------
that like mindset we would at least be


---------84:22----------
able to start the


---------84:24----------
i guess the healing process of the smash


---------84:26----------
community so tkd someone says


---------84:29----------
yeah go ahead piggy if someone says you


---------84:32----------
hurt them


---------84:32----------
you stop and you listen and you say


---------84:36----------
even if i didn't intend to did i is it


---------84:39----------
possible


---------84:41----------
yeah and that's how you grow i think a


---------84:43----------
lot of people when they're hearing these


---------84:45----------
kinds of conversations they


---------84:47----------
they have a way of trying to convince


---------84:48----------
the other person how


---------84:50----------
well that's not what i intended to do so


---------84:52----------
you shouldn't feel hurt by it


---------84:54----------
rather than understanding it from their


---------84:56----------
perspective like to truly put themselves


---------84:59----------
into their shoes


---------85:01----------
to see how they feel about your actions


---------85:04----------
and that's the only thing that should


---------85:05----------
matter it shouldn't matter what your


---------85:06----------
intention was it's more about how you


---------85:08----------
made them feel with your actions that


---------85:09----------
could have been predatory it could have


---------85:11----------
been


---------85:12----------
you know made them feel uncomfortable


---------85:14----------
and even if you never intended to be


---------85:16----------
that kind of person as long as they feel


---------85:18----------
that way that's what you did that's the


---------85:19----------
truth of the matter


---------85:20----------
so um when there are people that are


---------85:23----------
trying to grow and trying to understand


---------85:25----------
how they could be less problematic


---------85:26----------
that's


---------85:27----------
one of the best things you can do is to


---------85:29----------
stop with the mentality of convincing


---------85:31----------
people that your intentions weren't what


---------85:32----------
they think they were


---------85:34----------
and instead focus on you know how they


---------85:36----------
actually felt about the situation


---------85:38----------
and what you could have done differently


---------85:40----------
to stop them from feeling that way it


---------85:42----------
doesn't matter what the hell your


---------85:43----------
intention was


---------85:44----------
if they felt that way impact instead of


---------85:47----------
intent


---------85:48----------
yeah tk you mentioned that you had


---------85:52----------
you had sort of changed a little bit


---------85:54----------
about the way that you think about your


---------85:56----------
interactions can you share that with us


---------85:59----------
yeah i mean just when i was younger i


---------86:01----------
was like


---------86:02----------
i was grow crazy you know you're like


---------86:04----------
i'm not gonna a lot i was definitely


---------86:06----------
like very much into like i would go to


---------86:08----------
tournaments and i was there for the game


---------86:09----------
obviously but like i was


---------86:11----------
like also very much interested in the


---------86:15----------
like the females or the women that were


---------86:16----------
there at the tournament and like


---------86:18----------
i wasn't it wasn't like i was like


---------86:20----------
overstepping any boundaries but i was


---------86:21----------
you know


---------86:22----------
like i would be more like


---------86:26----------
um i don't know flirtatious than i need


---------86:28----------
to be that than


---------86:29----------
than what uh i should have been too


---------86:32----------
early i guess before anything was


---------86:33----------
established


---------86:34----------
things like that and as i started to


---------86:36----------
grow up you know you just kind of


---------86:37----------
realize that like


---------86:38----------
what one like isn't that big of a deal


---------86:39----------
and two like


---------86:41----------
yeah this this favorite could be seen as


---------86:44----------
like


---------86:44----------
creepy so like as i started to grow up i


---------86:48----------
just became less


---------86:49----------
you know for like a better term thirsty


---------86:50----------
like just you know


---------86:52----------
like you kind of just you just kind of


---------86:54----------
just go about uh well once


---------86:56----------
that and also i just started like


---------86:57----------
working on my career a lot more so like


---------86:59----------
there's


---------87:00----------
like i put more time into like becoming


---------87:03----------
like a better commentator all that good


---------87:04----------
stuff so like most of my time was filled


---------87:06----------
up with


---------87:07----------
that stuff but then like to be


---------87:10----------
on this side now to be the person that


---------87:13----------
people trust


---------87:14----------
um when like things happen it's a lot


---------87:17----------
more fulfilling


---------87:19----------
for me than to like i don't know


---------87:21----------
potentially hook up with someone


---------87:23----------
uh like


---------87:26----------
i i usually there's been situations


---------87:29----------
where like


---------87:29----------
my uh like my women friends would


---------87:33----------
like come to me because someone was


---------87:34----------
chasing them around the the bar someone


---------87:36----------
was


---------87:36----------
speaking to them like in a weird manner


---------87:39----------
and like they wanted to feel safe so


---------87:40----------
they would come to me


---------87:41----------
i like that a lot more than being


---------87:44----------
the person who is making them feel


---------87:45----------
unsafe and half having to find


---------87:48----------
uh a person that they can trust like


---------87:50----------
that um


---------87:52----------
so yeah i just i don't know i grew up


---------87:55----------
like


---------87:56----------
like i think that's the easiest turn


---------87:57----------
just like i just i grew up you know and


---------87:59----------
uh


---------87:59----------
unfortunately i feel like a lot of my


---------88:00----------
peers did not as they were still


---------88:02----------
you know facing skirts you know in in in


---------88:06----------
a very malicious


---------88:07----------
and i guess predatory way and


---------88:10----------
i guess in in some ways i felt like


---------88:14----------
i may have seen it but mostly more so


---------88:16----------
like


---------88:17----------
distance myself because like that's not


---------88:18----------
what i wanted to do anymore when it


---------88:20----------
i i should have trying to be a little


---------88:23----------
more like


---------88:25----------
uh i guess let's say educational about


---------88:28----------
it you know like i should have been like


---------88:29----------
hey bro like you know we're getting old


---------88:30----------
now this is not like this ain't the way


---------88:32----------
you know what i'm saying but


---------88:33----------
like i don't know like in some ways i


---------88:36----------
feel like


---------88:37----------
it's not my responsibility obviously but


---------88:39----------
it also because they are my friends it


---------88:41----------
is kind of my responsibility like i


---------88:42----------
should have said something


---------88:43----------
but you're your own human and i'm not


---------88:45----------
sure if you're gonna listen to me anyway


---------88:47----------
so i'm just gonna continue to do me


---------88:50----------
and like become a better person myself


---------88:53----------
sorry like i think i think so i've had a


---------88:56----------
lot of people when this came out they


---------88:57----------
were like messaging me personally


---------88:59----------
saying like not because they did


---------89:01----------
anything to me but they just felt so


---------89:03----------
bad like you know like the whole


---------89:05----------
self-reflection like they


---------89:07----------
were associated with a lot of these


---------89:09----------
people and like they might have seen


---------89:10----------
some signs or suspicious signs but like


---------89:13----------
they didn't do anything to stop it


---------89:14----------
and like i have to say like i don't


---------89:17----------
think anyone should ever feel like


---------89:19----------
they did something wrong like they


---------89:22----------
shouldn't feel like it was totally their


---------89:23----------
sole responsibilities


---------89:25----------
to stop something in every situation


---------89:26----------
because the truth of it is


---------89:28----------
is that the person doing the thing


---------89:29----------
should just not be doing in the first


---------89:31----------
place


---------89:32----------
right like that that accountability


---------89:35----------
should be held with them


---------89:36----------
not with you but obviously like you know


---------89:38----------
that's the world


---------89:39----------
the world would be great if like things


---------89:41----------
actually worked out the way that they


---------89:43----------
should


---------89:43----------
but you know that's not how things are


---------89:45----------
so like


---------89:47----------
obviously i just think like if people if


---------89:49----------
there's one thing to take away is like


---------89:50----------
if you just do your best and


---------89:52----------
educate yourself or try to educate


---------89:54----------
yourself really and make that effort


---------89:56----------
um like that that alone i think


---------90:00----------
actually stops a lot of people from like


---------90:02----------
doing things


---------90:03----------
like the fact that like for instance


---------90:05----------
like you know tk you're up here and


---------90:07----------
you're like talking about this like you


---------90:08----------
know


---------90:09----------
anyone who's around you or any guy and


---------90:11----------
like with the with the


---------90:12----------
standing that you do have if they were


---------90:13----------
gonna do something if you're there


---------90:15----------
they're not gonna do it anymore


---------90:16----------
you know and like i feel like that like


---------90:19----------
just just


---------90:20----------
then like that you know like i said like


---------90:22----------
you're not being perfect but you're just


---------90:23----------
doing everything you can but like doing


---------90:25----------
something is so much better than not


---------90:26----------
doing anything


---------90:27----------
and like that goes first that goes for


---------90:29----------
like everybody in the scene right now


---------90:31----------
that is


---------90:31----------
or has done something to speak up about


---------90:33----------
it you know


---------90:36----------
yeah so i i've discovered something kind


---------90:38----------
of interesting since i've


---------90:40----------
been engaging with the internet i've


---------90:42----------
noticed that you know if people are


---------90:43----------
trying to figure out


---------90:44----------
is my behavior a problem there's an


---------90:47----------
interesting diagnostic test which is


---------90:49----------
do you refer to women as females if the


---------90:51----------
answer is yes


---------90:53----------
there's a decent chance i think it's


---------90:55----------
more likely that maybe some of your


---------90:57----------
behavior needs to be adjusted


---------90:59----------
it's a good litmus test that's a yellow


---------91:01----------
flag for me


---------91:02----------
right it's funny i don't know if you


---------91:04----------
guys caught but tk actually


---------91:06----------
re reframed in the middle of the


---------91:09----------
sentence


---------91:10----------
did you guys see that barely it's a


---------91:14----------
it's a


---------91:18----------
i grew up in the south in like a


---------91:20----------
predominantly black area in the south


---------91:22----------
and like that's just how that's how they


---------91:25----------
like


---------91:25----------
say no no i i i'm not trying to blame i


---------91:28----------
get what you're i get what you're saying


---------91:29----------
though like i definitely catch myself


---------91:30----------
because i know that like


---------91:31----------
in the real world like that's not a good


---------91:33----------
way to refer to women


---------91:35----------
but like it definitely is something that


---------91:37----------
like


---------91:38----------
uh i've still had to learn not to say


---------91:41----------
because like i don't mean it with


---------91:42----------
malicious intent but i know that like it


---------91:44----------
to other people that like saying like


---------91:46----------
usually


---------91:48----------
when it's said it is in a way where it's


---------91:50----------
like man females be


---------91:51----------
you know like females would be shopping


---------91:52----------
or whatever like people say it in ways


---------91:54----------
that like it's negative but i'm just


---------91:55----------
saying it because like


---------91:56----------
it's i don't know like the word just


---------91:59----------
hits easier for me however i definitely


---------92:02----------
will catch myself


---------92:03----------
in in normal conversation where if i'm


---------92:05----------
about to say i'm like oh no no i don't


---------92:06----------
want


---------92:07----------
i don't want to be perceived in a way so


---------92:08----------
say women say girls say anything


---------92:10----------
but that so yeah i also think to that


---------92:13----------
point


---------92:14----------
um because tk was mentioning this


---------92:16----------
earlier uh when you're


---------92:18----------
so we we have a lot of influence with


---------92:21----------
our guy friends like men have influence


---------92:23----------
over other men if they're like friends


---------92:24----------
and things like that and a lot of these


---------92:26----------
things that go on i think are part of a


---------92:29----------
culture that allows them to exist


---------92:31----------
so uh one of those ways to address that


---------92:34----------
part of the culture is that you check


---------92:35----------
your boys when they're using words like


---------92:37----------
females or [ __ ] even


---------92:39----------
and you stop them then and there because


---------92:41----------
even though


---------92:42----------
they feel comfortable around it around


---------92:45----------
by saying it around their friends


---------92:47----------
because you know it's not a big deal


---------92:49----------
who's going to get offended


---------92:51----------
it's uh the thing is it just creates


---------92:53----------
this culture of


---------92:54----------
objectifying women to the point where


---------92:56----------
it's going to manifest itself into some


---------92:57----------
actual action


---------92:59----------
that shows that disrespect so even if


---------93:01----------
they're not feeling disrespected because


---------93:03----------
you're not saying it in front of them


---------93:04----------
the fact that you're doing it regularly


---------93:06----------
and you are you know among


---------93:08----------
a group that's just constantly


---------93:10----------
encouraging it


---------93:11----------
eventually that lack of respect is going


---------93:15----------
to come out in a different kind of way


---------93:16----------
so even just


---------93:18----------
checking your friends on these little


---------93:19----------
things that go on constantly


---------93:22----------
it's gonna hopefully make them


---------93:26----------
value women as just another human that


---------93:29----------
they value


---------93:31----------
on the regular right um so yeah i mean


---------93:34----------
the the


---------93:35----------
i think that the female thing is uh is


---------93:37----------
an indicator i think


---------93:38----------
saying [ __ ] all the time instead of


---------93:40----------
women is a huge [ __ ]


---------93:42----------
indicator sorry but hugs on the stream


---------93:45----------
hugs i


---------93:45----------
i i've got a question for you so


---------93:47----------
sometimes when i try to tell my friends


---------93:49----------
not to call


---------93:50----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] and i say you should


---------93:52----------
call them women they call me a simp cuck


---------93:58----------
well when i when i've dealt with that


---------94:00----------
sort of thing like there's always


---------94:02----------
always push back whenever i bring it up


---------94:04----------
and i i just tell them


---------94:06----------
like they're they're like you know i


---------94:07----------
don't mean a man like why are you making


---------94:08----------
a big deal about it i'll always tell


---------94:10----------
them


---------94:10----------
like it's not there there's a way to


---------94:13----------
explain


---------94:14----------
like first you tell them that first of


---------94:16----------
all like are you going to stay in front


---------94:17----------
of them so why are you sitting in front


---------94:19----------
of me


---------94:20----------
and then uh then that's that's when they


---------94:22----------
say what are you a simp cuck


---------94:24----------
yeah yeah well then i would say no it's


---------94:26----------
just that they're they're


---------94:28----------
humans just like us and if you wouldn't


---------94:30----------
say it in front of them like would you


---------94:31----------
want someone saying that about your


---------94:32----------
mother your sister like you


---------94:34----------
you find ways to relate it to them and


---------94:35----------
then you also say honestly i


---------94:38----------
i put it into different perspectives


---------94:40----------
where i say okay let's say like


---------94:42----------
with racism right if you're dropping the


---------94:44----------
n bomb


---------94:45----------
and and then and then you just hide it


---------94:48----------
from everyone else do you think that's


---------94:50----------
cool and then if i'm dealing with


---------94:51----------
someone who's


---------94:52----------
not racist they'll be like no that's not


---------94:54----------
okay at all


---------94:55----------
i'm like right and then usually you have


---------94:57----------
people that are


---------94:58----------
saying it publicly it's because they do


---------95:00----------
it all the time privately and then


---------95:02----------
they're actually losing respect for this


---------95:04----------
group of people because they're


---------95:05----------
constantly


---------95:06----------
engaging behavior that just devalues


---------95:08----------
them right


---------95:09----------
so then why the hell are you okay with


---------95:11----------
doing this with women


---------95:12----------
and they could call me as like at that


---------95:14----------
point their argument of of me just being


---------95:16----------
a simp and just doing it for this


---------95:18----------
purpose kind of breaks down because


---------95:20----------
you you explain to them how this applies


---------95:21----------
to so many other things


---------95:23----------
and how if they actually want to value


---------95:24----------
people as people then they got to just


---------95:26----------
stop this


---------95:27----------
behavior in general like even in private


---------95:29----------
even with your boys etc


---------95:32----------
and i have some experience yeah i have


---------95:34----------
some experience with this so back in the


---------95:35----------
day we used to


---------95:36----------
use uh homophobic language to describe


---------95:40----------
any play style that was like


---------95:42----------
annoying and we used to use the word


---------95:44----------
rape


---------95:45----------
uh to talk about like domination if you


---------95:47----------
would really destroy somebody


---------95:49----------
and that was really widespread you know


---------95:51----------
i don't know 10 years ago


---------95:53----------
and it took time to switch that and you


---------95:55----------
know my wife helped me understand why


---------95:57----------
those


---------95:57----------
things were not good so i literally


---------95:59----------
didn't know i was ignorant to it


---------96:01----------
but once i knew i had this very


---------96:03----------
experience of saying like hey don't say


---------96:04----------
rape like that and people would be like


---------96:06----------
you know they would talk [ __ ] about me


---------96:09----------
what i ended up doing was saying like


---------96:11----------
yeah i am a simp cuck so


---------96:13----------
just shut the [ __ ] up about it like


---------96:14----------
don't say that around me kind of thing i


---------96:16----------
would just say like yes that's me yes


---------96:17----------
i'm a


---------96:18----------
[ __ ] cuck um


---------96:22----------
yeah i mean yes if that's what you want


---------96:23----------
to call me then yes that's exactly what


---------96:25----------
i am


---------96:25----------
um and eventually it got to a place


---------96:28----------
where they were curious about why i was


---------96:29----------
so pissed off about it


---------96:30----------
and i found that that really helped you


---------96:32----------
know when when i had people


---------96:34----------
asking me legitimately like okay fine so


---------96:36----------
you're a cuck like why do you care so


---------96:38----------
much about this


---------96:39----------
then for whatever reason i felt like it


---------96:40----------
was way easier to explain


---------96:42----------
that new people come into this room and


---------96:45----------
play melee with us


---------96:46----------
okay people who don't know us are in


---------96:48----------
this room playing and when we say [ __ ]


---------96:50----------
like that they don't know who we are


---------96:51----------
they sure [ __ ] don't know who i am


---------96:53----------
and i don't want them to think that i'm


---------96:55----------
cool with that because i don't know who


---------96:56----------
they are


---------96:57----------
i have friends we all have friends who


---------96:59----------
are who are gay who have played melee


---------97:01----------
for a long time where


---------97:02----------
they were so uh immersed in that kind of


---------97:05----------
language that they would say it


---------97:06----------
themselves but i didn't know if they had


---------97:07----------
a problem with it they hadn't even come


---------97:08----------
out you know


---------97:09----------
so learning later on that people who are


---------97:12----------
near and dear to me were in the room we


---------97:14----------
were talking about oh you're playing gay


---------97:16----------
uh they just sat through that and didn't


---------97:17----------
say anything took that on the shoulder


---------97:20----------
that uh really bothered me after i


---------97:22----------
learned


---------97:23----------
like what we had been doing and so i


---------97:25----------
don't know to be honest i feel like


---------97:28----------
what gives me strength is the idea that


---------97:30----------
i think melee is


---------97:31----------
[ __ ] dope and i think anybody who


---------97:33----------
thinks that it's dope should be able to


---------97:35----------
play it without a problem


---------97:36----------
right and so if anybody's creating a


---------97:38----------
problem for somebody who wants to play


---------97:39----------
melee then they i feel like they've got


---------97:41----------
a problem with me


---------97:42----------
so that's what lets me feel strong and


---------97:43----------
saying like yeah i'm a cook i'm


---------97:45----------
simping for anybody who wants to play


---------97:46----------
melee also i want to say


---------97:49----------
women love simcocks like


---------97:53----------
no that's not why it's not part of my


---------97:55----------
motivation but


---------97:57----------
that's cool the term simp has gone so


---------97:59----------
warped


---------98:00----------
that like i like saw some [ __ ] on like


---------98:03----------
okay


---------98:04----------
i don't know i don't follow the


---------98:05----------
mainstream internet that much but i saw


---------98:06----------
like idubbbz or whatever in his


---------98:08----------
girlfriend like they're calling him a


---------98:09----------
sim for having a girlfriend it's like


---------98:10----------
what


---------98:11----------
he has a girlfriend and you don't it's


---------98:13----------
like


---------98:14----------
if being a sim card gets you the girl


---------98:17----------
then i don't know what the [ __ ] to say


---------98:19----------
but anyway it sounds like the sim card


---------98:21----------
is the true chad


---------98:24----------
i think so when everything flips at a


---------98:26----------
certain point everything goes full


---------98:27----------
circle


---------98:28----------
car was literally being in the chat he


---------98:30----------
was the dude that said like stop we got


---------98:32----------
to not do this he went against the grain


---------98:34----------
and like that's like


---------98:35----------
to me that takes more balls than like


---------98:38----------
and you know


---------98:39----------
it definitely does and as soon as one


---------98:41----------
thing i want to say is that i think the


---------98:42----------
first follower is just


---------98:44----------
as important as the leader here because


---------98:46----------
uh the first person to say like hey


---------98:47----------
don't use that language around me


---------98:49----------
they're super vulnerable


---------98:50----------
but if you're in that situation and you


---------98:52----------
feel any kind of way and you can back


---------98:54----------
that person up who's on the right side


---------98:56----------
that goes so far i can't i really can't


---------98:58----------
express


---------98:59----------
how that changes the culture more than


---------99:01----------
any one person


---------99:03----------
so there's some people who are going to


---------99:04----------
take the lead and who are going to tank


---------99:05----------
but then there's other people who are


---------99:06----------
you know the healers behind you got to


---------99:08----------
like keep their health up because they


---------99:09----------
get hit


---------99:10----------
yeah and i just want to mention that uh


---------99:12----------
when


---------99:13----------
when a lot of these accusations came out


---------99:15----------
in july one of the things that


---------99:18----------
you know people were called out for


---------99:19----------
behavior from the past and then one of


---------99:20----------
the defenses were always uh well that's


---------99:22----------
just how things were back then right


---------99:24----------
and i think that as a community we


---------99:27----------
always need to be


---------99:28----------
forward looking and thinking where um


---------99:32----------
uh you should be uncomfortable with


---------99:34----------
things before it's cool to be


---------99:35----------
uncomfortable with them right like


---------99:37----------
like the way like i always commend scar


---------99:38----------
for this because he was


---------99:40----------
talking about how we shouldn't say uh


---------99:42----------
homophobic slurs and


---------99:44----------
and these uh and words like rape that


---------99:45----------
make people uncomfortable


---------99:47----------
uh way before uh anyone was even


---------99:50----------
thinking about that


---------99:51----------
and he got a lot of [ __ ] for it but uh


---------99:53----------
things don't change unless you challenge


---------99:55----------
what's going on


---------99:56----------
normally and he did so now we're at a


---------99:58----------
point where i could ask someone like do


---------100:00----------
you think it's okay


---------100:01----------
to to use homophobic slurs and then


---------100:03----------
they'll just


---------100:04----------
be like obviously not and we're at that


---------100:06----------
point now and we're not going to be at


---------100:08----------
that point with


---------100:09----------
language and behavior that makes women


---------100:11----------
uncomfortable unless we challenge it


---------100:12----------
before it's cool to


---------100:14----------
challenge you yeah you have to be


---------100:15----------
forward thinking you have to start


---------100:17----------
challenging it now so that


---------100:18----------
a year from now or hopefully sooner when


---------100:21----------
when you say uh you know is it okay to


---------100:24----------
use the word [ __ ] to describe women


---------100:25----------
they're gonna be like


---------100:26----------
that makes no sense that's an awful


---------100:28----------
thing to do right so like you you have


---------100:29----------
to


---------100:30----------
not wait for things to be okay you have


---------100:33----------
to


---------100:33----------
make them not okay like and honestly


---------100:36----------
just like what


---------100:37----------
tk said about like okay it's fun to hook


---------100:39----------
up with somebody but it feels so much


---------100:41----------
better


---------100:42----------
right when people are coming to you and


---------100:43----------
like you're really able to help them


---------100:45----------
i just feel like yes it's not fun in the


---------100:47----------
beginning to challenge the status quo


---------100:49----------
but


---------100:50----------
when it changes it's really gratifying


---------100:51----------
like i'm proud of what we were able to


---------100:53----------
do i know that we've got a lot more work


---------100:55----------
to do but like


---------100:57----------
changing the language is big and it took


---------100:59----------
a it took some time but


---------101:01----------
i'm just proud that we did it i mean


---------101:02----------
damn dude i was also pretty happy that


---------101:05----------
you know we weren't like oh where's the


---------101:06----------
proof with all the stuff coming out


---------101:08----------
yeah because uh i could've gone that way


---------101:10----------
i don't think our specific


---------101:11----------
problem is just uh strictly the


---------101:14----------
predators that we've caught


---------101:15----------
i think it's a cultural problem that we


---------101:17----------
have had in the scene


---------101:19----------
and that's like you you presented the


---------101:22----------
question earlier about


---------101:23----------
minimizing the amount of predators that


---------101:24----------
we have i think changing the culture


---------101:26----------
which includes you know


---------101:28----------
uh people in power saying this [ __ ]


---------101:30----------
ain't cool and then


---------101:32----------
also the language that we used even


---------101:33----------
behind closed doors like you you address


---------101:36----------
like all these cultural things


---------101:38----------
um and i think that starts to help i


---------101:40----------
think that starts to change things you


---------101:42----------
know you at least minimize


---------101:43----------
just like we minimize the amount of


---------101:45----------
people that are hateful towards


---------101:46----------
um people of of of different


---------101:50----------
sexualities and things like that like we


---------101:52----------
we can do that with


---------101:54----------
uh with the people that make women


---------101:58----------
uncomfortable or assault them


---------101:59----------
and are predators and things like that


---------102:00----------
like we could change the culture and


---------102:02----------
start minimizing that as well


---------102:03----------
i i would hope yeah so and i do want to


---------102:07----------
add that one thing you can do besides


---------102:08----------
you know calling out your buds and like


---------102:10----------
pushing for this cultural shift it's


---------102:12----------
important to amplify the voices of the


---------102:13----------
people that experienced it firsthand too


---------102:15----------
so you know it's it's great to be able


---------102:18----------
to explain but


---------102:19----------
uh you know if somebody else makes if a


---------102:22----------
girl makes a tweet about how sexism


---------102:23----------
makes her feel you don't have to explain


---------102:25----------
over her you can just retweet and that


---------102:27----------
is


---------102:27----------
you know that is using your influence to


---------102:30----------
to elevate and amplify something that


---------102:34----------
someone personally experience reminds me


---------102:36----------
of this phrase i don't know if you guys


---------102:37----------
ever heard this


---------102:38----------
before but no snowflake feels


---------102:40----------
responsible for the avalanche


---------102:45----------
i've never heard that but i like it


---------102:50----------
um i i guess so let me ask you guys


---------102:53----------
two questions i i guess the first is i'm


---------102:56----------
personally a little bit confused about


---------102:59----------
how to handle you know believe women


---------103:02----------
versus


---------103:03----------
people who do uh fabricate


---------103:07----------
allegations so do you guys have any


---------103:10----------
thoughts about


---------103:13----------
how to manage that we should do


---------103:17----------
my uh my first instance


---------103:20----------
is to like all like i'm gonna read


---------103:22----------
whatever comes out


---------103:24----------
then i'll like if i know this person i


---------103:27----------
will like


---------103:28----------
put you know my i will put i would like


---------103:31----------
think about like


---------103:31----------
them as a person and then read this and


---------103:33----------
be like do these two things feel like


---------103:34----------
they match up


---------103:35----------
if they do then you know we'll [ __ ] but


---------103:38----------
if not


---------103:39----------
then i'm still going to wait i'm not


---------103:41----------
going to like i never the first person


---------103:42----------
to be like oh man


---------103:43----------
that's crazy i can't believe he did this


---------103:45----------
but i'm also not going to be the first


---------103:46----------
person to be like yo


---------103:46----------
proof i need to it's just the


---------103:49----------
information is out there


---------103:50----------
i want to see what happens now so


---------103:52----------
basically like i'm just waiting to see


---------103:54----------
what comes next so if this person goes


---------103:56----------
silent for four days


---------103:58----------
i'm more inclined to believe that


---------103:59----------
whatever was written is true but if this


---------104:01----------
person comes out


---------104:02----------
like that day and says you know i have


---------104:04----------
you know i have evidence or whatever


---------104:06----------
that is not true then i'm gonna wait to


---------104:09----------
make my like final judgment you know i'm


---------104:11----------
saying like i'm not gonna call him i'm a


---------104:12----------
liar i'm not gonna tell him uh


---------104:14----------
take anything and just immediately


---------104:16----------
believe but i will at least try to do


---------104:18----------
some like


---------104:19----------
uh i guess some rec some thinking on


---------104:22----------
both on all of the information that i


---------104:25----------
have


---------104:26----------
uh before making a decision but whoever


---------104:29----------
came out first i'm


---------104:30----------
more unlikely like i'm more inclined to


---------104:32----------
believe that like especially in this


---------104:33----------
climate that


---------104:34----------
whatever is being said is most likely


---------104:37----------
there's some truth behind it you know


---------104:39----------
like it may not


---------104:40----------
be 1000 correct but there is


---------104:44----------
a probably a some level some level


---------104:47----------
behavior that has made someone feel


---------104:48----------
uncomfortable enough to come up


---------104:50----------
to come out with this story so it is


---------104:52----------
easier for me to believe


---------104:53----------
that whatever i'm reading is probably


---------104:55----------
closer to the truth than whatever is


---------104:57----------
going to come out unless that person


---------104:58----------
comes out with like facts receipts and


---------105:00----------
all that


---------105:00----------
saying that like yo this didn't happen


---------105:02----------
and it does suck because obviously


---------105:05----------
i think that the few people that may


---------105:08----------
have come out with a


---------105:09----------
with a fake story like


---------105:12----------
even if the story is fake and you're


---------105:14----------
able to disprove it like that's still


---------105:15----------
going to follow you


---------105:16----------
like for a long long time you know and


---------105:20----------
it may be like a one or two percent


---------105:23----------
uh of stories that are it are fake


---------105:26----------
but those those people are still gonna


---------105:28----------
be hurting just because they've been


---------105:30----------
looped they're going to be lumped in


---------105:31----------
with everybody else because no one


---------105:33----------
a lot of people didn't go off and do


---------105:34----------
research after to


---------105:36----------
see if this was fake or not you know


---------105:37----------
what i'm saying so i think the phrase


---------105:40----------
believe women doesn't mean whoever was


---------105:43----------
accused


---------105:44----------
is absolutely guilty and we should go


---------105:45----------
dox them and we should condemn them and


---------105:47----------
never speak to them again


---------105:48----------
i don't think that's what believe women


---------105:49----------
means it means that when you read that


---------105:51----------
story for the first time you aren't


---------105:53----------
thinking like


---------105:53----------
well maybe she just regrets it it means


---------105:56----------
you're not thinking you're not gonna ask


---------105:58----------
like


---------105:58----------
well did she like flirt with him a


---------106:00----------
little bit and that's why you thought it


---------106:02----------
was okay


---------106:02----------
no you're gonna be like man that sucks


---------106:05----------
if that happened


---------106:06----------
like just give me that basic uh uh


---------106:11----------
empathy that like if i came forward


---------106:13----------
about this story


---------106:15----------
get benefit of the doubt that doesn't


---------106:16----------
mean you don't confirm like tk is saying


---------106:18----------
you have to hear both sides because some


---------106:20----------
weird [ __ ] does happen


---------106:22----------
but um believe women just means


---------106:26----------
don't try to invalidate what we're


---------106:28----------
saying


---------106:31----------
so i it's interesting because what i i


---------106:34----------
realize what i practically do is i take


---------106:36----------
the


---------106:36----------
allegations seriously but tend to not


---------106:39----------
pass


---------106:40----------
judgment right away right


---------106:43----------
you know maybe it's not for us to pass


---------106:44----------
judgment all the time right like yeah i


---------106:46----------
think every individual community member


---------106:47----------
doesn't need to know all of the gory


---------106:49----------
details of everybody's lives


---------106:51----------
but again that's assuming that there is


---------106:53----------
someone that will


---------106:54----------
uh uh demand accountability or or have


---------106:57----------
some kind of judgment in the end which


---------106:59----------
who knows if that happens in any given


---------107:01----------
case


---------107:02----------
i i will say as someone who's like


---------107:06----------
faced like the brunt of like a lot of


---------107:08----------
like cloud-chasing thought horror


---------107:10----------
accusations which by the way


---------107:13----------
again i didn't make my platform off of a


---------107:15----------
lot of those like


---------107:17----------
conventional things that guys on the


---------107:19----------
internet always hate on


---------107:20----------
it was only after i made my accusations


---------107:24----------
that men i only want to say men i don't


---------107:27----------
know who just people on the internet


---------107:30----------
immediately went to dig and try to find


---------107:32----------
the most


---------107:33----------
thoughtiest or like most condemning


---------107:35----------
things about me and try to paint me in


---------107:37----------
this light


---------107:38----------
and you know again there's not that much


---------107:39----------
there's not really anything on me to be


---------107:41----------
honest but like you'll go on youtube and


---------107:42----------
there's there's video thumbnails they'll


---------107:44----------
dick up pictures of me that i posted of


---------107:46----------
myself


---------107:46----------
from like three or four years ago and


---------107:49----------
it's like and there's such a clear


---------107:51----------
intent behind it which is


---------107:53----------
you know to paint me like a thought you


---------107:54----------
know like oh this person is just another


---------107:56----------
gold digging thought


---------107:57----------
like haha let's all go [ __ ] on her


---------107:59----------
because as men that's what we like to do


---------108:00----------
on the internet


---------108:01----------
and i think what you know dr piggy and


---------108:04----------
all these like the whole rhetoric right


---------108:05----------
now


---------108:05----------
is you know people do make up stories


---------108:10----------
i'm not going to pretend like that [ __ ]


---------108:11----------
doesn't exist but


---------108:14----------
when someone comes out with something


---------108:16----------
especially like in my situation where i


---------108:18----------
was putting a lot on the line like when


---------108:19----------
i called zero out


---------108:20----------
you know i i was like all right you know


---------108:23----------
i know my story is true


---------108:25----------
i hope people back me up on it but if


---------108:28----------
this [ __ ] tanks it's like well


---------108:29----------
buy smash community you know and like i


---------108:32----------
mean thankfully it didn't but like


---------108:35----------
well maybe look at these situations


---------108:36----------
where like somebody's not gonna come out


---------108:38----------
with a story like that for no reason


---------108:39----------
especially if they have nothing to gain


---------108:41----------
from it really


---------108:41----------
you know like what do you get like 10


---------108:43----------
minutes of fame especially if they come


---------108:44----------
out anonymously like what like they're


---------108:46----------
not getting anything out of it


---------108:47----------
and like two like you know


---------108:50----------
women they don't like like dr piggy said


---------108:54----------
when she said believe women that doesn't


---------108:55----------
mean


---------108:56----------
oh let's just ignore critical thinking


---------108:59----------
like that's that's all


---------109:00----------
that's that's just as bad as the other


---------109:01----------
thing you're doing the same thing just


---------109:03----------
the other way what we're asking for


---------109:04----------
is the same credence and respect


---------109:08----------
and open-mindedness that you always give


---------109:10----------
to


---------109:11----------
the guys that's literally it and if you


---------109:14----------
do that


---------109:15----------
then in most situations like nine times


---------109:17----------
out of ten you know you if you


---------109:18----------
critically think through it


---------109:20----------
then you'll arrive to the truth and


---------109:23----------
like i i will say like by default even


---------109:26----------
with how


---------109:27----------
you know i don't like using this word


---------109:28----------
but like not conventionally i've held


---------109:31----------
myself


---------109:31----------
like or presented myself on the internet


---------109:33----------
i was i still


---------109:34----------
felt and got a huge like


---------109:38----------
like backlash from the default state of


---------109:40----------
mind of men which is just to


---------109:42----------
like hate on the girl and it doesn't


---------109:44----------
matter what you do it's like it's the


---------109:45----------
fact that you're a girl


---------109:46----------
they're gonna call you these things


---------109:48----------
they're gonna dig up these things about


---------109:49----------
you and then they're gonna be like here


---------109:51----------
this is what she does she's a thought


---------109:53----------
this is how she makes her living


---------109:54----------
it's like that's not even true but like


---------109:56----------
they that's that's what they want to do


---------109:58----------
they just want to hate women


---------110:00----------
so that's that is the first thing that


---------110:02----------
needs to be changed and it's still


---------110:04----------
something that's being fought against


---------110:05----------
that's literally all that that's really


---------110:06----------
all that all the good women mean


---------110:10----------
and like even if you are a sex worker


---------110:12----------
that does not necessarily


---------110:14----------
it doesn't lower your value as a human


---------110:17----------
or as a smash community member


---------110:18----------
right um i've been called like a social


---------110:21----------
justice warrior infiltrator lizard


---------110:23----------
person


---------110:25----------
just because they can't believe that a


---------110:26----------
woman would be in smash bros


---------110:28----------
or whatever and it's yeah so


---------110:31----------
there are some people that the issue is


---------110:33----------
that you're a woman


---------110:35----------
not everybody but some people will find


---------110:37----------
whatever they can


---------110:38----------
and make that the issue yeah


---------110:43----------
yeah so what's next guys what do we what


---------110:45----------
do we do


---------110:47----------
what happens well as of right now i


---------110:49----------
don't know because we're


---------110:51----------
you know with the quarantine stuff like


---------110:53----------
it's just


---------110:54----------
we a lot happened in a short amount of


---------110:58----------
time


---------110:59----------
uh within the smash community to make it


---------111:02----------
feel like


---------111:04----------
you know it's not that it's dead but


---------111:06----------
it's definitely


---------111:07----------
like some type of hiatus now whenever we


---------111:10----------
come back i hope that


---------111:11----------
uh these lessons don't get lost like i


---------111:14----------
hope that


---------111:15----------
after after seeing that literally and


---------111:17----------
like to any


---------111:18----------
to anyone watching or whatever to anyone


---------111:20----------
who plays to anyone who's planning a


---------111:21----------
tournament after saying that literally


---------111:22----------
anyone can go down


---------111:24----------
that you if you have uh problematic


---------111:27----------
behavior


---------111:28----------
that like it is something that you try


---------111:29----------
to fix you know not only for just the


---------111:31----------
smash community but just in life you


---------111:33----------
know i mean like


---------111:34----------
these uh these are not just smash


---------111:35----------
community exclusive things these are


---------111:36----------
life lessons


---------111:37----------
you know don't make people feel


---------111:38----------
uncomfortable anywhere if you


---------111:41----------
can if you can stop that like if you can


---------111:43----------
uh if you have the power to


---------111:45----------
to not do that then you know do that um


---------111:48----------
so i feel like as far as being a


---------111:50----------
community leader


---------111:52----------
uh not to say that i am but i know that


---------111:55----------
there


---------111:56----------
are people out there that will look up


---------111:58----------
to me you know they will look up to us


---------112:00----------
that will look up to anyone with status


---------112:02----------
with clout whatever


---------112:03----------
the best thing we can do is lead by


---------112:04----------
example in my opinion


---------112:06----------
um i think the best thing we can do is


---------112:09----------
continue to


---------112:11----------
make those who feel who make other


---------112:13----------
people feel uncomfortable


---------112:14----------
uncomfortable you know like if me


---------112:18----------
telling you that like your behavior is


---------112:21----------
problematic and that makes you


---------112:22----------
uncomfortable because you are being


---------112:24----------
problematic then good you know what i'm


---------112:25----------
saying


---------112:26----------
like that's that's the reaction that i


---------112:28----------
want because then it's gonna make you


---------112:30----------
uh think about you know what you're


---------112:33----------
doing and what you can be doing better


---------112:35----------
and that's all i really


---------112:38----------
wish to accomplish you know is to make


---------112:41----------
sure that people


---------112:42----------
are uh i guess consciously aware of


---------112:45----------
themselves


---------112:46----------
and what they can do to hold themselves


---------112:49----------
and other people accountable


---------112:51----------
yeah i did hold i did have like this


---------112:54----------
like big panel


---------112:55----------
and one of the people that i invited was


---------112:57----------
actually the t.o of genesis


---------112:59----------
um he goes well like share dactyls like


---------113:01----------
online um


---------113:03----------
but like you know because i think one of


---------113:04----------
the biggest questions obviously like


---------113:06----------
you're asking it right now is like what


---------113:07----------
do we do now and


---------113:08----------
it's more than just a matter of like the


---------113:09----------
culture like there's a lot of logistics


---------113:11----------
uh


---------113:13----------
um just like objective


---------113:16----------
pieces that need to move to like make


---------113:18----------
things happen


---------113:19----------
and it's a matter it's a question of


---------113:20----------
like who's gonna do it and what exactly


---------113:22----------
does that entail and like especially


---------113:24----------
like


---------113:24----------
yeah whenever tournaments might happen


---------113:26----------
you know that's one of the biggest


---------113:27----------
question marks


---------113:28----------
and like um


---------113:31----------
he did tell us that a lot of the tos


---------113:35----------
are in talks or have been in talks of


---------113:37----------
measures that they can take


---------113:39----------
to prevent things like this happening um


---------113:42----------
and i think a big a big point though


---------113:45----------
that he wanted to emphasize


---------113:46----------
like i think needs to be emphasized too


---------113:47----------
is like it's not going to be perfect


---------113:50----------
like you know


---------113:50----------
once things come back and like


---------113:52----------
tournaments are a thing again like it's


---------113:54----------
not like


---------113:55----------
you know oh they're gonna have the


---------113:56----------
perfect system figured out it's like the


---------113:58----------
like you know like literally the legal


---------114:01----------
police in our world


---------114:02----------
with all the funding and structure and


---------114:04----------
infrastructure they have like


---------114:05----------
they don't even have things figured out


---------114:06----------
you know and it's it's unreasonable to


---------114:09----------
think that


---------114:09----------
it's not going to take a couple of tries


---------114:11----------
but like i said before it's the fact


---------114:13----------
that


---------114:14----------
people are even trying like that's the


---------114:17----------
difference


---------114:18----------
and i think especially online too i've


---------114:20----------
already noticed like a difference


---------114:22----------
where people have been taking a stand


---------114:24----------
like recently


---------114:25----------
there was um there was a really


---------114:27----------
questionable twit longer made about


---------114:28----------
somebody who was ousted


---------114:29----------
uh and like it was


---------114:33----------
like people immediately came and like


---------114:36----------
you know what i'm talking about people


---------114:38----------
immediately came and they're just like


---------114:40----------
they're just like [ __ ] on it they're


---------114:41----------
like what are you talking about you know


---------114:42----------
and like


---------114:43----------
obviously we want to give credence to


---------114:45----------
both sides but it wasn't a case where


---------114:47----------
the accused


---------114:48----------
already admitted and like i said there's


---------114:51----------
a history of him being very


---------114:53----------
like predatory towards women in general


---------114:55----------
um which his


---------114:56----------
that person's twit longer just


---------114:57----------
completely ignored uh


---------114:59----------
so like you know that wasn't a thing


---------115:03----------
before this whole happened like people


---------115:05----------
if


---------115:06----------
that twit longer came out like before


---------115:08----------
the whole july


---------115:09----------
stuff more people more people definitely


---------115:12----------
just be on his side especially because


---------115:13----------
he does have a decent enough following


---------115:15----------
so like um there is change that's


---------115:18----------
happening and i think like


---------115:19----------
just like how somebody who's like


---------115:21----------
correcting themselves


---------115:23----------
like they need to keep doing the same


---------115:25----------
actions and like create a record of it


---------115:26----------
to actually show true change it's the


---------115:28----------
same for the community like we as a


---------115:29----------
whole


---------115:30----------
need to work together to keep


---------115:32----------
reinforcing


---------115:33----------
the promises that we that we've made to


---------115:36----------
like the victims of the past and like to


---------115:37----------
prevent this for like victims of the


---------115:39----------
future


---------115:39----------
you know i


---------115:42----------
wanted to ask a question actually so you


---------115:44----------
know toph and i did a stream


---------115:46----------
about this i don't know a while ago and


---------115:47----------
uh one of the ideas we come up


---------115:49----------
came up with or one of the things we


---------115:50----------
talked about is like how people can be


---------115:52----------
isolated


---------115:53----------
not only victims but you know people who


---------115:55----------
are


---------115:56----------
starting to who are close to making a


---------115:58----------
big mistake and the question was who can


---------116:00----------
they talk to


---------116:01----------
and uh you know i was kind of thinking


---------116:03----------
about the recovery coach program that dr


---------116:05----------
k and healthy gamer are putting together


---------116:06----------
and like


---------116:08----------
does anybody think it would be a good


---------116:10----------
idea to have like a


---------116:12----------
melee or a smash community like recovery


---------116:15----------
coach


---------116:16----------
type deal where hey i'm i've got a


---------116:18----------
problem i'm a melee player like i don't


---------116:20----------
know who to talk to like


---------116:21----------
have a discord have a place dr k i don't


---------116:23----------
know how recovery coach program


---------116:25----------
and the rollout's going but it just


---------116:27----------
seems to me that having people more


---------116:28----------
connected to each other and being able


---------116:30----------
to talk to somebody


---------116:31----------
and it's not uh somebody who's a lawyer


---------116:34----------
who's gonna charge you money or


---------116:36----------
you know a psychiatrist who might not


---------116:38----------
actually help in any meaningful way


---------116:40----------
but just somebody you could talk to


---------116:44----------
you know i didn't mean it that way i i


---------116:47----------
thought it was funny


---------116:49----------
i'm not i'm not offended okay


---------116:52----------
i'm laughing because i just need


---------116:53----------
somebody in the community to


---------116:55----------
help connect people so so that because


---------116:58----------
for me i never hear about this [ __ ] till


---------116:59----------
it's way too late i don't know


---------117:00----------
and i know that there's people who care


---------117:02----------
who feel that there's nothing they can


---------117:04----------
do because it's always too late


---------117:06----------
and i've just been thinking about like


---------117:07----------
how do we get the information to flow


---------117:11----------
the information flow seems to be a big


---------117:13----------
problem in my mind that people could


---------117:15----------
have problems and they just can't get it


---------117:16----------
out there


---------117:18----------
go ahead jisoo oh i was i was just


---------117:21----------
i was just thinking about it like i want


---------117:24----------
to think a little bit more


---------117:25----------
before i say anything else but i feel


---------117:26----------
like i don't know i feel like dr piggy


---------117:28----------
is already


---------117:28----------
kind of working on that and along with


---------117:31----------
some other people


---------117:32----------
um i don't know if that's true or not


---------117:35----------
generally speaking when when dr k


---------117:38----------
asks like what do we do next um


---------117:43----------
that's really hard for me to answer


---------117:45----------
because i've been the backbone of a lot


---------117:47----------
of the code of conduct initiatives and


---------117:48----------
i'm getting burnt out guys


---------117:50----------
i spent too many nights crying in the


---------117:52----------
shower getting


---------117:53----------
messages from abusers i can't i


---------117:57----------
it takes a village and we need a village


---------117:59----------
um


---------118:03----------
but yes i mean that's real talk too


---------118:05----------
because like i think


---------118:06----------
that was that low tier city you were


---------118:09----------
like you're about to get on commentary


---------118:10----------
and you look a little rattled and i came


---------118:12----------
up to you and asked you are you good you


---------118:13----------
were telling me a little bit about that


---------118:14----------
stuff and i felt bad because like it


---------118:15----------
really


---------118:16----------
it really does feel like you're


---------118:17----------
shouldering at all when it really does


---------118:19----------
it should be


---------118:20----------
on all of us and not just you so i mean


---------118:22----------
i appreciate the work you're doing i


---------118:23----------
just want you to know that


---------118:24----------
but i like you know if there's anything


---------118:28----------
any way that we


---------118:29----------
i could help you directly you know you


---------118:30----------
can always dm me like i'm always around


---------118:33----------
yeah and i apologize if it sounds like


---------118:34----------
i'm saying oh let's do something you've


---------118:36----------
already been working on


---------118:37----------
the thing i'm talking about is like the


---------118:38----------
way to build the village and the


---------118:40----------
recovery coach program just sounds it


---------118:41----------
just hit me when it


---------118:42----------
you know when when healthy gamer


---------118:44----------
announced it that like that could be


---------118:45----------
cool you know it's like organic and it


---------118:47----------
can spread


---------118:48----------
like whoever wants to get involved can


---------118:50----------
can we help them get involved so that we


---------118:51----------
have a village


---------118:53----------
yes if if anyone has any kind of if


---------118:55----------
you're trying to figure out a code of


---------118:56----------
conduct initiative for your local scene


---------118:58----------
if you're trying to


---------118:59----------
create a resources page or document


---------119:00----------
please do it there is no monopoly on


---------119:03----------
this


---------119:03----------
and and really i you know i talk about


---------119:05----------
my struggles but there have been so many


---------119:06----------
people along the way that have given


---------119:08----------
their hours of time


---------119:09----------
and love um to the code of conduct


---------119:10----------
projects i'm the one that's happened to


---------119:12----------
be here the longest right


---------119:13----------
and done it most consistently i suppose


---------119:15----------
um but whether or not


---------119:17----------
i end up continuing with the code of


---------119:18----------
conduct work um the one


---------119:20----------
goal i have in the coming months is


---------119:22----------
creating resource


---------119:24----------
uh pool right so resources for


---------119:26----------
tournament organizers how uh


---------119:28----------
how can you implement your own codes


---------119:29----------
what are the kind of rules and


---------119:30----------
commitments


---------119:31----------
uh what kind of questions do you need to


---------119:32----------
ask when somebody comes to you with a


---------119:34----------
report


---------119:35----------
um creating resources for victims so


---------119:37----------
like how can i get


---------119:38----------
how can i see a therapist or like what's


---------119:39----------
my likelihood of being able to


---------119:42----------
sue this person or like how can i talk


---------119:44----------
to somebody having resources for accused


---------119:46----------
people like


---------119:46----------
how to write an apology or even things


---------119:48----------
like um


---------119:49----------
you know uh therapy for themselves like


---------119:52----------
there are so many


---------119:54----------
things that just weren't talked about in


---------119:56----------
smash community that if if that


---------119:57----------
information and education were out there


---------120:00----------
i think it would do a lot of good um so


---------120:04----------
i you know i don't know where i'll be


---------120:05----------
but i do think one of the answer


---------120:07----------
is creating consistent structural um


---------120:11----------
emphasis and importance on


---------120:13----------
accountability


---------120:14----------
and how each person in each part of our


---------120:16----------
community whether you're a terminal


---------120:17----------
organizer or


---------120:18----------
or just a player or a top player


---------120:20----------
whatever what


---------120:21----------
you can do and then stick to it you know


---------120:24----------
throughout my work there's been a lot of


---------120:25----------
people that have


---------120:26----------
ideas they have big dreams and big ideas


---------120:28----------
of what to do but the follow through


---------120:30----------
is what really makes people it's


---------120:33----------
effective


---------120:34----------
and makes somebody an amazing person in


---------120:36----------
my eyes is when you follow through on


---------120:37----------
those things right like all this july


---------120:39----------
stuff that happened


---------120:40----------
the people that are still out there


---------120:41----------
working god you're my heroes


---------120:43----------
you know you're the ones that that we


---------120:46----------
that


---------120:47----------
that should be elevated um not just


---------120:50----------
because you're good at the game but


---------120:51----------
because


---------120:51----------
you committed to protecting people and


---------120:53----------
then you did it like that's so powerful


---------120:56----------
wait i have a question for like okay


---------120:59----------
wait doesn't melee have like okay so i


---------121:02----------
don't fall ultimate that well i'm like


---------121:04----------
more like mailing


---------121:05----------
but like doesn't it have like that like


---------121:08----------
tournament legalization


---------121:10----------
like squad like i remember


---------121:13----------
like when ucf and like you talk about


---------121:16----------
like the five and the 25.


---------121:18----------
yeah yeah i'm talking about the five and


---------121:20----------
i forget i forget what their name is


---------121:21----------
they're literally


---------121:22----------
erased that stuff in my mind it was so


---------121:24----------
ridiculous


---------121:25----------
okay like i was gonna i was gonna say


---------121:28----------
like there is some kind of structure


---------121:29----------
going on whether it's just like


---------121:31----------
literally facebook messages or whatever


---------121:32----------
but like


---------121:34----------
like i think i feel like just a tangible


---------121:37----------
solution


---------121:38----------
would be like because okay because the


---------121:39----------
scene they attack like tournament


---------121:42----------
legal issues so vehemently they'll be


---------121:45----------
like


---------121:45----------
yo pokemon stadium and then everyone's


---------121:48----------
oh like the other pitchforks after like


---------121:51----------
i'm so passionate about this you know


---------121:52----------
and like i feel like


---------121:54----------
instead of like having like these like


---------121:57----------
the code of conduct or like the 525 i


---------121:59----------
don't know what it is nowadays


---------122:00----------
it's always changing but like if if it


---------122:03----------
could all somehow just like come


---------122:04----------
together


---------122:05----------
because there is a panel of people who


---------122:07----------
do these things and make decisions


---------122:10----------
it's just that it needs like these like


---------122:12----------
sexual allegations and like social


---------122:14----------
issues need to be brought up on the same


---------122:16----------
pedestal


---------122:17----------
as like oh how many times can mewtwo can


---------122:20----------
grab the ledge


---------122:20----------
like that's just like it's like why why


---------122:23----------
are we spending like


---------122:24----------
20 [ __ ] years like discussing like


---------122:27----------
that [ __ ]


---------122:28----------
instead of like oh is it bad if we give


---------122:32----------
alcohol to a 15 year old it's like


---------122:36----------
the conduct actually did come out of the


---------122:39----------
five


---------122:39----------
um emily's son emily waves she was like


---------122:42----------
hey y'all uh why don't we


---------122:44----------
deal with this issue of harassment and


---------122:45----------
they're like we don't think we that's


---------122:46----------
our specialty you should make a a group


---------122:49----------
so that's when the harassment task force


---------122:50----------
was formed and then we changed our name


---------122:52----------
to code of conduct


---------122:53----------
so originally this was part of some like


---------122:55----------
bigger initiative and i do


---------122:56----------
i am in chats with like the five or


---------122:58----------
whatever but i think they kind of had


---------123:00----------
the same problem that i've been


---------123:00----------
describing and that the consistency and


---------123:02----------
the follow-through


---------123:03----------
um of like creating a rule set or or


---------123:07----------
you know a ban recommendation or


---------123:08----------
whatever isn't always there


---------123:11----------
so i'm going to take a stab at bobby's


---------123:14----------
question


---------123:15----------
so like does kim coaching help so like i


---------123:18----------
think that the


---------123:19----------
the interesting thing is that you know


---------123:21----------
with a lot of the metoo movement


---------123:23----------
let me just take a step back so i'm


---------123:25----------
going to say some things that i think


---------123:26----------
could be a little bit controversial


---------123:28----------
um and so if you guys have any questions


---------123:30----------
or you feel like


---------123:31----------
it's out of line like please let me know


---------123:34----------
so


---------123:35----------
honestly the way i think about this is


---------123:38----------
like lung cancer so if we start with


---------123:40----------
sort of the idea like if we think about


---------123:41----------
medicine right so


---------123:43----------
you have a patient who has lung cancer


---------123:45----------
like that's really bad


---------123:47----------
and then you have this entire branch of


---------123:49----------
oncology


---------123:51----------
which is like okay like chemotherapy and


---------123:53----------
radiation and all this kind of stuff


---------123:55----------
like a lot of intensive medicine


---------123:56----------
just a really bad situation that's just


---------123:59----------
like ugly


---------124:00----------
and when i think about these predators


---------124:02----------
as you guys are describing them


---------124:03----------
i sort of think about lung cancer um


---------124:07----------
and that in and of itself is sort of


---------124:08----------
like a maybe a judgmental image


---------124:10----------
may be fair maybe unfair depending on


---------124:12----------
who you are what you believe whatever


---------124:14----------
but the real interesting thing is like


---------124:15----------
do you guys know


---------124:17----------
how we really


---------124:21----------
improved lung cancer outcomes at least


---------124:23----------
in the united states


---------124:27----------
uh i did not what are you guys like so


---------124:31----------
lung cancer used to be a way worse


---------124:32----------
problem 60 years ago


---------124:35----------
than it is now smoking absolutely


---------124:38----------
so here's the really really crazy


---------124:40----------
thought which i think a lot of people


---------124:42----------
don't really think about and i think if


---------124:44----------
we really tunnel down


---------124:46----------
hugs sort of mention this right it's


---------124:48----------
like we have this idea like there are


---------124:50----------
these people out there and we like


---------124:51----------
label them as predators this person is a


---------124:54----------
predator it's the way that we define


---------124:56----------
them


---------124:57----------
it's kind of like this war against like


---------124:58----------
the good people and the bad people


---------125:01----------
and hugs when he sort of like realized


---------125:03----------
oh my god like this is a person that i


---------125:05----------
thought was in the good camp


---------125:06----------
and now he's in the bad camp and in a


---------125:10----------
bizarre way like tk


---------125:11----------
actually kind of touched us on this too


---------125:13----------
because he used to be thirsty


---------125:16----------
and then something happened and he grew


---------125:18----------
up as he calls it


---------125:20----------
so i i here's the way that i think about


---------125:22----------
it i think that there


---------125:23----------
are a thousand or ten thousand or a


---------125:26----------
hundred thousand


---------125:27----------
people who could grow up to be predators


---------125:30----------
and for me it started with the question


---------125:32----------
like when was this predator born


---------125:34----------
like this guy who did whatever you did


---------125:36----------
to jisoo or or did whatever they did to


---------125:38----------
to you piggy like when did this person


---------125:41----------
become a predator


---------125:42----------
because like you guys said it's kind of


---------125:44----------
like there's this this long like not


---------125:46----------
crossing the line not crossing the line


---------125:47----------
not crossing the line and they cross the


---------125:49----------
line


---------125:50----------
right were they a predator at that point


---------125:52----------
or were they like a predator before


---------125:54----------
was he a predator the first time he like


---------125:56----------
walked up to jisoo and said hey what's


---------125:58----------
going on


---------126:00----------
when is a predator born because i think


---------126:03----------
it's okay first of all


---------126:04----------
yeah can we i really want to vehemently


---------126:08----------
disagree with the idea that somebody's a


---------126:09----------
predator are not a predator


---------126:11----------
so somebody's what um that somebody is


---------126:13----------
binary a predator or not


---------126:15----------
yeah i know that that's the point i'm


---------126:17----------
making oh okay cause you're saying that


---------126:19----------
like


---------126:19----------
yeah we put these people into buckets


---------126:21----------
but that's not it at all well that's how


---------126:23----------
we talk about them right


---------126:24----------
so you guys have used the word predator


---------126:26----------
throughout this entire discussion


---------126:28----------
you've talked about people in a very


---------126:30----------
judgmental manner because i mean like


---------126:32----------
that's what that's the language we call


---------126:35----------
these people


---------126:35----------
predators but yeah but but so i'm i'm


---------126:38----------
with you


---------126:39----------
yeah piggy so like that's sort of like


---------126:41----------
calling someone you know


---------126:42----------
schizophrenic this person is a


---------126:45----------
schizophrenic


---------126:46----------
versus as schizophrenia so there are


---------126:49----------
some people who we define


---------126:51----------
their personhood by a particular


---------126:54----------
attribute of who they are so like


---------126:56----------
homophobic slurs is another good example


---------126:58----------
thought is another good example where we


---------127:01----------
define an entire person


---------127:03----------
by one attribute of their being and one


---------127:05----------
place where i see


---------127:06----------
very few people everyone's against using


---------127:09----------
you know the word thought


---------127:11----------
or [ __ ] or homophobic slur but when it


---------127:13----------
comes to defining a predator as a


---------127:15----------
predator


---------127:16----------
everyone's on board you're the in the


---------127:18----------
minority piggy


---------127:19----------
because most people are okay with


---------127:21----------
tarring and feathering


---------127:23----------
sexual predators which i'm not saying is


---------127:25----------
i mean i think it's reasonable in a lot


---------127:27----------
of ways


---------127:28----------
um but i i think the the the issue about


---------127:31----------
how to solve this and where the coaching


---------127:32----------
program comes in is because i think that


---------127:34----------
like


---------127:35----------
you know i mean i


---------127:38----------
certainly had a lot of feelings that i


---------127:40----------
think like align with being an incel


---------127:42----------
when i was growing up like


---------127:44----------
a lot of young male gamers do we were


---------127:45----------
socially awkward couldn't get


---------127:47----------
girlfriends


---------127:48----------
sexually frustrated and then like some


---------127:50----------
of us grow up and i think some of us


---------127:52----------
don't


---------127:53----------
and so what i'm really curious about is


---------127:55----------
like that fork in the road like what's


---------127:57----------
the lung can


---------127:58----------
what's the smoking in our society that


---------128:00----------
leads to the lung cancer


---------128:02----------
and so we talk about cultural change


---------128:05----------
right but i think that like in my mind


---------128:07----------
there's like there's a 17 year old kid


---------128:09----------
out there right now


---------128:10----------
who could one day turn into a sexual


---------128:13----------
predator


---------128:15----------
and whatever hey i don't want to


---------128:16----------
interrupt but like when i thought about


---------128:18----------
this hey man


---------128:19----------
the people who were doing like they got


---------128:21----------
into the community young so you've got


---------128:22----------
young men who do not have a lot of


---------128:24----------
interaction with women where they are


---------128:26----------
[ __ ] famous and there is booze around


---------128:28----------
and like


---------128:29----------
you know what i mean this is a bad


---------128:30----------
environment


---------128:32----------
do you know what i'm saying like the


---------128:34----------
environment is going to bring that out


---------128:35----------
of people who wouldn't i feel otherwise


---------128:37----------
do it if it wasn't so high risk


---------128:39----------
yeah so i i think the the tricky thing


---------128:42----------
sorry piggy go ahead


---------128:44----------
the way i think about this is it's i


---------128:46----------
think something similar to you


---------128:47----------
imagine a normal distribution a


---------128:49----------
bell-shaped curve right and there's


---------128:50----------
right down the middle


---------128:52----------
uh a line that we draw the average right


---------128:54----------
and if you're above that line you're a


---------128:56----------
predator if you're below that line


---------128:57----------
you're not right


---------128:58----------
and maybe you have


---------129:01----------
an entitlement issue where you think


---------129:02----------
people owe you and maybe that puts you


---------129:04----------
ten percent higher


---------129:05----------
and or maybe your mom was sexually


---------129:08----------
assaulted when she was young and that's


---------129:09----------
why that puts you five percent lower


---------129:10----------
right


---------129:11----------
but like what are the big like 20 chunks


---------129:14----------
that would put you over the edge right


---------129:15----------
because we can say culture who our best


---------129:18----------
friend is maybe that's two percent


---------129:19----------
um personal responsibility should be


---------129:22----------
like a 30


---------129:23----------
or something like that but like there


---------129:24----------
are risk factors just like


---------129:27----------
just like lung cancer that that


---------129:29----------
additively


---------129:30----------
or subtractively end up with the binary


---------129:33----------
result


---------129:33----------
of does something that hurts other


---------129:35----------
people or doesn't


---------129:36----------
right and i think we can go even further


---------129:38----------
and say like well if you're in the upper


---------129:40----------
eighty percent


---------129:41----------
at that point that's when you're


---------129:42----------
intending to hurt people not just on


---------129:44----------
accident and so how does somebody get


---------129:46----------
from


---------129:46----------
doing it and not realizing the hurt


---------129:48----------
they're causing to like knowing and


---------129:49----------
doing it anyway


---------129:50----------
so there's so many underlying factors


---------129:52----------
but i think it is important for us to


---------129:54----------
say like okay so what are the biggest


---------129:55----------
ones


---------129:56----------
yeah so so i think this is where kind of


---------129:58----------
bobby's question was about the coaching


---------130:00----------
program so in my experience so like so i


---------130:02----------
i tend to work on an individual level


---------130:04----------
right so that's what my day job is


---------130:06----------
so i take someone with let's say an


---------130:08----------
addiction and they have like all kinds


---------130:09----------
of stuff like


---------130:10----------
abuse growing up family history of


---------130:12----------
addiction


---------130:14----------
what are like you know struggling


---------130:16----------
financially whatever


---------130:17----------
and and so you all ultimately end up


---------130:19----------
with kind of a unit the short answer is


---------130:20----------
that i i do think bobby that the


---------130:22----------
coaching program can help


---------130:24----------
and that's why we started it because i


---------130:26----------
think at the end of the day just like


---------130:27----------
piggy is saying


---------130:28----------
there are a thousand different factors i


---------130:30----------
think you guys are we're talking about a


---------130:32----------
couple of them are like no-brainers to


---------130:33----------
me so


---------130:34----------
one thing for example that i noticed


---------130:35----------
just like the epidemiologist in me


---------130:37----------
noticed that like 90 of these stories


---------130:40----------
involve drinking


---------130:41----------
and usually a lot of them right so it


---------130:44----------
like


---------130:44----------
like a lot of it is like after parties


---------130:46----------
with like i


---------130:47----------
and i think the smash community is in a


---------130:49----------
sense a little bit


---------130:50----------
of an outlier because i think there's


---------130:52----------
way more underage people


---------130:54----------
but if you look at like the dota


---------130:55----------
community like i don't think they're a


---------130:56----------
bunch of 15 year olds at after parties


---------130:58----------
it's like mostly people over the age of


---------131:00----------
18 but there's also just a lot about


---------131:02----------
there's a lot of alcohol and that kind


---------131:04----------
of comes from the cultural conception


---------131:05----------
that an after party needs to have


---------131:07----------
alcohol


---------131:08----------
which is like a really deep rooted thing


---------131:11----------
the short answer is yeah sorry let me


---------131:14----------
just finish up


---------131:16----------
if that's okay yeah yeah um so the short


---------131:18----------
answer is that i


---------131:19----------
i do think we can help and like this is


---------131:21----------
what we see so what we see is that when


---------131:23----------
we sort of like


---------131:24----------
open our doors and try to be


---------131:26----------
non-judgmental


---------131:28----------
we do deal with a lot of people who are


---------131:30----------
like in cells


---------131:31----------
so we just tossed around the idea


---------131:33----------
recently of starting like an incel group


---------131:35----------
because i


---------131:35----------
we've tried to get what i call a true


---------131:37----------
incel on stream because it's my


---------131:38----------
hypothesis that


---------131:40----------
an insult is like it's like a it's like


---------131:43----------
a


---------131:44----------
a mode that emerges when you're in a


---------131:47----------
particular environment and when you


---------131:48----------
actually sit down and you talk to these


---------131:50----------
people


---------131:51----------
you find that they're they're like


---------131:53----------
they're like pretty normal people that


---------131:54----------
just


---------131:55----------
have internal struggles that then they


---------131:57----------
find this echo chamber that kind of like


---------131:59----------
fans a particular kind of flame


---------132:01----------
and like changes the way they think and


---------132:02----------
then they sort of like turn into this


---------132:04----------
like weird wolf which is like a normal


---------132:06----------
human by day


---------132:07----------
like if you can get them one-on-one and


---------132:09----------
actually talk to them you can really


---------132:11----------
start to make a pretty big impact like


---------132:12----------
relatively


---------132:13----------
easily and so i do think this is why we


---------132:16----------
have like group coaching we literally


---------132:18----------
just this past week talked about


---------132:20----------
like offering particular groups for like


---------132:23----------
in cells or other people who are


---------132:25----------
struggling with these things because i


---------132:26----------
i think the really other the other thing


---------132:28----------
that we don't really like to think about


---------132:30----------
when it comes to predators is we don't


---------132:31----------
talk to them right we almost never do


---------132:34----------
that


---------132:35----------
because i suspect that a lot of these


---------132:37----------
people who get out of line


---------132:39----------
actually do so not out of a predatory


---------132:42----------
instinct


---------132:43----------
but out of a positive emotion i think


---------132:46----------
that some of these people


---------132:48----------
are so infatuated are so in love or so


---------132:51----------
entitled


---------132:52----------
that they think it's okay like most


---------132:55----------
human beings in my experience


---------132:57----------
when they commit a sin they don't


---------133:00----------
do it knowing it's a sin they do it


---------133:03----------
thinking that they're justified


---------133:05----------
and they think that there's some like


---------133:07----------
there's something going on where they're


---------133:08----------
like


---------133:09----------
you know like someone who's unfaithful


---------133:10----------
to their partner justifies it because


---------133:13----------
their partner didn't pay enough


---------133:14----------
attention to them it's very what we call


---------133:15----------
ego syntonic


---------133:16----------
they don't think that they don't view


---------133:18----------
what they're doing is predatory behavior


---------133:20----------
because they feel a particular way about


---------133:22----------
it and this is where we kind of go back


---------133:24----------
to what hugs was saying earlier about


---------133:25----------
like you have to learn how to step out


---------133:27----------
of your own shoes and just because you


---------133:29----------
don't think it's a problem


---------133:30----------
doesn't mean it isn't a problem and my


---------133:34----------
my end sort of conclusion is that i


---------133:36----------
think we need to like start


---------133:37----------
early i think we need to work with a lot


---------133:39----------
of people probably on an individual or


---------133:41----------
group level


---------133:42----------
and i think it's awesome that we have


---------133:44----------
these large-scale like code of conduct


---------133:46----------
kind of measures


---------133:48----------
but i i do think that at some point what


---------133:50----------
we really need to do we're almost at a


---------133:52----------
phase where we're like


---------133:53----------
you know 50 years ago addiction was


---------133:55----------
considered a moral


---------133:56----------
problem and is is like now like more of


---------133:59----------
a disease


---------134:00----------
and working with people like i'm an


---------134:02----------
addiction psychiatrist in my day job i


---------134:03----------
think sometimes it is a moral problem


---------134:05----------
like sometimes human beings let like


---------134:08----------
they just act in a very like nasty way


---------134:11----------
not because


---------134:12----------
of their addiction like you can be an


---------134:14----------
addict and be an [ __ ] too


---------134:15----------
and i think sometimes like now it's


---------134:17----------
gotten over medicalized to the point


---------134:19----------
where like people use their addiction as


---------134:20----------
an excuse


---------134:21----------
where i think sometimes like you know


---------134:23----------
it's a medical problem absolutely but


---------134:25----------
sometimes sort of like


---------134:26----------
people turn it like use that as an


---------134:28----------
excuse which is really bizarre


---------134:30----------
and and i think what we've really got to


---------134:32----------
do is like dig into


---------134:34----------
you know why do people do these kinds of


---------134:36----------
things like how do we understand that


---------134:37----------
and how do we alter that course


---------134:40----------
how do we get these people when they're


---------134:41----------
16 17 18


---------134:43----------
in terms of like role models right


---------134:44----------
because if tk says hey man like don't


---------134:46----------
use that kind of language


---------134:47----------
they'll change like that's one way to do


---------134:49----------
it but i do think that a lot of


---------134:51----------
individual work can go a very long way


---------134:55----------
in terms of of like if you take this


---------134:57----------
person like an incel


---------134:59----------
if you can help them find confidence the


---------135:01----------
in-cell behavior just withers away


---------135:04----------
in-cell behavior and in my experience a


---------135:07----------
lot of toxic


---------135:08----------
behavior is nourished by like negative


---------135:10----------
emotion


---------135:12----------
it's nourished by feelings of like shame


---------135:14----------
like why do they call you


---------135:15----------
thoughts why do they why do they have to


---------135:18----------
refer


---------135:18----------
to women as [ __ ] it's because it like


---------135:21----------
protects them in some way because if i


---------135:23----------
dehumanize this person


---------135:25----------
then like i don't have to feel like


---------135:27----------
judged by that


---------135:29----------
there's a lot of like weird complicated


---------135:31----------
psychology that goes into it but the


---------135:32----------
short answer is yes


---------135:34----------
and i say that with caution because the


---------135:35----------
last thing that i want to do is is you


---------135:37----------
know bombard our coaches with a bunch of


---------135:39----------
would-be sexual predators um but at the


---------135:42----------
same time i think that you know you guys


---------135:44----------
do what y'all are gonna do healthy


---------135:45----------
gamers gonna do what we're gonna do


---------135:47----------
which is we're gonna try to get into the


---------135:49----------
heart of it and talk to people who


---------135:50----------
struggle


---------135:51----------
and try to help them see that there's a


---------135:53----------
different way to go about doing it


---------135:55----------
right that the toxic feelings that you


---------135:57----------
have towards people are ultimately


---------135:59----------
like stem it's my experience that in


---------136:01----------
cells for example it comes from heart


---------136:04----------
like they like got hurt by a woman and


---------136:06----------
then they like rage at them


---------136:08----------
it's like you know and and and like


---------136:11----------
once you unpack that hurt then like the


---------136:13----------
toxicity will go away i'm not excusing


---------136:15----------
the toxicity in any way shape or form


---------136:17----------
i'm just saying that they're you know


---------136:18----------
you can sort of do structural things and


---------136:20----------
then you can also get to the individual


---------136:22----------
person


---------136:23----------
and try to help them understand hey man


---------136:24----------
like sure you're behaving like an


---------136:27----------
[ __ ] and you should stop but i think


---------136:28----------
it's also important to understand


---------136:30----------
why are you behaving like an [ __ ] in


---------136:31----------
the first place like where does that


---------136:32----------
come from


---------136:33----------
because once you understand where the


---------136:34----------
[ __ ] inside you comes from


---------136:37----------
then you can really start to change it


---------136:41----------
spoken like a true clinician


---------136:47----------
well okay i don't know what everyone


---------136:49----------
else is thinking but like


---------136:50----------
i've actually thought about this a lot


---------136:52----------
um


---------136:54----------
obviously having gone through it and


---------136:55----------
like


---------136:57----------
you know i i do want to empathize with


---------136:59----------
the other side as much as possible as


---------137:01----------
possible because


---------137:02----------
you have to be objective like and i do


---------137:04----------
like to think about


---------137:05----------
an individual and like where they came


---------137:08----------
from like the psychology of like why


---------137:09----------
they do things


---------137:11----------
um and like i do agree that


---------137:14----------
we should all be approaching it from the


---------137:16----------
perspective that like you know i'm not


---------137:17----------
going to pretend like there aren't


---------137:19----------
guys out there who are lonely and are


---------137:22----------
hurt and


---------137:22----------
they're taking it out on women you know


---------137:25----------
because they feel hurt by women i'm not


---------137:26----------
going to pretend like women are


---------137:28----------
perfect and have never done anything to


---------137:29----------
hurt men


---------137:31----------
um that all being said though i feel


---------137:34----------
like


---------137:35----------
just with like you coming back to the


---------137:37----------
idea of how at least the internet or


---------137:39----------
just like the world at large


---------137:40----------
is predisposed to give more credence to


---------137:43----------
men like


---------137:44----------
for instance i think the fact that


---------137:47----------
you're even


---------137:48----------
you want to coach these men because you


---------137:50----------
were once in a position


---------137:51----------
like you're saying yourself like them


---------137:53----------
and their mindset and mentality like


---------137:55----------
that that is great and like that that is


---------137:58----------
a measure that needs to be done and it's


---------138:00----------
hard and


---------138:00----------
like the amount of thought that you're


---------138:02----------
putting into it is like admirable


---------138:05----------
but where is the same side and


---------138:08----------
i think that's where i felt so strongly


---------138:10----------
about like and i don't normally like to


---------138:12----------
talk about these things but i felt so


---------138:13----------
strongly i realized i almost have this


---------138:15----------
duty to do this


---------138:16----------
because the same kind of like


---------138:20----------
objective thought isn't put into why


---------138:22----------
women do the things that they did like a


---------138:24----------
lot of times when these stories come out


---------138:26----------
like


---------138:26----------
okay so let's say some guy hurt a


---------138:30----------
girl or or some girl hurt a guy growing


---------138:32----------
up and then the guy just like hates


---------138:34----------
women


---------138:35----------
okay so that's that's a relatable story


---------138:37----------
for a lot of guys on the internet and


---------138:38----------
like predominantly


---------138:39----------
most people like like on reddit for


---------138:41----------
instance are probably they're probably


---------138:43----------
male or i don't go on reddit that much


---------138:44----------
but like it sounds like they're all like


---------138:46----------
males


---------138:47----------
and like they're all gonna agree with


---------138:49----------
each other and empathize with that


---------138:50----------
mindset right


---------138:51----------
and just logistically speaking because


---------138:53----------
there are more males on there


---------138:55----------
any mindset or perspective that's not


---------138:58----------
their mindset


---------138:59----------
is gonna get shunned and i think


---------139:02----------
that's kind of i don't have a problem


---------139:05----------
with like


---------139:06----------
giving credence the idea like oh it


---------139:08----------
needs to we need to


---------139:10----------
speak to predators or like i don't even


---------139:12----------
like using the word predators because


---------139:13----------
again i don't think it's binary either i


---------139:15----------
think that


---------139:16----------
people do things people grow up and turn


---------139:18----------
out to be one way or another for a


---------139:20----------
variety of reasons


---------139:21----------
um and like i do agree that every person


---------139:25----------
has their story and the reason why they


---------139:26----------
do stuff


---------139:28----------
but that being said there is a disparity


---------139:30----------
for


---------139:31----------
how women are viewed and how their


---------139:34----------
outlooks and perspectives


---------139:35----------
are treated and like you can't say


---------139:39----------
that there's the same kind of like um


---------139:44----------
i don't know yeah like there's just


---------139:46----------
there's not the same level of empathy


---------139:48----------
given and i


---------139:48----------
have to say i think it just be it's


---------139:50----------
because the internet is predisposed


---------139:52----------
to mostly just be of like a male mindset


---------139:56----------
um and like i think at least in the case


---------139:59----------
where like


---------140:01----------
like in the smash community and you'll


---------140:02----------
see this at the world at large too like


---------140:04----------
do you think


---------140:05----------
do you think epstein didn't know what he


---------140:06----------
was doing do you think


---------140:09----------
these people like you know you said that


---------140:11----------
oh this person


---------140:12----------
maybe they weren't aware i think that's


---------140:14----------
true for the average person i think


---------140:16----------
that's true for most people


---------140:17----------
like the bell curve for like people who


---------140:19----------
do bad things is like the majority of


---------140:21----------
them like yeah they


---------140:22----------
they're not aware and as soon as you


---------140:24----------
coach them or really teach them


---------140:26----------
um like what what their actions mean


---------140:29----------
they'll get it


---------140:30----------
but there are there are the outliers and


---------140:33----------
these are typically the people who


---------140:35----------
once they get in power they abuse it you


---------140:36----------
know because they're they're waiting in


---------140:38----------
society


---------140:39----------
to finally have their chance to abuse


---------140:41----------
their power and get away with it you


---------140:43----------
know and that's


---------140:44----------
that's kind of what we saw in smash


---------140:46----------
because like i said once they were held


---------140:47----------
accountable


---------140:48----------
they they ran away from it and like i


---------140:51----------
think


---------140:52----------
i think setting the example is also so


---------140:54----------
important because


---------140:56----------
like in the real world a lot of guys get


---------140:58----------
away with stuff just because


---------141:00----------
they they're not they don't they're not


---------141:02----------
penalized for it like who's that one guy


---------141:03----------
that brock dude who like literally like


---------141:06----------
like like turner yeah brock turner he


---------141:09----------
literally like drugged this girl and


---------141:10----------
like raped her and like


---------141:12----------
like he only faced like six months in


---------141:15----------
prison or something crazy whereas


---------141:16----------
there's like people


---------141:18----------
who are like dealing weed or [ __ ] and


---------141:20----------
getting like years in jail it's like


---------141:22----------
that what the disparity is so bad


---------141:24----------
and like that the precedent that that


---------141:26----------
sets is like so


---------141:27----------
horrible and like if we're gonna go in


---------141:30----------
here and be like


---------141:32----------
okay we need to give credence to the


---------141:33----------
idea that like predators aren't


---------141:35----------
predators it's like okay the same thing


---------141:36----------
needs to be said then for like the women


---------141:38----------
and the disenfranchised like people and


---------141:41----------
like that


---------141:41----------
you know everything so i'm not trying to


---------141:43----------
discredit anything that you just said i


---------141:44----------
just think that


---------141:46----------
it needs to be said that there are other


---------141:48----------
perspectives out there and that


---------141:50----------
this disparity is real yeah absolutely


---------141:52----------
like the idea of a perfect victim the


---------141:54----------
fact that the woman had to do x


---------141:56----------
y and z for us to support or believe her


---------141:58----------
like that's what that's what i'm


---------141:59----------
i wish people understood it's like there


---------142:01----------
is no such thing as a perfect victim


---------142:03----------
we should we can empathize and try to


---------142:05----------
change predators but at the same time we


---------142:06----------
can empathize with women who didn't do


---------142:08----------
exactly xyz when they were


---------142:10----------
uh victimized like so so let me just


---------142:14----------
i feel like i want to respond to that is


---------142:16----------
that okay jisoo


---------142:17----------
yep so it's it's a great point right so


---------142:20----------
the first thing that i have to


---------142:21----------
understand is that like when i speak i'm


---------142:23----------
coming from a male


---------142:24----------
perspective which is gonna def by


---------142:26----------
definition have some bias


---------142:29----------
right the second thing


---------142:32----------
is you know you know where i got this


---------142:34----------
idea


---------142:40----------
actually a panel of female gamers


---------142:44----------
so like we started with women so we


---------142:47----------
started actually by like talking to


---------142:49----------
women about what's your experience


---------142:51----------
like being a woman in gaming what's your


---------142:54----------
experience like


---------142:55----------
dealing with toxicity in video games and


---------142:58----------
then we had a second panel


---------143:00----------
before we have yet to have a panel with


---------143:02----------
insults second panel about


---------143:04----------
like women sharing their experiences of


---------143:05----------
like rando dudes falling in love with


---------143:07----------
them over the internet


---------143:08----------
fascinating panel right so i absolutely


---------143:10----------
think that this is a group of people


---------143:12----------
like


---------143:13----------
it's a psychological burden


---------143:16----------
that the average by average i mean male


---------143:19----------
like person on the internet has no idea


---------143:22----------
that you guys just live in a different


---------143:24----------
world where you can't go into a game


---------143:27----------
and just use [ __ ] voice chat because


---------143:29----------
people will send you pictures of their


---------143:31----------
penis afterward


---------143:33----------
it's just a completely different world


---------143:35----------
and so like


---------143:36----------
we had these two panels of women which


---------143:37----------
were mind-blowing to me just to hear


---------143:40----------
what the experiences of these people are


---------143:42----------
like that's what we're dedicated to


---------143:43----------
to ex like like sort of leveling this


---------143:46----------
playing field


---------143:47----------
educating the masses about what it's


---------143:50----------
like to be a minority in gaming


---------143:52----------
and what you guys have to deal with and


---------143:54----------
doing so in a way that hopefully the


---------143:56----------
people aren't watching aren't like who


---------143:57----------
thought you know it's it's like it's a


---------144:00----------
really genuine perspective


---------144:02----------
it's no one's looking for clout or fame


---------144:04----------
or anything you can't even make that


---------144:06----------
argument it's just someone coming on and


---------144:07----------
sharing their experience


---------144:09----------
and the crazy thing is that through


---------144:11----------
those two conversations


---------144:13----------
i was surprised because i asked the


---------144:15----------
women i was like let me ask you


---------144:17----------
i use guys so that also like tk i was i


---------144:20----------
grew up with a particular


---------144:22----------
uh you know vocabulary that could be


---------144:24----------
offensive


---------144:25----------
but i asked i was like what do you guys


---------144:27----------
like it sounds to me like


---------144:29----------
you know there's there's a lot that we


---------144:30----------
don't understand about like what's


---------144:32----------
happening on the other side


---------144:34----------
and and i asked them i was like would


---------144:36----------
you would y'all like to see


---------144:38----------
a panel of the people who do the [ __ ] to


---------144:42----------
you


---------144:42----------
that like the people on the other side


---------144:44----------
of the dm


---------144:45----------
would you guys like to understand what


---------144:47----------
their perspective is i was stunned by


---------144:48----------
their response which was like


---------144:49----------
overwhelmingly yes


---------144:52----------
because i think this this whole dynamic


---------144:53----------
like i think absolutely we just need to


---------144:55----------
look


---------144:56----------
at the whole thing the perspectives and


---------144:58----------
experiences of women


---------145:00----------
being not shared and unknown is half of


---------145:03----------
what propagates the problem


---------145:06----------
because like the people who send you dms


---------145:08----------
they don't conceptualize of you as a


---------145:11----------
human being that's a huge [ __ ]


---------145:12----------
problem


---------145:15----------
right and so like we absolutely need to


---------145:17----------
and this kind of goes back to females


---------145:19----------
versus women we just don't


---------145:20----------
conceptualize y'all as as like humans


---------145:24----------
and as long as that that's the first


---------145:26----------
thing that needs to change


---------145:27----------
is that we're all humans and my sense in


---------145:30----------
my experience has been the more that we


---------145:32----------
start


---------145:32----------
treating people like human beings in


---------145:34----------
general whether you've [ __ ] up or you


---------145:36----------
haven't [ __ ] up whether


---------145:38----------
you're a victim or you the better off


---------145:41----------
we're gonna be


---------145:42----------
and i'm not trying to in any way shape


---------145:44----------
or form excuse the behavior of sexual


---------145:47----------
predators because like i said


---------145:49----------
you know cancer is cancer and like once


---------145:51----------
you get to that point


---------145:53----------
you know that needs to be excised but i


---------145:56----------
think if we really want to if we want to


---------145:57----------
reduce the number of cases


---------145:59----------
that piggy is getting overwhelmed with


---------146:01----------
from 250 to 25


---------146:03----------
we have to stop smoking


---------146:06----------
that's how you really beat cancer and i


---------146:09----------
don't know how much of that analogy


---------146:11----------
applies to this situation i'm not sure


---------146:14----------
right that's where like i i don't know


---------146:16----------
but like when i look at


---------146:18----------
big scale advances an ounce of


---------146:21----------
prevention


---------146:21----------
is worth a pound of cure


---------146:28----------
i mean it sounds to me like what i was


---------146:30----------
part of what i'm hearing is that we want


---------146:32----------
a better nuanced understanding


---------146:34----------
of people who become born predators and


---------146:36----------
a more nuanced understanding of people


---------146:38----------
who are victims


---------146:39----------
uh absolutely because here's starting


---------146:42----------
there because we don't know what it


---------146:43----------
looks like you don't know if you're


---------146:44----------
smoking a cigarette you know in this


---------146:46----------
dimension and we don't know like you


---------146:48----------
know you can't see somebody and say oh


---------146:49----------
they're smoking but the better we


---------146:50----------
understand what


---------146:52----------
a vic you know with nuance and empathy


---------146:54----------
what it's like to be a victim early on


---------146:55----------
and what it's like to become


---------146:57----------
someone with the predatory behavior then


---------146:59----------
the better we can help


---------147:01----------
better people can self-identify does


---------147:03----------
that sound like part of go ahead dr k


---------147:05----------
yeah i mean i was just because i think


---------147:07----------
what we need to understand is like how


---------147:09----------
tk grew up


---------147:11----------
like we absolutely need to understand


---------147:13----------
the perspective of women and victims


---------147:14----------
don't get me wrong and that's why


---------147:16----------
like you know we've spent more time i


---------147:17----------
mean i wasn't even saying any of this


---------147:19----------
until bobby asked the question i think


---------147:21----------
the most important thing for me that


---------147:23----------
come out of this discussion


---------147:24----------
is for young people to be aware of what


---------147:27----------
a predator looks like


---------147:30----------
that's what my emphasis was the one goal


---------147:32----------
that i wanted is like


---------147:33----------
if you're a 16 year old gamer male


---------147:36----------
female whatever


---------147:38----------
what are the signs that you're being


---------147:40----------
manipulated because that's


---------147:41----------
really the most important thing and then


---------147:44----------
in terms of how coaching fits in i think


---------147:46----------
that's sort of the separate issue of


---------147:47----------
like


---------147:48----------
understanding you know how do you grow


---------147:50----------
up


---------147:51----------
like that's what healthy gamer is about


---------147:52----------
we're trying to teach a generation of


---------147:54----------
people like how to grow up


---------147:55----------
like what are the chant what are the


---------147:57----------
challenges that we face


---------147:58----------
and how do we overcome them grow up


---------148:01----------
sounds good


---------148:02----------
but i think my only uh my only like


---------148:07----------
observation from all this has been like


---------148:10----------
basically um i feel the way that a lot


---------148:13----------
of these people get into the position


---------148:14----------
they are the


---------148:15----------
how the predator is born the answer for


---------148:17----------
a lot of them is that like


---------148:19----------
you know in high school or wherever


---------148:20----------
their early years were they weren't


---------148:21----------
popular you know saying like they


---------148:22----------
weren't


---------148:23----------
they didn't get you know uh women's


---------148:25----------
attention


---------148:26----------
they didn't have girlfriends whatever so


---------148:29----------
then they end up getting popular


---------148:30----------
in this realm and it's like a new start


---------148:33----------
for them you know i'm saying like


---------148:34----------
they they were never like those big


---------148:37----------
streamers who end up having like


---------148:38----------
allegations with most women because like


---------148:39----------
now they're getting attention


---------148:41----------
from women those you know the big um


---------148:44----------
the big name top players commentators


---------148:47----------
who


---------148:48----------
are like you know also getting um


---------148:52----------
issues against them from multiple women


---------148:54----------
because i feel like in their earlier


---------148:55----------
days they're like


---------148:56----------
they were nothing they weren't [ __ ] you


---------148:58----------
know what i'm saying and now they're


---------148:59----------
trying to like make up for it


---------149:01----------
and in this time or they don't know what


---------149:03----------
to do with this


---------149:04----------
power if you will uh and it gets to


---------149:06----------
their head


---------149:07----------
and i think like that's not an issue


---------149:10----------
that


---------149:11----------
we can fix after it's already happened


---------149:13----------
that's the issue that they have to


---------149:15----------
go about wanting to fix i've had this


---------149:17----------
conversation with


---------149:19----------
um like i don't want to use names but i


---------149:22----------
had this conversation with a fellow


---------149:23----------
commentator


---------149:24----------
who i felt like you know as i started to


---------149:26----------
grow up and


---------149:27----------
get less about chasing skirts and more


---------149:29----------
about like you know just


---------149:30----------
being i guess an adult or whatever or


---------149:32----------
trying to like settle down or whatever


---------149:33----------
he didn't and he was older than me and i


---------149:35----------
was like do you not notice that like


---------149:37----------
this may be an issue


---------149:38----------
because like i'm now 31 and you're


---------149:41----------
you know you're you're two three years


---------149:43----------
older than me and you're still like


---------149:44----------
acting like we're 25 26


---------149:46----------
or not even then more like 23


---------149:49----------
uh so you know i think that that


---------149:53----------
one thing that changed comes from you


---------149:55----------
but


---------149:57----------
uh if you're only changing because


---------149:58----------
someone else is pointed out to you and


---------150:00----------
you're


---------150:00----------
changing because like oh i need to


---------150:02----------
change to appear like i'm better


---------150:04----------
then you're not really changing again


---------150:05----------
like that's more so just you know


---------150:07----------
a wolf of sheep's clothing type deal i


---------150:09----------
think genuinely wanting to change


---------150:11----------
because you realizing


---------150:12----------
the error of your ways uh ends up coming


---------150:15----------
down to the person i


---------150:16----------
just don't know how to get them to reach


---------150:17----------
that you know if they don't reach it on


---------150:19----------
them on themselves i don't know how to


---------150:21----------
like egg someone on to be like yo bro


---------150:22----------
like


---------150:23----------
this is an issue and i think this is


---------150:25----------
something that you should address


---------150:28----------
yeah i mean i think tk that's a great


---------150:30----------
point and i'll i'll give you guys the


---------150:32----------
last word in a second but i think that's


---------150:33----------
exactly why


---------150:34----------
like when people come on and share their


---------150:37----------
stories


---------150:39----------
it's really easy to think that you're


---------150:40----------
not doing anything wrong if the person


---------150:42----------
on the other side of the table


---------150:44----------
isn't a real human being


---------150:48----------
right and like that's the toxicity of


---------150:50----------
the internet


---------150:52----------
right it's like does it like


---------150:56----------
they're females that's the basicity of


---------150:59----------
human


---------151:00----------
social thought sure um we use heuristics


---------151:03----------
to judge things


---------151:05----------
because it's easier and it can protect


---------151:07----------
us but in the end that those heuristics


---------151:09----------
can also


---------151:10----------
cause enormous pain and harm and that's


---------151:13----------
why i think like like


---------151:14----------
i think it's awesome that women are


---------151:15----------
coming forward because like we need to


---------151:17----------
hear your perspective like you need to


---------151:19----------
stop like you know i think it's really


---------151:21----------
powerful when


---------151:24----------
when we when we see an individual as a


---------151:27----------
person


---------151:28----------
it starts to break down


---------151:31----------
like the conceptions like when you start


---------151:34----------
to see the shades of grey and stuff like


---------151:36----------
that and that's why i really appreciate


---------151:37----------
like


---------151:38----------
piggy and juicy sharing their stories


---------151:40----------
because i think in this moment


---------151:41----------
you know for people who are watching


---------151:43----------
it's hard to just


---------151:44----------
call you like a female because like


---------151:47----------
you're a human being with a full array


---------151:49----------
of like thoughts and emotions


---------151:51----------
and feelings and experiences and and the


---------151:54----------
more


---------151:55----------
human you are and the more you share


---------151:57----------
that experience i think that's


---------151:58----------
ultimately what causes people to learn


---------152:00----------
so thank you guys all for coming on


---------152:02----------
share and share but i don't think it


---------152:03----------
should be a requirement for us to air


---------152:05----------
our trauma


---------152:06----------
just to be seen as people right


---------152:10----------
yeah so so i don't think you have to


---------152:12----------
share your trauma


---------152:14----------
but i think when we any kind of


---------152:16----------
authentic sharing it just happens to be


---------152:17----------
that we're talking about a traumatic


---------152:19----------
experience today


---------152:20----------
but i think any time you're right i


---------152:22----------
don't think you should air your trauma


---------152:23----------
to be seen as a human being


---------152:26----------
but i think part of part of what we do


---------152:27----------
as an organization is we


---------152:29----------
take the parts that have not been shared


---------152:31----------
in the past and we try to bring them to


---------152:33----------
life


---------152:33----------
because i think personally that's where


---------152:35----------
a lot of growth is that's how we try to


---------152:36----------
fight stigma


---------152:39----------
that it's okay like if you're a victim


---------152:41----------
you're not


---------152:42----------
a less normal human being you're a


---------152:44----------
valuable human being


---------152:46----------
you know you should be treated with


---------152:48----------
respect that your trauma and


---------152:50----------
and this is where you're right that you


---------152:51----------
shouldn't need to share trauma to become


---------152:53----------
a person


---------152:54----------
in my experience part of the reason that


---------152:56----------
we try to share trauma is because some


---------152:58----------
people this is really sad but


---------152:59----------
some people who experience trauma don't


---------153:01----------
feel like a human being


---------153:05----------
and and when when you share it when you


---------153:08----------
bring it out into the open


---------153:09----------
it like has less power over you


---------153:12----------
and i think what we saw today like even


---------153:14----------
listening to hugs right like so


---------153:16----------
i mean here's his experience of being


---------153:18----------
betrayed by a friend


---------153:20----------
and like that's i think what gets people


---------153:22----------
to like look at themselves


---------153:24----------
and it comes back to tk's question of


---------153:26----------
you have to want to change from the


---------153:27----------
inside


---------153:28----------
in my experience when you show yourself


---------153:30----------
when you authentically represent


---------153:32----------
yourself


---------153:32----------
to the rest of the world that's what


---------153:34----------
prompts change


---------153:38----------
but yeah it's it's with you guys anyway


---------153:41----------
closing thoughts


---------153:44----------
um i've been you know i've been kind of


---------153:47----------
mulling over what


---------153:49----------
like we can do because i mean this is


---------153:51----------
this is one of many issues i feel like


---------153:53----------
the smash community has that are now


---------153:54----------
coming up


---------153:55----------
to light i think that uh


---------153:58----------
it's a good one to start with but


---------153:59----------
there's so much we have to tackle that i


---------154:01----------
feel like it's it's


---------154:02----------
almost an impossible hill to climb you


---------154:03----------
know like there's


---------154:05----------
it goes further than just like uh the


---------154:08----------
sexual assault in


---------154:09----------
rape and and sexual misconduct just in


---------154:12----------
general


---------154:13----------
but it goes as far as to just general


---------154:15----------
like bullying


---------154:16----------
of people in in online in chats all the


---------154:19----------
time just


---------154:20----------
just people uh dehumanizing i feel like


---------154:23----------
the people that they are supposed to


---------154:25----------
love uh


---------154:26----------
because they're locked behind computer


---------154:28----------
screens and stuff like that there's like


---------154:29----------
there's so many


---------154:30----------
interesting uh dynamics that need to be


---------154:33----------
fixed


---------154:34----------
uh within the spanish community i don't


---------154:36----------
know like how we could do it but i know


---------154:38----------
that my first step


---------154:39----------
is to believe that like we can promote


---------154:42----------
change by being


---------154:44----------
said and changed by by following


---------154:47----------
by practicing what we preach by


---------154:48----------
following our own set of uh


---------154:51----------
you know code of conducts i guess that


---------154:53----------
are


---------154:54----------
morally sound and things like that the


---------154:57----------
i feel like in in smash community like


---------155:00----------
the celebrity


---------155:01----------
of things is like really like this is a


---------155:04----------
very like celebrity type community like


---------155:06----------
where people are like


---------155:08----------
huge followers of top players top


---------155:10----------
commentators and things like that


---------155:12----------
i don't really see that happen uh too


---------155:13----------
often in other uh fighting games or just


---------155:16----------
in games in general outside of like


---------155:17----------
maybe like league and like


---------155:19----------
overwatch because they're like backed by


---------155:20----------
the big companies but for a grassroot


---------155:22----------
game


---------155:23----------
to have a multiple people over 100 uh k


---------155:26----------
followers and stuff


---------155:27----------
is actually crazy to me so uh with


---------155:30----------
those big followings i feel like being


---------155:33----------
like showing


---------155:34----------
leading by example and showing that like


---------155:37----------
uh


---------155:38----------
you have changed behavior that you do


---------155:39----------
not accept in cell type behavior


---------155:42----------
uh is a great thing and that's one big


---------155:45----------
avenue


---------155:46----------
in a way that we can push for change in


---------155:48----------
the future in my opinion


---------155:51----------
and for me if something i've been


---------155:52----------
thinking about a lot is like what is


---------155:54----------
what are we explicitly preaching


---------155:55----------
you know tk because like i want to


---------155:57----------
believe too that we can model


---------155:59----------
uh this good behavior and that that'll


---------156:01----------
catch fire and that things can get a lot


---------156:03----------
better


---------156:04----------
uh and the more i think about it the


---------156:06----------
more i think that


---------156:08----------
for me what i want to preach and what i


---------156:10----------
want to practice is that anybody who


---------156:11----------
cares about the game


---------156:12----------
is you know i'll define them as a member


---------156:14----------
of the community in some capacity


---------156:16----------
and for me i feel that people who like


---------156:19----------
don't hurt other people in the community


---------156:21----------
people who


---------156:22----------
care about other people having being


---------156:24----------
safe like that's kind of the bar


---------156:25----------
we need to uh hold ourselves each and


---------156:29----------
every one of us accountable to


---------156:30----------
that's like in my mind if we can all


---------156:32----------
feel accountable for


---------156:34----------
other community members having like you


---------156:36----------
know not being in danger basically


---------156:38----------
then a lot can change but as long as we


---------156:41----------
don't feel responsible for that you know


---------156:42----------
or that there's discussion about


---------156:44----------
like that's kind of what i would love to


---------156:45----------
pull out by the root kind of ask people


---------156:47----------
if


---------156:49----------
if they care about other people having


---------156:51----------
uh being able to play melee safely


---------156:54----------
because for me i've never heard anybody


---------156:56----------
say that they don't care about that


---------156:58----------
i don't think anybody can say that with


---------156:59----------
a straight face that like oh no i don't


---------157:01----------
give a [ __ ] about other people playing


---------157:02----------
the game safely like that's not on me


---------157:05----------
right i feel like


---------157:09----------
just like i don't want to like


---------157:12----------
derail things too hard but i'm like


---------157:14----------
reading the chat and just like you know


---------157:16----------
everyone


---------157:16----------
brings up really good points like oh


---------157:18----------
this is just a worldwide issue or this


---------157:21----------
has a lot to do with like


---------157:23----------
um you know just general sexism or like


---------157:26----------
uh


---------157:26----------
abuse in general and just other other


---------157:29----------
psychological things


---------157:31----------
and like i think all those points are


---------157:32----------
really true which is why it's really


---------157:34----------
hard to have panels like these and talk


---------157:36----------
about it in a really


---------157:37----------
direct uh concise way because it is


---------157:41----------
nuanced like i'm not


---------157:42----------
like you know like dr k said


---------157:45----------
guys do grow up with a different


---------157:46----------
perspective and especially if you


---------157:49----------
grow up being an outcast in a certain


---------157:51----------
way that comes with its own problems


---------157:52----------
that like i


---------157:53----------
probably will never be able to


---------157:54----------
understand but like i think


---------157:57----------
real change comes from you take when


---------157:59----------
people in like their smaller communities


---------158:01----------
do what they can in their smaller pools


---------158:03----------
and attack issues one by one


---------158:05----------
because you can't attack everything in


---------158:07----------
the world all at once like i can't


---------158:08----------
attack how


---------158:09----------
disenfranchised people get like jailed


---------158:12----------
for unreasonable amounts of time like


---------158:13----------
that's not


---------158:14----------
my battle to fight probably and there


---------158:16----------
are there already are people fighting


---------158:18----------
for it


---------158:18----------
and like i know that what i can do is


---------158:22----------
help other women or victims or people


---------158:25----------
who have gone through the things that i


---------158:26----------
identify with personally because


---------158:28----------
i know what it's like to go through that


---------158:29----------
and i can help them best with something


---------158:31----------
that i know


---------158:32----------
and i think that goes for anybody else


---------158:34----------
in the chat or people who are viewing


---------158:35----------
like if you're watching this you're like


---------158:36----------
what can i do


---------158:37----------
and like you know i know all these other


---------158:40----------
factors go into it but how do we like


---------158:41----------
attack these things like one by one and


---------158:43----------
it's like it is a one by one process and


---------158:45----------
it just starts with like


---------158:46----------
one thing that you're passionate about


---------158:48----------
um and i think i think


---------158:50----------
to me that's like the biggest giveaway


---------158:52----------
or takeaway i'd want to


---------158:53----------
speak out to everybody


---------158:58----------
yeah she finds you so some time ago we


---------159:01----------
started a special section of our discord


---------159:03----------
for women


---------159:04----------
just because you know they do have a


---------159:05----------
different experience and even on our


---------159:07----------
discord they were getting


---------159:09----------
harassed and stuff and then you know


---------159:12----------
we got a lot of criticism for that


---------159:13----------
because a lot of people were like


---------159:14----------
where's the men's space


---------159:16----------
there's a women's space where's the


---------159:17----------
men's space and and now


---------159:19----------
everywhere and now now i have the answer


---------159:23----------
which is sorry guys


---------159:24----------
i'm a sipcock see ya


---------159:27----------
i think it's a very powerful answer


---------159:29----------
let's chat


---------159:33----------
anyways okay


---------159:37----------
sorry bobby you were like saying


---------159:38----------
something i i like don't know if i


---------159:39----------
interrupted that


---------159:40----------
no no you didn't that was my last word


---------159:42----------
was just that like if we


---------159:44----------
if we can believe that we want to create


---------159:47----------
a space where people can


---------159:48----------
play the game without being harassed


---------159:51----------
that's a low bar


---------159:53----------
and then i think that i think we could


---------159:54----------
do a much better job if we


---------159:56----------
say that we want to hold it up because


---------159:58----------
tk mentioned this earlier right


---------159:59----------
you can't take responsibility for


---------160:01----------
changing another person i can't go in


---------160:03----------
anybody else's


---------160:04----------
being and change them but we can't we


---------160:07----------
can do more than nothing


---------160:09----------
and i think for each of us if we know


---------160:11----------
where that line is which is


---------160:14----------
i hope that we can like have real homie


---------160:16----------
talks with people who are


---------160:17----------
looking like they're in a bad spot and


---------160:19----------
that we can stop


---------160:21----------
you know bad things from being born into


---------160:22----------
the world in the first place and that


---------160:23----------
would be great but


---------160:25----------
yeah i guess like having our eyes open


---------160:26----------
and knowing that we're trying to help


---------160:28----------
make the space


---------160:29----------
safe for everybody that would be really


---------160:32----------
good


---------160:35----------
that was all that i had to say and also


---------160:37----------
thanks dr k for having us here and


---------160:38----------
thanks to everybody


---------160:39----------
thank you guys for of course the


---------160:41----------
everybody else here i guess


---------160:43----------
my last thought would be uh that i


---------160:45----------
really


---------160:47----------
do hope that the smash community bounces


---------160:49----------
back


---------160:50----------
and learns from everything that has


---------160:51----------
happened i think i'm i'm hopeful and i


---------160:53----------
think that we will


---------160:54----------
at least be going in a much better


---------160:56----------
direction from here on out


---------160:58----------
and also thanks to everyone here for


---------161:01----------
everything that you do


---------161:02----------
uh using your influence to


---------161:06----------
force change or help towards change


---------161:08----------
especially


---------161:09----------
you piggy we've talked about a lot of


---------161:11----------
this stuff and you


---------161:12----------
do a crazy amount of work that i think


---------161:15----------
goes under appreciated so i will always


---------161:17----------
have your back


---------161:18----------
and i will make sure that people uh put


---------161:20----------
some respect on your name and all the


---------161:22----------
work that you do so


---------161:23----------
really appreciate what you're doing


---------161:26----------
don't make me cry on stream


---------161:31----------
my closing thoughts are please get


---------161:34----------
involved with your local scenes


---------161:36----------
please um uh ask your tos about


---------161:39----------
bands um or or help organize or


---------161:42----------
something


---------161:43----------
um if you've lost hope i understand


---------161:47----------
uh and you are not required to stay in


---------161:50----------
smash


---------161:50----------
but if you are please


---------161:54----------
it matters what you do and say i think


---------161:56----------
that's another takeaway message of all


---------161:57----------
this


---------161:58----------
um and use what you've got whether it's


---------162:01----------
cloud


---------162:02----------
quote or or just energy and time or


---------162:04----------
passion


---------162:05----------
uh or or personal experience


---------162:08----------
oh also wait i i know okay people are


---------162:11----------
viewing the smash community like we're


---------162:13----------
like


---------162:13----------
a bunch of like freaks after this


---------162:15----------
understandably so


---------162:17----------
all right there's a lot of cool people


---------162:19----------

---------162:21----------

---------162:23----------
of the like


---------162:25----------
five people here dr k if you roll


---------162:27----------
