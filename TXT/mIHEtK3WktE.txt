---------00:00----------
so how you been man um i've been doing


---------00:03----------
okay


---------00:03----------
still right yeah


---------00:07----------
um and you wanted to you'd ask me a


---------00:11----------
question on the scop podcast which i i


---------00:12----------
don't know if i answered coherently


---------00:15----------
oh yeah it's an interesting question of


---------00:17----------
um you said you had lots of questions


---------00:20----------
um yeah [ __ ] you guys were talking about


---------00:23----------
wait am i am i allowed to say [ __ ] you


---------00:26----------
i guess so i don't know okay well i'm


---------00:28----------
just because you've been doing this


---------00:29----------
longer than i have


---------00:30----------
yeah sure but i don't know if you have


---------00:31----------
different rules for your stream right


---------00:34----------
i don't know what the rules of my stream


---------00:36----------
i imagine you have some rules for your


---------00:38----------
stream right


---------00:39----------
i say [ __ ] okay gotcha all right we're


---------00:41----------
good to say [ __ ]


---------00:42----------
um it's always been a really interesting


---------00:44----------
question to me the um the difference


---------00:46----------
between like


---------00:47----------
respecting a person's autonomy um versus


---------00:51----------
uh superseding their autonomy for what


---------00:54----------
you perceive to be their benefit


---------00:56----------
um that question is yeah is a really


---------00:59----------
hard one i feel


---------01:00----------
um so in the case where if you have


---------01:03----------
somebody that you know is suicidal


---------01:05----------
um and has the means and the desire to


---------01:07----------
you know


---------01:08----------
commit suicide um what kind of state of


---------01:12----------
mind do they have to be in for you


---------01:14----------
to respect their decision is basically


---------01:17----------
the


---------01:18----------
a question that i've kind of wrestled


---------01:19----------
with a lot


---------01:21----------
so when you say you do you mean me


---------01:24----------
or do you mean a person


---------01:28----------
when i say you for a person who is


---------01:30----------
suicidal or person who is considering


---------01:32----------
stopping somebody from committing


---------01:33----------
suicide yeah so if the person is


---------01:35----------
considering stopping someone


---------01:37----------
who is the you like a general person or


---------01:39----------
me


---------01:40----------
uh well i mean i guess it i mean at one


---------01:43----------
point in my life it was me


---------01:44----------
um it could be anybody um i imagine for


---------01:47----------
you it's probably a bit different


---------01:49----------
it is if you're working in the capacity


---------01:50----------
of a therapist you have an obligation


---------01:52----------
to contact somebody yeah obviously so um


---------01:55----------
yeah it's more just kind of like a a


---------01:56----------
question of philosophy in general not


---------01:58----------
necessarily an occupational question


---------02:00----------
yeah so i think the the main thing that


---------02:01----------
i look at is what


---------02:03----------
whether they have so if we think about


---------02:05----------
consent and choice


---------02:07----------
yeah so you know when does a doctor so


---------02:10----------
we're going to talk about doctors for a


---------02:11----------
second and then we can


---------02:12----------
expand when does a doctor have the right


---------02:16----------
to overcome someone's choice


---------02:20----------
and generally speaking we have the right


---------02:22----------
when that person


---------02:23----------
when we didn't deem their consciousness


---------02:27----------
or their decision-making capacity to be


---------02:30----------
impaired


---------02:31----------
yeah and and so you know what i do


---------02:34----------
in terms of like you know if someone's


---------02:35----------
depressed like they'll make statements


---------02:38----------
that


---------02:40----------
really suggest that they're impaired so


---------02:41----------
if someone says the world would be


---------02:43----------
better off without me


---------02:44----------
and you know generally speaking i mean i


---------02:46----------
imagine that that can be true


---------02:48----------
in some cases but generally speaking


---------02:51----------
most people


---------02:52----------
will you know their family members don't


---------02:55----------
actually want to see them die


---------02:57----------
or their friends and so that suggests to


---------03:00----------
me that their


---------03:01----------
their cognitive process is impaired at


---------03:03----------
some point


---------03:04----------
so you know if they have the capacity to


---------03:07----------
make


---------03:08----------
good decisions and that can be impaired


---------03:10----------
by mental illness


---------03:12----------
so that's one piece thoughts


---------03:16----------
um so there's an interesting catch-22


---------03:18----------
that's kind of brought up here


---------03:19----------
where um some people look at things


---------03:23----------
like um medically assisted suicide


---------03:26----------
and some people will say hey you know


---------03:29----------
we ought to have the ability to end our


---------03:31----------
lives should we choose to


---------03:32----------
um now for some people this is just a


---------03:34----------
question of like end-of-life stuff so


---------03:36----------
for instance if you're dying of a


---------03:37----------
terminal disease should you be able to


---------03:38----------
but for other people you know they say


---------03:40----------
well if you're in your 20s or 30s if


---------03:41----------
you're suffering or combating mental


---------03:43----------
illness you should have the ability to


---------03:44----------
you know end your life if you choose to


---------03:46----------
um some people would say that the


---------03:48----------
criteria


---------03:50----------
for determining whether or not you're of


---------03:52----------
sound mind will always preclude somebody


---------03:54----------
from committing suicide though


---------03:55----------
so for instance yeah so how do you is is


---------03:58----------
so the question is like well if somebody


---------04:00----------
feels suicidal i think for a person of


---------04:02----------
healthy mind you would say well there


---------04:03----------
must be some


---------04:04----------
sort of like cognitive impairment there


---------04:06----------
which would then make it so that nobody


---------04:08----------
could essentially ever


---------04:09----------
commit suicide not that i'm advocating


---------04:10----------
for it it sounds like i am sorry but


---------04:12----------
yeah so how do you deal with that um


---------04:14----------
catch 22 is there ever


---------04:15----------
a spot where somebody could be of sound


---------04:17----------
mind or they're not suffering from a


---------04:18----------
terminal disease


---------04:19----------
and they want to commit suicide i guess


---------04:22----------
so i'm going to say something once again


---------04:23----------
which i think we have to be careful i'm


---------04:24----------
not advocating for suicide yeah of


---------04:26----------
course yeah yeah sorry this conversation


---------04:27----------
is really weird to have published


---------04:28----------
yep no no it's a good conversa i think


---------04:30----------
it's an important conversation so i'll


---------04:31----------
say something that i think


---------04:33----------
may be a little bit shocking i'd say


---------04:34----------
half of the people that i've worked with


---------04:36----------
that are suicidal are not suicidal due


---------04:38----------
to a mental illness


---------04:40----------
so we have a big mental illness you said


---------04:44----------
not due to mcdonald's no so this is this


---------04:46----------
is a really interesting


---------04:47----------
assumption that has started to happen in


---------04:49----------
our society


---------04:51----------
so suicidality is a symptom


---------04:54----------
right other mental illness so it's a


---------04:56----------
sign like if you're bipolar


---------04:58----------
or you have trauma or you're depressed


---------05:00----------
you can be suicidal


---------05:02----------
but you can also have none of those


---------05:04----------
things and be suicidal


---------05:06----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------05:07----------
suicidality is not exclusive


---------05:10----------
to mental illness so if you look at like


---------05:12----------
for example japanese culture


---------05:14----------
or you know even like suicide bombers


---------05:16----------
like i mean you can make an argument


---------05:17----------
about whether they're mentally ill or


---------05:19----------
not


---------05:19----------
but there there's you know there's


---------05:22----------
evidence culturally that


---------05:24----------
people have motives for suicide that are


---------05:26----------
not due to mental illness


---------05:27----------
and the most shocking thing that i've


---------05:30----------
encountered is actually working with


---------05:31----------
people who are suicidal and they're not


---------05:33----------
actually like cognitively impaired so


---------05:36----------
they may


---------05:37----------
sound like they're depressed but they


---------05:38----------
genuinely like look at a life


---------05:40----------
where they don't see a way forward


---------05:44----------
and so they just want to tap out and if


---------05:46----------
you really like assess them in terms of


---------05:48----------
of depression


---------05:50----------
you know they don't meet the dsm


---------05:52----------
criteria


---------05:53----------
oh maybe i maybe i just


---------05:56----------
i see a lot of people can move to sub


---------05:59----------
mode but


---------06:01----------
maybe i said something that's not really


---------06:02----------
good but um


---------06:05----------
you know that there are people who uh


---------06:08----------
i've talked to and it's scary so like


---------06:09----------
they're my patients but i wouldn't


---------06:11----------
diagnose them with like clinical


---------06:12----------
depression


---------06:13----------
so there are certain criteria of


---------06:15----------
clinical depression which they don't


---------06:16----------
meet i still think that they shouldn't


---------06:17----------
kill themselves


---------06:19----------
um and i i work with them to work on


---------06:22----------
their suicidal so that they're no longer


---------06:24----------
suicidal and i tend to be generally


---------06:25----------
successful with that


---------06:28----------
but i do think that it's possible to be


---------06:29----------
suicidal and not have mental illness


---------06:32----------
and then coming to your catch-22 so i


---------06:34----------
think the issue there is do you assume


---------06:37----------
that suicidality comes from mental


---------06:39----------
illness because if you don't assume that


---------06:41----------
then the catch-22 goes away right


---------06:45----------
um the argument that i'm the argument


---------06:48----------
that i'm hearing is that suicidality


---------06:50----------
is evidence of mental illness therefore


---------06:52----------
it's a catch-22 and no one can


---------06:53----------
kill themselves yeah i'm sorry i'm


---------06:55----------
trying to be very careful my words i


---------06:56----------
wouldn't say necessarily meant


---------06:57----------
um i wouldn't necessarily say evidence


---------06:59----------
of mental illness i would say evidence


---------07:01----------
of well people would say evidence of


---------07:02----------
mental impairment


---------07:04----------
um so for instance when you say somebody


---------07:06----------
could not be mentally ill


---------07:07----------
but still could be suicidal like i'm


---------07:09----------
curious because i could read that in two


---------07:11----------
ways


---------07:12----------
um one i could read is that if you're


---------07:13----------
not mentally ill and you're suicidal


---------07:15----------
then on either one hand then you are


---------07:17----------
perfectly within your rights to feel


---------07:19----------
suicidal like it seems like you're not


---------07:20----------
mentally impaired so you have all the


---------07:22----------
tools available to you to make that


---------07:23----------
decision


---------07:24----------
but then on the second hand i could say


---------07:26----------
like well you're not mentally ill and


---------07:27----------
you're still suicidal that seems


---------07:28----------
incredibly irrational


---------07:30----------
um like there's no reason for this at


---------07:32----------
all um which way do you lean then on


---------07:33----------
that are you leaning more towards the


---------07:34----------
former than the latter or


---------07:36----------
i'm sorry can you say that again so like


---------07:38----------
if somebody doesn't have a mental


---------07:39----------
illness and they're suicidal


---------07:41----------
would you assume then that that decision


---------07:42----------
is very reasonable because they don't


---------07:44----------
have a mental illness and they're


---------07:45----------
able to think through it or would you


---------07:46----------
assume that it's very unreasonable


---------07:47----------
because you're not even mentally ill yet


---------07:49----------
you still feel suicidal


---------07:52----------
i don't like the word reasonable so i


---------07:54----------
i'd say that


---------07:56----------
i can i'd say it's understandable right


---------07:58----------
so i don't think that people should kill


---------08:00----------
themselves


---------08:00----------
but i think starting off with the


---------08:03----------
presumption


---------08:04----------
that you the reason you want to kill


---------08:07----------
yourself


---------08:07----------
is because you're impaired is an


---------08:10----------
incredibly


---------08:11----------
invalidating approach sure right it


---------08:14----------
discounts their entire perspective


---------08:17----------
if we say oh you're suicidal because


---------08:20----------
your brain is busted


---------08:22----------
there's something wrong with you that


---------08:24----------
just completely invalidates any actual


---------08:26----------
concerns


---------08:27----------
they have about the world so i don't


---------08:31----------
think that that's actually healthy so i


---------08:32----------
think it's


---------08:33----------
in a sense it's reasonable and that's


---------08:36----------
how you get it to change right like you


---------08:38----------
meet them kind of where they're at if


---------08:39----------
someone says


---------08:40----------
i'm 35 years old i've never been on a


---------08:41----------
date with a girl that i'm going to be


---------08:42----------
alone for the rest of my life i want to


---------08:44----------
kill myself


---------08:45----------
like it's reasonable i think for them to


---------08:48----------
feel that way and


---------08:49----------
also i don't think they should do that


---------08:51----------
and that's what you have to work on


---------08:52----------
because the cool thing is as you talk to


---------08:54----------
someone


---------08:55----------
about their reasons for suicidality you


---------08:58----------
then begin to see the path


---------09:00----------
of how to make them not suicidal because


---------09:02----------
if this person if what they want is like


---------09:04----------
companionship in life like that's what


---------09:05----------
you should work on


---------09:07----------
yeah i i agree with you there the the


---------09:09----------
only worry then is that um


---------09:12----------
how reflective can you be without like


---------09:14----------
um


---------09:16----------
without i don't say without pushing them


---------09:17----------
towards it but like say a person it


---------09:19----------
feels somewhat suicidal


---------09:20----------
um they express those concerns too and


---------09:22----------
they give the reasons why


---------09:23----------
you're understanding and reflective of


---------09:25----------
the language they use and then they feel


---------09:26----------
like they've gotten affirmation in that


---------09:28----------
and then they commit suicide


---------09:29----------
because they feel like their feelings


---------09:30----------
have been validated is that a worry ever


---------09:32----------
or


---------09:32----------
so the data actually suggests that


---------09:34----------
talking to people and validating their


---------09:36----------
feelings of suicide does not increase


---------09:38----------
suicidal behavior


---------09:40----------
so that's a big concern that people have


---------09:42----------
right is that you don't talk about it


---------09:43----------
and if you talk about it you validate


---------09:45----------
them they're more likely to do it


---------09:46----------
whereas


---------09:47----------
in my experience it's been the exact


---------09:48----------
opposite so what happens when you


---------09:50----------
validate their experience


---------09:51----------
is then like at least one person


---------09:53----------
understands them and then if i


---------09:55----------
understand them and then i say


---------09:57----------
hey like maybe you shouldn't do this yet


---------09:59----------
like can we work on this for a little


---------10:00----------
while


---------10:02----------
the response that i get overwhelming is


---------10:04----------
like yeah okay fine


---------10:07----------
so i actually find that you know in


---------10:09----------
validating someone's


---------10:11----------
suicidal feelings and understanding the


---------10:13----------
depth of their despair


---------10:14----------
is the first step in like helping them


---------10:18----------
change their life


---------10:21----------
because if you say like yeah your


---------10:22----------
complaints


---------10:24----------
are dumb then like how are you gonna


---------10:26----------
change your life


---------10:29----------
gotcha okay interesting


---------10:33----------
does that resolve your catch 22 or no


---------10:37----------
um well so


---------10:40----------
my original catch 22 was that it felt it


---------10:42----------
feels like


---------10:43----------
um being suicidal in and of itself


---------10:46----------
can be evidence of some sort of


---------10:49----------
impairment


---------10:51----------
your response is that that's not


---------10:53----------
necessarily true that you can still


---------10:54----------
approach a person who is suicidal you


---------10:57----------
can be


---------10:57----------
reflected with your language you can


---------10:58----------
have a conversation with them


---------11:01----------
what do you do so i guess chasing that


---------11:03----------
down a little bit more what do you do if


---------11:04----------
you are reflective


---------11:06----------
you do have those conversations but


---------11:07----------
they're still pretty set on


---------11:09----------
on committing suicide in a


---------11:10----------
non-professional role what do you think


---------11:12----------
you have an extra legal obligation there


---------11:14----------
or


---------11:15----------
extra moral obligation there to


---------11:16----------
intervene or what


---------11:18----------
yeah i think you do have a moral


---------11:21----------
obligation to intervene because i don't


---------11:23----------
know


---------11:24----------
that the average person is able to


---------11:27----------
assess


---------11:28----------
for capacity right so we're


---------11:31----------
professionally trained in assessing


---------11:33----------
someone's


---------11:35----------
capacity to make decisions and when


---------11:37----------
someone's thinking is impaired and when


---------11:39----------
someone's thinking is not impaired


---------11:40----------
i don't know that the average person


---------11:42----------
knows how to do that


---------11:44----------
so like i think because you're not


---------11:46----------
professionally trained


---------11:48----------
it's something that if someone is about


---------11:50----------
to kill themselves i think you're


---------11:51----------
morally obligated to try to intervene


---------11:53----------
and at least get them evaluated by


---------11:55----------
someone


---------11:56----------
who is who knows how to evaluate suicide


---------12:03----------
gotcha okay right and the other way to


---------12:06----------
think about it is like this may be


---------12:09----------
it may be incorrect at times but


---------12:12----------
like let me put it to you this way if


---------12:15----------
you're walking down the street and you


---------12:16----------
see someone drowning in a lake


---------12:19----------
do you think you should try to help them


---------12:22----------
um in that case yeah for sure right but


---------12:24----------
what if they


---------12:26----------
are drowning as part of a suicide


---------12:27----------
attempt


---------12:29----------
um i mean i'm assuming you don't have


---------12:30----------
access to that information right


---------12:32----------
exactly so since you don't have access


---------12:35----------
to the


---------12:35----------
information of their impairment of mind


---------12:38----------
you err on the side of saving the life


---------12:40----------
[Music]


---------12:42----------
and if you do have like a more intimate


---------12:43----------
relationship with the person what then


---------12:45----------
do you still err on the side of they


---------12:47----------
need to be they need to at least get one


---------12:48----------
consultation with a professional first


---------12:50----------
or absolutely


---------12:53----------
right so like the fact that you're


---------12:55----------
intimate with them may in turn


---------12:56----------
impair your judgment objectively


---------13:00----------
and so to have have them get an


---------13:02----------
evaluation by a professional i think is


---------13:04----------
absolutely a good idea


---------13:06----------
gotcha what do you think um


---------13:11----------
yeah maybe yeah i'll think about it you


---------13:13----------
for usually for big topics like this i


---------13:14----------
usually sleep on it a few days and then


---------13:16----------
i


---------13:16----------
have like a better opinion of it but


---------13:17----------
yeah it's stuff to think about yeah


---------13:24----------
it sounded like you had a lot of


---------13:25----------
questions is that


---------13:28----------
um oh well i mean not well not like


---------13:30----------
hours were the questions actually i'm


---------13:31----------
just really curious what you're


---------13:32----------
what you're thinking what's down this


---------13:34----------
path um


---------13:36----------
how are you feeling in general good


---------13:39----------
overall well that's good yeah we're um


---------13:43----------
yeah i spoke to you uh some number of


---------13:46----------
months ago


---------13:46----------
you feel like your perspective at all


---------13:47----------
has changed um being a little bit more


---------13:49----------
in this world


---------13:50----------
maybe not perspective on mental health


---------13:51----------
but like on like streamers in general or


---------13:53----------
this world of journals or anything


---------13:54----------
that's like surprised you or shocked you


---------13:56----------
um or is everything panned out about as


---------13:57----------
you thought it would or


---------13:59----------
so nothing is panned out how i thought


---------14:01----------
it would


---------14:03----------
um i i'd say that i have learned immense


---------14:06----------
things


---------14:06----------
i think the biggest revelation that i've


---------14:08----------
had is i think that our


---------14:10----------
understanding of mental illness and


---------14:13----------
mental


---------14:14----------
pressure is woefully outdated


---------14:19----------
what do you mean by that i'm curious


---------14:20----------
what you mean by that specifically


---------14:22----------
mental illness and mental pressure yeah


---------14:24----------
so like the first thing is that the


---------14:26----------
stresses that people go


---------14:27----------
under are changing that's why i call it


---------14:29----------
mental pressure because i don't think it


---------14:30----------
necessarily qualifies as illness


---------14:32----------
so um and i think that like there's a


---------14:35----------
big mistake that's being made in the


---------14:37----------
academic community


---------14:38----------
well a mistake is actually a little bit


---------14:40----------
unfair um there are some assumptions


---------14:43----------
which are being made so for example if


---------14:44----------
you look at the criteria for


---------14:47----------
proposed criteria for video game


---------14:48----------
addiction they're essentially


---------14:50----------
the same as alcohol addiction with the


---------14:52----------
world word alcohol replaced with video


---------14:54----------
games


---------14:55----------
yeah i think i saw similar with like


---------14:57----------
gambling addiction too basically yeah


---------14:58----------
and so what they do is they say that all


---------15:00----------
and that basically has the presumption


---------15:02----------
that all addictions are sort of the same


---------15:05----------
and it's been my experience that that is


---------15:07----------
really not true


---------15:08----------
having i mean so i'm an addiction


---------15:10----------
psychiatrist generally in my day job and


---------15:12----------
like


---------15:12----------
you know working with a heroin addict


---------15:14----------
and working with like a video game


---------15:15----------
addict


---------15:16----------
there's some overlap to be sure but they


---------15:18----------
feel like really discreet diseases with


---------15:21----------
different kinds of solutions


---------15:24----------
so that's one one thing so i think that


---------15:26----------
in general the kinds of pressures that


---------15:28----------
people face like when i talk to


---------15:29----------
streamers and stuff


---------15:31----------
is like very very different


---------15:34----------
in some ways so i think uh yeah go ahead


---------15:38----------
do you um so i'm kind of curious on that


---------15:41----------
road


---------15:41----------
um do you ever feel like


---------15:46----------
when you bring up even the concept of


---------15:47----------
being addicted to video games do you


---------15:48----------
ever feel like the pushback that you


---------15:50----------
might get from somebody in the gaming


---------15:51----------
community might be similar to an


---------15:53----------
alcoholic


---------15:54----------
like the denial that it could ever even


---------15:55----------
be a problem i noticed that sometimes


---------15:57----------
i remember when i i don't know if it was


---------15:59----------
a prose day of something or at the who


---------16:01----------
whoever initially came out with the


---------16:02----------
video game addiction thing i remember


---------16:04----------
when i first read it the language seemed


---------16:06----------
a little bit vague but it's like yeah i


---------16:07----------
could totally see people being addicted


---------16:08----------
to video games


---------16:09----------
but it seemed like gaming communities in


---------16:10----------
general were incredibly


---------16:12----------
hostile towards the even the notion that


---------16:14----------
video games could like lead to an


---------16:16----------
unhealthy addiction do you ever do you


---------16:17----------
ever see that pushback or


---------16:19----------
sure yeah i mean i i think some people


---------16:23----------
push back against the idea of the


---------16:25----------
diagnosis like that's an interesting


---------16:27----------
question right like what happens


---------16:30----------
so this is a discussion that i haven't


---------16:32----------
had much recently but


---------16:33----------
when in its early days um when healthy


---------16:36----------
gamer was like


---------16:37----------
a group of like 50 strong and we would


---------16:39----------
meet once a week and talk about video


---------16:40----------
game addiction


---------16:42----------
we would talk about what does it mean to


---------16:43----------
be labeled as an addict what are the


---------16:45----------
pros and what are the cons because there


---------16:46----------
are advantages and there are


---------16:47----------
disadvantages


---------16:49----------
so i think it's understandable that a


---------16:50----------
lot of the community so i think our


---------16:52----------
community is misunderstood


---------16:54----------
by society as a whole


---------16:57----------
when you say our community you mean


---------16:59----------
gaming or yeah you're okay yeah okay


---------17:02----------
twitch and i think what happens is that


---------17:05----------
like what we see


---------17:07----------
is so let's say like i'm a 16 year old


---------17:09----------
kid and i have conflict with my mom


---------17:11----------
and when when i see something about


---------17:13----------
video game addiction


---------17:15----------
it gives her license to continue


---------17:18----------
to it gives her ammo in our arguments


---------17:21----------
because she can just say i'm a [ __ ]


---------17:23----------
addict now it's a disease


---------17:25----------
the world health organization is


---------17:26----------
concerned about it so it actually gives


---------17:28----------
people like an avenue to invalidate like


---------17:30----------
gamers experiences


---------17:32----------
sure okay so diagnosis is supposed to


---------17:34----------
help us


---------17:35----------
get help for something basically if


---------17:36----------
you're gonna identify a problem well now


---------17:38----------
we can treat it but some people just use


---------17:39----------
it to like attack people basically


---------17:41----------
sure yeah okay and i think the bigger


---------17:44----------
problem that that happens is not so much


---------17:45----------
that they attack people but


---------17:47----------
there's an assumption of understanding


---------17:48----------
right so like your mom then thinks


---------17:51----------
she knows what's wrong with you and by


---------17:53----------
doing so it's not so much that she's


---------17:55----------
attacking you although she can


---------17:57----------
it's also that they don't like actually


---------17:58----------
listen to gamers perspectives


---------18:00----------
so the big thing that is absent in


---------18:03----------
all the discussions on video game


---------18:05----------
addiction are so speaking of suicidality


---------18:08----------
you know i'll get messages from people


---------18:09----------
that are like


---------18:10----------
you know i can't stop playing video


---------18:12----------
games i don't know what to do with my


---------18:13----------
life i'm stuck i'm 27 i live at home and


---------18:15----------
i want to kill myself


---------18:17----------
i also get messages that are you know


---------18:20----------
i'll be browsing reddit


---------18:21----------
i mean i don't get and i'll see these


---------18:23----------
stories of like you know if it wasn't


---------18:25----------
for you guys i would have killed myself


---------18:26----------
years ago


---------18:28----------
so i think video games in the gaming


---------18:29----------
community can be an


---------18:31----------
amazing source of support and growth


---------18:34----------
and it can be something that is like


---------18:36----------
toxic and harmful


---------18:38----------
and generally speaking you know you


---------18:39----------
don't really think about i mean you


---------18:41----------
can't actually but


---------18:42----------
um generally speaking we don't think


---------18:44----------
about like the the community of heroin


---------18:46----------
users


---------18:47----------
as like a place that can like support


---------18:50----------
and bolster each other when in reality


---------18:51----------
they do like that's why


---------18:52----------
n a and a are powerful organizations


---------18:55----------
sure um


---------18:56----------
but you know gaming i think is a little


---------18:58----------
bit different there's no there's no like


---------18:59----------
there's esports but there's no like


---------19:00----------
professional


---------19:01----------
heroine tournaments so i think that the


---------19:04----------
two are just different


---------19:05----------
sure and one last kind of new one saltos


---------19:10----------
out which is like a good example of why


---------19:11----------
i think that old patterns don't apply


---------19:14----------
is if there's a kid who spends you know


---------19:16----------
all day every day


---------19:17----------
practicing basketball and he's 16


---------19:22----------
then do you call him addicted


---------19:25----------
because he wants to make it in the nba


---------19:28----------
and when you've got a 16 year old who's


---------19:30----------
in the top .001 percent of a particular


---------19:33----------
sport and wants to go pro


---------19:35----------
and is failing out of his classes do you


---------19:37----------
call him addicted


---------19:40----------
so it's tricky


---------19:43----------
yeah for sure i think it's really


---------19:44----------
interesting um a lot of there's like two


---------19:46----------
different types of like movies


---------19:48----------
that show success in like sports or the


---------19:50----------
arts or whatever


---------19:51----------
um you have the like the the the very


---------19:54----------
happy upbeat sports movies that like


---------19:56----------
everybody's like super happy and super


---------19:57----------
awesome the entire time and they win the


---------19:59----------
championship and it's awesome and then


---------20:00----------
you have the others that show


---------20:01----------
basically like the level of


---------20:03----------
self-destruction that some people engage


---------20:04----------
in to reach that top


---------20:06----------
0.0001 percent where the difference


---------20:08----------
between it being pathologized or not is


---------20:10----------
whether or not they make it basically


---------20:12----------
yeah exactly right yeah so like i have


---------20:15----------
some clients who are let's say an


---------20:16----------
investment banking


---------20:18----------
been divorced three times have very high


---------20:21----------
net worths


---------20:23----------
devote themselves body mind and soul


---------20:26----------
to their profession and how is that


---------20:29----------
different from an esports professional


---------20:31----------
or someone who wants to make it in


---------20:32----------
esports no


---------20:36----------
so i think that our perceptions of


---------20:38----------
health


---------20:39----------
wellness and illness like need to be


---------20:43----------
re-examined that's another big thing


---------20:44----------
i've learned


---------20:46----------
is you know yeah go ahead um


---------20:49----------
sorry okay well it's if we're expanding


---------20:51----------
the conversation i have a lot of


---------20:52----------
just interesting general questions for


---------20:54----------
your perspective on what you just said


---------20:56----------
um so when it comes to things like


---------21:00----------
uh autism spectrum disorder or adhd


---------21:04----------
and the different subtypes whatever


---------21:07----------
how do you um let's say that there's


---------21:09----------
like a healthy


---------21:10----------
section of human mind that exists on a


---------21:12----------
spectrum of zero to one hundred


---------21:14----------
but let's say like in the society that


---------21:15----------
we live in today it seems like only like


---------21:18----------
20 to 80 work right and 0 to 20 is left


---------21:21----------
out 80 to 100 is left out


---------21:22----------
is there ever a worry that we just


---------21:24----------
pathologize those because they don't


---------21:26----------
work with current society


---------21:27----------
um rather than like having a more honest


---------21:30----------
look at whether or not these are like


---------21:31----------
unhealthy states of mind so i'm thinking


---------21:33----------
of something like specific to like adhd


---------21:35----------
or or autism spectrum disorder usually


---------21:36----------
the ones i hear people bring up the most


---------21:38----------
where these people aren't like


---------21:39----------
mentally ill or they don't have a


---------21:40----------
disease it's just with the way that


---------21:42----------
we've organized society today


---------21:44----------
their minds specifically have a hard


---------21:46----------
time adapting do you think is that ever


---------21:48----------
a big worry do you think in


---------21:49----------
psychology with how we approach that's


---------21:52----------
half of what i preach about ireland


---------21:54----------
so let me tell you the crops of the


---------21:55----------
problem uh destiny is that


---------21:59----------
we think about it as a bell curve with


---------22:01----------
one dimension


---------22:03----------
so like the whole thing about ayurveda


---------22:05----------
and this is i think a fundamental


---------22:06----------
problem with our understanding of


---------22:07----------
psychology


---------22:08----------
and medicine in general is what you


---------22:10----------
repeat that again the whole problem with


---------22:11----------
what what is that word you're using


---------22:13----------
i forget it's the bell curve yeah oh


---------22:16----------
yeah i'm sorry it's one dimensional


---------22:18----------
right so we think about human mind as


---------22:21----------
like


---------22:21----------
a function on one dimension but that's


---------22:24----------
not


---------22:25----------
how the mind works the mind is


---------22:26----------
multi-dimensional that's the first


---------22:28----------
problem


---------22:29----------
yeah so you have like a veda is the word


---------22:30----------
you use oh yeah ayurveda


---------22:32----------
what is that so ayurveda is traditional


---------22:34----------
indian medicine


---------22:35----------
okay and ayurveda posits that not so


---------22:38----------
this i know this is


---------22:39----------
to sound kind of weird but in western


---------22:40----------
medicine we posit that all minds are


---------22:42----------
basically the same


---------22:43----------
okay right so like you go to psychology


---------22:46----------
like you major in psychology and you


---------22:48----------
learn like


---------22:49----------
principles of the mind like if you


---------22:52----------
become a doctor you learn like


---------22:53----------
cardiac physiology right so which is


---------22:55----------
like all hearts


---------22:56----------
basically function in the same way and


---------22:58----------
even when we're taught about the mind we


---------22:59----------
sort of


---------23:00----------
learn that all minds basically function


---------23:02----------
in the same way we have a subconscious


---------23:04----------
we have a conscious we have an ego we


---------23:05----------
have an id we have a superego


---------23:07----------
these are all commonalities of all minds


---------23:09----------
and we sort of treat them all the same


---------23:12----------
ayurveda starts with the idea that not


---------23:14----------
all minds are the same and not all


---------23:16----------
people are the same


---------23:17----------
that people are unique and they actually


---------23:20----------
have three


---------23:20----------
axes of like


---------23:24----------
mind right and you can have scores on


---------23:26----------
each of those axes


---------23:27----------
and depending on what your scores are on


---------23:29----------
each of these three axes you get sort of


---------23:31----------
a unique mind


---------23:33----------
and i'll give you just an example so


---------23:36----------
what we call


---------23:36----------
adhd is people who have high vata so i'm


---------23:40----------
someone who has a high vata


---------23:42----------
okay so vata is the sunscript word which


---------23:45----------
sort of means wind and ether


---------23:47----------
so my mind is like the wind an ayurvedic


---------23:51----------
doctor once explained this to me so


---------23:53----------
actually i'll tell you the story can i


---------23:54----------
go off on tangent this is what mata's


---------23:56----------
doing


---------23:56----------
if you want yeah we go we go off on


---------23:58----------
tangents okay so


---------24:01----------
i was using your diagnosis as an excuse


---------24:03----------
for your responsible behavior but


---------24:05----------
absolutely absolutely so i use it i use


---------24:09----------
it as an excuse for my irresponsible


---------24:11----------
behavior


---------24:11----------
and i also use it as a key reason for


---------24:14----------
why i believe i'm successful


---------24:15----------
it's both okay hit me up with this um so


---------24:19----------
i was so i finished call uh high school


---------24:21----------
went to college started failing out got


---------24:22----------
super excited


---------24:24----------
so i like ran for student government i


---------24:26----------
joined a bunch of clubs


---------24:27----------
i went to a bunch of parties i studied


---------24:30----------
three languages


---------24:32----------
in my first year in college because i


---------24:34----------
got really excited about


---------24:35----------
a bunch of [ __ ] i was pre-med i took


---------24:38----------
philosophy courses like i was all over


---------24:39----------
the place


---------24:41----------
tried to join a fraternity and you know


---------24:44----------
fail like god less


---------24:45----------
like got mostly d's and f's maybe a c or


---------24:48----------
a b here or there


---------24:49----------
and then second year um what happened is


---------24:53----------
like


---------24:53----------
i tried to cut down so like i cut down


---------24:56----------
in my second semester cut down and


---------24:58----------
first semester of sophomore year cut


---------25:00----------
down cut down cut down and then even


---------25:01----------
like i was taking like three classes


---------25:03----------
which is half a normal mode and then was


---------25:06----------
not doing any


---------25:07----------
extracurriculars was doing nothing just


---------25:09----------
taking i was like a half-time student


---------25:11----------
and


---------25:12----------
nothing else and i still did bad and i


---------25:15----------
went to india


---------25:17----------
and um one of my one of my teachers


---------25:19----------
there i was kind of telling him i was


---------25:21----------
like i don't know why i'm like


---------25:22----------
why i suck at life like at first i was


---------25:24----------
doing too many things and i understood


---------25:26----------
that and my dad was like you gotta focus


---------25:28----------
you gotta focus


---------25:29----------
you gotta focus so i started doing fewer


---------25:31----------
things and i started doing fewer things


---------25:32----------
and i started doing fewer things


---------25:34----------
and despite like doing less stuff i


---------25:36----------
still continued to fail at basically the


---------25:37----------
same rate i was just [ __ ] confused


---------25:40----------
and he was like yeah that sounds like a


---------25:41----------
terrible idea and i was like what do you


---------25:42----------
mean it's a terrible idea


---------25:44----------
he's like your mind is so dynamic


---------25:47----------
that if you're gonna get bored easily


---------25:51----------
and what you need to do is juggle as


---------25:53----------
many balls as you can at the same time


---------25:55----------
without dropping a single one


---------25:57----------
and that your mind is designed to like


---------25:59----------
do something really really


---------26:01----------
passionately for a brief period of time


---------26:04----------
and then switch to something else


---------26:07----------
and actually your best productivity is


---------26:10----------
not going to come


---------26:10----------
from one thing it's going to come from


---------26:12----------
like rotating your attention between


---------26:14----------
like three or four different things


---------26:16----------
so when i get bored of one thing i move


---------26:18----------
to another and i


---------26:19----------
get bored of that i move to that this is


---------26:21----------
the key thing that i didn't understand


---------26:23----------
is that i used to just keep on shifting


---------26:25----------
a to z


---------26:26----------
and the one change that i made is i just


---------26:28----------
circled between a and d


---------26:30----------
and then i circled back to a and that's


---------26:32----------
when i started becoming like successful


---------26:35----------
but my mind is is different it's about


---------26:37----------
the mind


---------26:38----------
and different kinds of minds need


---------26:40----------
different sorts of strategies


---------26:42----------
and adhd is a good example of like what


---------26:45----------
i call


---------26:46----------
you know there another dichotomy is like


---------26:49----------
there are hunters and there are farmers


---------26:51----------
like if you look at human psychology


---------26:53----------
some people excel at waking up the same


---------26:57----------
time


---------26:57----------
every day and doing the same thing every


---------27:00----------
day and they find a lot of pleasure


---------27:02----------
enjoyment satisfaction and ease and like


---------27:05----------
putting all their energy into one thing


---------27:07----------
those are farmers and there are hunters


---------27:09----------
who are there our brains are actually


---------27:11----------
designed to like


---------27:13----------
to pull in a lot of disparate stimuli


---------27:15----------
and like piece things together


---------27:17----------
we have to be dynamic it's absolutely


---------27:19----------
adaptive


---------27:20----------
and add i think is a good example of


---------27:24----------
some kinds of minds that are not ideally


---------27:26----------
designed which i think is what your


---------27:28----------
question was


---------27:29----------
for things like sitting in a classroom


---------27:31----------
for eight hours


---------27:32----------
that's not what we're made for and so we


---------27:36----------
get


---------27:36----------
diagnosed with something because


---------27:39----------
you know it's like our mind is not


---------27:41----------
designed to function that way


---------27:43----------
sure was that too much


---------27:46----------
no it's interesting it's something that


---------27:48----------
uh my son is


---------27:49----------
really really really bad adhd um and


---------27:52----------
that's kind of uh because i did like so


---------27:53----------
much reading on it i think i might even


---------27:55----------
actually after doing so much research on


---------27:57----------
it


---------27:57----------
um but yeah it's one of the things that


---------28:00----------
i kind of wonder is like um


---------28:02----------
we're quick to pathologize behaviors


---------28:04----------
that just don't fit into society


---------28:07----------
yeah it's it's very hard when i talk


---------28:10----------
publicly about anything related to like


---------28:12----------
psychology or


---------28:13----------
mental illness you have to walk a very


---------28:15----------
careful line between saying like yeah


---------28:17----------
these are some concerns versus


---------28:18----------
invalidating the whole field


---------28:20----------
and like discouraging people from like


---------28:22----------
seeking treatment or talking to


---------28:23----------
professionals is really hard


---------28:24----------
conversation i have sometimes


---------28:25----------
um yeah some people will take like if


---------28:27----------
you say like oh yeah we pathologize too


---------28:28----------
much


---------28:29----------
some people are liable to take that and


---------28:30----------
go ah yeah i knew it like it's all quack


---------28:32----------
science it's all [ __ ] like i'm not


---------28:34----------
gonna go talk to anybody like i don't


---------28:35----------
need a pill or whatever and then they


---------28:36----------
just you know walk away from everything


---------28:38----------
which is really


---------28:39----------
um which is really bad i think yeah yeah


---------28:42----------
i mean i think there's some interesting


---------28:44----------
data to support so i think adhd is a


---------28:46----------
real thing for sure


---------28:47----------
and also i think it's probably like way


---------28:49----------
over diagnosed


---------28:51----------
so there's data that suggests that uh


---------28:54----------
student-to-teacher ratio has a core a


---------28:57----------
pretty tight correlation


---------28:58----------
with diagnosis of adhd can you predict


---------29:02----------
what would be your guess as to what as


---------29:06----------
student


---------29:06----------
as the number of students per teacher


---------29:08----------
goes up


---------29:10----------
what happens to adhd diagnosis diagnosis


---------29:13----------
would probably increase


---------29:15----------
absolutely and that's what you find why


---------29:16----------
do you think that is yeah


---------29:18----------
you have less time to spend per child um


---------29:20----------
so your


---------29:21----------
band of acceptable attention decreases


---------29:24----------
and decreases the more children you have


---------29:26----------
the more narrow their focus needs to be


---------29:27----------
because the less time you can commit to


---------29:29----------
them so the higher likelihood that their


---------29:30----------
behavior is pathologized and diagnosed


---------29:33----------
adhd probably


---------29:34----------
exactly what the data shows


---------29:40----------
um okay something else you brought up um


---------29:43----------
if you ever want to go off on any of


---------29:44----------
these two just get because i'm just


---------29:45----------
asking questions


---------29:46----------
um a lot of streamers have a problem


---------29:49----------
where


---------29:49----------
you get a message well i say a problem


---------29:51----------
that's a really rude way to say you get


---------29:53----------
a lot of messages sometimes people say


---------29:54----------
like hey


---------29:55----------
like i'm suicidal um i don't really know


---------29:57----------
what to do i don't expect you to respond


---------29:59----------
but i just want to let you know my


---------30:00----------
thoughts


---------30:00----------
um what do you think is a responsible


---------30:02----------
course of action for


---------30:04----------
i i guess like streamers there in that


---------30:07----------
yeah


---------30:08----------
yeah what is the responsible course of


---------30:09----------
action that for any streamer that gets


---------30:12----------
a message like that i mean so i i think


---------30:14----------
you should urge him to get help


---------30:16----------
right so like like i i mean it's cool so


---------30:18----------
i


---------30:19----------
you know many things i've learned


---------30:21----------
destiny since i started streaming on


---------30:23----------
twitch one is like how awesome of a


---------30:24----------
community this is in general


---------30:26----------
and how tight the bonds are between a


---------30:29----------
streamer


---------30:30----------
and the audience which is really cool i


---------30:32----------
mean i think it's actually


---------30:33----------
i was talking about this i think maybe


---------30:35----------
on that podcast that i think it's kind


---------30:37----------
of neat because


---------30:38----------
you know we're facing a lot of societal


---------30:41----------
pressures in terms of mental health


---------30:43----------
and i think that that you know the very


---------30:44----------
things that on the one hand are toxic


---------30:46----------
are also the things that i hope to be


---------30:48----------
our salvation


---------30:50----------
and like social media i think is a good


---------30:51----------
example of something that can be


---------30:53----------
very harmful and also be like incredibly


---------30:56----------
helpful


---------30:58----------
um in terms of what to do for a person


---------31:00----------
who reaches out like


---------31:01----------
i think that you know it's hard because


---------31:03----------
what do you have the bandwidth for


---------31:06----------
and what do you have the competence for


---------31:09----------
and so i i think it's important you know


---------31:12----------
if if


---------31:13----------
as if someone you know reached out to


---------31:16----------
you and said


---------31:18----------
hey um i have blood in my stool


---------31:22----------
for the last two months like what do you


---------31:25----------
think your responsibility is


---------31:27----------
as a streamer


---------31:30----------
um we tell them to see a doctor yeah so


---------31:33----------
i think it's the same


---------31:34----------
right so i i think that like i was


---------31:37----------
saying earlier so i think we treat


---------31:39----------
physical and mental illnesses still


---------31:40----------
differently


---------31:42----------
and i think that that person deserves


---------31:46----------
the possibility of treatment if they do


---------31:49----------
have an illness


---------31:51----------
and if not even if they don't have an


---------31:52----------
illness and they're like half the people


---------31:54----------
that i see that are not


---------31:55----------
suicidal i think those people can be


---------31:58----------
helped


---------32:00----------
uh you know i think you just have to


---------32:02----------
decide


---------32:03----------
in terms of your own personal bandwidth


---------32:06----------
and what you feel comfortable with how


---------32:07----------
much of a conversation to engage with


---------32:09----------
them


---------32:11----------
i think that the tricky thing there is


---------32:13----------
that sometimes


---------32:15----------
you know if you really don't have i


---------32:17----------
think it can be unfair to people


---------32:22----------
yeah i mean i think you have to be


---------32:23----------
careful about because we think about


---------32:25----------
this a lot on stream like when someone


---------32:26----------
comes on stream like what's our ongoing


---------32:28----------
responsibility to them


---------32:30----------
so i think it can be you know you should


---------32:33----------
do what you can


---------32:34----------
and then also if you can't do the second


---------32:37----------
step


---------32:38----------
give people direction as to how to do it


---------32:42----------
right like if you're a taxi driver and


---------32:44----------
you take someone to a railway station or


---------32:46----------
something


---------32:46----------
and you drop them off and then you're


---------32:49----------
like oh yeah so like


---------32:50----------
your terminal is this way like at least


---------32:51----------
point them in the right direction


---------32:53----------
sure okay what are you doing you ever


---------32:56----------
um how do you respond to those requests


---------33:00----------
uh oh i mean i and yeah i usually


---------33:02----------
because i get


---------33:03----------
enough of it to where i'm basically my


---------33:05----------
response is um listen i understand


---------33:07----------
you're going through some things


---------33:08----------
um unfortunately i don't have enough


---------33:10----------
information to help you and i don't


---------33:11----------
think i would even have the time to give


---------33:12----------
you the proper attention you need i


---------33:13----------
highly recommend talking to either


---------33:15----------
school resources or psychology something


---------33:17----------
basically something like that yeah


---------33:20----------
how does that feel to do uh


---------33:24----------
i i'm sorry i mean personally it's not i


---------33:28----------
don't i don't think about it much but i


---------33:29----------
know that a lot of other streamers have


---------33:30----------
like really big problems with that sorry


---------33:31----------
that sounds really cool to say but i


---------33:33----------
don't think i have like obligations to


---------33:34----------
strangers that email me or whatever


---------33:36----------
um i don't mean that to sound that cold


---------33:37----------
but yeah i i don't personally think


---------33:38----------
about it much but i know that a lot of


---------33:39----------
streamers have a lot of big problems


---------33:41----------
where


---------33:41----------
when they get messages like that they


---------33:42----------
feel like they all of a sudden have like


---------33:44----------
an obligation to a stranger to ensure


---------33:46----------
that


---------33:46----------
they have a positive outcome with their


---------33:47----------
issues and yeah


---------33:49----------
yeah do you ever worry about um well you


---------33:52----------
you just you use that phrase what is our


---------33:54----------
responsibility do you ever worry about


---------33:56----------
people that you bring on seeing this as


---------33:58----------
a sort of replacement for therapy


---------34:00----------
sure i know that yeah yeah i mean i


---------34:03----------
think that's why we try to


---------34:06----------
you know be clear with people before


---------34:09----------
they come on


---------34:11----------
um and i don't i don't mean just from


---------34:14----------
like a medical legal perspective like we


---------34:16----------
genuinely try to you know make it clear


---------34:17----------
to people


---------34:19----------
we try to equip people with further


---------34:20----------
resources if they're interested


---------34:22----------
like if they want to explore things i'll


---------34:24----------
oftentimes tell them that you know i


---------34:25----------
think you should continue working on


---------34:26----------
this with a therapist


---------34:28----------
um and generally speaking you know


---------34:31----------
sometimes people have misunderstood


---------34:34----------
and and so we have clarifying


---------34:35----------
conversations and we try to behave


---------34:38----------
sort of in the best and most ethical


---------34:40----------
manner possible


---------34:42----------
i tend to be kind of a stickler for like


---------34:46----------
boundaries and ethics and stuff i think


---------34:47----------
it's a really fascinating field


---------34:48----------
especially in mental health


---------34:50----------
um so we try to really do well as an


---------34:52----------
organization to like really help them


---------34:56----------
and yeah it's just sort of a


---------34:59----------
case-by-case basis though


---------35:00----------
i mean we have sort of a set of


---------35:03----------
resources and stuff that we provide to


---------35:04----------
people but


---------35:05----------
sure okay cool uh when it comes to


---------35:08----------
looking at


---------35:10----------
mental health in the west it feels like


---------35:12----------
we talk a lot about body health


---------35:13----------
but it seems like we spend basically no


---------35:16----------
time


---------35:16----------
at least through all of schooling


---------35:18----------
talking about um


---------35:20----------
talking about not not just not being


---------35:23----------
mentally ill but being mentally like


---------35:24----------
very healthy it seems like we don't


---------35:25----------
value


---------35:26----------
um the pursuit of happiness very much uh


---------35:29----------
in the western world


---------35:30----------
um i know a lot of people and i'm sure


---------35:32----------
you've met a lot of people in the


---------35:34----------
streaming world or in the work world


---------35:36----------
who their lives kind of revolve around


---------35:38----------
the acquisition of


---------35:39----------
bigger houses higher paying jobs


---------35:42----------
maybe different items or possessions how


---------35:44----------
what kind of conversation do you have


---------35:46----------
with somebody to start to get them down


---------35:47----------
the track of thinking that they should


---------35:49----------
prioritize for things that give them


---------35:50----------
like more sustained or longer-term


---------35:52----------
happiness


---------35:53----------
than just kind of like getting stuck in


---------35:54----------
like the race of trying to get more and


---------35:56----------
more stuff or like higher wage


---------35:58----------
does that question make sense yeah so i


---------36:00----------
think


---------36:02----------
so i mean how do you deviate people from


---------36:05----------
being materialistically oriented


---------36:07----------
yeah i guess this is like i feel this is


---------36:09----------
being like one of the biggest problems


---------36:10----------
that i think that most people that i


---------36:12----------
talk to


---------36:13----------
face is that we have like no concept of


---------36:15----------
like


---------36:16----------
when we think of like progress of


---------36:17----------
society or lives nobody ever thinks like


---------36:19----------
man you know when i was 20


---------36:20----------
i could have like three close friends


---------36:22----------
now that i'm 35 i can have like 15 close


---------36:24----------
friends like nobody it seems like nobody


---------36:25----------
would ever say something like that and


---------36:26----------
view it as progress but rather when i


---------36:28----------
was 20 i was making 45 a year now that


---------36:30----------
i'm 35 i'm making 120


---------36:31----------
like that's the progress of people


---------36:32----------
thinking what how do you talk to


---------36:34----------
somebody or


---------36:35----------
how do you begin to set somebody on the


---------36:36----------
path of not viewing life like that


---------36:39----------
it's a really hard one sorry no i think


---------36:41----------
it's i mean that's a lot of my day job


---------36:42----------
so


---------36:43----------
let me start by saying you know you had


---------36:45----------
us some context at the beginning so let


---------36:47----------
me start with that context


---------36:49----------
sure so i don't i would disagree that we


---------36:51----------
don't think about happiness it's just


---------36:53----------
the way we think about happiness in the


---------36:55----------
way that we're taught to think about


---------36:56----------
happiness is materialistic


---------36:58----------
so these are cultural values right so


---------37:00----------
like when you


---------37:02----------
like when you meet like a kid who's like


---------37:05----------
14


---------37:07----------
the first question that people ask is


---------37:09----------
what do you want to be when you grow up


---------37:10----------
you grow up yeah


---------37:11----------
so right right then and there a whole


---------37:14----------
society is teaching an individual that


---------37:16----------
your identity is based on your


---------37:17----------
profession


---------37:19----------
so why would that individual not orient


---------37:21----------
towards a profession first and foremost


---------37:24----------
what are the things that we celebrate oh


---------37:26----------
like getting into harvard like


---------37:28----------
getting a promotion getting a raise


---------37:31----------
these are the things the society that we


---------37:32----------
celebrate we don't advertise


---------37:34----------
hey i made a friend today you know it's


---------37:36----------
like


---------37:38----------
okay like the [ __ ] is wrong with you


---------37:40----------
where you have to like advertise making


---------37:41----------
a friend


---------37:42----------
so our value system is i mean we just


---------37:45----------
think that something leads to happiness


---------37:47----------
and you know that too i don't think is


---------37:50----------
entirely unfair because


---------37:52----------
you know i'm a second generation indian


---------37:55----------
where


---------37:56----------
you know my parents like happiness like


---------37:58----------
sort of spiritual fulfillment was like


---------38:01----------
really not


---------38:02----------
a thing that anyone had the luxury for


---------38:04----------
because


---------38:06----------
you know my dad grew up in a house that


---------38:09----------
had like eight people


---------38:10----------
living in a 10 by 10 space


---------38:13----------
so it's really about you know like


---------38:15----------
making ends meet like my grandfather was


---------38:17----------
like heavily in debt


---------38:19----------
my parents like borrowed money for a


---------38:21----------
plane ticket


---------38:23----------
and suitcases when they came to this


---------38:24----------
country and so i think a lot of that is


---------38:27----------
kind of


---------38:28----------
you know it's i don't really blame the


---------38:29----------
society for what it is but i think your


---------38:31----------
question is a good one


---------38:32----------
which actually kind of comes back to uh


---------38:35----------
you know how do you reorient people so i


---------38:37----------
do reorder people because


---------38:38----------
most of my at least until about you know


---------38:41----------
i started doing healthy gamer more you


---------38:42----------
know most of my


---------38:44----------
patients or clients would be successful


---------38:46----------
like professionally successful people


---------38:47----------
who are unhappy


---------38:49----------
that was sort of what i was good at and


---------38:51----------
what i tell them is that you know this


---------38:53----------
is actually the same problem that would


---------38:54----------
have faced


---------38:56----------
so and this is kind of subtle but so you


---------38:58----------
know buddha had everything so


---------39:00----------
he was a prince and he was loved


---------39:03----------
and had wealth and power and respect and


---------39:05----------
then one day he woke up and he was


---------39:07----------
unhappy


---------39:09----------
and then he was like i don't understand


---------39:11----------
like why i'm unhappy


---------39:13----------
and something very subtle happens so


---------39:15----------
this is another thing that happens we


---------39:16----------
tend to do a lot of gatekeeping around


---------39:18----------
suffering


---------39:19----------
so we don't let people who are


---------39:20----------
successful suffer


---------39:22----------
we blame them for suffering and we say


---------39:24----------
that you shouldn't suffer


---------39:25----------
because you have money or success or


---------39:27----------
whatever


---------39:28----------
another common thing that's a big thing


---------39:31----------
yeah i bring this up


---------39:32----------
a lot around streamers is that like if


---------39:33----------
you're a streamer you can't ever really


---------39:35----------
complain about anything related to your


---------39:36----------
job publicly because you sound so


---------39:38----------
unbelievably entitled like oh boohoo


---------39:41----------
you're getting


---------39:42----------
hate because you're famous wow oh my god


---------39:44----------
it's like people


---------39:45----------
generally in the public perceive it that


---------39:46----------
way yeah yeah so i mean i think the


---------39:48----------
basic question is


---------39:50----------
what do you think is the source of


---------39:51----------
suffering and does money buy happiness


---------39:54----------
and money does correlate with happiness


---------39:56----------
to a certain degree


---------39:57----------
right it certainly provides security but


---------39:59----------
they're really really


---------40:01----------
yeah so the really fascinating thing


---------40:03----------
though is if you look at buddha


---------40:05----------
so like here here's what happens like so


---------40:07----------
i think basically


---------40:09----------
you know how you talk to them is they


---------40:10----------
need spirituality and i'll talk about


---------40:12----------
what


---------40:12----------
i mean by that so if you think about it


---------40:14----------
let's say i make 30k a year


---------40:16----------
and i don't i've never dated anyone in


---------40:18----------
my life and i'm unhappy


---------40:20----------
so when i look at my life i think okay


---------40:22----------
in order to be happy i need a girlfriend


---------40:24----------
so let's say i get a girlfriend and my


---------40:26----------
happiness increases some then i'm like


---------40:27----------
okay now i want more money and so you


---------40:29----------
make more money and then happiness


---------40:30----------
increases some because it does right


---------40:32----------
you get to travel and like oh i've got


---------40:34----------
to go to hawaii because now i'm making


---------40:35----------
50k instead of 30k and i can afford to


---------40:37----------
make a vacation


---------40:38----------
sure and so what happened with buddha is


---------40:42----------
like


---------40:42----------
he checked all those boxes and as long


---------40:45----------
as you have a box unchecked


---------40:46----------
you think that checking those boxes is


---------40:48----------
going to lead to happiness


---------40:50----------
which is not an unreasonable way to


---------40:51----------
think but what happened with wood does


---------40:53----------
he gets to the end of the road and he's


---------40:54----------
checked all the boxes and then he wakes


---------40:56----------
up and he's happy


---------40:58----------
and then he's screwed because then what


---------41:01----------
does he do


---------41:05----------
and so this is where like when you know


---------41:07----------
when i work with people who are


---------41:09----------
materialistic


---------41:10----------
or materialistically successful and


---------41:12----------
unhappy i basically tell them


---------41:13----------
now you're on with this path and there's


---------41:15----------
a saying sort of in the meditation


---------41:17----------
community that you can't meditate on an


---------41:18----------
empty stomach


---------41:20----------
you can also see this uh you know shades


---------41:23----------
of this and maslow's hierarchy of needs


---------41:24----------
where he says


---------41:25----------
self-actualization is at the top right


---------41:28----------
you have to take care of


---------41:28----------
the conditions to pursue happiness not


---------41:31----------
happiness itself yeah


---------41:32----------
yeah and i think from uh from a more


---------41:35----------
psychological or spiritual aspect


---------41:37----------
there is this idea because we're you


---------41:39----------
know our brains


---------41:41----------
tell us that external stuff will lead to


---------41:43----------
satisfaction


---------41:44----------
and once you satisfy yourself externally


---------41:46----------
that's really when you have the


---------41:47----------
desperation


---------41:49----------
that is really required for true


---------41:51----------
spirituality


---------41:52----------
like people talk about spirituality like


---------41:54----------
it's a good thing


---------41:56----------
but in my experience spiritual true


---------41:59----------
spirituality is born


---------42:00----------
of like abject desperation and terror


---------42:05----------
okay it's when nothing else in the world


---------42:07----------
will work for you


---------42:08----------
you only have one option left and that's


---------42:10----------
really what it takes


---------42:12----------
gotcha i don't know how common it is


---------42:14----------
among immigrant families in the united


---------42:15----------
states but in my personal experience


---------42:18----------
sometimes the new immigrants to the us


---------42:20----------
are some of the most


---------42:22----------
like ultra liberal very patriotic very


---------42:25----------
individualized people


---------42:27----------
and i noticed that for my my family on


---------42:30----------
my mom's side


---------42:31----------
is all cuban and they are obsessed


---------42:34----------
my like my mom and her siblings are


---------42:37----------
obsessed with


---------42:38----------
acquisition of material wealth so like


---------42:40----------
they have huge houses


---------42:41----------
but like they all work multiple jobs


---------42:43----------
they're like even with their full


---------42:44----------
retirements and pensions where they're


---------42:46----------
trying to like keep up their payments or


---------42:47----------
whatever


---------42:47----------
um and it just seems pretty miserable


---------42:50----------
and then i think back to um i have older


---------42:51----------
cuban family that live down in miami in


---------42:53----------
a place called hialeah


---------42:54----------
very trashy cockroaches everywhere water


---------42:57----------
is like flooding the apartment every


---------42:59----------
single time it rains horrible place


---------43:00----------
but when i would spend the summer there


---------43:02----------
almost every other day there were like


---------43:03----------
these huge cookouts where like everybody


---------43:04----------
was going everybody's laughing


---------43:06----------
everybody's having a good time


---------43:07----------
and even though they were completely


---------43:08----------
missing that material level of well it


---------43:10----------
seemed like they were all like super


---------43:11----------
friendly


---------43:12----------
really happy like really chill with


---------43:13----------
everybody um


---------43:15----------
and then watching the that dichotomy


---------43:17----------
between like the ultra wealthy super


---------43:18----------
liberal individualistic american


---------43:20----------
um that you know has the big house and


---------43:22----------
the dream cars or whatever versus like


---------43:24----------
the very poor people it seems strange to


---------43:26----------
think that like


---------43:26----------
that my older family just seemed to be


---------43:28----------
more happy in general i guess


---------43:29----------
when they weren't like running that yeah


---------43:32----------
it's been impossible to talk


---------43:34----------
or what how do you understand that


---------43:37----------
um how do i understand it and like why


---------43:40----------
do i think what drives each


---------43:42----------
person to do i mean how do you


---------43:43----------
understand that phenomenon


---------43:45----------
um um


---------43:50----------
broader there's a broader philosophical


---------43:52----------
i guess understanding it feels like


---------43:54----------
it feels like the in the western world


---------43:56----------
in general it feels like we very much


---------43:57----------
fixate on possession


---------43:59----------
and money um so a lot of parents when


---------44:02----------
they talk about


---------44:03----------
um i want to have i want my child to


---------44:05----------
have a better life than me


---------44:06----------
most of the time what that translates to


---------44:08----------
is i want my child to have a better job


---------44:10----------
and make more money than me


---------44:11----------
and i feel like my my mom's parents were


---------44:14----------
very much like


---------44:14----------
we came from cuba to the united states


---------44:16----------
to give our children better lives and


---------44:18----------
they all you know my mom joined the air


---------44:19----------
force my aunt was in the nypd


---------44:21----------
like people got jobs and they got money


---------44:23----------
but they never maybe they just assumed


---------44:25----------
that like those values of like friends


---------44:27----------
and family would filter down


---------44:28----------
automatically but they didn't actually


---------44:30----------
deliberately instill them


---------44:31----------
so my parents got the whole like yeah


---------44:33----------
like you guys can do better than us you


---------44:35----------
can be successful you can have good jobs


---------44:36----------
and make a lot of money


---------44:37----------
but they didn't actually stress those i


---------44:40----------
guess like friendship values of the


---------44:41----------
relationships you could form with other


---------44:42----------
people


---------44:42----------
and those didn't filter down as much


---------44:44----------
that would be like my assumption i guess


---------44:46----------
why don't you think they filter down as


---------44:48----------
much


---------44:50----------
why don't they filter down um


---------44:54----------
i think maybe there are some things that


---------44:55----------
filter down


---------44:57----------
unconsciously and other things require


---------44:59----------
some deliberate level


---------45:01----------
of filtering down so for instance like


---------45:04----------
if you're abusive to your children


---------45:05----------
that type of modeling might filter down


---------45:07----------
automatically um but if you have some


---------45:10----------
value of i guess in this case of like


---------45:14----------
forming friendships with other people if


---------45:16----------
that's not as visible to your children


---------45:17----------
maybe they take it for granted or it


---------45:18----------
doesn't filter down as much maybe


---------45:20----------
there's some things that filter


---------45:21----------
automatically


---------45:21----------
some things that don't i'm not sure yeah


---------45:23----------
they're gonna guess yeah


---------45:24----------
i mean i i think that you know for a lot


---------45:27----------
of it so


---------45:28----------
so i mean i agree with you in terms of


---------45:30----------
some stuff is it what's


---------45:31----------
be filtered down but i think that you


---------45:33----------
know generally speaking


---------45:35----------
i almost think about it like darwin's


---------45:37----------
finches so there's a particular mindset


---------45:40----------
that is adaptive


---------45:41----------
for a particular circumstance and


---------45:45----------
you know i know at least in my parents


---------45:46----------
circumstance like friendships were not


---------45:48----------
as important


---------45:49----------
as like paying off the crushing debt of


---------45:52----------
your family


---------45:52----------
yeah and so they oriented towards like


---------45:55----------
materialistic


---------45:56----------
success which is i mean i consider


---------45:58----------
myself to be quite lucky because


---------46:00----------
i think they also instilled in me they


---------46:02----------
weren't materialistic they were very


---------46:03----------
successful


---------46:04----------
but i remember you know being 16 years


---------46:07----------
old and then like


---------46:09----------
you know my parents asked me they're


---------46:10----------
like do you you know what kind of car do


---------46:12----------
you want


---------46:13----------
it's like i've had a car and i was like


---------46:15----------
i don't need one


---------46:16----------
and because i had friends i was younger


---------46:19----------
i started school earlier skip to grade


---------46:20----------
or whatever


---------46:21----------
and so my friends drove so like a year


---------46:23----------
before you know i would always get rides


---------46:25----------
and like i didn't


---------46:26----------
i didn't even get a driver's license


---------46:27----------
until i was 18. which on the one hand is


---------46:30----------
like super entitled and privileged and


---------46:31----------
on the other hand is also like quite


---------46:33----------
unmaterialistic it's kind of weird right


---------46:36----------
it's sort of like both


---------46:38----------
sure whereas well it depends on where


---------46:39----------
you live but i understand what you mean


---------46:40----------
yeah yeah


---------46:41----------
it's kind of like my my friends were


---------46:43----------
really shocked that


---------46:45----------
i had the option of having a car and i


---------46:47----------
chose not to take it


---------46:49----------
which is like the depth of materialistic


---------46:53----------
you know but it was also like my parents


---------46:55----------
also instilled in the values that


---------46:57----------
stuff doesn't bring happiness and so


---------47:00----------
that's really good yeah


---------47:02----------
i'm lucky that way um the thing you


---------47:05----------
brought up early about jobs is really


---------47:06----------
interesting when you act like


---------47:08----------
there's a weird transition that happens


---------47:09----------
at some point i think maybe in high


---------47:11----------
school where


---------47:12----------
when you ask a kid when he's a child


---------47:13----------
what do you want to be when you grow up


---------47:15----------
it's actually it seems like a really


---------47:16----------
positive experience looking forward to


---------47:18----------
because i want to be like an astronaut


---------47:19----------
or a firefighter like these are like


---------47:20----------
what are your passions


---------47:22----------
and then by the time they hit like maybe


---------47:23----------
it's like 14 50 when you get to high


---------47:25----------
school


---------47:25----------
now it's like what kind of job do you


---------47:26----------
want to have when you graduate college


---------47:28----------
it's a much much different question that


---------47:30----------
it's like you're reframing something


---------47:31----------
earlier in a


---------47:32----------
more negative light at the same time


---------47:33----------
yeah yeah so i mean i


---------47:35----------
the reason that i was pre-med in college


---------47:37----------
is because when i told my


---------47:39----------
parents friends when i was 17 years old


---------47:42----------
at a christmas party


---------47:44----------
that i want to be a doctor one day


---------47:47----------
they like thought i was the hottest


---------47:49----------
hottest [ __ ] in the world they were like


---------47:51----------
wow


---------47:52----------
and then i was like i felt really good


---------47:53----------
right i was like i'm gonna be a doctor


---------47:55----------
one day


---------47:56----------
and so i you know you start to develop


---------47:58----------
this professional based ego


---------48:01----------
and it's like the absolute worst reason


---------48:03----------
to become a doctor


---------48:04----------
that's why half of the indian kids that


---------48:05----------
i know become doctors


---------48:09----------
and it's but i mean i don't blame people


---------48:12----------
for doing that i think it's like


---------48:14----------
you know we we pass on to our kids the


---------48:16----------
formula for success that


---------48:18----------
we think is important so in your in our


---------48:21----------
case


---------48:22----------
you know we may emphasize friendships


---------48:24----------
and happiness to the detriment


---------48:26----------
of professional success


---------48:33----------
which i think is okay


---------48:36----------
but i guess it would depend on the


---------48:37----------
person you talked to i think most people


---------48:39----------
would think it's okay if they'd


---------48:40----------
experience both ends of it but


---------48:41----------
yeah yeah right so our parents also


---------48:44----------
thought it was


---------48:44----------
okay to sacrifice friendships for the


---------48:48----------
sake of professional


---------48:50----------
security right that's why they did it


---------48:54----------
have you ever seen on the internet um


---------48:56----------
the the kind of


---------48:57----------
hyper obsession with stem and the kind


---------49:00----------
of relentless [ __ ] on


---------49:02----------
like the arts and humanities and stuff


---------49:04----------
yeah


---------49:05----------
i mean i work i don't know if you're


---------49:06----------
familiar with some of these prep schools


---------49:08----------
but i have i've had patients or clients


---------49:10----------
at these prep schools and it's like one


---------49:12----------
of the biggest crises of confidence


---------49:15----------
for a 15 or 16 year old girl


---------49:18----------
at a place like phillips exeter is


---------49:21----------
discovering that they don't want to do


---------49:23----------
stem


---------49:25----------
it's so hard because they've been taught


---------49:26----------
oh like there need to be more women in


---------49:28----------
medicine and women in engineering and


---------49:30----------
they want to be like astrophysicists and


---------49:32----------
there's almost this like bizarre


---------49:36----------
pressure that's placed upon them that


---------49:38----------
because it's a male-dominated field they


---------49:39----------
should seek to like even that out


---------49:41----------
whereas like really they just


---------49:43----------
sometimes they just don't want to do


---------49:44----------
that and i absolutely see that pressure


---------49:47----------
i think some of it's fair


---------49:48----------
in terms of like discrimination and


---------49:50----------
stuff like that but


---------49:52----------
can't swing too far in the other


---------49:53----------
direction you know yeah


---------49:59----------
i think those fields are overvalued in


---------50:01----------
general so like those are the


---------50:02----------
this is the feeling like if you're a you


---------50:04----------
know second generation immigrant


---------50:07----------
when i was growing up yeah i had a


---------50:09----------
couple of options


---------50:10----------
my dad said to us once


---------50:14----------
one of y'all is going to be a doctor and


---------50:15----------
one of y'all is going to be a lawyer i


---------50:16----------
have an elder brother


---------50:18----------
and what i used to say in my med school


---------50:20----------
interviews when they were like why do


---------50:21----------
you want to become a doctor i said well


---------50:23----------
when i was growing up my dad said one of


---------50:25----------
y'all is going to be a doctor and one of


---------50:26----------
y'all is going to be a lawyer


---------50:27----------
my brother was older and he chose law


---------50:30----------
schools that's why i'm here


---------50:33----------
what do you think um do you think you


---------50:35----------
just got lucky then or do you think that


---------50:36----------
you learned to like


---------50:37----------
accept your profession or why do you


---------50:39----------
think you ended up enjoying what you


---------50:40----------
thought i assume you joey do you see i


---------50:41----------
love what i do


---------50:43----------
uh so i mean i i think so my story is


---------50:46----------
kind of interesting so i started out


---------50:47----------
pre-med but i really


---------50:49----------
wasn't really interested in being a


---------50:52----------
doctor


---------50:52----------
i actually became interested in being a


---------50:54----------
doctor about four


---------50:56----------
years a couple years after truly became


---------50:58----------
interested in being a doctor


---------50:59----------
about two or three years after i


---------51:01----------
finished college


---------51:02----------
and what i realized it was actually part


---------51:04----------
of more my spiritual


---------51:07----------
path more than anything else and then


---------51:10----------
now i think a lot about karma and things


---------51:12----------
like that and i think i'm supposed to be


---------51:14----------
a doctor but


---------51:15----------
um you know for me the decision really


---------51:18----------
changed when


---------51:19----------
my so i tried to become a monk so i


---------51:22----------
tried to


---------51:23----------
like give up my material life and my


---------51:25----------
teachers said


---------51:27----------
you're welcome to do that but you have


---------51:28----------
to get a doctoral degree and you


---------51:30----------
you have to make that choice when you're


---------51:31----------
30. which is really smart of them


---------51:34----------
because at the age of 21 i wasn't really


---------51:35----------
giving up anything i had nothing worth


---------51:37----------
giving up


---------51:37----------
if you really want to become a monk you


---------51:39----------
have to give [ __ ] up and that means


---------51:40----------
building [ __ ] and then walking away


---------51:43----------
right and this is what i see a lot in


---------51:44----------
like also sort of these like


---------51:45----------
pseudo-spiritual people who are like


---------51:48----------
like myself 21 anti-establishment


---------51:52----------
believe that the capitalist world is


---------51:54----------
terrible and they don't want to


---------51:55----------
participate in it


---------51:56----------
and that they're going to devote


---------51:57----------
themselves to spirituality and they're


---------51:59----------
not like really giving up anything


---------52:01----------
they're just saying no to the system


---------52:03----------
because they don't want to play that


---------52:04----------
game


---------52:05----------
yeah and so my teachers are like you


---------52:07----------
know go complete your education and


---------52:10----------
one of my teachers was a neuroscientist


---------52:13----------
a phd in neuroscience another one had a


---------52:14----------
phd in quantum physics


---------52:17----------
and these were like the two monks


---------52:19----------
basically that i learned a lot from or


---------52:21----------
i've had a couple of other people but


---------52:23----------
um and they said you know go finish your


---------52:25----------
education and then


---------52:26----------
if you're interested in your 30 we'll


---------52:28----------
take you one of my other teachers said


---------52:31----------
if you can't actually like succeed in


---------52:33----------
the material world you're not going to


---------52:34----------
succeed in the spiritual world because


---------52:36----------
materialistic success is easier than


---------52:38----------
spiritual success


---------52:40----------
and so then i was like okay i'm going to


---------52:42----------
just pick something arbitrary i might as


---------52:43----------
well become a doctor


---------52:46----------
at the least i'll understand about like


---------52:47----------
the physical body which i think will


---------52:49----------
will help me when i become a monk


---------52:52----------
so i decided okay i just said it almost


---------52:54----------
arbitrarily i was like i'm just gonna


---------52:56----------
become a doctor because that's what i'm


---------52:58----------
gonna do


---------52:58----------
after i finish medical school and stuff


---------53:00----------
like that i'm going to walk away and i'm


---------53:02----------
going to go be a monk


---------53:03----------
and that's really when i decided to


---------53:05----------
become a doctor and gave my all


---------53:07----------
got you i don't know do you have a


---------53:10----------
question


---------53:11----------
yeah no yeah i think it makes sense um


---------53:14----------
it seems like you you had you


---------53:16----------
um i think this sometimes it seems like


---------53:17----------
sometimes we get really really lucky


---------53:19----------
that we stumble into certain people in


---------53:20----------
our lives rather than somebody that


---------53:21----------
could have


---------53:22----------
um i guess put you down another path


---------53:26----------
i i don't know too much about people um


---------53:28----------
in this world of spirituality but it


---------53:29----------
seems like it's possible that you could


---------53:30----------
have wound up with somebody that would


---------53:31----------
have just encouraged you


---------53:32----------
wholeheartedly to drop school and just


---------53:34----------
to pursue the giving up everything


---------53:36----------
lifestyle and that would have turned out


---------53:37----------
not as good for you it seems


---------53:40----------
yeah so i mean there were people who


---------53:41----------
encouraged me


---------53:43----------
for that there were people who


---------53:45----------
encouraged me so i applied to medical


---------53:46----------
school for three years because it's hard


---------53:48----------
to get into med school with a 2.5 gpa


---------53:50----------
and i i got like what i think at the end


---------53:53----------
of two years i had gotten 90 rejections


---------53:57----------
and you know even people who are really


---------53:58----------
close to me advised for me other paths


---------54:01----------
they're like hey man


---------54:03----------
you maybe want to think about doing


---------54:05----------
something else


---------54:06----------
and that's why i say like that's when i


---------54:08----------
really decided to become a doctor


---------54:09----------
because it it was a bad idea to continue


---------54:11----------
like objectively it was bad


---------54:14----------
um and i had other options like i could


---------54:16----------
have gone to the caribbean and places


---------54:17----------
like that but i was like unless i can


---------54:19----------
succeed at this i'm not gonna succeed a


---------54:20----------
vegan monk so i'm gonna


---------54:22----------
keep going to hell with the audience


---------54:26----------
okay


---------54:27----------
now when you do your or go ahead yeah go


---------54:30----------
ahead


---------54:32----------
i mean you had asked i think i i


---------54:35----------
you brought up this point about like you


---------54:37----------
know you're kind of lucky that there are


---------54:38----------
some people in your life and i


---------54:40----------
completely agree and i think a lot about


---------54:42----------
dharma


---------54:42----------
or karma which is something that i've


---------54:45----------
really come to appreciate and respect


---------54:47----------
more and more


---------54:49----------
so i don't really think about it as luck


---------54:51----------
but okay


---------54:53----------
um oh okay hold on because i have a i


---------54:56----------
have a


---------54:57----------
i have one question in terms of like um


---------54:59----------
i wanted to toss that out just for you


---------55:01----------
yeah good yeah because i want to hook


---------55:02----------
onto that um yeah i have a question


---------55:04----------
about like um


---------55:05----------
how how do you decide what level of


---------55:07----------
spirituality to incorporate in your


---------55:09----------
conversations with people such that you


---------55:10----------
feel like it won't turn them off from


---------55:11----------
the conversation


---------55:12----------
you feel like it's a that's like a


---------55:14----------
that's a that's a secondary question but


---------55:15----------
now you brought up the karma thing


---------55:17----------
um so personally for me i try to avoid


---------55:20----------
any idea of like um


---------55:23----------
of like deserved circumstances


---------55:27----------
um because i worry that it leads people


---------55:29----------
down this road


---------55:30----------
of thinking so for instance if you bring


---------55:33----------
up a concept of karma


---------55:34----------
and you had a few awesome mentors um and


---------55:36----------
you you know well that's the universe


---------55:38----------
you know working as it's intended to


---------55:40----------
um what do you say then to like people


---------55:42----------
that are that never found those figures


---------55:44----------
in life like you ever worry that they


---------55:45----------
might take that it's like oh man i guess


---------55:47----------
i either messed up hard in a previous


---------55:48----------
life or i just did something bad in my


---------55:50----------
youth to not earn


---------55:52----------
i guess that mentor like karma didn't


---------55:53----------
pay off for me because i you know i'm a


---------55:55----------
failure


---------55:55----------
how do you how do you balance that out


---------55:57----------
or yeah how do you address yeah that's a


---------55:59----------
great question


---------55:59----------
and it's hard so this is a long


---------56:02----------
conversation if you'll


---------56:03----------
permit me yeah of course so when i was


---------56:06----------
when i was


---------56:08----------
studying in india you know i was


---------56:09----------
learning about all the stuff


---------56:11----------
and karma was something that i sort of


---------56:13----------
had like i didn't believe in like


---------56:15----------
destiny


---------56:16----------
or fate or any of that stuff i'm very


---------56:17----------
scientific like i'm very skeptical


---------56:20----------
so people would sort of talk about it i


---------56:21----------
was like and it just seems like


---------56:23----------
randomness to me


---------56:24----------
and that that the that sentiment was


---------56:27----------
even reinforced by like people that i


---------56:29----------
would talk to right so i was somewhat


---------56:30----------
skeptical so i'd go to like different


---------56:32----------
monks and different people who were


---------56:33----------
studying and i'd talk to them and be


---------56:34----------
like you know what do you think about


---------56:35----------
karma


---------56:36----------
and the most telling thing that made me


---------56:38----------
feel like karma's complete [ __ ] is


---------56:40----------
one person i talked to


---------56:42----------
was like don't tell anyone this but and


---------56:44----------
this was a monk who was like i don't


---------56:46----------
believe in karma i think it's [ __ ]


---------56:48----------
and i was like why do you say that he


---------56:49----------
says i have trouble accepting


---------56:51----------
any system in which


---------56:54----------
if someone gets raped it's their fault


---------56:57----------
yeah


---------56:58----------
or starving children or cancer when


---------57:00----------
you're 25 or anything


---------57:02----------
and i was like that's a damn good point


---------57:04----------
so like i was like


---------57:05----------
okay karma's out the window and it was


---------57:07----------
for like a decade for me because i


---------57:08----------
never saw i could never resolve that


---------57:12----------
like why do


---------57:13----------
bad things happen to good people and


---------57:16----------
people use karma as an explanation


---------57:19----------
and that i think is done i think it's


---------57:22----------
absolutely done


---------57:23----------
and then i don't know when this happened


---------57:25----------
but at some point like something clicked


---------57:27----------
probably through meditation so i think


---------57:28----------
this also gets into


---------57:30----------
like where knowledge comes from so i'd


---------57:32----------
say that a lot of my


---------57:33----------
understanding of karma doesn't come from


---------57:35----------
logic because i think that that stance


---------57:38----------
logically is indefensible and i don't


---------57:39----------
accept it like i'm not willing to


---------57:42----------
believe in any system that says that if


---------57:43----------
something bad


---------57:44----------
bad happens to you it's your fault um


---------57:47----------
which there's problems with that too


---------57:49----------
but so i think that from a very good i


---------57:52----------
mean you make a really strong point that


---------57:53----------
people sort of


---------57:55----------
say that i'm screwed because of my karma


---------57:57----------
which is what a lot of people in india


---------57:58----------
do


---------57:59----------
and like indians and hindus and i find


---------58:02----------
that to be


---------58:02----------
[ __ ] i think it's like it's a very


---------58:05----------
easy way


---------58:06----------
to absolve yourself of all


---------58:08----------
responsibility because it's sort of


---------58:10----------
karma


---------58:10----------
gets equated as destiny or fate right


---------58:14----------
but that's really not what karma is and


---------58:16----------
if you really stop and think about it


---------58:18----------
like here's my understanding of karma


---------58:19----------
it's nothing but newton's


---------58:21----------
third law second law every action has an


---------58:23----------
equal and opposite reaction it's not a


---------58:25----------
principle of


---------58:26----------
destiny or fate it's a principle of


---------58:28----------
science so the people who developed the


---------58:31----------
theory of karma


---------58:32----------
noticed that all actions have reactions


---------58:36----------
right like if i drop a ball it falls and


---------58:39----------
so then they started asking themselves a


---------58:40----------
really interesting question which is


---------58:42----------
like


---------58:42----------
where does that principle stop working


---------58:46----------
right so for earlier today we were


---------58:48----------
talking about


---------58:50----------
why the values that we got instilled and


---------58:53----------
why there are different groups of people


---------58:55----------
and we came up with explanatory causes


---------58:58----------
for the effects that we see


---------59:00----------
materialistic family


---------59:02----------
fun loving family and we said that this


---------59:04----------
has a cause


---------59:05----------
does that make sense yeah of course yeah


---------59:08----------
i understand where we're going


---------59:09----------
right so like physics is like a very


---------59:11----------
clear cause


---------59:12----------
and then we get to these things like


---------59:14----------
psychology which is like ah


---------59:16----------
and then we get to [ __ ] like behavioral


---------59:18----------
economics


---------59:19----------
which is like is there a cause and


---------59:21----------
effect there


---------59:22----------
and generally speaking i think the


---------59:24----------
answer is yes


---------59:26----------
of course yeah there has to be right


---------59:27----------
everything is causal if we believe


---------59:29----------
ah but hold on a second so that's a very


---------59:32----------
bold claim right because if you say that


---------59:34----------
everything is causal


---------59:36----------
do you really mean everything is cause i


---------59:38----------
do i'm a heart determinist yeah


---------59:41----------
i do believe everything so does that


---------59:42----------
mean that you were born to your


---------59:44----------
particular parents


---------59:45----------
is that the effect of a cause yep


---------59:50----------
what's the cause um


---------59:53----------
the the causes of them having sex okay


---------59:56----------
right so so do you bel so that that's


---------59:58----------
that explains the actual biological


---------60:00----------
birth


---------60:00----------
what do you think about like your sense


---------60:02----------
of identity or personality is that also


---------60:04----------
just purely based on


---------60:06----------
the biology of your brain yeah your


---------60:08----------
conscious mind is an emergent property


---------60:10----------
of the underlying


---------60:11----------
neurochemistry or whatever of the brain


---------60:13----------
yeah so that's where i disagree


---------60:15----------
right so i i think that like in my


---------60:17----------
experience


---------60:19----------
so this is the way that i think about


---------60:20----------
people's lives so like


---------60:22----------
i think about let's say let's say i have


---------60:25----------
a fence


---------60:26----------
and i'm standing on one side of the


---------60:27----------
fence and i see a ball


---------60:30----------
come over the fence and all i have is is


---------60:32----------
its downward trajectory


---------60:34----------
all that is observable and


---------60:36----------
scientifically verifiable


---------60:38----------
is the downward trajectory can i


---------60:42----------
know where that ball came from


---------60:45----------
um it depends on how deep you're asking


---------60:48----------
this question i mean the ball could have


---------60:49----------
come from a whole other dimension yeah i


---------60:50----------
mean


---------60:51----------
we don't know just to come over the


---------60:52----------
fence i mean the snapshot would be it


---------60:53----------
came from the next the neighbor's yard


---------60:55----------
right yep and


---------60:56----------
where in the neighbor's yard could i


---------60:57----------
calculate its point of origin


---------61:00----------
i mean assuming you had perfect data


---------61:02----------
about the way that the ball was falling


---------61:03----------
the arc of the angle and everything yes


---------61:04----------
you could yeah


---------61:05----------
even though i have no scientifically


---------61:07----------
verifiable


---------61:08----------
or empirical observation about its


---------61:11----------
origin


---------61:13----------
i'm hesitant to concede that i mean i


---------61:15----------
would argue that if you have the


---------61:16----------
trajectory


---------61:19----------
but that's all we have right all we have


---------61:20----------
is the effect we don't have the cause


---------61:24----------
well but if if we understand the


---------61:26----------
university causal then we would know


---------61:27----------
that that one effect could only be


---------61:28----------
preceded by one particular thing it


---------61:30----------
would necessitate an


---------61:32----------
origin right it must have been launched


---------61:33----------
at a particular um


---------61:35----------
speed and angle right yep right so i


---------61:38----------
think this is where


---------61:40----------
now the question becomes in terms of


---------61:42----------
your experience as a conscious being


---------61:45----------
is so like that's an effect we both


---------61:48----------
agree there the question is what is the


---------61:50----------
cause


---------61:50----------
is it simply neurons in consciousness


---------61:53----------
and so then the question is like do you


---------61:55----------
think that


---------61:56----------
your parents meeting was


---------61:59----------
also like was it random that they met or


---------62:02----------
was there


---------62:03----------
what was their relationship the effect


---------62:05----------
of a prior cause


---------62:07----------
um everything is the effect of a prior


---------62:09----------
cause basically that's what i would say


---------62:10----------
right right so so then we could assume


---------62:12----------
therefore that your consciousness and


---------62:15----------
personality


---------62:16----------
is the downstream effect of causes that


---------62:19----------
happened before


---------62:20----------
you were even born correct the beginning


---------62:22----------
of the universe yeah


---------62:23----------
right so the big difference between


---------62:25----------
karma and science is karma presupposes


---------62:28----------
that some of the things about your life


---------62:30----------
today were determined by things that you


---------62:33----------
were


---------62:33----------
that happened before you were born


---------62:36----------
and science so far generally says no


---------62:39----------
right


---------62:40----------
science says that wait science says know


---------62:43----------
that things that are happening in your


---------62:44----------
life today aren't due to things that


---------62:45----------
happened before you were born


---------62:46----------
not generally right so if you look at


---------62:48----------
like psychology or behavioral economics


---------62:51----------
people don't think about causal factors


---------62:53----------
before you were born


---------62:54----------
in the application of our scientific


---------62:56----------
understanding of an individual human


---------62:58----------
being


---------62:59----------
is that really true though so like for


---------63:01----------
instance like for psychology


---------63:02----------
um if we look at things like or genetics


---------63:05----------
right if you like things like heredity


---------63:06----------
we can talk about the heritability of


---------63:08----------
even political beliefs right


---------63:10----------
beautifully like right so now this is


---------63:12----------
interesting so like let's look at what


---------63:14----------
traditionally karma has said and what


---------63:17----------
science says now because i think


---------63:18----------
genetics


---------63:19----------
is the first scientific evidence of the


---------63:21----------
theory of karma


---------63:23----------
because just think about this we


---------63:24----------
generally say that your life is like


---------63:27----------
you know determined by like stuff now


---------63:29----------
and is not


---------63:30----------
influenced by things from the past


---------63:32----------
that's how we look at our lives


---------63:33----------
and genetics is the first scientific so


---------63:37----------
think put yourself 200 years ago


---------63:40----------
right so we can't think about ourselves


---------63:41----------
now and what if i told you that like


---------63:44----------
who you are today is determined by


---------63:46----------
things before you were being


---------63:48----------
i mean i would fully agree with that i


---------63:50----------
feel like i feel like the scientific


---------63:52----------
evidence though tends to take that point


---------63:54----------
of view that who you are today is


---------63:55----------
usually an amalgamation of stuff that


---------63:57----------
happened prior to your birth


---------63:58----------
so for instance are you born to a


---------64:00----------
single-parent household what what is the


---------64:01----------
socio-economic status of your family in


---------64:02----------
the united states like i would view


---------64:03----------
those factors as being like majorly


---------64:05----------
important in the formation of this


---------64:06----------
person


---------64:06----------
yeah yeah so so we are today but what


---------64:08----------
i'm saying is like put yourself 200


---------64:10----------
years ago before we had the discovery of


---------64:11----------
genetics because like


---------64:12----------
generally speaking science says like


---------64:14----------
here is the now and the past


---------64:17----------
tends to be filled with randomness and


---------64:18----------
may not be like associated with the now


---------64:23----------
i mean i don't agree with that obviously


---------64:24----------
but i mean i i don't i mean the true


---------64:26----------
sense science doesn't say that right


---------64:27----------
because we have big bang theory and we


---------64:29----------
have gravity and all this kind of stuff


---------64:30----------
but if you look at the application of


---------64:31----------
science and the theory of karma all of


---------64:33----------
the theory of karma says is that


---------64:34----------
there's stuff in prior to this birth


---------64:37----------
that affects you in this birth


---------64:38----------
and that's the idea of reincarnation


---------64:40----------
that you carry karma from your past life


---------64:42----------
and stuff like that


---------64:43----------
all it's saying is that there's stuff


---------64:44----------
that's happened in the past which sounds


---------64:45----------
radical if i were to tell you that


---------64:47----------
destiny things from your past life


---------64:49----------
affect for example the fact that nathan


---------64:51----------
is your son


---------64:53----------
what would you see um well now i guess


---------64:56----------
it's getting into what do we consider


---------64:57----------
past life right now so what do you mean


---------64:59----------
by that what


---------64:59----------
prior causes are we talking about


---------65:01----------
exactly right so this is


---------65:03----------
this is where the border so karma used


---------65:05----------
to be like super crazy


---------65:07----------
and the more that we learn in science so


---------65:09----------
this is the way that i kind of think


---------65:10----------
about it there's like order in the


---------65:11----------
universe and there's chaos


---------65:13----------
and like a thousand or two thousand


---------65:15----------
years ago most of the universe was chaos


---------65:17----------
and very little of it was order


---------65:19----------
the reason that lightning happened was


---------65:21----------
because of zeus there's a whimsical god


---------65:23----------
in the sky who sometimes gets pissed off


---------65:25----------
and throws lightning bolts at the ground


---------65:27----------
and then as our scientific increasing is


---------65:29----------
understanding


---------65:31----------
is grown we've demystified a lot of


---------65:33----------
stuff and we added order into our


---------65:35----------
universe


---------65:37----------
so at some point the question is this


---------65:39----------
kind of comes back to i'm lucky that


---------65:41----------
there were certain influences in my life


---------65:44----------
is there order to me meeting the people


---------65:47----------
that i met


---------65:48----------
is there an explanatory reason that we


---------65:51----------
can deduce for


---------65:52----------
why those people are in my life and


---------65:54----------
other people don't have those people


---------65:56----------
that was your original question what do


---------65:58----------
you think


---------65:59----------
yes of course right so that's karma


---------66:03----------
okay so my so the original contention


---------66:06----------
the original problem that i have is that


---------66:08----------
my problem with karma is that usually


---------66:11----------
now maybe


---------66:11----------
maybe it's possible you don't view it


---------66:13----------
this way which is good if you don't


---------66:14----------
but the problem that i have with this is


---------66:16----------
that karma often carries with it


---------66:18----------
this idea of moral weight uh it's wrong


---------66:22----------
what absolutely wrong yeah yeah i


---------66:24----------
understand that but i'm saying that to


---------66:25----------
99 of people without your explanation


---------66:28----------
karma to them will have a moral weight


---------66:29----------
so for instance like a wealthy person


---------66:31----------
will see a poor


---------66:32----------
person and think well that's karma you


---------66:33----------
know they earned their place in life and


---------66:35----------
i earned my place in life


---------66:36----------
rather than viewing karma as like a


---------66:38----------
billion antecedent causes that


---------66:40----------
eventually led down to a chain of


---------66:41----------
whatever they are today i i think i


---------66:44----------
think i must right i must


---------66:46----------
subscribe to your idea of karma given


---------66:47----------
the way you've explained it it just


---------66:49----------
feels like a lot of people view karma a


---------66:50----------
lot differently than what your


---------66:51----------
explanation would have yeah so i mean i


---------66:53----------
tend to be somewhat arrogant


---------66:54----------
but i think those people are wrong sure


---------66:58----------
right so i i think that karma is not and


---------67:00----------
this is what i've like


---------67:01----------
learned through meditation so i think my


---------67:02----------
understanding of karma


---------67:04----------
doesn't come from like logic or reading


---------67:07----------
it comes from meditation


---------67:09----------
and it comes from the realization that


---------67:10----------
karma in its essence


---------67:12----------
is no different from i keep on


---------67:14----------
forgetting


---------67:15----------
which of newton's laws it is but that


---------67:17----------
that you know every action has an equal


---------67:19----------
and opposite reaction


---------67:21----------
and that it's just the fundamental


---------67:22----------
principle of cause and effect that's


---------67:24----------
what karma is it's nothing more


---------67:25----------
nothing less the only thing the only


---------67:27----------
reason it sounds wild is because it


---------67:29----------
presumes that some of the effects in


---------67:31----------
this life come from things that are not


---------67:33----------
observable


---------67:34----------
by this person in his current state of


---------67:36----------
consciousness


---------67:37----------
gotcha okay but it has no moral so this


---------67:41----------
is the other confusing thing so karma


---------67:43----------
doesn't truly have morality


---------67:45----------
we're the ones who so what karma says is


---------67:48----------
this is also


---------67:49----------
not a great way of putting it but let's


---------67:50----------
just concede it for a second what goes


---------67:52----------
around comes around


---------67:54----------
and so the reason that something bad


---------67:55----------
happened to you is because you did


---------67:56----------
something bad


---------67:57----------
we're the ones that place the value


---------67:59----------
judge right if i


---------68:01----------
if i like hit myself in the face with


---------68:04----------
a tennis racket i'm the one who says


---------68:07----------
that that's a bad thing because i place


---------68:09----------
the value judgment


---------68:10----------
all karma says is that if you do a then


---------68:12----------
b will happen


---------68:13----------
it's just cause and effect we're the


---------68:15----------
ones who place the morality on top of it


---------68:17----------
the theory of karma has nothing to do


---------68:18----------
with morality


---------68:19----------
it just says you reap what you sow yeah


---------68:22----------
i understand that as


---------68:23----------
people though humans moralize everything


---------68:25----------
so it's


---------68:26----------
yeah this can be kind of hard to address


---------68:27----------
a concept like that i guess like an


---------68:29----------
immoral vacuum or whatever because it


---------68:30----------
seems like people are very quick to


---------68:31----------
moralize


---------68:32----------
everything literally it's a frustration


---------68:34----------
that i have i guess yes


---------68:36----------
um i'm quick to moralize as well and


---------68:38----------
that's dharma


---------68:39----------
dharma okay right so taraba and karma


---------68:42----------
are linked


---------68:43----------
but karma isn't has nothing to do with


---------68:45----------
morality dharma absolutely does


---------68:48----------
gotcha okay um


---------68:52----------
i don't know how much time you have so


---------68:53----------
just tell me you need to


---------68:55----------
take off okay um how do you decide


---------68:59----------
to uh how do you decide what level of


---------69:01----------
spirituality to incorporate


---------69:03----------
in your discussions with people or i


---------69:06----------
imagine there must have been some point


---------69:07----------
in your life


---------69:08----------
um when you were either in school or


---------69:09----------
when you first started practicing when


---------69:11----------
you were like


---------69:12----------
i'm going to be this spiritual or i'm


---------69:13----------
not going to bring this up at all or


---------69:15----------
what like how what was that thought


---------69:16----------
process like


---------69:17----------
yeah so it's evolved over time so it


---------69:19----------
starts with when i was applying to


---------69:20----------
medical school


---------69:22----------
and having someone who is writing me a


---------69:24----------
letter of recommendation strategize with


---------69:25----------
me about how much to talk about


---------69:27----------
complementing alternative medicine


---------69:29----------
so like we don't know how much we want


---------69:31----------
you to talk about yoga because like if


---------69:32----------
you talk about yoga and ayurveda


---------69:34----------
like they may not like that because they


---------69:36----------
look they're gonna think you're like


---------69:37----------
hokey


---------69:38----------
sure and so i talked about it less


---------69:42----------
and then after you know my third year


---------69:45----------
that i applied


---------69:46----------
i was like you know what this is just


---------69:47----------
who i am it's a big part of


---------69:50----------
who i am so i'm going to talk about it


---------69:51----------
and if they like it that's great i don't


---------69:53----------
want to wind up at a medical school


---------69:54----------
where i have to like hide part of who i


---------69:56----------
am


---------69:56----------
so that was like kind of the first step


---------69:59----------
and then at that point i think


---------70:00----------
complementing alternative medicine was


---------70:02----------
becoming like more evidence-based so


---------70:03----------
this was back in


---------70:05----------
2008 2009-ish


---------70:09----------
and and so by then like you know people


---------70:11----------
like there were yoga studios cropping up


---------70:13----------
people were really starting to do


---------70:14----------
research um


---------70:17----------
and uh so that was kind of the first


---------70:19----------
because i think complementary


---------70:20----------
alternative medicine and spirituality in


---------70:22----------
some ways go hand in hand


---------70:24----------
um and then during residency


---------70:29----------
so then you know when i was applying


---------70:31----------
after


---------70:32----------
medical school i focused on


---------70:33----------
evidence-based complementary and


---------70:35----------
alternative medicine because i still


---------70:36----------
tend to be like


---------70:37----------
pretty scientific and evidence-based i'm


---------70:38----------
not like a hokey


---------70:40----------
you know yoga hippie kind of dude like i


---------70:42----------
do yoga


---------70:44----------
in a more rigorous scientific and


---------70:46----------
calculated way


---------70:48----------
um and then


---------70:51----------
then in residency it was interesting


---------70:53----------
because i sort of basically didn't do


---------70:55----------
much of it


---------70:56----------
and there were i had a couple of


---------70:57----------
experiences where i was like sort of


---------70:59----------
testing the waters


---------71:01----------
so i was being taught therapy and one of


---------71:04----------
my


---------71:04----------
so i started to like spread my wings a


---------71:07----------
little bit and incorporate some eastern


---------71:08----------
philosophy


---------71:09----------
meditation some of these concepts like


---------71:11----------
karma not karma because that's like


---------71:13----------
really unscientific


---------71:14----------
but i started to spread my wings a


---------71:16----------
little bit and then actually found that


---------71:19----------
um you know got some negative pushback


---------71:22----------
from some people so one of my therapy


---------71:24----------
supervisors so when you're training to


---------71:25----------
become a psychiatrist


---------71:26----------
you have supervisors who like supervise


---------71:28----------
you in therapy so i go and i do therapy


---------71:30----------
with my patients


---------71:31----------
and then you go and you talk to your


---------71:33----------
therapy supervisor and sometimes they


---------71:34----------
sit in and they watch you do therapy


---------71:36----------
so one of my therapy supervisors said


---------71:40----------
i don't know if i can supervise you


---------71:41----------
because i don't know what you're doing


---------71:43----------
but it's not therapy


---------71:46----------
and i was kind of taken aback and i was


---------71:47----------
like i'm not sure what you mean and then


---------71:49----------
she was saying like yeah like you're


---------71:50----------
doing something


---------71:51----------
but it's not therapy like you're it


---------71:53----------
seems helpful so i'm not saying it's bad


---------71:55----------
it's just not therapy and so i talked to


---------71:59----------
my


---------71:59----------
program and stuff about that and they


---------72:01----------
were like thankfully they were pretty


---------72:02----------
supportive and they're like yeah


---------72:04----------
so this is i think the first time that


---------72:05----------
i've ever heard of this happening where


---------72:07----------
sometimes


---------72:07----------
you know residents will complain about


---------72:09----------
their supervisors that happens all the


---------72:10----------
time


---------72:11----------
because we tend to be like a fickle and


---------72:13----------
[ __ ] little bunch


---------72:16----------
but it's rare that like you know it's


---------72:18----------
it's common that you'll have


---------72:20----------
students complain to a teacher


---------72:23----------
i mean complain about teachers it's very


---------72:25----------
rare to have a teacher well maybe not


---------72:27----------
that rare but you know it's less common


---------72:30----------
for a


---------72:30----------
a teacher to say i can't have this


---------72:33----------
student in my class anymore


---------72:35----------
especially when you're like a resident


---------72:36----------
so it's not like you know kids with


---------72:38----------
behavioral problems when they're eight


---------72:39----------
but we tend to be like well-functioning


---------72:42----------
human beings and so thankfully my


---------72:43----------
program found me sort of a different


---------72:45----------
supervisor who was more comfortable with


---------72:47----------
me kind of doing my own thing


---------72:49----------
and then over time i sort of dabbled


---------72:52----------
into the waters and what i tended to


---------72:53----------
find


---------72:55----------
which is weird um is that the more i


---------72:58----------
included spirituality like the better my


---------73:00----------
patients got


---------73:03----------
and that too is i i don't necessarily


---------73:05----------
think it's because i'm


---------73:06----------
that much better of a psychiatrist but i


---------73:08----------
think people would come to me


---------73:09----------
with these issues like i lack happiness


---------73:11----------
in my life


---------73:13----------
and that's not the same as having major


---------73:14----------
depressive disorder


---------73:16----------
sure so over time i've included more and


---------73:18----------
more spirituality in general like on


---------73:20----------
twitch i was never planning on talking


---------73:22----------
about


---------73:22----------
i thought i would be eating a lot by


---------73:24----------
twitch i had


---------73:26----------
when i started streaming on twitch i had


---------73:28----------
an army of scientific articles to back


---------73:31----------
up why


---------73:32----------
i think meditation and yoga is good like


---------73:35----------
all kinds of stuff like even chanting


---------73:37----------
why chanting because it's such a strange


---------73:39----------
meditation technique the scientific


---------73:41----------
evidence behind why i recommend chanting


---------73:44----------
so for all the practices that i do i had


---------73:46----------
like all this science


---------73:48----------
and what i was stunned is that what


---------73:50----------
people seem to be


---------73:51----------
what people ask me about is not in


---------73:53----------
neuroscience people ask me about his


---------73:55----------
dharma how do i find my dharma


---------73:57----------
how do i find purpose how do i find


---------73:58----------
meaning people identify with like


---------74:00----------
stories and narratives way more than


---------74:02----------
52 percent of 72 percent of whatever


---------74:04----------
scientific article generally is what i


---------74:06----------
find


---------74:06----------
i think that's actually an unfair


---------74:08----------
characterization because i don't think


---------74:09----------
that


---------74:10----------
story or narrative is what i talk about


---------74:12----------
in terms of


---------74:14----------
so i i think i don't think that that one


---------74:16----------
is just the story and the other isn't


---------74:18----------
like i think the two are not really yeah


---------74:20----------
i don't mean to sound dismissive when i


---------74:21----------
say story or narrative what i mean is it


---------74:22----------
like


---------74:23----------
some something that you can tell


---------74:24----------
somebody that they can like emotionally


---------74:26----------
hook into


---------74:27----------
and like personally identify or


---------74:29----------
empathize with is going to stick with


---------74:31----------
somebody's mind way more than


---------74:32----------
being read like some numbers off the


---------74:34----------
study is kind of the way that i view it


---------74:36----------
yeah but when i read numbers off of a


---------74:38----------
study it's emotionally


---------74:40----------
it sinks in too you okay i find i find


---------74:43----------
that that experience


---------74:45----------
seems to not be the case as much that um


---------74:48----------
let's say for instance yeah so your go


---------74:50----------
ahead


---------74:51----------
yeah i mean i agree with you that that's


---------74:53----------
not the case as much


---------74:55----------
but when i cite studies i do so in the


---------74:57----------
same way that i cite spirituality which


---------74:59----------
is in theme with my general narrative


---------75:02----------
sure okay right so i agree that studies


---------75:05----------
are drier but like that's why like when


---------75:06----------
you cite a study you have to do it at


---------75:08----------
the right time


---------75:09----------
and then it gives you oomph to the story


---------75:12----------
i just thought that i would be citing


---------75:13----------
way more studies than scriptures


---------75:16----------
when i was adding oomph to my points and


---------75:19----------
what twitch seems to be more interested


---------75:20----------
in actually is like spirituality which


---------75:22----------
doesn't mean that they're not interested


---------75:23----------
in the science


---------75:25----------
but anyway i didn't mean to cut you off


---------75:27----------
i just


---------75:28----------
there was something about that premise


---------75:29----------
which i didn't feel was fair


---------75:31----------
sure okay do you um for


---------75:34----------
one one of the big complaints that i


---------75:36----------
hear about people that are pursuing like


---------75:37----------
mental health related stuff is that


---------75:38----------
there's a very brutal game of trying to


---------75:40----------
find


---------75:41----------
the right therapist um so either


---------75:43----------
somebody that you feel like understands


---------75:44----------
you or doesn't judge you or is


---------75:46----------
empathizing with you


---------75:47----------
in a way that like i guess like rings or


---------75:50----------
resonates with you more


---------75:51----------
um how do you suggest two questions on


---------75:54----------
this


---------75:55----------
um how do you suggest somebody it sounds


---------75:57----------
bad but like shops for a therapist like


---------75:59----------
what's the best way to find a therapist


---------76:00----------
um and then how can you tell when you


---------76:02----------
have a therapist that is


---------76:04----------
challenging you appropriately versus


---------76:06----------
somebody that you just like don't click


---------76:07----------
with at all


---------76:08----------
um yeah great question so first question


---------76:11----------
is how do you shop for a therapist so


---------76:13----------
what i recommend that people do so


---------76:14----------
there's


---------76:14----------
resource concerns about this right so


---------76:17----------
that has to be taken into account


---------76:18----------
but what i recommend that people do is


---------76:20----------
is make appointments with three


---------76:22----------
different therapists


---------76:24----------
and you pick the one that like who's the


---------76:25----------
webpage you like the most


---------76:30----------
what is going on


---------76:34----------
i'm confused by twitch chat sorry oh


---------76:36----------
yeah i just got turned off with sub mode


---------76:37----------
so


---------76:38----------
everybody's free again okay i'm going to


---------76:40----------
just minimize that because


---------76:42----------
um but so i was like oh freedom


---------76:47----------
and i thought we were talking about how


---------76:48----------
to find therapists and i was like really


---------76:49----------
confused


---------76:51----------
but so i'd say like make three


---------76:53----------
appointments and pick your


---------76:55----------
you know your top choice first because


---------76:57----------
therapy is about fit


---------76:59----------
and then you know i'd space them out by


---------77:01----------
like two weeks


---------77:03----------
and um you know when you find someone


---------77:05----------
that like at the end of the session if


---------77:07----------
you feel like you can talk to them


---------77:08----------
and they kind of get you


---------77:11----------
if it feels good to you then cancel the


---------77:13----------
others


---------77:15----------
um and then or or c3 and then pick the


---------77:17----------
one that you fit


---------77:18----------
the best now how do you know if you're


---------77:21----------
being appropriately challenged so i


---------77:22----------
think the main thing that people need to


---------77:23----------
understand about therapy is that


---------77:25----------
if you have a problem in therapy


---------77:30----------
unlike pretty much any other place it's


---------77:32----------
the one place where you can go


---------77:34----------
and you can just tell your therapist


---------77:35----------
that you have a problem with them


---------77:38----------
you can walk in and you can say i feel


---------77:39----------
like this is a [ __ ] waste of my time


---------77:41----------
and i feel like you're just taking my


---------77:42----------
[ __ ] money and as a therapist


---------77:44----------
when people do that i'm like awesome


---------77:48----------
good and let give your therapist the


---------77:51----------
benefit


---------77:52----------
of understanding your difficulty


---------77:56----------
and letting them work on it like if you


---------77:58----------
have a problem with a therapist tell


---------77:59----------
them


---------77:59----------
so i think i think you're you know i'm a


---------78:02----------
man and you're a woman and i don't think


---------78:04----------
you can ever understand what my


---------78:05----------
experience as a man


---------78:06----------
is like in this world i don't think that


---------78:09----------
seeing you is gonna mean anything like


---------78:10----------
i'm not going to get anything out of


---------78:11----------
this


---------78:12----------
just go to your therapist and tell them


---------78:13----------
that


---------78:15----------
because i think the big thing that


---------78:16----------
people don't understand is they think


---------78:17----------
that a therapist


---------78:18----------
like has a good fit i mean so i tell you


---------78:21----------
to find a fit but i think the main thing


---------78:22----------
that


---------78:23----------
you need to understand about therapy is


---------78:24----------
that like in order for therapy to work


---------78:27----------
the two of you have to work together at


---------78:29----------
solving your problem


---------78:31----------
and if your first problem is that you


---------78:32----------
don't fit that's the thing that you guys


---------78:34----------
need to solve how can you guys make it


---------78:36----------
so that the two of you fit


---------78:39----------
and the the the patients that i tend to


---------78:41----------
find the most frustrating


---------78:43----------
are the ones that don't tell me what's


---------78:45----------
wrong they're hiding thoughts because


---------78:47----------
they think you won't understand or they


---------78:48----------
just don't trust


---------78:49----------
whatever yeah and like one you know


---------78:53----------
anyway yeah so i've had some experiences


---------78:56----------
where then they'll because they like


---------78:57----------
like me


---------78:58----------
so that you don't want to criticize


---------78:59----------
someone and they're like i didn't want


---------79:00----------
to say like


---------79:01----------
you know this hurt my feelings you got


---------79:03----------
to tell me man


---------79:05----------
what if you have a friend that is


---------79:08----------
struggling with mental illness


---------79:10----------
in terms of how you view the normal


---------79:11----------
population what is like what are a


---------79:13----------
couple ways that you can be


---------79:15----------
supportive to that person that you feel


---------79:16----------
like a lot of people miss


---------79:18----------
i caught you talking about using


---------79:19----------
reflective language for instance instead


---------79:21----------
of invalidating somebody's feelings that


---------79:22----------
seemed like a really helpful tip


---------79:24----------
um do you have any other like things


---------79:25----------
like that where it's like when somebody


---------79:26----------
hears this from a mentally ill person


---------79:28----------
most people do this but you should


---------79:29----------
actually do that


---------79:30----------
are there any things like that um that


---------79:32----------
you know of offhand


---------79:33----------
yeah so i think the first is don't


---------79:35----------
underestimate your impact so this is a


---------79:37----------
very very common mistake that humans


---------79:39----------
make


---------79:39----------
so like let's say you invite a friend to


---------79:41----------
a party and they say no i don't


---------79:43----------
no thank you and then you invite them


---------79:46----------
again and they say no thank you again


---------79:48----------
and you invite them a third time and


---------79:49----------
they say no


---------79:50----------
thank you you assume that they don't


---------79:52----------
want to be invited


---------79:55----------
right but the truth is that your


---------79:57----------
invitation


---------79:58----------
in and of itself can mean a lot like


---------80:00----------
they can have social anxiety or they can


---------80:01----------
be busy


---------80:02----------
and they can feel like oh it's like


---------80:03----------
really nice that he keeps inviting me


---------80:06----------
even though i can't go and for for


---------80:09----------
friends who are struggling with mental


---------80:10----------
illness you know you can


---------80:12----------
even like kind of asking them like hey


---------80:14----------
is there some way that i can support you


---------80:15----------
and they say no i'm fine


---------80:17----------
and then you ask again is there some way


---------80:18----------
i can support you and they say no i'm


---------80:20----------
fine


---------80:21----------
the fact that you're asking even though


---------80:23----------
you don't see it


---------80:24----------
helping doesn't mean that it isn't


---------80:27----------
incredibly healthy


---------80:29----------
so i think the biggest mistake that


---------80:31----------
people tend to make is they


---------80:33----------
undervalue their own contribution to a


---------80:36----------
relationship


---------80:37----------
because they don't see a change in the


---------80:39----------
relationship because of their efforts


---------80:42----------
but especially with mental illness if


---------80:44----------
you're doing something


---------80:45----------
and they don't seem to be changing at


---------80:47----------
all you could actually be what's keeping


---------80:49----------
them afloat


---------80:50----------
because generally speaking mental


---------80:51----------
illness has a downward trend


---------80:54----------
so even if you're like hey man do you


---------80:55----------
want to talk every now and then and they


---------80:57----------
seem to be doing like the same level of


---------80:58----------
depression you are there's


---------81:01----------
i mean generally speaking you're


---------81:02----------
probably grossly underestimating how


---------81:05----------
helpful you actually are to that person


---------81:08----------
okay so i'd say just you know do what


---------81:11----------
you think is right as a friend


---------81:13----------
and don't get biased by the perception


---------81:16----------
that it's not working


---------81:18----------
gotcha which is bizarre right by the


---------81:21----------
perception that it isn't working because


---------81:22----------
it seems like it's not working so why


---------81:24----------
would you continue doing it but it has


---------81:25----------
immense value


---------81:26----------
gotcha because there's some internal um


---------81:29----------
improvement that's happening there's an


---------81:30----------
intervention there that feels good even


---------81:31----------
if you don't see like an external change


---------81:33----------
of behavior


---------81:33----------
exactly even though they never come to


---------81:35----------
your party


---------81:37----------
you make them feel wanted and cared for


---------81:41----------
which is hard to see and it's also hard


---------81:43----------
for them to express


---------81:46----------
and this is also where you can just kind


---------81:47----------
of check in with them hey i keep on


---------81:48----------
asking if you want to come to


---------81:50----------
the parties or not i'm not sure if


---------81:51----------
you're busy or what like do you want me


---------81:53----------
to keep inviting you just ask them


---------81:56----------
yeah like please let me know when you


---------81:57----------
have a party


---------81:59----------
okay um how do you determine um


---------82:04----------
one of the most frustrating parts about


---------82:05----------
mental stuff is that you can't force


---------82:07----------
people obviously to do things they have


---------82:08----------
to make the choices on their own


---------82:10----------
um what level of um


---------82:13----------
intervention i guess um all right


---------82:17----------
let's say that you have a friend oh use


---------82:18----------
an example you have a friend with like


---------82:19----------
really big social anxiety right


---------82:20----------
um and you know that they've been like


---------82:22----------
they are trying to like see more people


---------82:25----------
like in larger groups of friends or


---------82:26----------
whatever um how do like


---------82:29----------
is it is is should you make some


---------82:31----------
positive effort to like kind of push


---------82:33----------
them


---------82:33----------
like more or do you leave that entirely


---------82:35----------
in their court and you just don't ever


---------82:37----------
push at all


---------82:38----------
or or like say you have a friend with


---------82:39----------
depression or whatever i know like for


---------82:40----------
instance like reckful would stay in bed


---------82:42----------
sometimes for months because he was so


---------82:43----------
depressed he would never get out


---------82:44----------
like do you ever like show up at that


---------82:46----------
person's house it's like get up we're


---------82:48----------
going outside like come on


---------82:49----------
like do you think that those types of


---------82:50----------
interventions are responsible or do you


---------82:52----------
think that you're depriving the other


---------82:53----------
person of their own


---------82:54----------
choices too much or how do you view


---------82:57----------
stuff like that like when can you make a


---------82:58----------
determination as we're not professionals


---------83:01----------
um for when like you like should


---------83:02----------
intervene a little bit more to help


---------83:03----------
somebody that's kind of struggling with


---------83:04----------
that kind of stuff what do you think


---------83:07----------
what's your compass um


---------83:12----------
i i guess the way that i view it is that


---------83:14----------
if i feel like if i feel like somebody


---------83:15----------
is engaging in a behavior


---------83:17----------
that seems to me to just be incredibly


---------83:20----------
destructive


---------83:21----------
and or self-destructive i guess and it


---------83:23----------
doesn't seem like


---------83:24----------
there is any benefit for them to


---------83:25----------
continue to pursue that behavior


---------83:27----------
and if i have evidence in the past that


---------83:30----------
intervening


---------83:31----------
seems to have positive impacts so for


---------83:33----------
instance i know that sometimes people


---------83:35----------
will be depressed they don't want to


---------83:36----------
come out like but every time you get


---------83:38----------
them out they seem to have a really good


---------83:39----------
experience and they'll even admit as


---------83:41----------
much


---------83:41----------
um that like usually those are the types


---------83:43----------
of interventions i would try to push for


---------83:44----------
because i know that if i can at least


---------83:45----------
get them to move a little bit that


---------83:46----------
they'll start to feel better before


---------83:48----------
having moved yeah


---------83:49----------
sounds like a great answer to me okay


---------83:53----------
right so i i think that this is where


---------83:57----------
um this also leads to a lot of confusion


---------83:59----------
i i think that


---------84:00----------
sometimes we forget that mental health


---------84:03----------
is more than


---------84:04----------
treatment in fact it's so much more than


---------84:07----------
treatment


---------84:09----------
and friendship is one of the best things


---------84:11----------
that you can do for someone mental


---------84:13----------
health


---------84:14----------
right like you can look at studies that


---------84:16----------
show i mean so


---------84:19----------
you know you can look at studies with


---------84:20----------
like pets and like pets improve


---------84:23----------
cardiovascular health they improve


---------84:24----------
mental health


---------84:25----------
it's not a treatment it's not medicine


---------84:27----------
but it can still


---------84:28----------
help immensely and so i think you should


---------84:31----------
think about what your dharma


---------84:32----------
or duty as a friend is


---------84:36----------
and that dharma is going to be different


---------84:37----------
from the dharma of a mental health


---------84:39----------
profession


---------84:40----------
because it is grossly inappropriate for


---------84:42----------
me to show up at my patient's door


---------84:45----------
right it's like what if they just like


---------84:47----------
are they depressed or do they think i'm


---------84:49----------
a [ __ ] [ __ ] and just stopped


---------84:51----------
taking my calls and responding to my


---------84:53----------
emails


---------84:54----------
so i think you should do your duty as a


---------84:56----------
friend


---------84:57----------
and if that means showing up and


---------84:59----------
crossing certain boundaries that maybe a


---------85:01----------
mental health professional can't cross


---------85:03----------
because then that's okay i mean i think


---------85:06----------
that that's


---------85:07----------
that's what friends are for right okay


---------85:10----------
and and i think the main thing to think


---------85:13----------
about there is


---------85:13----------
you know just to really be very careful


---------85:15----------
about examining your own feelings and


---------85:17----------
also to check in with them


---------85:20----------
about you know like i i think friends


---------85:23----------
need to learn like just in general as


---------85:25----------
a society we need to learn to have like


---------85:27----------
more conversations


---------85:30----------
about you know the the meta level of our


---------85:33----------
relationship


---------85:34----------
yeah i notice that we rely a lot on


---------85:37----------
context clues


---------85:38----------
or on body language sometimes when like


---------85:41----------
people um


---------85:42----------
because of all the sexual assault


---------85:44----------
allegations we went over a lot of this


---------85:45----------
and


---------85:46----------
um the answer that i always give for 99


---------85:48----------
of like confusion and i'm sure


---------85:50----------
everybody's talking about relationships


---------85:51----------
thing is like just have a conversation


---------85:52----------
like just talk about this like


---------85:54----------
have like why would you try to guess


---------85:55----------
like don't try to figure out like


---------85:57----------
how they're feeling or like just talk


---------85:58----------
about it like have a conversation is the


---------86:00----------
easiest way to


---------86:01----------
elucidate you know like the issues and


---------86:02----------
it seems like so many people don't do


---------86:03----------
that


---------86:04----------
have any of those meta-level


---------86:05----------
conversations about any of their


---------86:06----------
relationships sexual or non-sexual or


---------86:08----------
friendships anything yeah


---------86:09----------
yeah we just don't talk about it what's


---------86:12----------
our relationship


---------86:15----------
um you and me um


---------86:18----------
a quasi-friendly quasi-professional


---------86:21----------
i guess we'd talk on streaming yeah i


---------86:22----------
enjoyed talking to you yeah yeah


---------86:25----------
okay and so i think of us as


---------86:28----------
colleagues on the road to becoming


---------86:30----------
friends okay


---------86:33----------
you play dota though not league right


---------86:35----------
yeah so you know


---------86:36----------
significant road bump but


---------86:42----------
can't have everything yeah


---------86:45----------
um let's see i'm trying to think of have


---------86:47----------
you played


---------86:49----------
um i are you um do you know the sunken


---------86:52----------
cost rule


---------86:54----------
yeah yeah something i'll see it's not a


---------86:56----------
fallacy okay i've sunk too much time


---------86:58----------
into league to ever learn another game i


---------87:00----------
can't


---------87:00----------
switch now even if even if switching at


---------87:02----------
this point in my life would produce


---------87:03----------
better outcomes for me


---------87:04----------
just can't okay i'm dug into league i'm


---------87:06----------
sorry you won't catch me saying this


---------87:08----------
anywhere else dusty but


---------87:09----------
it's not it seems to me like they're


---------87:10----------
both great games really


---------87:13----------
yeah oh man i have such a my view of


---------87:16----------
humanity worsens every time i get into a


---------87:17----------
new


---------87:18----------
a new lobby but okay i admire your


---------87:22----------
new lobby and law yes no i mean that's


---------87:25----------
all i agree with


---------87:25----------
i i think the fact that you're your view


---------87:27----------
of humanity but that has nothing to the


---------87:29----------
game that has to do with the


---------87:30----------
the players oh i mean the game itself is


---------87:33----------
okay


---------87:34----------
the game itself was pretty good but


---------87:36----------
unfortunately you have to do it


---------87:37----------
nine other people god willing alongside


---------87:40----------
you uh going after hopefully the same


---------87:42----------
goals but


---------87:42----------
well i mean hopefully five of them are


---------87:44----------
not going after the same goal as you


---------87:46----------
yeah oh yeah sure yeah but


---------87:50----------
um what is your what is your end goal


---------87:53----------
with your


---------87:54----------
you talk a lot about the organization


---------87:56----------
that you kind of have with all the


---------87:56----------
people that you're


---------87:57----------
training up to be counselors or like


---------88:00----------
what what


---------88:01----------
capacity coaches okay coaches um


---------88:05----------
what capacity do you want the


---------88:06----------
organization to serve in the future like


---------88:07----------
what's your end goal with that


---------88:09----------
like realistic end goal and then like


---------88:10----------
dream end goal i guess so


---------88:12----------
it's interesting so the the short answer


---------88:14----------
is i don't have an end goal because this


---------88:16----------
thing was never


---------88:18----------
conceived to go to a particular place


---------88:21----------
right so the first question you asked me


---------88:22----------
is like what did you expect from twitch


---------88:26----------
and have you been surprised and the


---------88:28----------
answer is i expected


---------88:29----------
i don't i don't even remember what i


---------88:30----------
expected but the short answer was not


---------88:32----------
much and i've been very surprised


---------88:35----------
so it's weird like because because


---------88:39----------
i mean every step of the way has been in


---------88:41----------
trying to figure out


---------88:43----------
like what is the next step i need to


---------88:45----------
take it's really not about an income


---------88:48----------
and the reason we started the coaching


---------88:49----------
program is because i got thousands of


---------88:51----------
requests per month for people like


---------88:53----------
hey can i talk to dr k like i'll


---------88:57----------
pay you any amount of money for just one


---------88:59----------
hour of your time


---------89:00----------
and as lucrative as that may be


---------89:04----------
you know i didn't think i could actually


---------89:06----------
help people so then the question becomes


---------89:07----------
so one of my friends i was talking to


---------89:09----------
one of my colleagues is also a


---------89:10----------
psychiatrist


---------89:11----------
and she was saying like jokingly like


---------89:14----------
either you need to


---------89:15----------
you know duplicate yourself or like


---------89:18----------
maybe come up with some kind of courses


---------89:20----------
or something like that


---------89:21----------
like write a book and what she was


---------89:23----------
saying is that you should write a book


---------89:25----------
and i was like i wonder if i can


---------89:27----------
duplicate myself


---------89:29----------
and yeah and this goes to the idea that


---------89:33----------
i'm something special which people think


---------89:35----------
i'm special but i don't think i'm that


---------89:36----------
special


---------89:38----------
and so the more special i am the harder


---------89:41----------
it is to duplicate myself but the real


---------89:42----------
question is


---------89:43----------
because i i did feel like so the reason


---------89:45----------
we started the coaching program is


---------89:46----------
because i


---------89:47----------
started on stream and what i really


---------89:48----------
wanted to show people


---------89:50----------
so the reason we started streaming was


---------89:52----------
because i was having individual


---------89:54----------
conversations with gamers for like four


---------89:56----------
years and it was like the same 35


---------89:58----------
like problem points yeah like 35


---------90:00----------
problems that pretty much all gamers


---------90:02----------
like any given gamer is gonna fall into


---------90:05----------
like 99


---------90:06----------
of them are going to fall into these


---------90:07----------
like 35 issues so


---------90:09----------
my thought was like i'm having the same


---------90:10----------
[ __ ] conversation with like a dozen


---------90:12----------
people


---------90:13----------
what if i just stream that conversation


---------90:15----------
could people watching benefit


---------90:17----------
turns out that the answer is like sort


---------90:18----------
of yes


---------90:20----------
then the question is like but we want


---------90:22----------
one-on-one and i'm like can i really


---------90:24----------
transform someone's life by streaming


---------90:26----------
some people will actually say yes i


---------90:27----------
still tend to be pretty skeptical


---------90:29----------
and i find that it's it's like hard to


---------90:30----------
substitute


---------90:32----------
one-on-one support with like youtube


---------90:34----------
videos even if the topics remember


---------90:36----------
don't ever don't ever underestimate the


---------90:37----------
impact you can have on somebody but yeah


---------90:39----------
absolutely right so i've i've learned


---------90:41----------
that yeah but then my thought was like


---------90:43----------
okay so what's missing from a healthy


---------90:44----------
gamer sure i can go on stream and i can


---------90:46----------
have these conversations and i can teach


---------90:48----------
about stuff


---------90:49----------
but what's missing is one-on-one and


---------90:51----------
that's why we started coaching


---------90:53----------
now the interesting thing that's there


---------90:55----------
are deficiencies that have come out of


---------90:56----------
coaching


---------90:57----------
which is that like people want so like


---------91:00----------
they want


---------91:00----------
more in depth than what we can offer on


---------91:03----------
stream and the coaches have a skill set


---------91:05----------
but they don't have my knowledge base


---------91:07----------
so the next thing that we're working on


---------91:08----------
on a healthy gamer is like


---------91:12----------
um can you hold on a second i'll just


---------91:14----------
show you yeah


---------91:17----------
so


---------91:29----------
so so what i basically noticed is that


---------91:31----------
like people are asking for more


---------91:32----------
in-depth stuff about meditation or more


---------91:35----------
in-depth stuff about ayurveda


---------91:37----------
or like more in-depth stuff about like


---------91:38----------
alexithymia and getting in touch with


---------91:40----------
your emotions


---------91:41----------
so and the coaches are actually really


---------91:43----------
helpful and they they're good outcomes


---------91:45----------
from our coaching program


---------91:47----------
um but they don't have the depth of


---------91:50----------
knowledge which actually people are sort


---------91:52----------
of ask us to stream about stuff


---------91:54----------
where now the problem that we're running


---------91:55----------
into is i don't think streaming


---------91:57----------
is the best way to disseminate


---------92:06----------
is the best way to disseminate like


---------92:08----------
comprehensive knowledge does that make


---------92:10----------
sense um


---------92:12----------
sure because you can't be responsive to


---------92:13----------
like individual like questions or


---------92:16----------
because you have to break things down on


---------92:17----------
an individual level for somebody to


---------92:18----------
understand


---------92:19----------
because my understanding is that


---------92:20----------
streaming people jump in and out


---------92:23----------
so oh okay okay let's do this so we're


---------92:26----------
gonna go


---------92:30----------
okay so i'm gonna maximize this


---------92:34----------
share my screen


---------92:38----------
okay


---------92:45----------
okay can you see this um


---------92:49----------
[Music]


---------92:51----------
i'm gonna click something say watch


---------92:53----------
stream yes okay


---------92:56----------
can you see the word doc yeah


---------92:59----------
so like so this is so the next thing for


---------93:02----------
healthy gamer is this


---------93:04----------
so this is like uh like essentially the


---------93:06----------
outline of a book about meditation


---------93:10----------
and um so this is like what's come out


---------93:13----------
from our coaching program is that people


---------93:14----------
want


---------93:15----------
more let me try to find just one example


---------93:19----------
yeah so let's do like the anxiety primer


---------93:21----------
so like this is just like my


---------93:22----------
understanding of anxiety


---------93:24----------
and all the different kinds of anxiety


---------93:25----------
that people can can experience


---------93:28----------
and this is what our community needs


---------93:29----------
next so first it was streaming


---------93:32----------
then it was like okay people need


---------93:33----------
one-on-one and then people like


---------93:35----------
our coaches can help them with ego but


---------93:37----------
they don't have


---------93:38----------
quite the depth of knowledge about how


---------93:40----------
to like the the know-how of how to


---------93:42----------
remove ego


---------93:43----------
they can actually help they're actually


---------93:44----------
pretty good with ego um


---------93:46----------
and so like this is what's next


---------93:50----------
and you know where does it end up i'm


---------93:53----------
i'm not quite sure to be honest


---------93:56----------
okay because i just don't i just don't


---------94:00----------
know i mean i'm gonna try to help


---------94:01----------
so the other thing when it comes to


---------94:03----------
dharma or duty is like it occurs to me


---------94:05----------
that


---------94:06----------
i have a so you know when you think


---------94:08----------
about karma in dharma so to kind of tie


---------94:10----------
things up


---------94:12----------
so i think i was given a very unique set


---------94:14----------
of circumstances in life


---------94:15----------
and i think that with ability comes


---------94:19----------
responsibility


---------94:22----------
and it was weird i was talking to like


---------94:24----------
this guy named uh


---------94:25----------
bobby scar and he was kind of saying


---------94:27----------
like i predicted someone like you would


---------94:29----------
show up on twitch one day


---------94:31----------
he was like i called it okay and i think


---------94:33----------
that there's a group


---------94:35----------
so what healthy gamer is about


---------94:38----------
is it's about healthy gamers so it's not


---------94:39----------
actually about like treating video game


---------94:41----------
addiction it's about like building a


---------94:42----------
healthy life this is what we've been


---------94:44----------
talking about


---------94:45----------
there's a difference between mental


---------94:46----------
illness and like building happiness and


---------94:49----------
fulfillment and that's really what our


---------94:51----------
goals are as an organization


---------94:53----------
yeah it's like the difference between


---------94:54----------
going to a hospital and being sent out


---------94:55----------
when you're no longer dying versus


---------94:57----------
actually like working out exercising


---------94:59----------
having like a healthy


---------95:00----------
body exactly and so i think the thing


---------95:02----------
that's been really confusing


---------95:03----------
from an organization standpoint or a


---------95:05----------
stream standpoint is people


---------95:06----------
because i talk about emotions they


---------95:08----------
assume that that's therapy


---------95:10----------
but no like i think that's the [ __ ]


---------95:12----------
problem with our society is that we


---------95:13----------
don't we don't


---------95:14----------
have these conversations about


---------95:15----------
relationships we don't have


---------95:16----------
conversations about emotions


---------95:18----------
you were kind of saying we weren't


---------95:19----------
taught how to be happy absolutely that's


---------95:21----------
what i'm trying to fix


---------95:23----------
is we weren't taught how to like gain


---------95:26----------
meaning and purpose in life we weren't


---------95:28----------
taught how we as human beings work we


---------95:30----------
have classes about


---------95:31----------
science and mathematics and economics


---------95:33----------
but nothing about why you can't


---------95:35----------
stop drinking soda


---------95:38----------
and so what our mission is and


---------95:42----------
is just to help people put their lives


---------95:44----------
together


---------95:45----------
and to become healthy gamers


---------95:48----------
right i don't want like i'm not really


---------95:50----------
for abstinence for


---------95:52----------
from video games i think it it's


---------95:53----------
necessary for some people


---------95:55----------
and certainly for some period of time


---------95:56----------
but like we want to build healthy gamers


---------95:59----------
and when


---------95:59----------
there are enough healthy gamers i guess


---------96:01----------
at some point i'm going to burn out or


---------96:02----------
quit


---------96:04----------
but generally probably working for a


---------96:06----------
while but yeah


---------96:07----------
i yeah i mean you know so i'm just going


---------96:09----------
to try to help people so i think it's i


---------96:11----------
kind of view our organization and where


---------96:13----------
it's going in the same way that


---------96:15----------
i think about because it's the only way


---------96:16----------
you can do it mentally and stay sane


---------96:18----------
when i'm working in the emergency room


---------96:20----------
it's like what's my end goal i have no


---------96:22----------
[ __ ] clue it depends on what walks in


---------96:23----------
the door


---------96:24----------
sure and as long as people are walking


---------96:26----------
in the door and asking us to do stuff


---------96:29----------
we're gonna do our best to do it


---------96:33----------
okay um i don't know how many questions


---------96:35----------
i've asked you've gone over on stream a


---------96:36----------
million times so i'm sorry if i'm


---------96:37----------
hitting a lot of like common talking


---------96:38----------
points


---------96:39----------
um i guess just like a final question


---------96:41----------
then we draw to an end here


---------96:43----------
because a lot of people in my audience


---------96:44----------
might be listening that haven't heard


---------96:45----------
these things before


---------96:46----------
um uh in terms of if you have like new


---------96:50----------
people listening what do you think is


---------96:51----------
like the most


---------96:52----------
positive thing an individual can do to


---------96:54----------
make like great strides towards becoming


---------96:56----------
mentally healthier that you think most


---------96:58----------
people don't already do


---------96:59----------
like what's like one thing that you


---------97:00----------
think is missing from a lot of twitch


---------97:03----------
audiences life


---------97:04----------
that they could be doing that would help


---------97:05----------
them greatly


---------97:08----------
i mean i have a generic answer and then


---------97:10----------
i have a specific answer


---------97:11----------
because i feel like the generic answer


---------97:13----------
is like not actionable which frustrates


---------97:16----------
me


---------97:17----------
so the generic answer is i think you


---------97:18----------
should understand yourself in the same


---------97:20----------
way that you try to understand external


---------97:22----------
things


---------97:22----------
so in your audience in particular so


---------97:25----------
destiny i think you've cultivated a good


---------97:27----------
audience or attitude or culture


---------97:31----------
of like critical thinking the problem is


---------97:33----------
that we don't critically think about


---------97:34----------
ourselves


---------97:35----------
yeah practically what i would say is


---------97:39----------
that a lot of people


---------97:40----------
i suspect in your audience think they


---------97:43----------
think critically about themselves


---------97:45----------
every yeah right but the truth is that


---------97:47----------
they don't so here's what i'd say


---------97:49----------
a classic example of this is like the


---------97:51----------
gamer who feels like they're in control


---------97:53----------
of their emotions


---------97:54----------
because they don't cry during a sad


---------97:57----------
movie or can watch horror films or


---------97:59----------
things like that


---------98:00----------
right like they don't have emotional


---------98:02----------
responses the way that


---------98:03----------
other people do and they pride


---------98:05----------
themselves on this that's not being in


---------98:07----------
control of your emotions that's just


---------98:10----------
numbing your emotions


---------98:12----------
so practically what i would if i had to


---------98:14----------
give someone a practical tip


---------98:15----------
it's look at your behavior and try to


---------98:17----------
figure out what are the different


---------98:18----------
variables that influence your behavior


---------98:21----------
and unless you can do something


---------98:23----------
arbitrary for no reason you're not in


---------98:25----------
control of yourself


---------98:27----------
so if people think that you're in


---------98:29----------
control of yourself and you can't


---------98:31----------
pick you know the last thing that you


---------98:34----------
ate that was unhealthy unless you can


---------98:36----------
knock that out of your diet for 60 days


---------98:39----------
you're not in control


---------98:41----------
and then tunnel down into what is it


---------98:43----------
that makes


---------98:44----------
that contributes to behavior because


---------98:45----------
behavior is really really complicated a


---------98:47----------
lot of variables


---------98:49----------
and understand your behavior and


---------98:51----------
understand yourself


---------98:52----------
and for people who want to be successful


---------98:54----------
i don't think they understand like


---------98:55----------
everyone looks for success


---------98:57----------
outside of themselves they're like


---------98:58----------
you've got to do this or like


---------99:00----------
i remember there was some guy on youtube


---------99:02----------
that was spamming


---------99:03----------
maybe due to my search history or


---------99:04----------
cookies or whatever about how he like


---------99:06----------
reads a thousand books and i'm like i


---------99:08----------
don't think


---------99:09----------
i don't think reading like we all think


---------99:11----------
that reading a thousand books makes you


---------99:12----------
successful like sure reading is


---------99:13----------
important i've read a [ __ ] ton of books


---------99:16----------
but doing no i don't believe that


---------99:18----------
success comes from doing some specific


---------99:20----------
formula externally i think you just got


---------99:21----------
to understand like


---------99:23----------
how you work as a person and that's and


---------99:26----------
i think that's what people need to like


---------99:27----------
take away is like understand how you


---------99:29----------
work


---------99:30----------
because we're playing this game of life


---------99:32----------
without understanding the buttons on the


---------99:34----------
controller


---------99:35----------
yeah it's like do you is there um do you


---------99:38----------
have a good


---------99:39----------
um i 100 agree with what you're saying


---------99:41----------
um do you have good like


---------99:42----------
tricks to check if you're lying to


---------99:44----------
yourself yeah perfect


---------99:46----------
yeah absolutely so the biggest thing to


---------99:49----------
understand about lying to yourself


---------99:52----------
so here's here's how the mind works okay


---------99:54----------
i'm going to do an abbreviated version


---------99:56----------
you guys can check this out in the


---------99:57----------
webinars and stuff because i've


---------99:58----------
explained this with


---------99:59----------
whiteboard and all that good stuff so i


---------100:02----------
also think that eastern psychology in a


---------100:04----------
lot of ways is superior to western


---------100:06----------
psychology because of the way


---------100:07----------
in which it was developed that's maybe a


---------100:09----------
conversation for a different day


---------100:10----------
sure but our mind has an emotional


---------100:13----------
component this is called the among us


---------100:16----------
and the manas is the emotional mind and


---------100:18----------
also reacts to things


---------100:20----------
so if you think about do you like sushi


---------100:23----------
no


---------100:24----------
okay when you ate your first piece of


---------100:27----------
sushi


---------100:28----------
how quickly did you know that you didn't


---------100:30----------
like it


---------100:34----------
um


---------100:36----------
i don't know i usually like i eat


---------100:37----------
something i think about it i'd swallow


---------100:38----------
it i can tell usually in a


---------100:40----------
i don't know 10 15 seconds it doesn't


---------100:42----------
take me that long to figure it out i


---------100:43----------
would say even less


---------100:44----------
i would be surprised if if it took you


---------100:46----------
longer than a second sure for me i


---------100:48----------
i don't like seafood so the first time i


---------100:50----------
really tried sushi it was like a year


---------100:52----------
ago but i went to a really nice


---------100:53----------
restaurant with some friends because i


---------100:54----------
wanted to like give it a good try before


---------100:55----------
writing it off so i really did think


---------100:57----------
about it but yeah


---------100:58----------
but yeah generally yeah for like a food


---------100:59----------
piece of food i don't like usually know


---------101:00----------
pretty quickly


---------101:01----------
yeah sometimes even smelling it so


---------101:03----------
there's this one part of your mind


---------101:04----------
that reacts to things and so the yogi's


---------101:07----------
thought that emotions


---------101:09----------
and reactions like stamping something


---------101:11----------
with like or dislike


---------101:12----------
oh like i like that song or i don't like


---------101:14----------
that song or oh that's a cool shirt


---------101:15----------
there isn't a culture


---------101:16----------
the reactionary mind is the same as the


---------101:18----------
emotional mind


---------101:19----------
so we also tend to experience emotions


---------101:21----------
very rapidly right


---------101:23----------
if you walk in and then your ex walks


---------101:25----------
into the same restaurant


---------101:26----------
you have an emotional reaction that


---------101:28----------
takes less than a second


---------101:30----------
so your emotional mind acts that's manus


---------101:34----------
that's the emotional line


---------101:35----------
the second piece of the mind is the


---------101:37----------
buddhi or the analytical mind the


---------101:39----------
logical mind and we all know that like


---------101:41----------
emotions and logic


---------101:42----------
are not the same part right like you


---------101:44----------
can't overcome emotions with logic or


---------101:46----------
you can or that's difficult we can get


---------101:48----------
that into that whole process


---------101:50----------
whatever yeah so the thing that people


---------101:52----------
don't understand is that between the


---------101:54----------
emotions and the logic


---------101:55----------
is this thing called the ahamka or the


---------101:57----------
ego okay


---------101:59----------
and what the ahamkar does is it


---------102:00----------
activates to protect you from negative


---------102:02----------
emotions


---------102:03----------
so when you feel bad the ego activates


---------102:06----------
and then what the ego does is it bullies


---------102:09----------
your intellectual mind into coming up


---------102:13----------
with


---------102:14----------
justifications and you can argue


---------102:17----------
logically against justifications and


---------102:18----------
what happens if you like argue with


---------102:20----------
someone


---------102:21----------
about why they do something and they


---------102:24----------
present justifications


---------102:26----------
um it feels like they'll bounce back and


---------102:28----------
forth between whatever they'll either


---------102:29----------
invent or fabricate some or they'll


---------102:31----------
exactly yeah right so that's the


---------102:33----------
question you're post-hoc rationalizing


---------102:34----------
you're doing it after the fact you don't


---------102:35----------
care what the justification is so the


---------102:37----------
question is like


---------102:38----------
like how do you know whether your


---------102:40----------
intellectual mind


---------102:41----------
is justifying things or objectively


---------102:44----------
analyzing things how do you know


---------102:46----------
and the short answer is whether your ego


---------102:48----------
is present or not


---------102:50----------
right so even when you have a political


---------102:52----------
argument if you can calm down and have a


---------102:54----------
discussion with them


---------102:55----------
where their ego is absent then they can


---------102:57----------
change their mind


---------102:59----------
so basically your intellect functions


---------103:02----------
well


---------103:03----------
if your ego is inactive and when does


---------103:06----------
ego become


---------103:06----------
active it becomes active when you


---------103:08----------
experience negative emotion generally


---------103:10----------
speaking


---------103:11----------
and so it really starts with it's not


---------103:13----------
about whether you're in control it's


---------103:14----------
about the presence


---------103:16----------
of or the absence of emotion and if you


---------103:18----------
can't detect


---------103:19----------
emotion and you can't detect and notice


---------103:23----------
your ego


---------103:24----------
then your rational mind is not thinking


---------103:25----------
properly yeah


---------103:28----------
so that just seems scary because i guess


---------103:29----------
when i think of like these these


---------103:31----------
these sorts of like like almost


---------103:33----------
cognitive distortions like


---------103:34----------
nobody feels like they ever have them so


---------103:36----------
it seems really like everybody feels


---------103:37----------
like they're honest with themselves


---------103:39----------
yeah so that's the beauty of what the


---------103:40----------
yogi's figured out is they're like okay


---------103:41----------
how do i know when my intellect is


---------103:43----------
working properly it has to do with the


---------103:45----------
presence of emotion and ego


---------103:47----------
and until you can see and label those


---------103:50----------
things within yourself then your


---------103:52----------
emotional


---------103:52----------
i mean then your analytical mind will


---------103:54----------
function well because you're like oh


---------103:56----------
that's my ego the first step then to


---------103:59----------
figuring out if you're lying


---------104:00----------
if we draw it back then to figure out if


---------104:02----------
you're lying to yourself


---------104:04----------
the first step of that process is can i


---------104:06----------
identify when i'm being emotional


---------104:08----------
yep and then if you can do that then you


---------104:10----------
can bring these


---------104:11----------
topics in in a place where you're not


---------104:13----------
being emotional and then analyze them


---------104:14----------
but if you feel like you're becoming


---------104:16----------
emotional you have to be able to


---------104:16----------
recognize that the tricky thing is that


---------104:18----------
most people aren't going to even be able


---------104:20----------
to recognize their emotions


---------104:21----------
for sure yeah right so the the first so


---------104:24----------
i would start


---------104:25----------
by assuming that if you don't


---------104:28----------
uh detect emotion that some emotion is


---------104:30----------
there you start by assuming that you're


---------104:32----------
not actually logical


---------104:34----------
because chances are you aren't and until


---------104:37----------
your like eq gets well developed and you


---------104:39----------
can detect your emotions


---------104:40----------
and then also detect your ego right and


---------104:43----------
this like you can kind of see this where


---------104:44----------
like the example that i use is let's say


---------104:46----------
you ask out a girl


---------104:47----------
and then she says no and then you say ah


---------104:50----------
she wasn't that attractive anyway


---------104:52----------
and then you tell your friends she was


---------104:53----------
like yeah i wasn't that into her


---------104:55----------
yeah of course yeah yeah you're a [ __ ]


---------104:57----------
anyway i didn't even know exactly


---------104:58----------
right but like like that's clearly


---------105:00----------
illogical but you can't


---------105:02----------
explain that to that person and why so


---------105:04----------
when she says no


---------105:05----------
in your emotional mind you feel


---------105:06----------
rejection and then your ego's like oh


---------105:08----------
[ __ ]


---------105:09----------
let's tank that and then then it pumps


---------105:11----------
you up


---------105:12----------
and then puts other people down so


---------105:14----------
another sign there are a couple i'll


---------105:15----------
leave you with one last point because


---------105:17----------
they're not going to be able to detect


---------105:18----------
their emotions any time you're making a


---------105:19----------
comparison


---------105:20----------
that's ego if you are comparing your


---------105:23----------
logic is incorrect


---------105:25----------
gotcha period okay


---------105:28----------
one of the um as a quick aside one of


---------105:30----------
the easy i consider myself to be pretty


---------105:32----------
emotionally aware i i'd like to think i


---------105:33----------
am but then


---------105:34----------
there are times when even i realize um


---------105:36----------
way too late oftentimes something as


---------105:38----------
stupid as like


---------105:39----------
man i think i just need to [ __ ] eat


---------105:40----------
because i'm in a really bad mood right


---------105:42----------
now i don't even think i realize that


---------105:43----------
and then you eat and then afterwards


---------105:44----------
once you're out of it you're like


---------105:45----------
wow holy [ __ ] i was really hungry i


---------105:47----------
can't believe i was just like a huge ass


---------105:48----------
over two hours when i just needed some


---------105:50----------
food


---------105:50----------
something as stupid as that um that's


---------105:52----------
arguably less impactful than like having


---------105:54----------
a fight with somebody or having a


---------105:55----------
negative experience with somebody else


---------105:56----------
so yeah for sure i understand what you


---------105:58----------
mean 100


---------105:59----------
yeah okay so yeah cool man


---------106:03----------
okay cool um i appreciate the


---------106:06----------
conversation i really


---------106:07----------
like it yeah um if i have a specific


---------106:10----------
topic


---------106:11----------
i'll bring it up in the future what


---------106:12----------
would you say yeah i was just gonna say


---------106:13----------
because i


---------106:14----------
i remember etiquette from before so like


---------106:17----------
i i assume that everyone knows who you


---------106:19----------
are


---------106:19----------
because i just assume everyone knows who


---------106:21----------
you are but do you want to tell people


---------106:22----------
if they don't like i


---------106:23----------
was just assuming but it just occurred


---------106:24----------
to me that maybe people don't know who


---------106:26----------
you are


---------106:26----------
do you want to oh sure um i'm destiny i


---------106:29----------
stream at twitch.tv slash destiny we


---------106:31----------
talk about politics and philosophy a lot


---------106:32----------
and then we play video games too


---------106:33----------
depending on what's going on for current


---------106:34----------
events


---------106:35----------
yeah cool well thanks a lot destiny i


---------106:38----------
really appreciate the conversation i


---------106:39----------
enjoy talking to you


---------106:41----------
yeah i appreciate it as well also


---------106:42----------
etiquette do you want to introduce


---------106:43----------
yourself in case some people watching on


---------106:44----------
my stream might know who you are


---------106:46----------
uh yeah but i mean i had a chance to


---------106:48----------
talk to about myself a lot


---------106:50----------
so i think people should have figured it


---------106:51----------
i mean i imagine okay


---------106:53----------
healthy game or underscore gg you are


---------106:55----------
trying to raise money for something


---------106:56----------
though right what do you collect


---------106:58----------
no you're not oh you guys raised all the


---------106:59----------
money you needed


---------107:01----------
yeah i mean the community gave us a ton


---------107:03----------
of money so we're fine


---------107:05----------
yeah so like what are you making well


---------107:06----------
the first big business mistake you're


---------107:07----------
making is you have to keep increasing


---------107:08----------
those goals you got to get more and more


---------107:10----------
no money right that's not


---------107:11----------
what we do seriously destiny i know it's


---------107:13----------
bizarre i mean


---------107:14----------
we've had people trying to still give us


---------107:16----------
five-figure donations


---------107:17----------
stuff and we're like nope i think


---------107:20----------
we're nope okay well that's awesome cool


---------107:23----------
well good luck with what you guys are


---------107:24----------
doing


---------107:25----------
um you're genuinely really cool there's


---------107:26----------
very very very few people that i talk to


---------107:28----------
that i actually respect and look up to


---------107:29----------
and you're like one of those very few


---------107:30----------
there's like two people actually there's


---------107:31----------
you


---------107:32----------
that i really enjoy talking to and then


---------107:33----------
another guy called sean carroll yeah you


---------107:35----------
two are


---------107:36----------
really awesome people so how insulting


---------107:37----------
to everyone else you've talked to


---------107:39----------
um most people know that i have very


---------107:41----------
[ __ ] negative views of everybody and


---------107:42----------
i mean like in terms of like


---------107:43----------
if you say something i'm more likely to


---------107:45----------
believe it without feeling like i have


---------107:46----------
to go and like check it and i'm


---------107:47----------
instantly like incredibly hostile or


---------107:49----------
combative towards a thought like if you


---------107:50----------
say something that challenges like a


---------107:52----------
preconceived notion that i have


---------107:53----------
i'm more likely to like default assume i


---------107:55----------
might be incorrect on something and then


---------107:57----------
really ponder what you're saying and try


---------107:58----------
to like incorporate that into what i'm


---------108:00----------
thinking like yeah


---------108:01----------
can i ask you i appreciate that man i


---------108:03----------
really respect you as well i


---------108:05----------
and you know we don't do much on twitch


---------108:07----------
that isn't like


---------108:08----------
our stuff because we don't have a whole


---------108:10----------
lot of time to stream and i think there


---------108:11----------
are a lot of people to help


---------108:12----------
and and i but i really love do love


---------108:15----------
talking to you


---------108:16----------
um look can i toss out one last thing


---------108:18----------
i'll try to send you the paper


---------108:19----------
but i had a wild thought recently and i


---------108:22----------
just love to get your thoughts on it


---------108:25----------
so it was recently a study i think on um


---------108:28----------
because


---------108:28----------
we've talked a little bit about


---------108:29----------
psychedelics before i think yeah


---------108:32----------
or or you've talked about it or whatever


---------108:34----------
i don't know if you and i have talked


---------108:35----------
about it


---------108:36----------
so a lot of people ask me questions


---------108:38----------
about psychedelics so i saw an


---------108:39----------
interesting study and it just really


---------108:41----------
i clicked in some way and i don't know


---------108:42----------
if this is completely idiotic


---------108:44----------
so there's a study i think with mdma or


---------108:46----------
psilocybin i forget


---------108:48----------
where something like 68 of people who


---------108:53----------
use mdma or psilocybin felt a connection


---------108:56----------
with like some kind of being


---------108:58----------
and and the being was like positive okay


---------109:02----------
like cared about them and i was just


---------109:04----------
really surprised by


---------109:07----------
the high percentage of a common


---------109:09----------
experience


---------109:10----------
because my assumption would have been


---------109:12----------
that if you use


---------109:14----------
psychedelics like i know that there are


---------109:15----------
some substances that you know like mdma


---------109:18----------
for example makes you feel like more


---------109:19----------
connected to people


---------109:20----------
but i was surprised by the the


---------109:24----------
uniformity of their experience of like


---------109:27----------
presence


---------109:28----------
of this other being or beings


---------109:31----------
and then i was kind of thinking like oh


---------109:32----------
that's actually like scientifically


---------109:33----------
that's very interesting that they have a


---------109:35----------
consistent experience across


---------109:37----------
all kinds of random people because i


---------109:38----------
would have expected all kinds of random


---------109:40----------
things


---------109:40----------
really okay um well i mean it's within


---------109:43----------
certain bounds right so like we know


---------109:45----------
that mdama like


---------109:46----------
increases your like like empathy and


---------109:48----------
stuff like that but


---------109:49----------
but to detect a being is a strange


---------109:52----------
scientific result


---------109:54----------
sure and it got me wondering whether


---------109:56----------
like actually


---------109:57----------
mdma and psilocybin are um


---------110:01----------
maybe like the next version of the


---------110:02----------
telescope


---------110:04----------
in the sense that that you know in we


---------110:07----------
have a general reality that we can


---------110:08----------
perceive and then as human beings we


---------110:10----------
develop


---------110:11----------
instruments and then anyone who looks


---------110:13----------
through the telescope sees a relatively


---------110:16----------
common thing


---------110:18----------
even though like normal people can't see


---------110:20----------
it but when you have enough human beings


---------110:22----------
who share a common sensory experience


---------110:25----------
at what point does that become reality


---------110:28----------
as opposed to just something that you're


---------110:30----------
hallucinating for sure


---------110:32----------
um obviously very responsible make sure


---------110:36----------
that everything is safe


---------110:37----------
consult a doctor if you're taking a drug


---------110:39----------
um like ssris will interact with


---------110:41----------
oh yeah i wouldn't recommend taking


---------110:43----------
psychedelics i'm not that's oh okay


---------110:45----------
i'm not i don't okay sorry i should have


---------110:47----------
been clear i was just wondering what you


---------110:49----------
think about the principle


---------110:50----------
of sorry what what you think about the


---------110:54----------
principle


---------110:54----------
of like whether it's possible that


---------110:58----------
psychedelics could actually give us


---------111:00----------
frontiers into reality that we're


---------111:02----------
otherwise not able to perceive


---------111:03----------
much like a telescope it's a theoretical


---------111:06----------
oh that's um


---------111:08----------
that's a really good question i'm


---------111:09----------
actually going to have a conversation


---------111:11----------
with tomorrow um i'm going to butcher


---------111:13----------
his last name


---------111:14----------
um will suey see you we'll we'll suit


---------111:18----------
yeah yeah about that yeah because i had


---------111:20----------
a really


---------111:21----------
yeah huge mushroom trip that i still


---------111:22----------
have trouble making sense of


---------111:24----------
um i think that the perspectives that


---------111:27----------
you gain on


---------111:28----------
stuff like mushrooms or lsd um


---------111:31----------
are invaluable um


---------111:35----------
it's hard i don't want to have this kind


---------111:36----------
of i'm not trying to recommend drugs to


---------111:37----------
your audience i'm trying to be


---------111:38----------
responsible for that but like there's


---------111:39----------
definitely


---------111:40----------
um there are worlds that exist


---------111:44----------
under psychedelic drugs that are


---------111:46----------
inaccessible in my opinion to


---------111:48----------
most people that that's fine so i'm


---------111:51----------
also i'm not recommending so i've also


---------111:53----------
just so you guys know from a safety


---------111:54----------
perspective i've had several people


---------111:56----------
reach out to me when we've talked about


---------111:58----------
psychedelics actually saying


---------111:59----------
they have ptsd or bad anxiety from


---------112:03----------
psychedelics so psychedelic usage can


---------112:05----------
actually be like very harmful


---------112:07----------
um so so and i think if you guys want


---------112:10----------
more information will is a great person


---------112:11----------
to talk to


---------112:13----------
uh so with the question that i have for


---------112:15----------
you though is do you think that those


---------112:17----------
experiences are ensconced to you or do


---------112:21----------
you think they could be reflective of


---------112:23----------
actually an objective reality


---------112:25----------
outside of your mind um


---------112:29----------
man sorry i'm trying to think of like


---------112:31----------
abbreviated forms of this


---------112:33----------
you don't have to answer now you just oh


---------112:35----------
i just wanted to get your thoughts on


---------112:36----------
like


---------112:37----------
because i want you to think about it but


---------112:38----------
the big problem that i had was that i


---------112:40----------
had a very very large mushroom trip and


---------112:42----------
it actually


---------112:43----------
like that term that you use objective


---------112:45----------
reality is one that i don't use anymore


---------112:46----------
because that


---------112:47----------
big mushroom trip really um undermined


---------112:51----------
my opinion of how well i can be in tune


---------112:54----------
with any sort of objective reality


---------112:55----------
um when you've done a certain um maybe


---------112:57----------
similar to what um schizophrenics feel


---------113:00----------
um when you've done enough of a certain


---------113:01----------
substance that can induce hallucinations


---------113:03----------
or make your senses


---------113:04----------
otherwise lie to you or cause you to


---------113:06----------
have a conscious experience that feels


---------113:08----------
very otherworldly or unrelated to your


---------113:10----------
normal one


---------113:11----------
i think it really undermines your sense


---------113:12----------
of how well you can truly understand any


---------113:14----------
part of the world


---------113:16----------
because yeah for most people you've


---------113:17----------
never experienced having a sensory organ


---------113:20----------
lie to you like you don't know what it's


---------113:21----------
like for your eye or your ear to report


---------113:22----------
something


---------113:23----------
that absolutely doesn't exist and once


---------113:25----------
you've experienced that


---------113:26----------
in like in a highly drug state i think


---------113:29----------
it


---------113:30----------
it feels a little bit weird to um it


---------113:33----------
feels a little bit weird to think that


---------113:34----------
like


---------113:34----------
you can have this like super big key


---------113:36----------
into like an objective reality


---------113:38----------
um this kind of like goes away from your


---------113:39----------
question though but your original


---------113:40----------
question is like could we use these to


---------113:41----------
gain further insights into objective


---------113:43----------
reality


---------113:43----------
um i'm guessing because you're saying


---------113:45----------
that we all have shared experiences it


---------113:47----------
seems to be


---------113:48----------
on these drugs it's possible that


---------113:49----------
because we all have like similar


---------113:51----------
backgrounds


---------113:51----------
um and because we all have like similar


---------113:53----------
like shared biology that doing like a


---------113:55----------
certain type of drug is more likely to


---------113:56----------
bring a certain experience


---------113:58----------
up to the surface so maybe for instance


---------114:00----------
western people would report a different


---------114:02----------
experience on a psychedelic drug


---------114:04----------
than like um maybe indians or japanese


---------114:06----------
people or


---------114:07----------
some form of eastern um it's a good


---------114:09----------
stuff


---------114:10----------
yeah um yeah i don't know when you said


---------114:12----------
yeah it's not surprising to me that


---------114:14----------
people would report similar experiences


---------114:16----------
just because we all have like so much


---------114:17----------
shared culture


---------114:18----------
and biology but i think it's worth


---------114:20----------
exploring and i think that the type of


---------114:22----------
shared experiences that you have


---------114:24----------
that in and of itself might be


---------114:26----------
insightful um so for instance for


---------114:28----------
i'm this is conjecture maybe true maybe


---------114:30----------
not but a lot of atheists might say like


---------114:31----------
oh gods aren't important people don't


---------114:32----------
need those


---------114:33----------
and then let's say that all of the human


---------114:35----------
population tries mushrooms


---------114:36----------
and 95 percent of people report um i had


---------114:39----------
an experience where i felt incredibly


---------114:40----------
close to a divine being and it made me


---------114:42----------
feel so incredibly at peace


---------114:44----------
well maybe coming out of that experience


---------114:46----------
maybe like well okay maybe it's a little


---------114:47----------
bit foolish to completely throw out the


---------114:49----------
idea of any type of like god-like figure


---------114:51----------
it seems like it's pretty integral


---------114:52----------
to like you know the human psyche like


---------114:54----------
so yeah i do think that there could be


---------114:56----------
something worth investigating there


---------114:57----------
sorry that was a really roundabout way


---------114:58----------
of answering that question


---------114:59----------
yeah that's that's what these


---------115:01----------
conversations are about man


---------115:02----------
sure yeah also for mdma i truly i would


---------115:05----------
stake money on this not that i was here


---------115:06----------
somebody do it but i do not believe that


---------115:08----------
two people


---------115:09----------
in the same room no matter how much they


---------115:11----------
hate each other i do not think it's


---------115:13----------
possible that two people could do mdma


---------115:15----------
and come out of that room still hating


---------115:16----------
each other


---------115:17----------
it is an incredibly empathetic drug


---------115:20----------
like um yeah it's yeah the connections


---------115:23----------
you fill in that are unbelievable


---------115:24----------
jesus but maybe that's because i'm


---------115:26----------
normally like an emotionally


---------115:27----------
disconnected person maybe i'm getting


---------115:29----------
closer to


---------115:30----------
um what what how people would normally


---------115:32----------
experience emotions but yeah wow


---------115:34----------
yeah so i mean seriously destiny i i


---------115:36----------
would be careful dude


---------115:37----------
like of course people watching and stuff


---------115:39----------
too because like stuff


---------115:40----------
so so just so you guys know and you can


---------115:42----------
ask will more about this but you know


---------115:44----------
will was


---------115:44----------
was telling me that psychedelic assisted


---------115:46----------
psychotherapy


---------115:48----------
is uh is you know normally done


---------115:52----------
like you'll you'll do like maybe four or


---------115:55----------
five months of therapy with three uses


---------115:58----------
of psychedelics in between with


---------116:00----------
appropriate time to process and like


---------116:02----------
controlled amounts


---------116:03----------
i mean i've really heard people should


---------116:05----------
really be careful because like


---------116:07----------
you know part of the problem is you


---------116:08----------
don't know what you're getting


---------116:11----------
yeah for sure and i would consider


---------116:12----------
myself like i think i have a very very


---------116:15----------
strong and well put together mind


---------116:17----------
and i completely underestimated um


---------116:19----------
psilocybin mushrooms and i deal with


---------116:21----------
things like anxiety and stuff now i


---------116:22----------
can't smoke


---------116:23----------
not that i would recommend it but i


---------116:24----------
can't smoke weed for instance without


---------116:26----------
having panic attacks which i'd never


---------116:27----------
experienced prior to doing


---------116:29----------
uh psychedelic mushrooms so it's


---------116:31----------
definitely something that you should be


---------116:32----------
incredibly respectful of and very


---------116:33----------
careful of


---------116:34----------
yeah i mean i would really just steer


---------116:36----------
clear i mean i know that a lot of people


---------116:38----------
are into it but like


---------116:39----------
it's just i mean neither there can i


---------116:41----------
mean it can be harmful but


---------116:42----------
talk to will i think he'll he knows more


---------116:44----------
than i do about that so yeah it'll be a


---------116:46----------
fun conversation yeah


---------116:46----------
all right man well thank you so much for


---------116:48----------
talking man i appreciate it


---------116:50----------

---------116:51----------

---------116:52----------
