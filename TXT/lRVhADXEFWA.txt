---------00:00----------
therapy seems useless should i stop


---------00:02----------
trying


---------00:03----------
no


---------00:04----------
i feel like i'm doing all the right


---------00:06----------
things yet if i continue this trajectory


---------00:08----------
i will never make progress in life


---------00:10----------
after watching dr kane healthy gamer for


---------00:12----------
some quite some time now i realize that


---------00:14----------
the root burden and obstacle in my life


---------00:16----------
is my crushingly low self-esteem and


---------00:18----------
dominating shame i started therapy at


---------00:20----------
the beginning of the year and have only


---------00:22----------
improved in my lexithymia and gained eq


---------00:25----------
but my immense shame and low self-esteem


---------00:28----------
seems impenetrable my therapist is


---------00:30----------
pretty much


---------00:32----------
has tried pretty much everything


---------00:34----------
cb style cbt style work for the inner


---------00:37----------
critic emdr hypnotherapy asking me about


---------00:39----------
earlier times i felt ashamed about


---------00:41----------
myself talk about times where i felt


---------00:43----------
competent


---------00:44----------
contempt from my parents but my memory


---------00:46----------
is so poor to where i can't even


---------00:48----------
remember any specific incident


---------00:51----------
only that something kind of vaguely sort


---------00:53----------
of happened because understanding my


---------00:54----------
origins doesn't seem to be an avenue but


---------00:57----------
because of how useless cbt approach type


---------00:59----------
approaches feel i genuinely think that


---------01:02----------
therapy has nothing to offer me


---------01:05----------
um as for why this is an issue i'm


---------01:07----------
unable to live the life that i want i


---------01:09----------
signed up for coaching but i am inclined


---------01:11----------
to believe that coaching will not help


---------01:13----------
me why because i know that my my low


---------01:16----------
self-esteem the not good enough and they


---------01:18----------
will hate you to oblivion thoughts in my


---------01:20----------
head are the root of the problem and


---------01:21----------
underlying obstacle


---------01:23----------
so now they go into their different


---------01:25----------
interviews and stuff


---------01:27----------
i've told my therapist everything and i


---------01:29----------
think even


---------01:30----------
he was not sure how to help me entirely


---------01:32----------
i found a new therapist but honestly i


---------01:34----------
think my problems are beyond what


---------01:35----------
therapy can help i don't think coaching


---------01:37----------
can help me either because i know what


---------01:39----------
my problem is and what i need to do to


---------01:41----------
reach my goals but it's simply just not


---------01:43----------
working


---------01:44----------
tldr


---------01:45----------
it's an infinite cycle


---------01:47----------
can't improve overwhelming shame and


---------01:49----------
insecurity


---------01:50----------
can't do job interviews because of shame


---------01:52----------
can't get better job stuck in current


---------01:54----------
brain dead job slipping back into


---------01:56----------
depression because hate job in life


---------01:58----------
can't focus on making better resume feel


---------02:01----------
even more stupid reinforcing shame and


---------02:03----------
insecurity can't improve shame and


---------02:04----------
insecurity etc the cycle repeats


---------02:07----------
so there's a lot of important


---------02:10----------
things to tease apart in this language


---------02:13----------
okay


---------02:14----------
so


---------02:15----------
therapy seems useless


---------02:18----------
i will never make progress in life


---------02:21----------
i feel like i'm doing all the right


---------02:23----------
things


---------02:24----------
okay


---------02:28----------
um


---------02:31----------
can't improve


---------02:33----------
overwhelming shame and insecurity


---------02:37----------
started therapy at the beginning of this


---------02:38----------
year have only improved in my alexa


---------02:41----------
thymia and gained eq okay


---------02:44----------
so so what we're going to talk about


---------02:45----------
right now is how shame literally shapes


---------02:48----------
your thoughts and projections


---------02:50----------
okay


---------02:52----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------02:53----------
therapy is that


---------02:56----------
it doesn't solve everything at once you


---------02:58----------
have to start somewhere okay


---------03:00----------
and so if you're someone who has


---------03:02----------
crippling shame and it sounds like this


---------03:03----------
person has had shame for a while


---------03:06----------
you know starting therapy at the


---------03:07----------
beginning of the year and after eight


---------03:08----------
months not being fixed i don't think is


---------03:11----------
like


---------03:12----------
unusual


---------03:13----------
so if you've made some progress in


---------03:15----------
therapy after eight months but your


---------03:16----------
self-esteem and dominating shame feels


---------03:19----------
overwhelming


---------03:20----------
that's actually like pretty good and i'd


---------03:22----------
say keep at it because if you've had


---------03:24----------
this this if this cycle has been


---------03:26----------
repeating


---------03:27----------
for like years


---------03:28----------
like eight months of therapy isn't gonna


---------03:30----------
be enough to fix it right like you said


---------03:32----------
it's very impenetrable right now it


---------03:33----------
doesn't seem like it's gonna change


---------03:35----------
so


---------03:36----------
the more


---------03:38----------
the harder the shame is to overcome the


---------03:42----------
longer time it's gonna take to overcome


---------03:44----------
it


---------03:45----------
and the harder it's going to be to see


---------03:48----------
the progress that you're making


---------03:50----------
so there's also something that's kind of


---------03:52----------
dangerous going on here


---------03:55----------
which i want to kind of highlight i


---------03:56----------
don't know if this is going to make


---------03:57----------
sense


---------03:58----------
but this is almost like more for


---------04:00----------
clinicians


---------04:01----------
so this reads to me like a desperate


---------04:04----------
clinician patient


---------04:06----------
scenario so sometimes as a doctor


---------04:10----------
i will come i will talk to patients who


---------04:12----------
are like desperate they'll come in and


---------04:14----------
they say i have this unsolvable problem


---------04:17----------
and then i'll get freaked out and i'm


---------04:18----------
like oh my god this person has an


---------04:20----------
insolvable problem like what am i going


---------04:21----------
to do let me try this let me try emdr


---------04:24----------
let me do cbt didn't work okay let's


---------04:26----------
what's next another medication let's try


---------04:28----------
this medication that medication let's


---------04:30----------
try this thing and this thing in this


---------04:31----------
thing


---------04:32----------
and then what happens the really tricky


---------04:33----------
thing is that the more desperate i


---------04:36----------
become as a clinician like what happens


---------04:38----------
to the client's hope


---------04:40----------
it like gets worse and worse and worse


---------04:42----------
right because each thing that you try


---------04:44----------
and fails


---------04:45----------
teaches both of you the lesson


---------04:48----------
that like nothing works


---------04:50----------
right it's a very devastating and


---------04:52----------
dangerous conclusion to come to and so


---------04:55----------
the more things that you try and the


---------04:57----------
more things that fail


---------04:59----------
like the more hopeless you become which


---------05:01----------
improves the cycle of desperation right


---------05:04----------
like so then i become more desperate as


---------05:06----------
a provider and now like i'm forced to


---------05:07----------
tell the client i've tried everything i


---------05:10----------
could and nothing is working you are


---------05:12----------
hopeless i'm sorry i don't know how to


---------05:13----------
help you i've done everything in my


---------05:14----------
playbook and then you this person goes


---------05:16----------
to the next therapist and they say i've


---------05:18----------
done therapy i've done five things and


---------05:20----------
i'm a failure i'm too hard to treat so i


---------05:22----------
don't know if this is going to help and


---------05:24----------
so they come in and their attitude


---------05:26----------
shapes everything so when five different


---------05:28----------
therapies fail i don't think it's a


---------05:30----------
problem with the therapy i think it's


---------05:31----------
something about the relationship or the


---------05:33----------
person


---------05:34----------
so that kind of desperation i know


---------05:36----------
sounds kind of weird leads to bad


---------05:38----------
outcomes there's this thing called the


---------05:40----------
no sibo effect which is the opposite of


---------05:42----------
the placebo effect which we know that


---------05:44----------
for example 70 percent


---------05:47----------
of antidepressant medication


---------05:50----------
is due to placebo effect so if i reduce


---------05:53----------
your depression by 50


---------05:55----------
okay


---------05:56----------
about


---------05:58----------
35 to 40 percent of that improvement is


---------06:01----------
placebo


---------06:02----------
it's belief the pharmacologic value of


---------06:05----------
antidepressant medication is only about


---------06:06----------
30 percent


---------06:08----------
so the nocebo effect is the opposite it


---------06:10----------
means that if if a patient goes into a


---------06:13----------
treatment


---------06:14----------
not believing believing that it won't


---------06:16----------
work


---------06:17----------
so let's be precise believing that it


---------06:18----------
won't work the likelihood of that


---------06:21----------
treatment to fail skyrockets


---------06:23----------
okay


---------06:24----------
so it's kind of interesting because this


---------06:25----------
person's cognitive bias could be


---------06:27----------
negatively impacting the therapy


---------06:28----------
relationship and the therapist is i


---------06:30----------
don't really know what's going on but i


---------06:32----------
as a clinician have been in that place


---------06:34----------
where i feel that desperation i become


---------06:36----------
desperate and then as a therapist i walk


---------06:39----------
into the room every single day desperate


---------06:41----------
every time the person shows up in my


---------06:43----------
office i'm feeling desperate i'm not


---------06:45----------
showing it but i'm feeling it on the


---------06:46----------
inside and then that's going to shape


---------06:48----------
the way that i interact with that person


---------06:49----------
i don't feel hopeful as a therapist and


---------06:52----------
then what chance does a client have if i


---------06:54----------
start to feel hopeless right it's like


---------06:55----------
gg game over it's like you're hopeless


---------06:57----------
i'm hopeless


---------06:58----------
so first thing to do is to just take a


---------07:00----------
step back and slow down


---------07:02----------
all right like don't worry about whether


---------07:04----------
it's gonna work or not work it's giving


---------07:06----------
you some benefits


---------07:08----------
learn to kind of sit with that shame


---------07:10----------
talk about with your therapist what it's


---------07:12----------
like to have this this unsolvable


---------07:14----------
problem right what does it feel like to


---------07:17----------
have an unsolvable problem


---------07:19----------
how do you manage that like how do you


---------07:21----------
get up in the morning like wow life is


---------07:22----------
tough dude like that sounds really hard


---------07:26----------
right and then over time what's gonna


---------07:27----------
happen is you have all of this shame and


---------07:30----------
this is how i think therapy or what we


---------07:32----------
try to do with coaches because coaches


---------07:34----------
they they help people with shame but


---------07:36----------
like here's here's how coaches help with


---------07:38----------
shame okay therapists are maybe actually


---------07:40----------
a little bit better than this but


---------07:43----------
so i want y'all to understand that if


---------07:44----------
you like in this person's brain there's


---------07:47----------
like a cycle of thoughts right and we


---------07:49----------
can see them kind of fighting against


---------07:51----------
them


---------07:52----------
so pay attention to this


---------07:54----------
right so can't focus


---------07:56----------
stuck can't can't can't do you guys


---------08:00----------
understand that these words are coming


---------08:02----------
out of the thoughts in this person's


---------08:04----------
brain


---------08:05----------
so what happens and this person goes in


---------08:08----------
now into like held three jobs and then


---------08:10----------
like i feel like my brain is rotting and


---------08:12----------
i can no longer do this this is going to


---------08:13----------
contribute to nocebo effect


---------08:16----------
okay


---------08:16----------
so it's kind of weird but what can you


---------08:18----------
do what i would advise a coach who is


---------08:20----------
working with this client


---------08:22----------
is first you have to model as a coach


---------08:25----------
how to tolerate shame so as this person


---------08:28----------
is this person like you know goes to


---------08:30----------
therapy and feels really ashamed and


---------08:32----------
hopeless


---------08:33----------
if the therapist can sit with that


---------08:36----------
hopelessness or the coach can sit with


---------08:38----------
that hopelessness and not feel hopeless


---------08:41----------
in turn you're going to show the person


---------08:43----------
how to do that right if we think about


---------08:45----------
like self-dialogue how do we change our


---------08:48----------
self-dialogue it usually start i mean


---------08:50----------
you can change it on your own but when


---------08:52----------
you work with a coach the way that our


---------08:53----------
coaches like change self-dialogue is by


---------08:56----------
giving you an alternate option


---------08:58----------
so when you fail to apply for a job and


---------09:00----------
you tell yourself oh my god it's because


---------09:02----------
i'm like so hopeless and i have this


---------09:04----------
impenetrable shame woe is me and your


---------09:06----------
coach is like wow that sucks it sounds


---------09:09----------
like you were really hard on yourself


---------09:10----------
and you genuinely have a lot of like


---------09:11----------
difficult challenges that you're dealing


---------09:13----------
with it sounds like you're paralyzed by


---------09:15----------
your shame and like that's part of the


---------09:16----------
reason that you feel stuck i know it


---------09:18----------
sounds kind of weird but like they're


---------09:19----------
sort of giving you a pass right they're


---------09:21----------
like treating you with compassion and


---------09:23----------
then something weird happens in your


---------09:25----------
brain like when people start like


---------09:27----------
consistently treating you with like


---------09:28----------
compassion and they don't kind of beat


---------09:30----------
you up on a regular basis


---------09:32----------
your brain learns how to talk to itself


---------09:35----------
and then over time what happens is that


---------09:37----------
like you'll start to chip away at that


---------09:39----------
chain right if you continue to work with


---------09:41----------
a therapist and your therapist is


---------09:42----------
supportive


---------09:44----------
and continues to demonstrate hope then


---------09:46----------
you'll start to like model that behavior


---------09:48----------
you'll pick it up almost like slang so


---------09:51----------
we know that human beings learn through


---------09:53----------
observation of like other kinds of


---------09:55----------
behaviors even if you look at like the


---------09:56----------
way that people walk right like people


---------09:59----------
in different parts of the country or


---------10:00----------
different parts of the world will like


---------10:02----------
walk in a different way if the way that


---------10:04----------
people talk the way that they have body


---------10:06----------
language in the way that they like you


---------10:08----------
know greet each other like some people


---------10:09----------
will shake hands some people will hug


---------10:12----------
like i remember when i moved to boston


---------10:13----------
first from texas like i used to be a big


---------10:15----------
handshaker and like like people they're


---------10:17----------
like shaking hands but it's not like a


---------10:18----------
big thing


---------10:19----------
and then when i went to india it's like


---------10:21----------
even more confusing because they do


---------10:22----------
namaste right so there's no bodily


---------10:24----------
contact


---------10:25----------
so all of these things like you have to


---------10:26----------
learn by like sitting with someone or an


---------10:29----------
efficient way to learn i should say is


---------10:31----------
by sitting with someone and having them


---------10:32----------
literally like model the right response


---------10:35----------
and over time as you learn to sit with


---------10:36----------
the shame and tolerate the shame and


---------10:38----------
recognize oh that shame is there and


---------10:40----------
it's actually not my fault


---------10:43----------
that


---------10:44----------
i'm failing because as long as like that


---------10:46----------
 that shame is like weighing me down


---------10:48----------
how could i how should i even expect


---------10:50----------
myself to be able to do anything the


---------10:52----------
shame is so crippling


---------10:53----------
i can't do anything and then something


---------10:54----------
funny happens there because if you start


---------10:56----------
to say that then you've forgiven


---------10:58----------
yourself then the shame is over here and


---------11:01----------
that's what's causing the shame is


---------11:02----------
causing you to fail it's not i am


---------11:04----------
failing the shame is making me fail and


---------11:07----------
then you externalize it and then your


---------11:09----------
value becomes separate from the shame


---------11:11----------
and then you can start building that


---------11:12----------
back up


---------11:14----------
okay yeah so when someone says i'm


---------11:16----------
ashamed and i'm ashamed of that


---------11:17----------
absolutely it's a cycle it's like it's


---------11:19----------
elephants all the way down chat


---------11:22----------
you can you can get lost in that cycle


---------11:24----------
as much as you want to breaking out of


---------11:26----------
that cycle literally oftentimes the


---------11:29----------
fastest way to do it is to sit with


---------11:31----------
someone so i'd say continue therapy


---------11:33----------
right even arguably with with the person


---------11:36----------
you've got you can try someone else by


---------11:38----------
all means try someone else


---------11:39----------
but go there and learn to sit with that


---------11:41----------
shame have them sit with the shame have


---------11:43----------
them teach you how to sit with the shame


---------11:45----------
sit with it because as long as you are


---------11:48----------
sitting with it it is outside of you do


---------11:49----------
you all get that like if i'm sitting on


---------11:51----------
a park bench with someone else like that


---------11:53----------
person isn't me it is outside of me at


---------11:55----------
that point so learning to sit with shame


---------11:58----------
is like i'm over here the shame is over


---------12:00----------
there but if it's over there then it's


---------12:02----------
no longer a part of me and then all of


---------12:03----------
these things i am a failure is not


---------12:06----------
correct you can't say that if you're


---------12:08----------
 sitting sitting with shame


---------12:11----------
um


---------12:12----------
so you can't you can't say that right


---------12:14----------
like


---------12:16----------
once you sit with the shame then i'm


---------12:18----------
over here and then the shame is over


---------12:20----------
there


---------12:21----------
okay


---------12:24----------
does that make sense


---------12:25----------
so i wouldn't give up on therapy


---------12:28----------
and and if i say just have hope you


---------12:30----------
can't just have hope if you don't have


---------12:32----------
hope that's okay but if you've signed up


---------12:34----------
for coaching it's your coach's job to be


---------12:36----------
hopeful for you and teach you how to be


---------12:38----------
helpful and that's totally fine like


---------12:40----------
that's fair


---------12:43----------
you must everyone i want you to


---------12:46----------
understand you must do the the shooting


---------12:47----------
with the shame


---------12:49----------
 with it it's wonderful


---------13:11----------
you
