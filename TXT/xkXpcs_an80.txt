---------00:00----------
today


---------00:01----------
we are going to try to do something very


---------00:03----------
challenging


---------00:05----------
so


---------00:06----------
i'm going to teach y'all a little bit


---------00:07----------
about the relationship between adhd and


---------00:10----------
depression and i have to say this is one


---------00:12----------
of the most


---------00:14----------
difficult lectures that i've had to


---------00:16----------
prepare


---------00:17----------
uh so that i'm going to need y'all to


---------00:19----------
like cut me some slack first of all so i


---------00:22----------
don't know if this is going to be too


---------00:23----------
much or too little


---------00:24----------
we're going to span a lot of different


---------00:26----------
stuff so we're going to talk about


---------00:27----------
genetics we're going to talk about


---------00:28----------
neuroscience we're going to talk about


---------00:30----------
developmental psychology we're going to


---------00:32----------
talk about sort of the manifestation in


---------00:34----------
the present


---------00:36----------
of


---------00:37----------
depression and adhd and like how that


---------00:39----------
looks so basically what i want to do


---------00:40----------
today is share with you guys


---------00:44----------
the narrative of adhd and depression so


---------00:47----------
what are the genetics what happens in


---------00:49----------
your brain what changes in your brain


---------00:52----------
result in


---------00:53----------
cognitive changes or behavioral changes


---------00:55----------
within a person


---------00:57----------
how do those changes within the person


---------01:00----------
affect their development through life


---------01:02----------
and then what does that look like in the


---------01:04----------
present like where do we end up once you


---------01:06----------
have a genetic change a neuroscientific


---------01:08----------
change a developmental consequence and


---------01:11----------
then you're kind of in the present


---------01:13----------
and then the question is going to be


---------01:14----------
like sort of the next question is like


---------01:16----------
now that we understand how we got here


---------01:18----------
and what our current situation is what


---------01:20----------
we can do about it so this is


---------01:22----------
challenging as an educator because like


---------01:25----------
it's going to involve


---------01:26----------
so many different disciplines of science


---------01:29----------
and even like a little not so much on


---------01:30----------
the spirituality but like psychology and


---------01:32----------
therapy and things like that


---------01:34----------
so i don't know if it's going to be too


---------01:35----------
much information i don't know if y'all


---------01:37----------
are going to be able to follow along so


---------01:38----------
the one thing that i need is the ability


---------01:40----------
to redo this lecture in the future if it


---------01:42----------
kind of implodes


---------01:44----------
um one thing that i that i've started to


---------01:47----------
uh


---------01:48----------
you know really appreciate is that the


---------01:50----------
internet is full of like really really


---------01:52----------
smart and engaged people


---------01:54----------
and so one thing that we're trying to do


---------01:56----------
at healthy gamer which we're sort of


---------01:57----------
committed to is like not dumbing things


---------01:59----------
down so it's my firm belief that you


---------02:01----------
know the better you understand the


---------02:02----------
situation even if it's like hard to


---------02:04----------
understand the more equipped you're


---------02:07----------
going to be to actually make a neg


---------02:09----------
positive impact in your life okay


---------02:12----------
so uh and then if we have time we'll


---------02:14----------
we'll touch on a couple of reddit posts


---------02:16----------
so i'm estimating this lecture to take


---------02:18----------
somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes just


---------02:20----------
so you all know um you know where it's


---------02:23----------
gonna be quite dense and so it's


---------02:25----------
possible it'll like end up with an hour


---------02:26----------
especially if we get to questions and


---------02:28----------
things like that


---------02:29----------
so let's start by talking about adhd and


---------02:32----------
depression


---------02:34----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------02:35----------
adhd and depress let me do an outline so


---------02:38----------
we're going to talk about


---------02:40----------
what we understand about genetics


---------02:43----------
okay and this is the other thing that i


---------02:45----------
have to tell you guys at many points


---------02:46----------
throughout this lecture because this is


---------02:47----------
science and i'm presenting it as such


---------02:50----------
y'all may feel like oh my god does this


---------02:52----------
mean i'm screwed i have adhd i have


---------02:54----------
depression does that mean like because


---------02:55----------
of my genetics and the genetics are so


---------02:57----------
bad that we're screwed no you're not


---------02:59----------
screwed just because of anything that we


---------03:01----------
talk about here even though it sounds


---------03:04----------
like the evidence i'm going to present


---------03:05----------
is going to be quite compelling the


---------03:07----------
statistics are going to be quite


---------03:08----------
shocking and at the same time you're not


---------03:10----------
screwed so don't worry about it okay


---------03:12----------
we'll we'll i'll kind of explain why so


---------03:14----------
we're going to start off by looking at


---------03:15----------
genetics then what we're going to do


---------03:18----------
is sort of look at how our genetics


---------03:20----------
manifest as particular changes in our


---------03:23----------
brain what are the different circuits in


---------03:26----------
our brain that deal with adhd and


---------03:28----------
depression


---------03:29----------
how and specifically what are the


---------03:31----------
circuits in our brain that result in an


---------03:33----------
interaction between these two diseases


---------03:36----------
okay


---------03:37----------
once we sort of understand the


---------03:39----------
neuroscience of the brain of someone


---------03:41----------
with adhd and depression what we're


---------03:43----------
going to end up with is understanding a


---------03:45----------
set of cognitive deficits


---------03:49----------
right so what is like the practical


---------03:51----------
consequence sure i'm going to be talking


---------03:52----------
about things like brain volume and


---------03:54----------
different circuits in the brain and


---------03:55----------
stuff like that but practically how does


---------03:57----------
that translate into particular deficits


---------04:00----------
once we understand the deficits then


---------04:02----------
what we're going to do is take a look at


---------04:03----------
development


---------04:05----------
so if we take someone who has these


---------04:07----------
particular manifested deficits


---------04:10----------
how does their life evolve and what kind


---------04:13----------
of circumstances and experiences do they


---------04:15----------
have as a result of those deficits


---------04:18----------
and once we understand development then


---------04:20----------
what we can do is look at the present


---------04:22----------
so now that we understand the


---------04:23----------
developmental arc what does that result


---------04:25----------
in today like what are you dealing with


---------04:27----------
today and what are the consequences of


---------04:29----------
the development


---------04:30----------
okay so like in the present what are


---------04:32----------
your symptoms


---------04:34----------
what does your life look like


---------04:36----------
right so this is like what we're when


---------04:37----------
we're gonna cite research at every step


---------04:39----------
of the way


---------04:40----------
so if we do a cross-sectional analysis


---------04:42----------
if you guys know what that means on


---------04:44----------
people with adhd and depression what do


---------04:45----------
we find so cross-sectional for those


---------04:47----------
that that don't know is like


---------04:49----------
research that basically is about one


---------04:51----------
point in time in the present okay


---------04:54----------
and so if we like take a snapshot of


---------04:56----------
people with adhd and depression what do


---------04:58----------
we discover about their lives in their


---------04:59----------
situations


---------05:01----------
and then the next thing is that once we


---------05:03----------
understand like all of these different


---------05:05----------
things and we understand okay what are


---------05:06----------
the deficits what's going on in the


---------05:07----------
brain what's the developmental impact


---------05:09----------
what are what do you face on like in the


---------05:12----------
here and now


---------05:13----------
trying to put together a road map


---------05:17----------
to address our problems


---------05:20----------
so like once we understand the


---------05:22----------
complexity that is like adhd and


---------05:24----------
depression


---------05:25----------
can


---------05:26----------
all of this information essentially give


---------05:28----------
us some kind of road map forward you all


---------05:31----------
ready for this


---------05:33----------
is this good


---------05:36----------
okay we'll get to we'll get to a lot of


---------05:38----------
what you guys are talking about okay so


---------05:39----------
let's start with genetics


---------05:41----------
what do we know


---------05:43----------
about the genetics of adhd and


---------05:46----------
depression


---------05:47----------
so the first thing is that twin studies


---------05:52----------
so there's a great paper by in 2019 by


---------05:55----------
farron and larson


---------05:57----------
show essentially a 70 concordance


---------06:02----------
with adhd and


---------06:04----------
depression so what that sort of suggests


---------06:07----------
is that there's a very tight link


---------06:10----------
between there's a genetic root that


---------06:13----------
manifests is both adhd and depression so


---------06:16----------
like twin studies are actually quite


---------06:18----------
compelling here that like there's


---------06:20----------
something going on in the genes so if


---------06:22----------
you look at genes that there's a 70


---------06:24----------
concordance between these these two


---------06:25----------
things and so we'll get to how this is


---------06:27----------
related and and you know how you


---------06:29----------
manifest as both but it does appear that


---------06:31----------
there's essentially like a very very


---------06:34----------
tight genetic link


---------06:36----------
in terms of adhd and depression now for


---------06:39----------
those of you that are kind of so this is


---------06:40----------
the first point of hopelessness okay


---------06:42----------
they're gonna be several points of


---------06:42----------
hopelessness and i'm gonna try to


---------06:44----------
address each of them in turn


---------06:46----------
so if i were to say that there's a high


---------06:48----------
genetic correlation between adhd and


---------06:50----------
depression what a lot of people will


---------06:52----------
conclude is that if i've got the bad


---------06:54----------
genes if i you know if i got unlucky in


---------06:57----------
the genetic lottery basically i'm


---------06:59----------
screwed for life but the truth of the


---------07:01----------
matter is as a clinician that's


---------07:02----------
absolutely not the case so this is what


---------07:04----------
i want y'all to understand about like


---------07:06----------
the relationship between genetics and


---------07:08----------
how it manifests in an individual


---------07:11----------
so i think about genetics as a


---------07:13----------
vulnerability or a potential and


---------07:15----------
generally speaking what we understand


---------07:16----------
from psychiatrists and this is clinical


---------07:18----------
medicine okay so this isn't like genetic


---------07:20----------
studies this is like looking at real


---------07:21----------
human beings


---------07:23----------
is that genetics


---------07:25----------
plus environment


---------07:30----------
equals illness


---------07:34----------
so essentially what's going on is


---------07:36----------
genetics is sort of like your


---------07:37----------
vulnerability


---------07:39----------
or the probability of something going on


---------07:42----------
and then when you combine that with


---------07:43----------
particular experiences


---------07:46----------
if that formula isn't doesn't go well


---------07:48----------
you end up with illness okay so for


---------07:51----------
example some people may be genetically


---------07:53----------
predisposed to trauma so they have like


---------07:56----------
a 50


---------07:57----------
you know risk of


---------07:59----------
trauma


---------08:01----------
and then depending on what kind of


---------08:02----------
experience they have let's say they grow


---------08:04----------
up you know in in central africa where


---------08:06----------
there's like a lot of you know genocide


---------08:08----------
and other bad things


---------08:11----------
then that'll result in something like


---------08:13----------
ptsd


---------08:14----------
and so there may be people with like 25


---------08:17----------
risk or 75 risk and so depending on like


---------08:20----------
you know what the other traumatic


---------08:22----------
experience is let's say this is like


---------08:24----------
you're in the holocaust


---------08:26----------
so then you end up with ptsd


---------08:29----------
and let's say even this person is like


---------08:31----------
you know


---------08:31----------
had a mom who never gave them like like


---------08:33----------
no bedtime stories


---------08:38----------
and this can result in ptsd


---------08:40----------
so you guys see like basically genetic


---------08:42----------
genetics doesn't determine


---------08:44----------
is not like it's not a destiny


---------08:47----------
it's a vulnerability


---------08:49----------
that combined with a particular


---------08:50----------
experience can result in the


---------08:52----------
manifestation of an illness okay


---------08:55----------
so like the other way that i kind of


---------08:57----------
think about this just to use a quick


---------08:58----------
analogy is i kind of think about like


---------09:00----------
the the genetic vulnerability as like a


---------09:03----------
seed okay so like genetics is like a


---------09:06----------
seed


---------09:09----------
and then depending on what kind of soil


---------09:11----------
you plant the seed in and this is where


---------09:13----------
the experience is like the soil


---------09:18----------
depending on what kind of


---------09:21----------
soil you plant the seed and it can


---------09:22----------
result in a plant or not a plant right


---------09:24----------
so if like if my soil is like concrete


---------09:26----------
and i take this seed and i try to plant


---------09:28----------
it in concrete it's never gonna grow so


---------09:31----------
like a concrete soil is sort of like


---------09:33----------
what i think of as like let's say a monk


---------09:35----------
right because they're so control of


---------09:36----------
their mind they're in so such strong


---------09:39----------
control of their mind that like even


---------09:41----------
genetic vulnerabilities can be kind of


---------09:42----------
like overcome


---------09:44----------
compared to if i take you know even a


---------09:46----------
seed that's not very robust and not very


---------09:49----------
healthy and i plant it in super fertile


---------09:51----------
soil like growing up in an environment


---------09:53----------
where you have parents that are like


---------09:55----------
abusive and emotionally neglectful even


---------09:58----------
the you know the the weakest seed when


---------10:01----------
grown in the most fertile soil will


---------10:03----------
manifest in a plant and so then people


---------10:06----------
are saying well okay like i know what


---------10:07----------
the next you know point of hopelessness


---------10:09----------
is oh i have a genetic vulnerability i


---------10:11----------
have a family history of like whatever


---------10:14----------
and i grew up in an unhealthy


---------10:15----------
environment does that mean that i'm


---------10:17----------
basically screwed and the answer is


---------10:19----------
still no because remember that through


---------10:21----------
experiences you can actually change the


---------10:23----------
soil right so this continues to be


---------10:26----------
malleable


---------10:27----------
so even if you have genetic


---------10:29----------
vulnerabilities to particular things by


---------10:31----------
changing your environment by changing


---------10:32----------
your relationships you can still escape


---------10:35----------
the destiny that negative genetics will


---------10:37----------
offer you does that make sense chat we


---------10:39----------
understand that


---------10:41----------
so going back to adhd so there does seem


---------10:43----------
to be in depression there does seem to


---------10:45----------
be a strong genetic concordance between


---------10:48----------
adhd and depression if you drew the


---------10:50----------
short end of this


---------10:51----------
the stick or if you drew the short straw


---------10:54----------
sorry doesn't mean you're screwed okay a


---------10:56----------
couple of other things to note about the


---------10:59----------
genetics and sort of correlation between


---------11:01----------
between adhd and depression so this is


---------11:03----------
quite alarming


---------11:05----------
so adhd


---------11:07----------
increases your risk of depression by


---------11:10----------
five-fold


---------11:13----------
okay so it's like an increased risk it's


---------11:15----------
crazy


---------11:17----------
by fivefold so you're five if you take


---------11:19----------
a group of uh you should take a hundred


---------11:21----------
kids


---------11:22----------
and 50 of them have adhd and 50 of them


---------11:25----------
have no adhd the likelihood of


---------11:28----------
depression is five times higher in the


---------11:30----------
adhd crowd compared to the non-adhd


---------11:33----------
crowd even more alarming is there's a


---------11:36----------
five times


---------11:37----------
five hundred percent basically


---------11:39----------
increase in suicidal ideation for people


---------11:42----------
who have adhd there's also a


---------11:47----------
3x risk of completed suicide


---------11:51----------
this is staggering


---------11:53----------
okay


---------11:54----------
so people who have adhd are three


---------11:57----------
three times the increased risk of of


---------12:00----------
actually committing suicide


---------12:02----------
okay so there's like a lot of stuff


---------12:04----------
going on here which may relate back to


---------12:06----------
genetics we'll talk about this stuff a


---------12:07----------
little bit more later right so for


---------12:09----------
example we know that suicidality usually


---------12:12----------
completed suicide is not like a long and


---------12:14----------
planned thing


---------12:15----------
so if you there have been studies done


---------12:17----------
where basically people take we examine


---------12:20----------
people who attempted suicide


---------12:22----------
and for some reason or another we were


---------12:24----------
able to save their life and then we


---------12:25----------
asked them when did you make the


---------12:27----------
decision to complete to try to kill


---------12:29----------
yourself and movies and media will


---------12:31----------
portray suicide as like a long and


---------12:33----------
thought out kind of thing right we'll


---------12:35----------
sort of think like i'm going to put my


---------12:36----------
affairs in order i'm gonna write a bunch


---------12:38----------
of notes and i'm gonna do all this stuff


---------12:39----------
and i'm gonna order the favorite thing


---------12:41----------
for like i'm gonna order


---------12:43----------
presents for the next five christmases


---------12:45----------
for my kids because i won't be around to


---------12:47----------
order them right so people like there's


---------12:49----------
this idea that we put our affairs in


---------12:50----------
order but somewhere between 60 and 80 of


---------12:53----------
people


---------12:54----------
the decision to try to kill yourself


---------12:56----------
happens within five minutes of the


---------12:58----------
attempt so it's a very impulsive


---------13:00----------
decision and so if we look at adhd adhd


---------13:03----------
we know increases your impulsivity we'll


---------13:05----------
get to that in a second and so we can


---------13:07----------
see how if you have a brain that is more


---------13:09----------
likely to be vulnerable to impulsive


---------13:11----------
decisions you will actually increase


---------13:12----------
your risk of suicide


---------13:14----------
does that make sense so we'll kind of go


---------13:16----------
into this more


---------13:17----------
so this is kind of a quick result of um


---------13:21----------
you know looking at sort of genetics and


---------13:23----------
the


---------13:24----------
what are what are sort of the


---------13:25----------
epidemiologic factors what are the risk


---------13:27----------
factors and what can we sort of expect


---------13:29----------
about the connection between adhd and


---------13:31----------
depression from a statistical level the


---------13:34----------
other interesting thing about this is


---------13:36----------
that


---------13:36----------
treatment


---------13:39----------
of adhd


---------13:43----------
reduces depression symptoms


---------13:46----------
by 20


---------13:49----------
so it appears that treating adhd


---------13:52----------
actually has a therapeutic impact on


---------13:54----------
depression so once again what we're


---------13:56----------
seeing here through the twin studies


---------13:59----------
through this stuff and through this


---------14:00----------
stuff


---------14:01----------
is that these are not two separate


---------14:03----------
diseases


---------14:05----------
that both some people are afflicted


---------14:07----------
right this is the main point that i'm


---------14:08----------
trying to make this is what you need to


---------14:09----------
understand is that we may classify adhd


---------14:12----------
and depression as completely separate


---------14:13----------
illnesses but when i work with people as


---------14:15----------
a clinician and when we look at sort of


---------14:17----------
the science and the statistics around it


---------14:19----------
what it seems is that there's a common


---------14:21----------
process that manifests as both adhd and


---------14:25----------
depression so it's not like really two


---------14:27----------
separate diseases it's like there's some


---------14:29----------
sort of common root that manifests in it


---------14:32----------
with these two constructs that are sort


---------14:34----------
of societally made okay


---------14:37----------
so now let's look at okay so let's say


---------14:38----------
that i have you know these genetic


---------14:40----------
changes


---------14:44----------
okay so i've got a set of particular


---------14:46----------
alleles that make me


---------14:48----------
predisposed to


---------14:50----------
depression and adhd so let's try to


---------14:52----------
understand what's going on in the brain


---------14:54----------
of people who are who have this genetic


---------14:56----------
vulnerability so we're going to talk


---------14:58----------
about a couple of different circuits of


---------15:00----------
the brain okay so this is like my


---------15:01----------
terrible drawing of a brain so here's a


---------15:03----------
brain okay


---------15:05----------
so over here we have


---------15:08----------
the amygdala


---------15:11----------
okay


---------15:13----------
so this is kind of interesting


---------15:14----------
so the amygdala


---------15:18----------
is responsible for the experience of


---------15:20----------
negative emotions


---------15:25----------
it's also our survival center of the


---------15:27----------
brain


---------15:30----------
so this is where we experience things


---------15:31----------
like fear and and sort of anxiety and


---------15:34----------
things like that okay


---------15:36----------
we also have uh like the insula which is


---------15:39----------
kind of around here


---------15:43----------
which is also relates to negative


---------15:45----------
emotions


---------15:46----------
so a lot of our emotional circuitry is


---------15:48----------
kind of in this central part of the


---------15:49----------
brain okay


---------15:51----------
there are a couple other other


---------15:54----------
sort of things that i want to talk about


---------15:56----------
this is


---------15:58----------
the nucleus accumbens so this is a major


---------16:01----------
part of reward circuitry


---------16:05----------
so the nucleus accumbens is a


---------16:07----------
dopaminergic


---------16:09----------
area of the brain


---------16:10----------
uh brain which means that it's like


---------16:12----------
infla like it sort of governs behavior


---------16:15----------
and reward it's probably actually a


---------16:17----------
little bit close more to the right which


---------16:18----------
i guess i can fix later


---------16:20----------
and then there are going to be a couple


---------16:21----------
of other parts of the brain that we're


---------16:23----------
going to talk about one is the


---------16:25----------
orbitofrontal cortex or ofc


---------16:28----------
so this involves the regulation of


---------16:30----------
emotion


---------16:34----------
okay so like what i mean by this is i


---------16:36----------
don't know if you guys have had this


---------16:37----------
experience but like sometimes we get


---------16:39----------
emotional and we can logically try to


---------16:42----------
talk ourselves out of it right we can


---------16:44----------
sort of like use logic or control


---------16:46----------
circuits of the brain these are our


---------16:48----------
emotional impulses


---------16:50----------
over here


---------16:52----------
okay


---------16:53----------
so these over here are emotional


---------16:55----------
impulses


---------16:57----------
and this is where our control comes from


---------16:59----------
if that sort of makes sense okay and


---------17:01----------
this is where if we look at this if we


---------17:03----------
look at this thing over here this is


---------17:05----------
where we sort of get the nucleus


---------17:07----------
accumbens will govern a lot of our


---------17:09----------
behavior so we'll kind of get to that in


---------17:10----------
a second okay


---------17:12----------
the other thing um


---------17:15----------
the other part of the brain that we're


---------17:17----------
going to kind of talk about is the


---------17:18----------
dorsolateral


---------17:20----------
pfc


---------17:21----------
okay and this also has to do the motion


---------17:23----------
regulation


---------17:25----------
or emotional control i would say as


---------17:27----------
opposed to regulation we'll talk a


---------17:28----------
little bit about how those are different


---------17:29----------
okay


---------17:30----------
and then the other thing that's kind of


---------17:32----------
important is that like there are


---------17:34----------
connections between these these parts of


---------17:36----------
the brain and those are important too so


---------17:38----------
like we're going to talk about the


---------17:40----------
anterior cingulate cortex


---------17:42----------
okay so this mediates


---------17:46----------
talk


---------17:47----------
between


---------17:50----------
our


---------17:51----------
emotions


---------17:54----------
and


---------17:55----------
let me uh our


---------17:58----------
i don't know control functions


---------18:03----------
okay you guys with the neuroscience so


---------18:04----------
like basically there's this thing called


---------18:06----------
the acc which is here


---------18:08----------
which basically is the circuit that


---------18:10----------
allows these two guys


---------18:13----------
to talk to these folks over here


---------18:16----------
so this is sort of a basic we'll kind of


---------18:19----------
talk about you know what what the


---------18:20----------
changes are in a second


---------18:22----------
so this is what we see in people who


---------18:24----------
have adhd the first thing is that


---------18:27----------
the volume we have the volume


---------18:30----------
of amygdala


---------18:33----------
and insula


---------18:36----------
is smaller than controls


---------18:40----------
okay so what this means is like these


---------18:42----------
parts of our brain are actually smaller


---------18:43----------
there's like a decreased volume so they


---------18:45----------
have small


---------18:46----------
emotional circuits


---------18:51----------
okay now this is kind of interesting


---------18:52----------
because some people may hypothesize they


---------18:54----------
may say well if our like emotional parts


---------18:56----------
of our brain are like smaller doesn't


---------18:57----------
that mean we experience less emotion and


---------18:59----------
it turns out that the opposite is true


---------19:02----------
that if you look at


---------19:03----------
um that how can i say this


---------19:06----------
that uh volume


---------19:08----------
of amygdala


---------19:11----------
is inversely correlated


---------19:18----------
with depression


---------19:20----------
so the smaller your amygdala is the more


---------19:23----------
likely you are to experience depression


---------19:26----------
for people who have large emotional


---------19:27----------
circuits just based on raw brain volume


---------19:31----------
they are actually less likely to


---------19:33----------
experience depression


---------19:35----------
okay


---------19:36----------
now the next thing that's important to


---------19:37----------
understand is so this is so you guys get


---------19:40----------
this you all got that


---------19:42----------
so what that basically means is that


---------19:43----------
like small amygdala and insula which is


---------19:45----------
what we see in adhd


---------19:48----------
results in a greater vulnerability to


---------19:51----------
the experience of depression the second


---------19:53----------
thing that's really really interesting


---------19:55----------
is that the nucleus accumbens of people


---------19:57----------
with adhd is different and the main


---------19:59----------
thing that's different about the nucleus


---------20:00----------
accumbens is that our emotional


---------20:02----------
circuitry


---------20:04----------
has a large positive effect


---------20:08----------
on our nucleus accumbens so what does


---------20:10----------
that mean so this means that people with


---------20:12----------
adhd


---------20:14----------
the influence of their emotions on their


---------20:16----------
behavior


---------20:18----------
is


---------20:18----------
stronger


---------20:20----------
than the influence of emotions on


---------20:22----------
behavior in a normal brain


---------20:24----------
okay so what that means is that people


---------20:26----------
with adhd


---------20:29----------
their behaviors


---------20:32----------
are vulnerable


---------20:35----------
to motion


---------20:39----------
okay do y'all does that make sense


---------20:42----------
so so generally speaking our nucleus


---------20:44----------
accumbens like gets all kinds of


---------20:46----------
different like projections right so what


---------20:47----------
will happen is like there will be an


---------20:49----------
influence from our emotions there will


---------20:51----------
be an influence from our frontal lobes


---------20:53----------
there may be even like influences from


---------20:55----------
like you know let's say our linguistic


---------20:57----------
cortex not sorry not linguistic lingual


---------21:01----------
gustatory that's the word i'm looking


---------21:03----------
for


---------21:05----------
so this is our ability to taste for


---------21:07----------
example like that can have influences on


---------21:10----------
like reward and behavior right so we get


---------21:12----------
all kinds of like stuff that goes into


---------21:14----------
the nucleus accumbens and basically like


---------21:16----------
our brain has this constant calculation


---------21:18----------
of like should i do this behavior is


---------21:20----------
this rewarding or not rewarding and so


---------21:22----------
like you can have things like taste


---------21:25----------
right like your cortices are like oh i


---------21:27----------
shouldn't eat that because i'm trying to


---------21:28----------
lose weight and then like your amygdala


---------21:30----------
is like i've had a bad day you know i


---------21:32----------
just went through a breakup screw it


---------21:34----------
we're just gonna eat a tub of ice cream


---------21:36----------
so that's like literally like the


---------21:37----------
experience of a human being can be


---------21:39----------
mapped onto the nucleus accumbens in the


---------21:42----------
way that these different parts of the


---------21:43----------
brain sort of interact with them


---------21:45----------
so when we look at the brain of someone


---------21:46----------
with adhd the amygdala and insula are


---------21:49----------
going to have stronger impacts on the


---------21:51----------
nucleus accumbens which may also so if


---------21:54----------
we kind of look at like what is the you


---------21:55----------
know what is the result of that what


---------21:58----------
this means if we take like amygdala


---------22:03----------
and then plus nucleus accumbens in the


---------22:06----------
brain of adhd what we get is impulsive


---------22:08----------
behavior


---------22:11----------
and emotional behavior


---------22:14----------
you guys see that like how the more i'm


---------22:17----------
i'm controlled by actually let me put it


---------22:19----------
this way the more i'm controlled by my


---------22:22----------
my emotions


---------22:23----------
the more impulsive i'm gonna seem


---------22:26----------
my behaviors will be more impulsive do


---------22:28----------
you all get that so we can kind of see


---------22:30----------
that the that the phenotype or the


---------22:32----------
manifestation of adhd


---------22:35----------
of impulsivity


---------22:37----------
jesus


---------22:39----------
may come from this neuroscientific


---------22:41----------
interaction so now we're going to get to


---------22:43----------
this in a second but we can see how the


---------22:46----------
symptoms of adhd are the experience of


---------22:48----------
someone with adhd their impulsivity


---------22:51----------
which is not like a neuroscientific


---------22:52----------
thing there's no like impulsivity


---------22:55----------
circuit of the brain i mean there may be


---------22:56----------
a circuit but impulsivity can't be


---------22:58----------
mapped to a neuroscientific structure


---------23:01----------
what we can map to a neuroscientific


---------23:02----------
structure is the integration of all


---------23:05----------
these different things to the nucleus


---------23:07----------
accumbens and based on the way that


---------23:08----------
those circuits integrate into the


---------23:10----------
nucleus accumbens we can have impulsive


---------23:12----------
behavior or we can have non-impulsive


---------23:14----------
behavior


---------23:15----------
another example of that is that when we


---------23:17----------
have a very strong frontal


---------23:20----------
control of our nucleus accumbens we will


---------23:22----------
result in less impulsive behavior okay


---------23:26----------
so now we can see that like you know we


---------23:28----------
can sort of start to see where


---------23:29----------
impulsivity and especially emotional


---------23:31----------
decision making


---------23:33----------
kind of with people with adhd come from


---------23:35----------
okay


---------23:37----------
the next thing that we're going to talk


---------23:38----------
about is in adhd unfortunately there


---------23:42----------
appears to be


---------23:43----------
a weak connection


---------23:46----------
over here


---------23:47----------
okay


---------23:48----------
there's a weak connection over here and


---------23:50----------
so like this the anterior cingulate


---------23:53----------
cortex and people with adhd is weak


---------23:56----------
and so what that means is that the


---------23:57----------
ability for our cortical brain which is


---------24:00----------
like emotional control regulation of


---------24:02----------
emotion and most importantly this


---------24:05----------
circuit that allows the connection


---------24:07----------
between our control circuits and our


---------24:09----------
emotional circuits seems to be weak and


---------24:12----------
so since it's weak our ability to kind


---------24:14----------
of regulate our emotions or put the


---------24:16----------
brakes on emotions seems to be negative


---------24:18----------
and negatively impacted so these are the


---------24:21----------
functions that we call top down control


---------24:28----------
so this is deficient


---------24:31----------
in people who have adhd


---------24:33----------
what top down control means is like you


---------24:35----------
know like you can have impulses within


---------24:37----------
you so i have like an impulse right


---------24:39----------
which i don't really control it's just


---------24:41----------
an impulse and then there's like my


---------24:43----------
brain over here which is kind of


---------24:44----------
suppressing it it's like oh man i really


---------24:46----------
want to eat french fries and then my


---------24:48----------
brain is like no no we're not going to


---------24:49----------
eat french fries we're going to eat a


---------24:50----------
salad so that top down control comes


---------24:53----------
from the frontal lobes


---------24:57----------
and this part appears to be deficient in


---------24:59----------
adhd so this is this can also result in


---------25:02----------
impulsivity you guys see that so now


---------25:05----------
so this is kind of like a quick summary


---------25:07----------
okay so let's let's go over it from the


---------25:08----------
top


---------25:10----------
and then we'll we're sort of setting


---------25:11----------
ourselves up to understand the


---------25:12----------
neuroscience and how this will manifest


---------25:15----------
is symptoms of adhd so the first thing


---------25:17----------
to understand


---------25:19----------
is that


---------25:22----------
um let's pick


---------25:23----------
purple


---------25:24----------
okay


---------25:25----------
so the first thing is that the brain


---------25:28----------
volume of the amygdala and the insulin


---------25:30----------
people with adhd is small


---------25:33----------
what this sort of results in is


---------25:36----------
essentially like


---------25:38----------
our ability to


---------25:40----------
how can i say this so we know that that


---------25:43----------
these regions of the brain being small


---------25:46----------
correlate


---------25:48----------
with


---------25:48----------
worse depression


---------25:50----------
okay so let's just accept that let's not


---------25:52----------
try to understand how that works for a


---------25:53----------
second


---------25:54----------
the second thing is that we have our


---------25:56----------
control circuits of the brain which seem


---------25:58----------
to be less connected


---------26:04----------
to emotions


---------26:05----------
so what that means is our ability to put


---------26:07----------
the brakes on our emotions has gone down


---------26:09----------
so this is also mediated through the acc


---------26:12----------
and lastly we have the nucleus accumbens


---------26:14----------
which essentially determines


---------26:16----------
what we do


---------26:19----------
and what we see in the nucleus accumbens


---------26:20----------
of people with adhd is that it's very


---------26:23----------
sensitive to emotions


---------26:30----------
and less sensitive


---------26:33----------
to


---------26:34----------
top


---------26:36----------
down


---------26:37----------
control


---------26:39----------
y'all with me


---------26:41----------
right so the experience of emotions


---------26:43----------
influences your behavior your ability to


---------26:46----------
put


---------26:46----------
the brakes on that is harder and then


---------26:49----------
this is the key thing about reward


---------26:51----------
circuitry what that means is that like


---------26:52----------
in your brain


---------26:55----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but it's


---------26:56----------
not conscious but you are


---------26:59----------
there is greater reinforcement


---------27:02----------
from emotional decisions i know it


---------27:04----------
sounds kind of bizarre but like what


---------27:06----------
that means if we kind of think about


---------27:07----------
like being like in the the behavioral


---------27:10----------
reinforcement the dopaminergic circuit


---------27:12----------
that actually drives your behavior and


---------27:14----------
creates your motivation


---------27:16----------
all of your motivational hard wiring in


---------27:19----------
your brain all of your motivation in


---------27:20----------
your brain that gets hardwired is going


---------27:22----------
to be more shaped by like emotional


---------27:25----------
decisions


---------27:26----------
so it's kind of really challenging okay


---------27:29----------
so now what we're going to do


---------27:31----------
is get to the deficits


---------27:33----------
so this is what happened


---------27:35----------
so researchers


---------27:39----------
looked


---------27:40----------
did a bunch of studies and essentially


---------27:42----------
what they did is they looked at okay


---------27:45----------
what are the factors


---------27:46----------
in um


---------27:49----------
adhd so if we take a group of people


---------27:51----------
with adhd and depression


---------27:53----------
what are the factors that we can sort of


---------27:55----------
conclude correlate with these two things


---------27:58----------
right so what this essentially do is


---------28:00----------
they take a group of people with adhd


---------28:01----------
and depression they take a group of


---------28:03----------
normal people and they explore okay what


---------28:05----------
is the impact of having adhd and


---------28:07----------
depression so this is essentially what


---------28:09----------
they discovered


---------28:11----------
so the first thing is that there is


---------28:13----------
emotional


---------28:16----------
regulation deficits


---------28:20----------
and i know this may seem common sense at


---------28:22----------
this point or like duh right didn't we


---------28:23----------
just explain that but i want you all to


---------28:25----------
understand these are different kinds of


---------28:26----------
studies right so this is like these are


---------28:28----------
brain scans where they're just scanning


---------28:30----------
people's brain and they don't know


---------28:31----------
anything about the people's symptoms or


---------28:33----------
their experiences of life


---------28:35----------
and these are like looking like asking


---------28:37----------
people questions about okay are you


---------28:39----------
depressed why are you depressed and then


---------28:41----------
they track that down to their individual


---------28:43----------
experience so this is like individual


---------28:46----------
experiences


---------28:50----------
and this is like brain scans


---------28:53----------
right so these are different kinds of


---------28:55----------
data so we're trying to weave them


---------28:56----------
together now hopefully at this point you


---------28:58----------
guys are saying well doug this is


---------28:59----------
obvious and that's the whole point of


---------29:00----------
the lecture is to try to integrate these


---------29:02----------
different kinds of research so we can


---------29:04----------
get a better understanding the second


---------29:05----------
thing is


---------29:06----------
people with adhd and depression are more


---------29:08----------
irritable and irritability is its own


---------29:14----------
biological and neuroscientific


---------29:17----------
thing okay


---------29:20----------
we'll talk about what emotional


---------29:21----------
dysregulation means let me actually see


---------29:23----------
so so actually let's let's define


---------29:26----------
emotional regulation right now so it is


---------29:28----------
the ability


---------29:30----------
to


---------29:30----------
[Music]


---------29:31----------
identify


---------29:34----------
and modify


---------29:38----------
get ready to get wrecked chat


---------29:40----------
um


---------29:41----------
emotional


---------29:44----------
states


---------29:46----------
that


---------29:50----------
promote


---------29:52----------
adaptive


---------29:55----------
and goal


---------29:56----------
directed


---------29:59----------
behavior


---------30:01----------
okay


---------30:07----------
right so this is kind of damning for a


---------30:08----------
lot of us


---------30:10----------
so this is a quick side note so in our


---------30:12----------
coaching program we've had somewhere


---------30:14----------
between five and six thousand people


---------30:16----------
maybe seven thousand now and so we're


---------30:18----------
doing a massive study on our coaching


---------30:20----------
program and what we find in our coaching


---------30:22----------
program is that we see a 20 to 40


---------30:23----------
percent reduction in depression or


---------30:26----------
anxiety despite the fact that our


---------30:27----------
coaching program is not treatment for


---------30:30----------
depression or anxiety so how is it that


---------30:33----------
coaching can actually improve symptoms


---------30:35----------
that we're not trying to improve at all


---------30:37----------
we're not qualified we're not trained


---------30:38----------
we're not mental health professionals


---------30:40----------
so it turns out that our running


---------30:42----------
hypothesis which we're actually studying


---------30:44----------
right now is that we believe that


---------30:46----------
coaching actually improves eq or


---------30:49----------
emotional quotient


---------30:51----------
it improves our emotional regulation it


---------30:53----------
improves our ability to identify and


---------30:55----------
modify emotional states that promote


---------30:57----------
adaptive and goal-directed behavior


---------30:59----------
that's what coaching is about it's about


---------31:01----------
goal-directed behavior and sort of


---------31:03----------
taking what you are on the inside and


---------31:05----------
sort of like


---------31:07----------
adapting it shaping it so that it it


---------31:09----------
results in like motivation and goal


---------31:11----------
directed behavior


---------31:12----------
so anyway that's what emotional


---------31:14----------
regulation is


---------31:15----------
so the other things that they found was


---------31:17----------
that um


---------31:19----------
people with adhd and depression have


---------31:22----------
discordant


---------31:23----------
relationships


---------31:27----------
so there's discord


---------31:29----------
within the relationships


---------31:31----------
they found peer victimization


---------31:35----------
it's a fancy way of saying bullying


---------31:39----------
and then they found


---------31:41----------
academic hardship


---------31:46----------
okay so when we look at like people with


---------31:49----------
adhd and depression what we essentially


---------31:51----------
find is like people are trying to figure


---------31:52----------
out okay like what are the common


---------31:54----------
elements


---------31:55----------
what is the tie between adhd and


---------31:57----------
depression and these are the five things


---------31:59----------
that they found they found that people


---------32:01----------
with adhd and depression have poor


---------32:04----------
emotional regulation they're highly


---------32:06----------
irritable and what we can actually see


---------32:08----------
is that there are a couple of other


---------32:09----------
things


---------32:10----------
and that we find discordant


---------32:12----------
relationships peer victimization like


---------32:14----------
bullying and like academic hardship


---------32:16----------
so let's try to understand this a little


---------32:19----------
bit better okay


---------32:20----------
so how can adhd and depression result in


---------32:24----------
in these things


---------32:26----------
right so let's try to link our


---------32:27----------
neuroscience to these things


---------32:29----------
and then how can these in turn lead to


---------32:33----------
depression down the road so now there's


---------32:35----------
a really interesting point of of


---------32:37----------
research here okay


---------32:39----------
so this point of research is that adhd


---------32:44----------
i forget exactly leads to like 50 to 70


---------32:48----------
percent


---------32:49----------
depression


---------32:52----------
but


---------32:54----------
depression leads to 2.7


---------32:58----------
of adhd


---------33:01----------
so what does this mean


---------33:02----------
this means when you take a young child


---------33:06----------
with adhd


---------33:08----------
when they grow up to be an adult


---------33:11----------
there's like a 50 chance they're gonna


---------33:13----------
have depression


---------33:15----------
but if you take a young child with


---------33:17----------
depression there's a 2.7 percent chance


---------33:20----------
that they're going to have adhd


---------33:23----------
okay so what it actually means is that


---------33:26----------
adhd


---------33:27----------
appears to be a causal factor for adult


---------33:30----------
depression


---------33:32----------
but depression does not appear to be a


---------33:34----------
causal factor for adhd so this is a


---------33:36----------
really really important


---------33:38----------
uh point to understand what this means


---------33:41----------
is that this


---------33:42----------
if everything was purely genetic


---------33:45----------
okay and if everything was just like in


---------33:48----------
the brain


---------33:49----------
then these numbers should be the same


---------33:52----------
but what this suggests is that there's a


---------33:54----------
cogniti i mean sorry a developmental


---------33:56----------
component here that growing up with adhd


---------33:59----------
leads to depression and this is really


---------34:00----------
important for us because this is a point


---------34:02----------
of hope


---------34:03----------
if this was just pure genetics and these


---------34:05----------
numbers were exactly the same


---------34:06----------
forget about the fact that they're like


---------34:08----------
so far apart right like 50 versus three


---------34:10----------
percent that's a huge difference what


---------34:13----------
this means is that there's something


---------34:14----------
here that we can actually intervene on


---------34:17----------
you guys get


---------34:18----------
this okay so now let's try to understand


---------34:22----------
how does adhd early in life result in


---------34:25----------
depression later in life so remember


---------34:27----------
that what we've if we kind of look at


---------34:29----------
adhd we have impulsivity


---------34:34----------
inattention


---------34:38----------
okay


---------34:39----------
um


---------34:40----------
irritability


---------34:45----------
dopamine reward sensitive sensitivity


---------34:53----------
and


---------34:56----------
yeah poor emotional regulation


---------35:01----------
the other thing that we sort of know is


---------35:03----------
that people with adhd their frontal


---------35:05----------
lobes


---------35:08----------
mature more slowly


---------35:13----------
so what that means is like their


---------35:14----------
maturity is going to be less than people


---------35:17----------
of their age


---------35:18----------
so let's kind of just think about this


---------35:20----------
constellation of symptoms and what


---------35:22----------
growing up as this person


---------35:25----------
looks like or feels like okay


---------35:27----------
so the first thing is like let's talk


---------35:28----------
about you know so now what i'm gonna


---------35:30----------
actually do is i didn't do a great job


---------35:32----------
of this so let me actually


---------35:36----------
think about doing it this way okay what


---------35:38----------
we're gonna do


---------35:41----------
we're gonna take these things


---------35:45----------
okay i'm gonna move them over here


---------35:48----------
um


---------35:54----------
no


---------35:55----------
screwed gg


---------35:57----------
okay let's just let's take a look at


---------35:58----------
these three


---------35:59----------
now what we're gonna do


---------36:01----------
is take


---------36:03----------
these


---------36:10----------
okay


---------36:16----------
and we're gonna see we're gonna play a


---------36:18----------
little game chat


---------36:20----------
so these are the things that we know


---------36:21----------
from


---------36:23----------
you know studies


---------36:24----------
contribute to the depression that people


---------36:26----------
with adhd have so now let's play a


---------36:28----------
simple game chat


---------36:31----------
let's see if these match up right so


---------36:33----------
let's say i'm impulsive do you think


---------36:35----------
that will


---------36:37----------
impact


---------36:38----------
how do you think that'll affect my


---------36:39----------
relationships am i more likely to have a


---------36:42----------
discordant relationship if i'm impulsive


---------36:45----------
right absolutely


---------36:48----------
do you think i will mor if my


---------36:50----------
irritability do you think that will


---------36:52----------
negatively impact my relationships


---------36:55----------
absolutely do you think my inability to


---------36:58----------
attend the situations


---------37:00----------
will negatively impact my relationships


---------37:03----------
absolutely


---------37:05----------
so now we begin to see that okay if if


---------37:07----------
depression


---------37:08----------
and adhd is connected through discordant


---------37:11----------
relationships


---------37:12----------
we can see how these three factors


---------37:15----------
will result in


---------37:17----------
discordant relationships right so like i


---------37:18----------
want you guys to put yourselves in the


---------37:20----------
shoes of like a 13 year old with adhd so


---------37:23----------
let's say i'm like hanging out with my


---------37:24----------
friends


---------37:26----------
and then like they're all talking about


---------37:28----------
something and then like my attention


---------37:29----------
wanders i don't participate in the


---------37:31----------
conversation so then like you know i'm


---------37:33----------
just kind of sitting there and then i'm


---------37:35----------
impulsive so i randomly start talking


---------37:37----------
about like zebras


---------37:39----------
and if zebras if there was a cheese


---------37:41----------
named zebra cheese what kind of stripes


---------37:44----------
would it have would it be two kinds of


---------37:46----------
cheeses blended together


---------37:47----------
and then all my friends like look at me


---------37:49----------
like i'm a weirdo because like i'm not


---------37:51----------
able to attend to the conversation plus


---------37:52----------
impulsivity and then what ends up


---------37:54----------
happening so there are studies that show


---------37:56----------
that basically people with adhd


---------37:58----------
get


---------38:00----------
um don't participate in


---------38:02----------
conversations


---------38:04----------
in sort of a healthy way


---------38:09----------
they don't get invited


---------38:14----------
to social things


---------38:17----------
amongst all kinds of other stuff right


---------38:19----------
so we can see that like


---------38:20----------
and let's not let's not forget about


---------38:22----------
irritability like the fact that my brain


---------38:24----------
is more sensitive to being irritable and


---------38:27----------
having a low frustration tolerance makes


---------38:29----------
it hard for me to participate in


---------38:31----------
relationships


---------38:33----------
okay


---------38:34----------
now let's think about


---------38:36----------
bullying


---------38:37----------
so let's see


---------38:38----------
what do you guys think do you think that


---------38:41----------
impulsivity makes me more likely to be


---------38:43----------
bullied like absolutely right and why is


---------38:46----------
that it's because of this


---------38:48----------
so if my social standing in the school


---------38:52----------
is low because of these kinds of things


---------38:55----------
that's going to result in me being


---------38:56----------
bullied so if you talk to people who


---------38:59----------
have adhd


---------39:00----------
what you discover is they got bullied


---------39:02----------
unless you guys know this chat unless


---------39:05----------
they were a class clown


---------39:11----------
so like what people with adhd


---------39:13----------
essentially learn how to do is like the


---------39:15----------
only way i can gain social standing is


---------39:17----------
with my inattentiveness and my


---------39:19----------
impulsivity if i can make other kids


---------39:21----------
laugh i'm not going to be like bullied


---------39:23----------
but otherwise their low social standing


---------39:25----------
their inability to pay attention makes


---------39:27----------
them like get made fun of even more


---------39:30----------
right the fact that they're irritable


---------39:32----------
means like you can get a rise out of a


---------39:34----------
an adhd kid and since i don't have adhd


---------39:37----------
and i've got friends i've got three or


---------39:38----------
four of my friends and i'm gonna like


---------39:40----------
surround the the kid with adhd and i'm


---------39:42----------
gonna bully him he's gonna get pissed


---------39:44----------
and he's gonna throw a punch but the


---------39:45----------
odds are stacked in my favor so he's


---------39:47----------
screwed


---------39:48----------
right because he's not gonna control


---------39:49----------
himself and that's why i'm gonna pick on


---------39:50----------
him


---------39:51----------
if i'm a bully because i know i can get


---------39:53----------
a rise out of


---------39:54----------
him okay


---------39:57----------
now let's think about academic hardship


---------39:59----------
so


---------40:01----------
impulsivity does that lead to academic


---------40:03----------
hardship yes


---------40:06----------
inattention does that lead to academic


---------40:07----------
partnership yes yes yes


---------40:10----------
okay once again the problem here is that


---------40:12----------
oftentimes adhd is under diagnosed in


---------40:15----------
children


---------40:16----------
it is bizarre because because it is the


---------40:18----------
disease that is the most under diagnosed


---------40:21----------
disease and the


---------40:22----------
the most under diagnosed and the most


---------40:24----------
over diagnosed disease in my experience


---------40:26----------
what that means is that a high number of


---------40:28----------
people without adhd get diagnosed with


---------40:30----------
adhd because they want adderall and


---------40:32----------
they're bored at school so they like


---------40:35----------
have trouble with attention and someone


---------40:36----------
gives them pills and it is the most


---------40:38----------
underdiagnosed because a lot of times


---------40:40----------
people will miss diagnoses of adhd and


---------40:42----------
because kids are smart so the smarter


---------40:45----------
you are the more you can set up


---------40:46----------
compensatory mechanisms and no one ever


---------40:48----------
realizes you have adhd


---------40:51----------
and does irritability lead to academic


---------40:53----------
hardship


---------40:54----------
probably but i think this is a slightly


---------40:56----------
less of a thing


---------40:57----------
okay so now let's think about so you


---------40:59----------
guys with me so like we can sort of see


---------41:01----------
it's kind of interesting because we can


---------41:02----------
see that


---------41:03----------
the the factors that studies show us


---------41:06----------
show are correlated and serve as the


---------41:09----------
link between adhd and depression


---------41:12----------
can absolutely be attributed to a


---------41:14----------
developmental process because the child


---------41:17----------
is here


---------41:19----------
and then as the child grows without


---------41:21----------
these being addressed we end up with an


---------41:23----------
adult


---------41:25----------
who grew up with these experiences and


---------41:27----------
so now we can see how adhd in childhood


---------41:36----------
results in adult depression


---------41:39----------
you all see that so this perfectly


---------41:41----------
mirrors what the research tells us


---------41:43----------
which is that if you're going this way


---------41:45----------
there's a 50 chance


---------41:48----------
and if you're going this way if you


---------41:50----------
start with depression you've got a 2.7


---------41:53----------
chance


---------41:53----------
you all get that


---------41:57----------
okay


---------41:59----------
so it does appear that there's a causal


---------42:00----------
link so the cool thing is that if we can


---------42:03----------
fix these in childhood


---------42:06----------
not just in childhood


---------42:07----------
but even in adulthood


---------42:11----------
what that means is that these things


---------42:12----------
should get better


---------42:14----------
so as we become professionally more


---------42:16----------
successful as we engage in healthier


---------42:18----------
relationships because these problems are


---------42:20----------
not just developmental right because if


---------42:21----------
you're still inattentive and impulsive


---------42:23----------
like it's going to be harder to engage


---------42:25----------
in relationships


---------42:26----------
you may still be a social outcast in


---------42:28----------
this day and age the cool thing is that


---------42:30----------
this is not set in stone so if we fix


---------42:32----------
this even in adulthood our relationships


---------42:34----------
will improve and and we'll see


---------42:36----------
downstream effects


---------42:38----------
so now we get to


---------42:42----------
the present


---------42:43----------
so this is sort of our development


---------42:46----------
right and so now we're up to bullet


---------42:47----------
point


---------42:49----------
five


---------42:53----------
okay


---------42:55----------
and we're going to talk a little bit


---------42:56----------
about


---------42:58----------
what this stuff results in so there are


---------43:01----------
further studies that sort of look at


---------43:03----------
things like emotional regulation and the


---------43:05----------
emotions of people with adhd these are


---------43:07----------
the cross-sectional studies


---------43:13----------
so these studies or this conclusion that


---------43:14----------
i'm drawing is developmental so this is


---------43:16----------
looking at the lifespan of children as


---------43:18----------
they become adults now if we take a


---------43:21----------
group of adults and we just kind of like


---------43:22----------
look at them in this point in time and


---------43:24----------
we try to figure out what is your


---------43:26----------
experience of life in this moment with


---------43:28----------
adhd and depression this is what we


---------43:30----------
discover


---------43:32----------
um that the link between emotion adhd


---------43:35----------
and depression is primarily due to


---------43:37----------
loneliness


---------43:39----------
primarily due to emotional regula


---------43:45----------
relation deficits


---------43:49----------
and shame so this is i'm tacking this on


---------43:51----------
there's not i didn't find a single paper


---------43:53----------
about that i'm sure it's out there but


---------43:54----------
this is just what i've seen


---------43:56----------
so when we're talking about you know


---------43:58----------
what it's like to sit with someone who


---------44:01----------
has adhd and depression these are the


---------44:03----------
three primary experiences which lead to


---------44:06----------
depression in the present


---------44:09----------
okay now let's try to understand where


---------44:10----------
do these come from so loneliness is kind


---------44:12----------
of a no-brainer right we know that


---------44:13----------
discordant relationships and bullying


---------44:15----------
like that's going to lead to loneliness


---------44:17----------
and by the way if we also look at


---------44:18----------
correlations between suicidality you


---------44:20----------
guys remember our 3x risk


---------44:24----------
of suicide


---------44:26----------
very very highly correlated with


---------44:28----------
loneliness if we look at people who


---------44:30----------
actually attempt suicide and commit


---------44:32----------
suicide they're very lonely so now we


---------44:34----------
can even see where the big scale


---------44:35----------
epidemiologic data comes from because


---------44:37----------
these are psychiatric studies so this is


---------44:39----------
looking at the treatment of illness in


---------44:42----------
actual patients


---------44:43----------
like humans okay


---------44:46----------
we can see that loneliness comes from a


---------44:47----------
combination of like discordant


---------44:49----------
relationships bullying and academic


---------44:50----------
hardship because you're not good at


---------44:52----------
school so you don't feel like you're


---------44:53----------
doing a good job


---------44:55----------
similarly


---------44:56----------
bullying and academic hardship will also


---------44:58----------
contribute to shame right so like this


---------45:00----------
is the experience of someone with adhd


---------45:02----------
so we're going to talk about this for a


---------45:03----------
second so if i've got adhd


---------45:06----------
i grow up and what do people tell me oh


---------45:08----------
oh look you're so smart


---------45:10----------
you just need to try harder i don't know


---------45:12----------
why you just can't be more disciplined


---------45:14----------
like i don't know


---------45:16----------
why you are failing so miserably because


---------45:18----------
you are so smart because iq and adhd are


---------45:20----------
not correlated


---------45:22----------
right and so when a child gets told that


---------45:24----------
and like a child understands so the


---------45:26----------
thing that's even more shameful is not


---------45:28----------
even how what the child is told because


---------45:29----------
i've had lots of patients with adhd that


---------45:31----------
have very supportive parents and they're


---------45:33----------
trying to be supportive right when they


---------45:34----------
say oh you have so much potential


---------45:35----------
they're trying to be supportive


---------45:37----------
but what the actual experience is the


---------45:39----------
kid


---------45:40----------
knows


---------45:41----------
they look around and they see everyone


---------45:42----------
else in their class and they can sort of


---------45:44----------
tell they're like i can do math just as


---------45:46----------
well as the kids around me like i


---------45:48----------
understand mathematics i'm a smart kid


---------45:51----------
they look around at all these other


---------45:52----------
people who are just able to sit down and


---------45:54----------
study


---------45:55----------
and like i know that if i get engaged


---------45:57----------
and i pay attention i can learn history


---------46:00----------
i can learn mathematics i should be able


---------46:02----------
to understand this stuff just as quickly


---------46:03----------
as everyone else or in fact that's what


---------46:04----------
they discover is that when they're


---------46:06----------
presented with new information that's


---------46:08----------
interesting they actually potentially


---------46:09----------
even learn faster than their classmates


---------46:11----------
but despite all of these observations


---------46:14----------
that they're just as capable as their


---------46:16----------
classmates they just can't sit down and


---------46:18----------
read a book and so then they feel like


---------46:20----------
idiots they're like there's something


---------46:22----------
fundamentally busted in me and oddly


---------46:24----------
enough the higher their iq is the more


---------46:27----------
shame they're likely to feel that's sort


---------46:29----------
of a clinical observation there's some


---------46:31----------
evidence of that as well there's this


---------46:32----------
thing called the insight trial


---------46:34----------
which sort of showed that the greater


---------46:36----------
insight you have into a particular


---------46:38----------
problem in this case it was a


---------46:39----------
degenerative neurological disease


---------46:41----------
the greater your suicidality is


---------46:44----------
so like it's kind of bizarre and this is


---------46:46----------
what's super sad about working with a


---------46:47----------
lot of my patients with adhd is the


---------46:50----------
smarter they are the more aware that


---------46:53----------
they are that they are of like how


---------46:55----------
screwed they are if that sort of makes


---------46:57----------
sense


---------46:57----------
and if you're like stupid and you kind


---------46:59----------
of don't realize there's a problem it's


---------47:00----------
sort of like ignorance is bliss


---------47:02----------
but bizarrely the most shame is felt


---------47:06----------
by the the students who are actually the


---------47:08----------
smartest and the most aware


---------47:10----------
so when we have loneliness and shame


---------47:12----------
that's going to kind of result in


---------47:13----------
depression


---------47:15----------
and then we're also going to have


---------47:16----------
emotional regulation deficits right and


---------47:18----------
this kind of goes back to our


---------47:20----------
neuroscience our amygdala insula our


---------47:22----------
anterior cingulate cortex and all that


---------47:24----------
kind of stuff


---------47:25----------
so there's some interesting stuff that


---------47:27----------
we can further explore here so you know


---------47:29----------
if we're kind of thinking about you know


---------47:31----------
what our process is


---------47:33----------
for fixing this


---------47:34----------
we're gonna tunnel down just a little


---------47:36----------
bit


---------47:39----------
further and i'm going to kind of dive


---------47:41----------
into


---------47:42----------
emotional regulation


---------47:45----------
because


---------47:47----------
we talk a lot on on stream about


---------47:49----------
loneliness and shame but a lot of people


---------47:50----------
have questions about okay so like if


---------47:52----------
there's an emotional regulation deficit


---------47:54----------
like what does that mean what do i do


---------47:56----------
about it right if if i'm unable to


---------47:58----------
identify and modify my internal


---------48:00----------
emotional states


---------48:02----------
to


---------48:03----------
be become adapt uh to adapt and to


---------48:06----------
direct uh and to engage in goal-directed


---------48:08----------
behavior like what what do i do about


---------48:10----------
that that sounds like devastating right


---------48:12----------
that sounds like my problem in a


---------48:13----------
nutshell is that i can't modify my


---------48:15----------
internal emotional state to like do what


---------48:17----------
i need to do


---------48:18----------
i know what i need to do i just can't


---------48:20----------
bring myself to do it that's another way


---------48:21----------
to put it


---------48:22----------
so further the researchers went tunnel


---------48:24----------
down even further and started to look at


---------48:26----------
emotional regulation and realize that


---------48:28----------
there are three strategies


---------48:31----------
that


---------48:32----------
um people with just in general human


---------48:35----------
beings but especially the people with


---------48:36----------
adhd will employ to regulate their


---------48:39----------
emotions


---------48:40----------
so the first is avoidance


---------48:44----------
so what this means is that that we're


---------48:45----------
going to


---------48:46----------
alter our exposure


---------48:52----------
to


---------48:54----------
internally


---------48:57----------
challenging


---------48:59----------
experiences


---------49:02----------
okay so altering our exposure can be


---------49:05----------
external


---------49:06----------
in a sense or internal


---------49:09----------
i don't like this nomenclature great but


---------49:12----------
it's the best example i have so an


---------49:14----------
example of an you know an avoidance


---------49:16----------
that's external is like i'm afraid that


---------49:18----------
i'm gonna look stupid at the party so


---------49:20----------
i'm not gonna go to the party


---------49:25----------
because i'm afraid i'm gonna look stupid


---------49:27----------
so what they essentially do is they just


---------49:29----------
avoid the situation entirely okay


---------49:32----------
there are also cognitive behavioral


---------49:37----------
avoidance strategies as well


---------49:40----------
okay so you may ask like what does that


---------49:41----------
mean a cognitive behavioral avoidance


---------49:43----------
strategy


---------49:45----------
so this is like where they actually


---------49:50----------
reduce


---------49:52----------
or downplay


---------49:56----------
the internal


---------49:58----------
severity


---------50:01----------
so this is kind of interesting but it's


---------50:03----------
sort of like mentally checking out is


---------50:05----------
what i call it


---------50:10----------
right so this is like when you you like


---------50:12----------
mentally like you kind of avoid


---------50:14----------
something in your mind it's like if i go


---------50:16----------
to a party and i tell myself


---------50:19----------
um you know i don't i i don't even like


---------50:21----------
these people


---------50:22----------
so it's like it's okay if i'm awkward i


---------50:24----------
don't care about these people anyway


---------50:26----------
you mentally sort of avoid in your mind


---------50:29----------
like you use a cognitive avoidance


---------50:31----------
strategy to insulate yourself from some


---------50:34----------
kind of internally challenging


---------50:35----------
experience it's protective in nature


---------50:37----------
right because if i if i devalue the


---------50:40----------
other person in my mind


---------50:42----------
i don't actually have to feel rejected


---------50:44----------
at all


---------50:45----------
do you guys get that so i can avoid


---------50:47----------
going to the party or in my head i can


---------50:49----------
mentally check out from the party when


---------50:51----------
i'm there


---------50:52----------
now this gets a little bit subtle


---------50:54----------
because there are other emotional


---------50:55----------
regulation strategies so the next is


---------50:57----------
suppression


---------50:59----------
so suppression's a little bit different


---------51:01----------
because the emotion is there


---------51:06----------
but i'm gonna squash it down


---------51:10----------
so you may say


---------51:12----------
isn't that avoidance and i'd say no this


---------51:14----------
is sort of fake it till you make it


---------51:21----------
and if we kind of look at like what's


---------51:23----------
the difference between someone who


---------51:24----------
suppresses emotion and someone who's


---------51:25----------
avoidant is like the person who


---------51:27----------
suppresses the emotion is still gonna go


---------51:29----------
to the party


---------51:30----------
right they're just gonna take all their


---------51:32----------
anxiety and they're gonna shove it way


---------51:33----------
down and they're gonna smile they're


---------51:35----------
gonna put on a face and they're gonna


---------51:36----------
pretend to have a good time they're not


---------51:37----------
mentally checked out they're not like


---------51:39----------
afk in their head and being like screw


---------51:41----------
all these guys right what they're


---------51:42----------
actually doing is like there's like an


---------51:44----------
internal struggle


---------51:46----------
but there is also an internal


---------51:48----------
genuineness


---------51:51----------
or authenticity which they're fighting


---------51:52----------
against does this make sense


---------51:55----------
it's very different actually on the


---------51:57----------
inside it is very very different


---------52:00----------
because the the thing the emotion is


---------52:02----------
there we're not avoiding the emotion


---------52:03----------
we're just trying to conquer it and


---------52:05----------
fight it


---------52:06----------
and then the third strategy is


---------52:08----------
reappraisal


---------52:12----------
so this is where like we have cognitive


---------52:14----------
reframes


---------52:16----------
right so this is like where we do some


---------52:18----------
like heavy cognitive work this is like


---------52:20----------
what things like therapy will hopefully


---------52:21----------
help you do


---------52:22----------
where you start to like work on things


---------52:24----------
and you take that negative emotion and


---------52:26----------
then like you do like once you sort of


---------52:27----------
have develop some kind of understanding


---------52:29----------
of for example if i go to the party and


---------52:31----------
i'm anxious


---------52:32----------
i can sort of cognitive reframe and sort


---------52:35----------
of realize oh like everyone else is just


---------52:37----------
as anxious about what they're wearing as


---------52:38----------
i am about what i'm wearing no one is


---------52:40----------
really paying attention to what i'm


---------52:42----------
wearing so i might as well just try to


---------52:43----------
have a good time if some people end up


---------52:45----------
not liking what i'm wearing maybe


---------52:46----------
they'll make fun of me but i'm pretty


---------52:47----------
witty so i can just make fun of them


---------52:48----------
it's like not that big of a deal that's


---------52:50----------
an example of a cognitive reframe it's


---------52:52----------
kind of like processing stuff


---------52:56----------
right working through it


---------53:01----------
etc and what we find in people with adhd


---------53:04----------
is that they so let's say normal human


---------53:07----------
beings


---------53:08----------
let's call normal people blue okay


---------53:11----------
so if we have normal people


---------53:13----------
they'll do like a third


---------53:16----------
a third


---------53:17----------
a third


---------53:19----------
people with adhd will do like nine


---------53:21----------
tenths


---------53:24----------
maybe one tenth


---------53:26----------
zero tenths maybe it's a bit brutal


---------53:29----------
okay and then you have people who are


---------53:31----------
like monks


---------53:33----------
right so monks like in the there's this


---------53:35----------
there's a scale so like


---------53:37----------
after you've got guns gotten someone


---------53:39----------
who's like you know done a lot of


---------53:41----------
internal work or as a monk


---------53:43----------
they'll do like 1 out of 10 avoidance


---------53:45----------
maybe 4 out of 10 suppression and 5 out


---------53:47----------
of 10 reappraisal


---------53:49----------
and at some point you've got you know


---------53:53----------
the


---------53:54----------
i don't know like whatever i mean so so


---------53:55----------
over time like i think


---------53:57----------
you can kind of move in this direction


---------54:00----------
as you do like more emotional work


---------54:02----------
okay and like super high eq will be like


---------54:05----------
nine tens of reappraisal


---------54:06----------
if that makes sense


---------54:09----------
so we can kind of see that all humans


---------54:11----------
will use all of these strategies but


---------54:12----------
there's evidence


---------54:15----------
that people with adhd employ avoidance


---------54:18----------
the most and that avoidance is probably


---------54:19----------
the most damaging


---------54:21----------
right so mentally checking out is a big


---------54:23----------
problem in our community


---------54:25----------
what's less of a problem but is still a


---------54:27----------
problem is like internal struggle or


---------54:29----------
internal conflict and this is sort of


---------54:31----------
like mental piece


---------54:32----------
so these are three different strategies


---------54:34----------
that we can sort of employ for emotional


---------54:36----------
regulation


---------54:38----------
okay


---------54:39----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but if


---------54:41----------
you're someone who's got adhd


---------54:43----------
what you probably want to do is move


---------54:45----------
from avoidance to suppression first and


---------54:46----------
then eventually move towards reappraisal


---------54:49----------
but it's okay to like feel bad and kind


---------54:51----------
of force yourself through it and that's


---------54:53----------
why people will say like fake it till


---------54:54----------
you make it right it's not mentally


---------54:56----------
checking out it's like acknowledging


---------54:58----------
that you feel bad and then forcing


---------55:00----------
yourself to do something


---------55:03----------
so


---------55:04----------
now we move on to the last step


---------55:07----------
okay so just to kind of cover what we've


---------55:09----------
covered we started with genetics we


---------55:11----------
started with epidemiology what are the


---------55:13----------
statistics around adhd and depression


---------55:16----------
then we talked a little bit about


---------55:18----------
different structures of the brain and


---------55:19----------
how if we look at like i do mri scans or


---------55:22----------
brain scans of people with like adhd and


---------55:24----------
depression what do we discover about


---------55:25----------
their brain and how is it different


---------55:28----------
once we understand understood the


---------55:29----------
neuroscientific deficits we went on to


---------55:31----------
look at you know what does that manifest


---------55:33----------
as what does that look like in someone's


---------55:35----------
life so what are the the vulnerabilities


---------55:38----------
or what are the psychological


---------55:40----------
disadvantages that they have


---------55:42----------
then we sort of looked at how being born


---------55:44----------
or growing up with those disadvantages


---------55:46----------
affects your development


---------55:48----------
and how that sort of results in


---------55:50----------
depression later in life


---------55:52----------
then we looked at in the present


---------55:54----------
you know what what does it look like if


---------55:56----------
you're someone who's had adhd and


---------55:57----------
depression


---------55:58----------
what does it look like in the present to


---------56:00----------
be in your situation and then the last


---------56:02----------
thing that we're going to look at now is


---------56:04----------
a road map


---------56:06----------
okay


---------56:07----------
so now everyone's wondering


---------56:09----------
what do i do about this how do i fix


---------56:11----------
this


---------56:12----------
and the short answer is like there's a


---------56:14----------
lot to do and you know you're not going


---------56:17----------
to get an answer in the next five


---------56:18----------
minutes of how to transform your life


---------56:20----------
but this is what i will say so the first


---------56:22----------
thing that i want you all to appreciate


---------56:23----------
now i'm going to talk purely from a


---------56:25----------
clinical perspective


---------56:26----------
so now i'm going to talk about like as a


---------56:28----------
human being who is a psychiatrist who


---------56:31----------
works with people with adhd and


---------56:33----------
depression here is what i've learned


---------56:34----------
about what works for them


---------56:36----------
the first is that


---------56:38----------
there is a diagnostic


---------56:41----------
um


---------56:43----------
on there's a diagnostic lack


---------56:46----------
of sophistication


---------56:50----------
so what i mean by that is if we kind of


---------56:52----------
look at all of these scales of problems


---------56:54----------
right like we can we can take a look at


---------56:56----------
all of the things we've discussed so is


---------56:58----------
your problem one of like


---------57:00----------
reward circuitry


---------57:04----------
is your problem one of you know orbital


---------57:06----------
frontal


---------57:07----------
control


---------57:10----------
is your problem one where your amygdala


---------57:13----------
is too hyperactive


---------57:19----------
or is your problem more downstream right


---------57:22----------
is your problem something more like


---------57:25----------
um you know emotional regulation


---------57:32----------
sorry


---------57:37----------
and then furthermore we can like tunnel


---------57:39----------
down right is it suppression


---------57:42----------
avoidance


---------57:45----------
or reappraisal which strategy do you use


---------57:49----------
is your problem irritability


---------57:53----------
or is is your problem developmental in


---------57:55----------
nature is the problem that you have a


---------57:56----------
bunch of shame is the problem that


---------57:58----------
you're lonely


---------57:59----------
right is the problem the way that you


---------58:01----------
interact with people


---------58:03----------
so discordant relationships


---------58:10----------
is your problem that you are still


---------58:11----------
bullied


---------58:12----------
either by people at work or things like


---------58:14----------
that is your problem that you lack


---------58:16----------
professional


---------58:19----------
or


---------58:20----------
academic success


---------58:24----------
and this is what i mean by there's a


---------58:26----------
lack of diagnostic sophistication so i


---------58:28----------
can diagnose someone with adhd and


---------58:30----------
depression and i can give them treatment


---------58:33----------
right i can give them medications or do


---------58:35----------
cbt or whatever


---------58:37----------
but in my experience of working with


---------58:39----------
actual human beings if you really want


---------58:41----------
to conquer this it actually starts with


---------58:43----------
this degree of diagnostic sophistication


---------58:45----------
so for you to look at yourself and say


---------58:47----------
like okay which one of these things


---------58:49----------
really fits me because each of these is


---------58:51----------
going to have a different kind of like


---------58:52----------
solution right so let's kind of go


---------58:54----------
through those


---------58:58----------
so like if your problem is


---------59:01----------
reward circuitry like maybe what you


---------59:02----------
need to do is a dopamine detox


---------59:06----------
if your problem is orbital frontal


---------59:07----------
control maybe what you need to do is


---------59:09----------
meditate


---------59:12----------
if your problem is amygdala hyper


---------59:14----------
reactivity maybe what you need to do is


---------59:15----------
alter your diet for a certain


---------59:17----------
neurotransmitter production or


---------59:19----------
be careful about toxic influences


---------59:24----------
or do a grounding meditation


---------59:27----------
because there's meditation specificity


---------59:29----------
all throughout here as well


---------59:31----------
okay maybe your problem is emotional


---------59:32----------
regulation so then this is where like


---------59:34----------
you can do things like you know cbt or


---------59:37----------
other kinds of exercises to like move


---------59:39----------
between these


---------59:40----------
these different areas right so cbt can


---------59:42----------
teach you how to which is cognitive


---------59:44----------
behavioral therapy can teach you how to


---------59:46----------
do reappraisal


---------59:47----------
you know increasing awareness


---------59:49----------
of avoidance


---------59:51----------
so i know it sounds kind of interesting


---------59:52----------
but if you just become aware of your


---------59:55----------
avoidance


---------59:56----------
that can actually move you into engaging


---------59:58----------
in suppression so just awareness is


---------60:01----------
actually sufficient at starting the


---------60:02----------
process of going from avoidance to


---------60:04----------
suppression


---------60:05----------
irritability once again there are


---------60:07----------
dietary changes here so there's evidence


---------60:10----------
that for example altering the diet of


---------60:12----------
people with severe autism


---------60:14----------
to have high iron diets and address


---------60:16----------
nutritional deficiencies


---------60:18----------
um


---------60:19----------
actually reduces the amount of like


---------60:22----------
meltdowns that they have i know it's


---------60:24----------
crazy but people have actually done


---------60:25----------
studies on severe autism and what


---------60:27----------
they've realized is that like so because


---------60:29----------
some of these poor kids like they're


---------60:30----------
just medicated through the roof to keep


---------60:31----------
them like docile and it turns out that


---------60:34----------
there are dietary changes that you can


---------60:35----------
make that will actually alter your


---------60:36----------
irritability there's a bunch of stuff


---------60:38----------
about this in dr k's guide about sort of


---------60:40----------
theories around how altering your diet


---------60:42----------
affects neurotransmitter production


---------60:45----------
right so produces serotonin like gives


---------60:47----------
you precursors that will be produced


---------60:48----------
turned into dopamine serotonin etc


---------60:50----------
things like that


---------60:52----------
if your problem is shame or loneliness


---------60:53----------
so for shame like maybe you need to go


---------60:55----------
to therapy and this kind of therapy may


---------60:56----------
be different it's more processing


---------61:00----------
therapy right if you're lonely this is


---------61:02----------
where like potentially coaching could


---------61:03----------
come in like sure you could go to the


---------61:04----------
therapy route and talk about how you're


---------61:06----------
lonely but maybe by working with a coach


---------61:09----------
you can actually focus on solutions


---------61:14----------
to make friends right like how can i


---------61:16----------
understand like okay where can i go how


---------61:18----------
do i meet people where how do i go


---------61:20----------
outside we had that post recently so a


---------61:22----------
lot of different solutions with


---------61:23----------
loneliness that may not necessarily be


---------61:25----------
sitting in your your therapist's office


---------61:27----------
and like talking about how lonely you


---------61:28----------
are like i know it's crazy as a


---------61:30----------
therapist sometimes i do not think that


---------61:32----------
is the cure to loneliness


---------61:33----------
and now discordant relationships this


---------61:35----------
one is huge because once you are aware


---------61:37----------
right so here's my experience with the


---------61:39----------
majority of people i work with adhd


---------61:41----------
when it comes to this


---------61:43----------
they have no idea what they're doing


---------61:47----------
like they have no idea that the reason


---------61:48----------
their relationships are discordant is


---------61:50----------
because they are inattentive


---------61:52----------
is because they are impulsive that other


---------61:54----------
people have difficulty keeping up with


---------61:55----------
them all they conclude is people don't


---------61:58----------
like me


---------61:59----------
it's hard for me to keep friends i don't


---------62:01----------
get invited to stuff and then that just


---------62:04----------
turns into shame


---------62:06----------
right so like then they start to develop


---------62:08----------
an identity of themselves


---------62:10----------
that i am unlikable people don't want to


---------62:12----------
be my friend it's not anything in their


---------62:15----------
control it's it's just like i am this


---------62:18----------
way and i'm screwed and so it leads to


---------62:20----------
shame and the more ashamed you are and


---------62:22----------
the more you come to realize that people


---------62:24----------
don't want to be your friend you're not


---------62:25----------
even going to engage in relationships


---------62:27----------
and then you don't try to engage in


---------62:28----------
relationships then you end up being


---------62:30----------
lonely


---------62:31----------
so by understanding the nature of your


---------62:34----------
discordant relationships you can even


---------62:36----------
prep people so sometimes i'll even like


---------62:38----------
prep my patients about how to talk to


---------62:40----------
people and say things like hey by the


---------62:42----------
way i've got adhd


---------62:44----------
so like there are all kinds of things


---------62:46----------
that my patients oftentimes do so for


---------62:48----------
example they'll be late to social


---------62:50----------
engagements


---------62:51----------
they'll be


---------62:52----------
um you know they'll sometimes even


---------62:54----------
forget like like they won't keep track


---------62:56----------
of like the fact that we're supposed to


---------62:57----------
meet someone for lunch and so obviously


---------62:59----------
like that person is pissed


---------63:01----------
and so interestingly enough just raising


---------63:03----------
awareness of your you know


---------63:05----------
inattentiveness


---------63:07----------
raising awareness of your


---------63:09----------
disorganization


---------63:12----------
and raising awareness of


---------63:14----------
your impulsivity


---------63:16----------
can actually


---------63:19----------
can actually start to mend your


---------63:20----------
relationships like you can just form


---------63:21----------
healthier relationships once you


---------63:23----------
understand all these things


---------63:25----------
the bullying you know you can teach


---------63:26----------
people how to set good boundaries


---------63:31----------
and the professional academic success


---------63:33----------
there's a lot of stuff here but you know


---------63:34----------
there's dealing with the shame to begin


---------63:36----------
with because that's that's like a burden


---------63:38----------
on you that prevents you from succeeding


---------63:39----------
you know you have a sense of identity


---------63:43----------
as a failure so you can work on that


---------63:45----------
right maybe therapy maybe coaching


---------63:46----------
something like that and then you can


---------63:48----------
also do like actual treatment


---------63:50----------
interventions like maybe you do need


---------63:51----------
like adhd meds


---------63:54----------
maybe you do need cognitive behavioral


---------63:55----------
therapy for adhd


---------63:57----------
right and the point here is that the


---------63:59----------
road map


---------64:00----------
for your


---------64:02----------
progress and for you to put together


---------64:04----------
your life is absolutely there


---------64:07----------
but it starts by sort of having a


---------64:10----------
sophistication of diagnosis


---------64:12----------
what is my actual problem here which of


---------64:14----------
these boxes do i check so you can kind


---------64:16----------
of go down this list


---------64:18----------
right and you can kind of say like okay


---------64:20----------
oh this feels right this feels not right


---------64:23----------
actually like i'm not getting bullied


---------64:24----------
it's not a big deal like oh yeah like my


---------64:26----------
big problems are professional or


---------64:28----------
academic success feeling of shame and


---------64:30----------
then like i'm very very avoided


---------64:33----------
right it's not so much that i'm


---------64:34----------
irritable like i don't get pissed easily


---------64:36----------
i actually do have good friends i've got


---------64:38----------
a good social support structure so i'm


---------64:40----------
not lonely or this and so it's it's very


---------64:42----------
specific in terms of how to navigate it


---------64:45----------
and once again despite the fact that


---------64:47----------
like you know the last thing that i kind


---------64:48----------
of want to share with you all is despite


---------64:49----------
the fact a lot of this stuff is genetic


---------64:51----------
and neuroscientific in nature


---------64:53----------
there's still a lot you can do about it


---------64:55----------
like this is not you know there's a lot


---------64:56----------
of stuff on the intervention side that


---------64:58----------
can be done


---------65:00----------
and generally speaking my my approach is


---------65:02----------
a clinician and this is what you know


---------65:04----------
it's not just as a clinician this is


---------65:05----------
what we also do in coaching


---------65:07----------
is to like help people understand where


---------65:09----------
is your actual problem


---------65:11----------
and awareness of the problem can in my


---------65:13----------
opinion not even doing anything about it


---------65:16----------
just recognizing what the problem is


---------65:19----------
can account for a 50 improvement in


---------65:22----------
whatever you're talking about so just to


---------65:24----------
give you guys like a simple


---------65:25----------
epidemiological example of this so if


---------65:28----------
you look at like obesity in central


---------65:29----------
america


---------65:31----------
so obesity in central america is really


---------65:33----------
really bad and it's probably due to


---------65:35----------
the propagation of like sugary beverages


---------65:38----------
like and people down there like i think


---------65:41----------
that's changing now but you know 20 or


---------65:42----------
30 years ago like people like some in


---------65:44----------
some parts of central america there was


---------65:46----------
just a lack of education that like


---------65:48----------
drinking you know like sugary juices and


---------65:50----------
sugary sodas like three meals a day is


---------65:53----------
going to contribute to obesity and once


---------65:55----------
people just realize oh hey what i'm


---------65:58----------
putting into my body may affect you know


---------66:01----------
like my health


---------66:02----------
once that awareness is there it actually


---------66:04----------
results in like a positive change in


---------66:06----------
behavior


---------66:07----------
and so if you look at things like


---------66:08----------
socioeconomic status and obesity what


---------66:11----------
you tend to find is that there are parts


---------66:13----------
of the you know


---------66:15----------
parts of the world where they're like


---------66:16----------
there's a very low understanding of like


---------66:19----------
the impact of like what you put into


---------66:20----------
your body and how it affects your health


---------66:22----------
and you can go to places like whole


---------66:23----------
foods and stuff like that where there


---------66:24----------
are all these wellness magazines there's


---------66:26----------
a lot of food that's unhealthy by the


---------66:27----------
way


---------66:28----------
but you can see that even awareness can


---------66:30----------
account for some amount of change and


---------66:32----------
even from video games we kind of know


---------66:33----------
like if you don't know why you're losing


---------66:35----------
a game you can't even begin to improve


---------66:37----------
it if you're just aware of particular


---------66:39----------
mechanics right like being aware of


---------66:41----------
those mechanics will automatically


---------66:43----------
change the way that you play the game


---------66:45----------
and so i think awareness in my opinion


---------66:47----------
is actually worth 50


---------66:49----------
of the progress and then once you have a


---------66:51----------
specific problem or once you figure out


---------66:53----------
what your specific problem is where your


---------66:54----------
specific vulnerability is you can start


---------66:56----------
to make changes in that particular


---------66:58----------
direction to sort of overcome this issue


---------67:01----------
a couple of things which i i should sort


---------67:03----------
of say if it hasn't become clear i think


---------67:05----------
if this stuff resonates with y'all the


---------67:07----------
first thing you should do if you haven't


---------67:08----------
done it already is seek an actual mental


---------67:11----------
health professional's help


---------67:13----------
so if you're concerned you may have adhd


---------67:15----------
if you're concerned you may have


---------67:16----------
depression go and talk to an actual


---------67:17----------
doctor or like therapist or something so


---------67:20----------
i know a lot of times we'll talk about


---------67:21----------
things like dr k's guide and coaching


---------67:23----------
and all that kind of stuff i really do


---------67:24----------
think the single most important


---------67:26----------
intervention you can do is to actually


---------67:28----------
go see a mental health professional


---------67:30----------
beyond that there are other things that


---------67:31----------
you can do like by all means go watch dr


---------67:33----------
k's guide there's a lot of stuff in


---------67:34----------
there about meditation and these


---------67:36----------
different grounding meditations versus


---------67:38----------
like the meditations that will teach you


---------67:39----------
control by all means check out our


---------67:41----------
youtube video on dopamine detox if you


---------67:43----------
want to talk about this kind of stuff


---------67:44----------
and focus on solutions to make friends


---------67:47----------
and things like that that's something


---------67:48----------
that coaches may be better trained at um


---------67:50----------
you know helping you with professional


---------67:51----------
and academic success that may be


---------67:53----------
something that coaches are can help you


---------67:55----------
with


---------67:56----------
uh you know helping with discordant


---------67:57----------
relationships that can be therapy or


---------67:59----------
coaching


---------68:00----------
but really at the top of the list is if


---------68:02----------
you guys have not seen a mental health


---------68:04----------
professional you should absolutely go do


---------68:05----------
that


---------68:08----------
questions


---------68:12----------
or i guess let me just kind of summarize


---------68:14----------
so just to kind of cap recap


---------68:17----------
today we talked a little bit about adhd


---------68:19----------
and depression and the goal of what i


---------68:21----------
was trying to do today is to stitch


---------68:23----------
together


---------68:25----------
a lot of different


---------68:27----------
disciplines of science to give us a very


---------68:30----------
clear understanding


---------68:32----------
of


---------68:33----------
what adhd and depression like how they


---------68:35----------
interact and what they are so it starts


---------68:36----------
with genetics where we sort of


---------68:38----------
discovered that 70 of


---------68:40----------
adhd and depression appears to be


---------68:43----------
has a 70 concordance in genetics that


---------68:46----------
there are a lot of scary statistics that


---------68:48----------
show that adhd and depression may start


---------68:50----------
at the genetic level so once we


---------68:52----------
understood the genetics we kind of went


---------68:54----------
into certain neuroscience and tried to


---------68:55----------
figure out okay what's happening in the


---------68:57----------
brain of people with adhd and depression


---------68:59----------
how do these two things kind of interact


---------69:04----------
then what we did is looked at deficits


---------69:06----------
right so once we understand what's


---------69:07----------
happening in the brain what does that


---------69:09----------
manifest as within an individual what


---------69:11----------
are the actual deficits that someone


---------69:13----------
with adhd and depression has


---------69:16----------
once we understood what the deficits are


---------69:18----------
we sort of were able to take a


---------69:19----------
developmental perspective so if you take


---------69:22----------
a kid who has these kinds of develop


---------69:24----------
deficits


---------69:25----------
and sort of has adhd as a child


---------69:28----------
how does growing up with those deficits


---------69:31----------
manifest as depression


---------69:33----------
when you're an adult and we kind of


---------69:35----------
explored those things and what what


---------69:37----------
whether the statistics tell us what does


---------69:38----------
the research tell us are they


---------69:40----------
contributing or what are the smoking


---------69:42----------
guns of depression in adulthood for


---------69:45----------
people who have adhd and we discovered


---------69:46----------
that it's discordant relationships


---------69:48----------
bullying academic hardship emotional


---------69:50----------
dysregulation and irritability


---------69:53----------
and then we even looked at sort of a


---------69:54----------
more present focused or clinical focused


---------69:56----------
perspective where we kind of said okay


---------69:58----------
so like once you're here and you're in


---------70:00----------
the here and now you grew up with adhd


---------70:02----------
now you have depression what does that


---------70:03----------
look like in the here and now what are


---------70:05----------
the different strategies that people use


---------70:07----------
in the present to deal with their


---------70:09----------
emotions


---------70:10----------
and then finally once we understood that


---------70:13----------
what is our roadmap for improvement if


---------70:16----------
you fall into this bucket what do you


---------70:18----------
actually end up like what can you do


---------70:19----------
about it and the answer is you can do a


---------70:21----------
lot so you're not doomed by your


---------70:22----------
genetics you're not doomed by your brain


---------70:24----------
there's a ton of stuff that you can do


---------70:26----------
and i've worked very successfully with


---------70:28----------
like tons of patients that have been


---------70:30----------
able to essentially overcome adhd and


---------70:32----------
depression so there's hope out there


---------70:34----------
don't give up and i really hope that


---------70:36----------
today's lecture has empowered you all to


---------70:38----------
better understand this really


---------70:40----------
fascinating aspect of like human


---------70:42----------
neuroscience human psychology and like


---------70:44----------
sort of


---------70:45----------
the experiences of these people in the


---------70:47----------
present


---------70:48----------
questions


---------70:57----------
all right questions


---------71:01----------
okay i'm gonna focus on questions


---------71:02----------
relating to adhd and depression for now


---------71:08----------
uh just


---------71:09----------
how does strengthening the frontal lobe


---------71:11----------
affect stuff


---------71:14----------
okay good question


---------71:15----------
so let's kind of go back


---------71:20----------
so how does strengthening the frontal


---------71:21----------
lobe affect stuff


---------71:23----------
so remember that our motivation


---------71:25----------
behavioral drives and essentially what


---------71:28----------
we do our reward circuitry


---------71:30----------
is the nucleus accumbens


---------71:33----------
now in the nucleus accumbens


---------71:36----------
let's kind of go down here okay


---------71:38----------
so let's look at point number seven


---------71:41----------
how does


---------71:43----------
frontal lobe


---------71:44----------
affect things


---------71:47----------
so in our nucleus accumbens


---------71:50----------
there's like a pro and a con for a


---------71:52----------
behavior okay


---------71:55----------
and essentially what happens is like our


---------71:56----------
emotions may be telling us break up with


---------71:58----------
this person


---------72:00----------
and our frontal lobes may be telling us


---------72:02----------
oh no no don't do that don't give in to


---------72:04----------
the emotion there's like there's a


---------72:05----------
tension


---------72:06----------
between emotions


---------72:09----------
and frontal lobes


---------72:11----------
in the nucleus accumbens and depending


---------72:13----------
on which one wins if the frontal lobe


---------72:15----------
wins then like you'll engage in one


---------72:17----------
behavior and if the emotions win you'll


---------72:19----------
engage in another behavior it even goes


---------72:21----------
a little bit deeper because the reward


---------72:23----------
structure can be related to emotions or


---------72:26----------
frontal lobe and so what that even means


---------72:28----------
is that


---------72:29----------
how can i say this


---------72:31----------
let's say i'm bullying someone the


---------72:34----------
amount of satisfaction i get from


---------72:36----------
bullying someone


---------72:38----------
relates to the emotional impact on our


---------72:41----------
nucleus accumbens versus our frontal


---------72:42----------
lobes which is why we'll see like if you


---------72:45----------
look at people who are lifelong


---------72:46----------
meditators


---------72:47----------
they don't engage in like toxic behavior


---------72:50----------
because it feels less rewarding to them


---------72:53----------
this is how like people who meditate on


---------72:55----------
a regular basis like become better human


---------72:57----------
beings


---------72:58----------
i know it's kind of bizarre because it's


---------72:59----------
not just the influence of like you know


---------73:02----------
what you end up doing it's also the


---------73:04----------
reward that you get from like giving in


---------73:06----------
to your emotions so like giving in to


---------73:08----------
hatred is going to reward it's going to


---------73:11----------
reinforce your behavior in a particular


---------73:12----------
way and it's going to feel really really


---------73:14----------
good if your brain is like framed a


---------73:16----------
particular way when you strengthen


---------73:18----------
strengthen your frontal lobes literally


---------73:20----------
the satisfaction that you get from being


---------73:22----------
a toxic on the internet goes


---------73:24----------
down and so then we see a reduction in


---------73:26----------
that behavior because your reward


---------73:28----------
circuitry has been altered


---------73:33----------
does that make sense


---------73:38----------
um so you mentioned genetics but are you


---------73:40----------
familiar with the science behind


---------73:42----------
epigenetics in regards to this


---------73:43----------
specifically the studies about things


---------73:45----------
like ptsd being passed down to children


---------73:47----------
through epigenetics yeah i'm pretty


---------73:49----------
familiar with that research so let's


---------73:51----------
take the question from the top so


---------73:52----------
there's some evidence okay let's just


---------73:55----------
really go from the top


---------73:57----------
so the first thing is that


---------73:59----------
there's a field called epigenetics which


---------74:01----------
is not the actual genes


---------74:04----------
but the act how genes are turned on or


---------74:07----------
turned off so our genome look we've got


---------74:09----------
a bunch of stuff in there and it's not


---------74:10----------
necessarily the allele or like the the


---------74:13----------
gene like the dna sequence at a


---------74:15----------
particular point but like you can turn


---------74:16----------
genes on and you can turn genes off


---------74:18----------
that's called epigenetics


---------74:20----------
so


---------74:21----------
whether genes are turned on or off


---------74:23----------
actually relates to our experiences so


---------74:26----------
certain kinds of genes


---------74:28----------
will be turned on by certain kinds of


---------74:30----------
experiences so an example of this


---------74:33----------
is when our body gets an infection we


---------74:36----------
will activate transcription we will turn


---------74:38----------
on genes of things like heat shock


---------74:40----------
proteins and other kinds of like genes


---------74:42----------
in our cells that will help us fight


---------74:44----------
infection right so it's like there's a


---------74:46----------
bunch of stuff that like once we get


---------74:47----------
infected our bodies like time to go to


---------74:49----------
war let's start producing like let's


---------74:51----------
turn on our armories and start producing


---------74:54----------
soldiers and like you know cytokines


---------74:56----------
that will help us fight infection so


---------74:58----------
experiences can affect our genetic


---------75:00----------
uh


---------75:01----------
activation


---------75:03----------
and so if we go back to what i was


---------75:04----------
saying earlier about what is the model


---------75:06----------
of genes right so that's where i sort of


---------75:08----------
shared that genetics plus vulnerability


---------75:12----------
is what results in illness and all that


---------75:13----------
kind of stuff is epigenetic


---------75:15----------
so this is also where when we kind of


---------75:17----------
look at that that developmental aspect


---------75:19----------
when we were talking about okay if you


---------75:21----------
have a kid with adhd who grows up with


---------75:24----------
an adhd brain


---------75:26----------
and experiences life as a kid with adhd


---------75:29----------
with bullying and not having friends and


---------75:31----------
like poor academic success that's going


---------75:33----------
to have an epigenetic impact and make


---------75:35----------
you vulnerable to depression so i


---------75:36----------
believe a lot of that stuff is mediated


---------75:38----------
through epigenetics i personally have


---------75:40----------
not looked into the epigenetics


---------75:43----------
of development with adhd as it relates


---------75:46----------
to depression but i sort of feel like i


---------75:48----------
don't need to because there's like i


---------75:49----------
mean hopefully i made a convincing


---------75:51----------
argument of this i think we have enough


---------75:52----------
pieces of the puzzle where we're like


---------75:54----------
pretty sure that that's happening


---------75:56----------
great question though


---------76:02----------
um


---------76:05----------
yeah so can can you explain more how to


---------76:07----------
work on discordant relationships sure


---------76:10----------
so the term discordant relationship


---------76:12----------
means like a relationship that has


---------76:14----------
discord right it's something that's not


---------76:16----------
working properly


---------76:18----------
so if you want to work on discordant


---------76:20----------
relationships as someone with adhd


---------76:22----------
i think the main thing to understand is


---------76:25----------
what are your adhd deficits that could


---------76:28----------
impact the relationship that's the first


---------76:30----------
thing you've got to do


---------76:31----------
so is this relationship not going well


---------76:34----------
because i am disorganized and i like


---------76:37----------
don't show up when i'm supposed to show


---------76:39----------
up is this relationship not going well


---------76:41----------
because i was supposed to pick up pick


---------76:43----------
someone up at the airport and i showed


---------76:44----------
up an hour late because i'm disorganized


---------76:46----------
like that's a very practical example of


---------76:48----------
how disorganization and adhd negatively


---------76:51----------
affects the relationship


---------76:52----------
is this relationship being negatively


---------76:54----------
affected because i'm inattentive so when


---------76:56----------
i do hang out with someone i'm literally


---------76:59----------
not able to attend to like what they're


---------77:02----------
saying so we're going to dinner together


---------77:04----------
and like i'm going to dinner with let's


---------77:05----------
say my partner right so my romantic


---------77:07----------
partner and they've had a bad day and my


---------77:10----------
mind is like wandering all over the


---------77:11----------
place so then that that partner will


---------77:13----------
feel unheard they'll feel like someone's


---------77:15----------
not listening to them they won't feel


---------77:16----------
emotionally supported and it'll create


---------77:18----------
discord in the relationship


---------77:20----------
so the first thing to under to do or


---------77:22----------
maybe it's like irritability or


---------77:24----------
emotional regulation right so maybe the


---------77:25----------
way the reason that my


---------77:27----------
relationship is in discord is because


---------77:29----------
i'm too irritable i've had a bad day and


---------77:32----------
then i like go and meet my friends and


---------77:34----------
since i'm in a foul mood because i'm


---------77:35----------
overly irritable like i snap at them and


---------77:38----------
they feel hurt and then like i feel like


---------77:40----------
kind of i feel like i screwed up right


---------77:42----------
and then the avoidance kicks in because


---------77:43----------
we know that people with adhd engage in


---------77:46----------
avoidance behaviors and so once i create


---------77:48----------
a problem in a relationship


---------77:51----------
since i rely on avoidance i never really


---------77:53----------
fix it right i never talk to them about


---------77:55----------
it i never apologize to them or i overly


---------77:58----------
apologize and never engage in discussion


---------78:00----------
i never asked them hey what was it like


---------78:02----------
to have me being like irritable that day


---------78:04----------
right i never want to hear from them


---------78:07----------
how i'm like actually sometimes not a


---------78:09----------
great friend so i avoid


---------78:11----------
so like that's an example of like


---------78:13----------
looking at


---------78:14----------
not only the the predispositions you


---------78:16----------
have


---------78:17----------
to damage relationships but then also


---------78:20----------
your coping mechanisms can sort of


---------78:22----------
reinforce that damage or interfere with


---------78:24----------
your repair mechanisms because you're so


---------78:26----------
avoidant and that leads to discordant


---------78:28----------
relationships


---------78:30----------
so how do you work on it right so now


---------78:32----------
this is where we kind of look at for


---------78:34----------
example like if you know that what your


---------78:36----------
problems are you can actually have


---------78:37----------
conversations with people about them


---------78:38----------
right you can say hey by the way so like


---------78:41----------
let's say you go to dinner with your


---------78:42----------
partner and and they're like they're


---------78:44----------
talking about things and you can even


---------78:45----------
like while you're tuned in you can say


---------78:47----------
hey


---------78:47----------
i can see that this is something that's


---------78:49----------
really upsetting you and i'm having a


---------78:51----------
lot of trouble focusing on what you're


---------78:52----------
saying and what i really want to do more


---------78:54----------
than anything else is focus on what


---------78:56----------
you're saying


---------78:57----------
um so i'm going to do my best but i


---------79:00----------
apologize if it seems like i'm kind of


---------79:02----------
checked out


---------79:03----------
i'm really trying to pay attention


---------79:05----------
the second thing that you can do is even


---------79:06----------
suggest an alternative and you can say


---------79:08----------
hey like it's really hard for me to like


---------79:10----------
pay attention to you like being in this


---------79:11----------
crowded restaurant


---------79:12----------
is it okay if we table this conversation


---------79:14----------
let's go for a walk after we're done


---------79:15----------
with dinner and like i'd love to hear


---------79:17----------
about it maybe we can go for a walk


---------79:19----------
because oftentimes what people with adhd


---------79:21----------
discover is that having some kind of


---------79:24----------
physical activity helps them pay


---------79:26----------
attention


---------79:27----------
so i've even had i've written notes for


---------79:30----------
students of mine for them to be able to


---------79:32----------
knit during class


---------79:34----------
okay so this is a really interesting


---------79:36----------
thing that if if people with adhd are


---------79:38----------
able to knit they can actually pay


---------79:40----------
better attention mentally so you i'll


---------79:42----------
even have patients who will be like hey


---------79:43----------
let's like i'm going to stop eating this


---------79:46----------
is the extreme i don't think this has


---------79:47----------
ever happened i'm going to stop eating


---------79:48----------
and because this conversation is so


---------79:49----------
important to me i'm going to pull out my


---------79:50----------
knitting because that helps me pay


---------79:51----------
attention it's bizarre


---------79:54----------
right so then you can start to address


---------79:55----------
things you can also signal to other


---------79:57----------
people because remember that if they


---------79:59----------
don't know what's going on internally


---------80:01----------
they're going to interpret your


---------80:03----------
inattentiveness as a lack of caring


---------80:06----------
so you can have a conversation with them


---------80:08----------
where you can help people understand hey


---------80:09----------
it's not that i don't care it's that i


---------80:12----------
really do care and my brain is really


---------80:13----------
not complying right now


---------80:15----------
right


---------80:16----------
so you can sort of address things and


---------80:18----------
then the third thing which i think is


---------80:19----------
really really important to improve


---------80:21----------
discordant relationships is to move away


---------80:23----------
from avoidance


---------80:24----------
if there is some kind of conflict if


---------80:26----------
there is some kind of problem and you


---------80:28----------
feel really ashamed or whatever like you


---------80:30----------
can't


---------80:31----------
bury it right or i guess you can


---------80:33----------
suppress that's that's what i mean by


---------80:34----------
bear i mean so that kind of


---------80:36----------
suppression is actually healthy so


---------80:39----------
burying it and attending to them but


---------80:40----------
avoiding the situation never having a


---------80:42----------
conversation with them never


---------80:44----------
acknowledging things pretending that


---------80:46----------
everything is okay or devaluing things


---------80:48----------
in my mind oh my partner will be fine


---------80:50----------
it's like not that big of a deal like


---------80:52----------
they understand i've got adhd i don't


---------80:54----------
need to talk to him about it all of


---------80:55----------
those kinds of avoidance strategies will


---------80:57----------
cause discord in your relationship so


---------80:59----------
move from those strategies to more


---------81:02----------
suppression where you're like even


---------81:03----------
though it's really going to hurt me to


---------81:05----------
have this conversation because my


---------81:06----------
partner may say may confirm my my


---------81:09----------
deepest fears that i'm actually not a


---------81:11----------
good partner at times i still have to


---------81:13----------
have the conversation i'm gonna squash


---------81:15----------
that feeling down and sit down and


---------81:17----------
actually have the conversation and


---------81:19----------
ideally you can even get to the point of


---------81:21----------
reappraisal


---------81:22----------
where you can work through things on


---------81:23----------
your own and you can say like you know i


---------81:25----------
really care about this relationship and


---------81:27----------
even though it may be hurtful


---------81:29----------
to get confirmation that i didn't do a


---------81:31----------
great job in the long term


---------81:34----------
moving past that is the right move and


---------81:36----------
really what this relationship needs so i


---------81:38----------
have to do it because caring about the


---------81:40----------
relationship and my value for the


---------81:41----------
relationship is greater than my feelings


---------81:44----------
being hurt temporarily


---------81:46----------
that's sort of the ultimate fix


---------81:48----------
so i hope that helps


---------81:52----------
um


---------81:58----------
okay so one person is saying i've tried


---------82:00----------
to get diagnosed for adhd and have been


---------82:02----------
told because i'm depressed and my age it


---------82:04----------
would be inconclusive and am unable to


---------82:06----------
get treatment for what i what what what


---------82:09----------
can i do so i'd say go see a different


---------82:11----------
clinician so let's understand a couple


---------82:12----------
of things


---------82:13----------
so adhd oftentimes people will get


---------82:16----------
tested for adhd so there are


---------82:19----------
neuropsychological tests so you go to a


---------82:22----------
psychologist and they will administer


---------82:24----------
like a test of your attention


---------82:28----------
based on the results of that test they


---------82:29----------
can diagnose you with adhd or not


---------82:31----------
diagnose you with adhd but the truth is


---------82:33----------
that a test cannot diagnose you with


---------82:35----------
adhd


---------82:37----------
all a test can do is give you a


---------82:38----------
probability of what your diagnosis of


---------82:41----------
adhd is if that sort of makes sense


---------82:43----------
because that's how psychological tests


---------82:44----------
are designed


---------82:45----------
a true diagnosis of adhd comes from is


---------82:49----------
often done clinically and a test is used


---------82:52----------
to supplement a clinical diagnosis and


---------82:54----------
so what does that mean a clinical


---------82:56----------
diagnosis that means that you sit down


---------82:58----------
with a trained professional who


---------83:00----------
evaluates you and essentially


---------83:02----------
subjectively decides i know it's kind of


---------83:04----------
objective but it's really one person's


---------83:05----------
opinion because that's how we do


---------83:07----------
psychiatric diagnoses there are no


---------83:08----------
objective tests for psychiatric


---------83:10----------
diagnoses


---------83:11----------
so a trained clinician has to sit down


---------83:13----------
evaluate your symptoms and say yes


---------83:16----------
according to my expertise you have adhd


---------83:18----------
or according to my expertise you do not


---------83:20----------
have adhd


---------83:21----------
so there may be so that's ultimately


---------83:24----------
where the diagnosis of adhd comes from


---------83:25----------
it doesn't technically come from a test


---------83:28----------
you know even the test report


---------83:30----------
will not give you a hundred percent


---------83:31----------
likelihood that you have adhd if you


---------83:33----------
actually read the report it'll probably


---------83:34----------
say and i could be wrong there may be a


---------83:36----------
test out there that because i'm not a


---------83:38----------
neuropsychologist


---------83:39----------
um


---------83:40----------
so you know i could be mistaken there


---------83:42----------
but based on as a psychiatrist when i


---------83:44----------
refer people to neuropsychological


---------83:45----------
testing they'll give me a report back


---------83:48----------
and that report will say like you know


---------83:49----------
we believe that this person has you know


---------83:51----------
has a high likelihood or extremely high


---------83:53----------
likelihood of having adhd here are the


---------83:55----------
neuroscientific deficits that


---------83:57----------
we believe that this person has which


---------83:59----------
which is why we think they have adhd so


---------84:01----------
they go into a lot of detail but they're


---------84:02----------
never going to give you 100


---------84:05----------
so just talk to a clinician now the main


---------84:07----------
confounding factor is that if you have


---------84:09----------
active depression


---------84:11----------
so if your cognition is being affected


---------84:13----------
by your depression


---------84:15----------
then it it makes it very hard to


---------84:17----------
determine whether your inattention is a


---------84:20----------
is coming from the depression or coming


---------84:22----------
from the adhd if that sort of makes


---------84:23----------
sense


---------84:24----------
because we know that people who are


---------84:26----------
actively depressed have trouble paying


---------84:28----------
attention to things but that has nothing


---------84:29----------
to do with adhd that's because attention


---------84:32----------
is you know a complicated


---------84:35----------
circuit in the brain that can be


---------84:36----------
affected by mood that can be affected by


---------84:38----------
depression so the real way you should


---------84:40----------
make a diagnosis of adhd with someone


---------84:42----------
who's got a diagnosis of depression is


---------84:45----------
ideally to treat the depression have the


---------84:47----------
depression in remission right so then


---------84:49----------
they're not actively depressed anymore


---------84:51----------
and then evaluate their attentive when


---------84:53----------
their depression is theoretically out of


---------84:55----------
the picture and if they still have


---------84:57----------
attentional problems then there's a good


---------84:59----------
likelihood that they've got adhd now as


---------85:01----------
a clinician


---------85:02----------
i've diagnosed people with adhd despite


---------85:05----------
the fact that they're actively depressed


---------85:07----------
and that simply comes from


---------85:09----------
asking questions about what their


---------85:11----------
attention was like before they were


---------85:13----------
depressed right so you can still do that


---------85:15----------
you can still try to do an assessment of


---------85:16----------
like before depression ever manifested


---------85:19----------
what was school like for you did you


---------85:21----------
ever need special testing did you have


---------85:22----------
difficulty with this do you have


---------85:24----------
difficulty with that sometimes i'll talk


---------85:25----------
to their parents and you can still sort


---------85:27----------
of like make a preliminary diagnosis of


---------85:29----------
adhd even in the case of active


---------85:30----------
depression


---------85:32----------
and that's very important clinically so


---------85:33----------
i'd say find a good clinician because a


---------85:35----------
good clinician should be able to suss


---------85:37----------
that out for you and walk you through


---------85:40----------
you know maybe treating your depression


---------85:41----------
so that you can get a good diagnosis but


---------85:43----------
i'm not surprised that one person would


---------85:45----------
say hey we can't give you


---------85:46----------
neuropsychological testing while you're


---------85:48----------
actively depressed because that'll


---------85:50----------
interfere with the test results that


---------85:51----------
sort of makes sense


---------85:57----------
okay just so you all know i know i'm


---------85:58----------
getting a lot of like questions and


---------86:00----------
responses and stuff like i'm still like


---------86:02----------
on the first round of questions okay so


---------86:04----------
like i think i can scroll down quite a


---------86:06----------
bit


---------86:09----------
um


---------86:12----------
someone's saying


---------86:13----------
dr k listening to your voice empowers me


---------86:15----------
good i'm happy to hear that


---------86:18----------
i'd also hope that listening to my words


---------86:20----------
empowers you


---------86:29----------
oh boy


---------86:31----------
adventurer 467 says i'm late oh dude


---------86:35----------
my poor friend


---------86:37----------
if you came in late to this lecture


---------86:39----------
it's gonna be tough dude


---------86:41----------
go back and watch from the beginning


---------86:46----------
um


---------86:49----------
okay why do people have adhd what a good


---------86:51----------
question


---------86:52----------
this is actually really interesting why


---------86:54----------
do people have adhd


---------86:57----------
so it is my belief that adh the reason


---------87:00----------
we so okay why do people have adhd if we


---------87:03----------
want to understand why human beings have


---------87:04----------
things


---------87:05----------
i think the best


---------87:07----------
way uh sorry the best answer for the


---------87:09----------
question why


---------87:11----------
is


---------87:12----------
evolution


---------87:13----------
so i just


---------87:15----------
as a psychiatrist medical professional


---------87:17----------
scientist call me whatever you want to


---------87:19----------
i think if you really want to understand


---------87:21----------
why like you could turn to things like


---------87:22----------
religion or yoga or whatever right and


---------87:24----------
i've studied all that stuff i believe in


---------87:25----------
some of that stuff but in terms of what


---------87:27----------
i'm confident you know sharing with


---------87:29----------
y'all it's basically evolution


---------87:31----------
so if you look at like human beings


---------87:33----------
everything we have things that you know


---------87:36----------
don't exist probably had selection


---------87:38----------
pressures against them and things that


---------87:40----------
do exist have selection pressures for


---------87:42----------
them so for example people may ask the


---------87:44----------
question why do we get depressed and


---------87:45----------
there's a good video about this in dr


---------87:47----------
k's guide


---------87:49----------
depression


---------87:50----------
is the evil is the price we pay for the


---------87:53----------
evolutionary advantage of self-awareness


---------87:56----------
so if we think about human beings at


---------87:58----------
some point we became self-aware and it


---------88:00----------
turns out that from an evolutionary


---------88:01----------
standpoint the capacity for


---------88:03----------
self-reflection


---------88:05----------
gave us such a dominating advantage over


---------88:08----------
every other species in the planet the


---------88:10----------
problem is that when we gain


---------88:11----------
self-awareness we open ourselves up to


---------88:14----------
depression and that has to do with this


---------88:16----------
circuit called the default mode network


---------88:18----------
there's a you know a big thing about


---------88:19----------
that in in dr k's guide i go into all


---------88:21----------
that detail


---------88:23----------
so let's talk about adhd like why would


---------88:25----------
we have adhd if it's a disease right


---------88:30----------
whereas i think you have to and there's


---------88:32----------
a good theory about this which is sort


---------88:33----------
of the hunter versus farmer uh theory


---------88:36----------
which is that when human beings were


---------88:38----------
like you know ten thousand years ago or


---------88:40----------
five thousand years ago human beings had


---------88:43----------
different temperaments


---------88:44----------
so some human beings were very like


---------88:46----------
routine oriented like to wake up at the


---------88:48----------
same time every day like to go to the


---------88:50----------
same place every day and do the same


---------88:52----------
stuff every day so these people became


---------88:54----------
the farmers and there were other human


---------88:56----------
beings that hated being a farmer they


---------88:59----------
wanted variety and they wanted to like


---------89:01----------
go out and explore and they needed to


---------89:03----------
attend to a lot of stimuli so when i'm


---------89:05----------
walking through the jungle my brain


---------89:07----------
needs to be like bouncing all over the


---------89:09----------
place it needs to kind of be adhd it


---------89:11----------
can't just focus on one tree it has to


---------89:13----------
look at this tree and has to look at the


---------89:14----------
ground is there a snake over there is


---------89:16----------
there oh is that like a footprint over


---------89:17----------
there is that is that a broken branch


---------89:19----------
over there and so what there's almost


---------89:22----------
like this adaptive benefit to having a


---------89:24----------
mind that's attention is more loose and


---------89:27----------
not focused and not repetitive


---------89:30----------
and so early on in in human like in


---------89:32----------
societies like we had hunter gatherer


---------89:34----------
societies we had early farming societies


---------89:36----------
and things like that and there was


---------89:37----------
probably a selection pressure for both


---------89:40----------
so the most successful tribe was one


---------89:42----------
that had some farmers some people who


---------89:45----------
were in the routine and some people who


---------89:47----------
were like very dynamic and had attention


---------89:48----------
all over the place


---------89:51----------
so essentially what happened is like


---------89:52----------
that's why we see in society we have


---------89:55----------
both camps right we have the people


---------89:57----------
whose attention is all over the place


---------89:59----------
these are the vatas for lack of a better


---------90:00----------
term and then we also have the kaphas


---------90:02----------
these are the farmers the people who are


---------90:03----------
very routine oriented the reason that


---------90:06----------
adhd is now a disorder


---------90:08----------
is because of a couple of things but the


---------90:10----------
first and biggest reason is because our


---------90:12----------
society has a very very farmer bent


---------90:16----------
so like hunters like don't do well in


---------90:18----------
our society anymore if we think about


---------90:19----------
school for example school is like eight


---------90:21----------
hours a day the same crap all day every


---------90:23----------
day it's not being out in the woods it's


---------90:25----------
not learning with your hands it's not


---------90:27----------
using your hands right it's not being a


---------90:29----------
tradesman anymore or trades woman it's


---------90:32----------
it's all about like schools and books


---------90:34----------
and learning and nine to five and the


---------90:36----------
grind and stuff like that so that


---------90:38----------
benefits the farmers it's a farmer-like


---------90:40----------
society


---------90:41----------
as a result


---------90:43----------
now this thing which used to be an


---------90:44----------
evolutionary advantage when we were


---------90:46----------
hunter-gatherers has now become a


---------90:48----------
disorder because we don't we're not able


---------90:50----------
to function in this society with brains


---------90:52----------
like this


---------90:54----------
so that's my big answer to why is there


---------90:56----------
adhd it's because these brains no longer


---------90:59----------
fit with the society that we have there


---------91:02----------
are also other influences like we know


---------91:04----------
that for example early exposure to


---------91:06----------
technology and especially like short


---------91:08----------
form technology


---------91:10----------
reduces our attention span and makes


---------91:12----------
like it hard for us to like


---------91:14----------
retain attention on one area so it's not


---------91:17----------
just societal influence there can also


---------91:19----------
be like technological influences where


---------91:21----------
there are even studies that have been


---------91:22----------
done on long-form television versus


---------91:25----------
short form television so if you take a


---------91:27----------
kid and you give them long-form tv like


---------91:30----------
you have them watch a movie that's not


---------91:32----------
going to negatively affect their


---------91:33----------
attention span whereas if you have a kid


---------91:35----------
who's watching 30 second clips on


---------91:36----------
youtube for like six hours a day their


---------91:38----------
attention span is going to be like


---------91:40----------
really really short right so they'll


---------91:42----------
still be very dynamic they can juggle a


---------91:43----------
lot of things but their ability to sit


---------91:45----------
through school is not going to be like


---------91:47----------
it's going to be hard it's hard for them


---------91:49----------
to sit down and focus their attention


---------91:51----------
so there do appear to be societal


---------91:53----------
influences that are like more


---------91:54----------
developmental and related to technology


---------91:56----------
too which is why adhd i think is getting


---------91:58----------
worse actually so that's why we have


---------92:00----------
adhd


---------92:05----------
okay


---------92:12----------
oh man what are the comorbidities of


---------92:14----------
other conditions that also match adhd


---------92:16----------
symptoms dude that's a whole lecture in


---------92:18----------
and of itself


---------92:20----------
um


---------92:22----------
but the short answer is that's why we


---------92:23----------
have the process of differential


---------92:25----------
diagnosis


---------92:26----------
so remember that you know


---------92:30----------
adhd is a collection of symptoms like


---------92:32----------
impulsivity for example inattention


---------92:35----------
irritability if we look at the


---------92:37----------
differential diagnosis for those


---------92:38----------
symptoms there's like a ton of stuff


---------92:39----------
right so ptsd is the great chameleon of


---------92:42----------
mental illnesses and can masquerade as


---------92:44----------
pretty much anything bipolar disorder


---------92:47----------
depression can sometimes there's a


---------92:48----------
subtype of depression called depression


---------92:50----------
with anger attacks which is like a bit


---------92:52----------
that depression which we also talk about


---------92:53----------
in dr k's guide so that's where like


---------92:55----------
people who are depressed aren't sad they


---------92:57----------
just get super irritable so even


---------92:58----------
depression can manifest as like


---------93:00----------
irritability and inattention


---------93:02----------
bipolar disorder for sure if you're


---------93:03----------
manic rights or hypomanic you're more


---------93:06----------
irritable you're less attentive you have


---------93:08----------
flight of ideas so bipolar disorder can


---------93:10----------
manifest as substance use is very high


---------93:13----------
on the list of like on the differential


---------93:15----------
right because if i'm like high on


---------93:16----------
adderall or i've had too much coffee i'm


---------93:18----------
going to be speaking very fast my mind


---------93:20----------
is all over the place and i'm going to


---------93:21----------
be irritable


---------93:23----------
so the differential diagnosis is huge if


---------93:25----------
you want to you know a great i mean i


---------93:27----------
guess we could theoretically do whole


---------93:28----------
lectures about differential diagnosis


---------93:30----------
but that's when we're really like


---------93:31----------
talking medical school kind of stuff


---------93:33----------
like that's what i teach clinically like


---------93:34----------
when i've


---------93:35----------
you know a resident who's like a


---------93:38----------
psychiatrist or a medical student who


---------93:40----------
wants to learn about psychiatry like


---------93:41----------
that's the kind of detail that we go


---------93:42----------
into there good question though


---------93:45----------
um


---------93:49----------
seems like defective executive function


---------93:51----------
would be a disadvantage in tribes i


---------93:53----------
would think so


---------93:54----------
so i i think like executive function is


---------93:56----------
like the most op thing in the brain in


---------93:59----------
my opinion so i don't know why we would


---------94:02----------
have a deficit for executive function if


---------94:04----------
we look at it evolutionarily probably


---------94:07----------
the reason that we have deficits in


---------94:08----------
executive function


---------94:10----------
is because of opportunity cost


---------94:14----------
so if you kind of think about it i know


---------94:15----------
this sounds kind of weird


---------94:17----------
but what do you think is like


---------94:19----------
evolutionary evolutionarily advantageous


---------94:23----------
being very like stable and monogamous


---------94:26----------
monogamous and staying in one


---------94:28----------
relationship for your entire life that


---------94:30----------
is like harmonious where you raise two


---------94:32----------
kids and you you know you make sure that


---------94:35----------
you can like support them with resources


---------94:37----------
or being somewhat of an emotional train


---------94:39----------
wreck and having like lots of different


---------94:40----------
children with like lots of different


---------94:42----------
people


---------94:42----------
what's actually like evolutionary


---------94:44----------
advantageous


---------94:46----------
right like falling in love and then


---------94:48----------
having a train wreck of a relationship


---------94:52----------
if that happens like six times over the


---------94:54----------
course of 15 years


---------94:57----------
it's interesting right so like


---------94:58----------
evolutionary advantages are about


---------95:00----------
survival and reproduction by the way i'm


---------95:02----------
not sure that that's the case so i


---------95:04----------
literally do not know


---------95:05----------
because it may be that you know that


---------95:07----------
person's


---------95:09----------
offspring or like less likely to have


---------95:11----------
successful offspring of their own like


---------95:12----------
you never know


---------95:14----------
so so it's interesting but


---------95:16----------
yeah we don't really know why people


---------95:18----------
seem to have executive function deficits


---------95:20----------
but it may be because like if your


---------95:22----------
executive function is too high like


---------95:23----------
you're less likely to have children


---------95:25----------
who knows


---------95:35----------
okay


---------95:44----------
uh


---------95:57----------
um


---------95:59----------
so would you have any recommendation


---------96:02----------
for adhd dears


---------96:04----------
with depression who are currently unable


---------96:05----------
to access medication due to waiting


---------96:07----------
lists any supplementation or specific


---------96:09----------
meditation techniques you'd recommend


---------96:12----------
so i'd go back to the roadmap right so i


---------96:14----------
gave you all like lots of different


---------96:15----------
things to work on


---------96:17----------
as far as supplementation goes i'm not


---------96:19----------
going to recommend any supplements


---------96:21----------
generally speaking we try to steer clear


---------96:23----------
of that here at hg i mean we do do it in


---------96:25----------
dr k's guide because


---------96:27----------
i think there's a lot of backstory


---------96:29----------
before like you understand like you


---------96:31----------
think about taking a supplement so in dr


---------96:33----------
k's guide we go into a lot of detail


---------96:35----------
about the dangers of herbal supplements


---------96:38----------
we also want to do a very thorough like


---------96:41----------
review of the literature and the science


---------96:42----------
before we recommend anything so there


---------96:44----------
are particular things that we'll talk


---------96:46----------
about for depression and anxiety but it


---------96:47----------
needs to have like you know a lot of


---------96:49----------
safety discussions


---------96:50----------
a lot of like exploration of the real


---------96:52----------
efficacy of supplementation


---------96:54----------
so while there are things that i do for


---------96:56----------
my patients and that's basically about


---------96:58----------
that balancing diet is what i would


---------96:59----------
recommend


---------97:01----------
there's a lot of back story to that and


---------97:02----------
a lot of complicated stuff that you need


---------97:04----------
to do before i just say hey do this so i


---------97:06----------
think one of the unfortunately


---------97:08----------
irresponsible things that tends to


---------97:09----------
happen is people will talk a lot about


---------97:11----------
supplements but they won't have in my


---------97:13----------
opinion the


---------97:15----------
boring


---------97:16----------
safe conversations that you really need


---------97:18----------
to before you get into supplementation


---------97:20----------
as far as specific meditation techniques


---------97:22----------
i think i addressed that in the roadmap


---------97:23----------
as well so we we've taught some


---------97:25----------
techniques for restraining attention


---------97:27----------
like the rotating sound awareness


---------97:28----------
meditation um


---------97:30----------
and by the way the the guide now has a


---------97:32----------
meditation index where you can now


---------97:34----------
search based on like if you're looking


---------97:36----------
for grounding techniques and things like


---------97:37----------
that it'll like point them out to you


---------97:39----------
but i think that depending on going back


---------97:41----------
to the roadmap


---------97:42----------
once you figure out what your problem is


---------97:45----------
there are specific meditations for like


---------97:47----------
each of those problems so if your


---------97:49----------
problem is shame for example you may


---------97:51----------
want to do like some kind of anahat


---------97:53----------
chakra or mehta meditation these are


---------97:55----------
heart chakra meditations that are all


---------97:57----------
about cultivating compassion and


---------97:59----------
forgiveness that's going to be different


---------98:02----------
from


---------98:03----------
the meditation that helps you restrain


---------98:05----------
your attention and focus on one point


---------98:07----------
that in turn is going to be different


---------98:09----------
from the kind of meditation that you use


---------98:10----------
to ground yourself when you're


---------98:12----------
emotionally activated and like very


---------98:14----------
irritable


---------98:15----------
right so there are all these different


---------98:16----------
meditation techniques there really isn't


---------98:20----------
great science yet that


---------98:23----------
specific meditation techniques


---------98:25----------
target things at the resolution that i


---------98:27----------
teach


---------98:28----------
because you just have to do a ton of


---------98:30----------
clinical trials we're i think we'll get


---------98:31----------
there we're getting there


---------98:33----------
but clinically i found it to be very


---------98:35----------
effective to teach people specific


---------98:36----------
targeted meditation techniques but those


---------98:39----------
techniques depend on you know the


---------98:40----------
roadmap


---------98:44----------
um so so one person is saying great so


---------98:46----------
adhd is good for nothing now i disagree


---------98:51----------
so i'm pretty sure that if you look at


---------98:53----------
successful streamers and content


---------98:55----------
creators


---------98:56----------
the prevalence of adhd within content


---------98:59----------
creators is higher than the average


---------99:00----------
population


---------99:02----------
i think as our society is becoming more


---------99:04----------
adhd with shorter form content and


---------99:06----------
things like that


---------99:07----------
right so like it's like the adhd brain


---------99:10----------
who did we have um


---------99:12----------
that guy uh who has so he so first of


---------99:15----------
all if you go back through our


---------99:16----------
interviews like we have a bunch of like


---------99:17----------
streamers and content creators who have


---------99:19----------
like we'll say yeah i have adhd


---------99:21----------
um daily dose of the internet so i think


---------99:23----------
i think that's a guy i think if i


---------99:24----------
remember correctly he sort of said like


---------99:26----------
i have really


---------99:27----------
bad adhd and if you kind of think about


---------99:29----------
it what is he doing like he


---------99:30----------
instinctively knows because of his adhd


---------99:33----------
what he finds entertaining so he uses


---------99:35----------
his adhd is almost like a compass


---------99:38----------
to determine like what's getting


---------99:40----------
included in daily dose of the internet


---------99:42----------
and what isn't and it's very successful


---------99:45----------
right so we've also got people are


---------99:46----------
mentioning miss kiff and and xqc and


---------99:48----------
stuff like that so like yeah i mean


---------99:50----------
check out the mischief interview if you


---------99:51----------
all are curious that's an excellent


---------99:53----------
interview about adhd


---------99:57----------
but i do think that it's you know adhd


---------99:59----------
has advantages like


---------100:01----------
once it crosses the threshold of


---------100:03----------
disorder it's


---------100:05----------
the reason we define it as a disorder is


---------100:07----------
like because it's negatively impacts


---------100:09----------
your function so if you've got super bad


---------100:11----------
you know adhd chances are it's just like


---------100:12----------
it's a it's a negative right


---------100:15----------
um but that's why i also prefer to sort


---------100:17----------
of use the ayurvedic system because i am


---------100:20----------
quite adhd but i'm like subclinical so i


---------100:23----------
think avata is a better example of like


---------100:25----------
how to understand the spectrum the bell


---------100:28----------
curve of like attention across human


---------100:29----------
beings


---------100:32----------
is becoming apathetic to your successes


---------100:34----------
whilst obsessing over your failures


---------100:36----------
common with adhd i'm gonna say yes


---------100:40----------
so let's go back to the neuroscience


---------100:42----------
so remember that


---------100:45----------
oh man this is so complicated let me


---------100:47----------
just think about this


---------100:49----------
okay


---------100:52----------
so the question is is becoming apathetic


---------100:54----------
to your successes whilst obsessing over


---------100:56----------
your failures common with adhd and i'm


---------100:59----------
gonna say yes


---------101:00----------
so let's


---------101:03----------
let's lean a little bit on what we've


---------101:04----------
learned today okay and maybe y'all can


---------101:06----------
walk


---------101:07----------
walk through this with me


---------101:10----------
so first thing is obsessing over your


---------101:12----------
failures common with adhd let's unpack


---------101:15----------
that phrase so the first thing is


---------101:16----------
obsessing so one of the hallmarks of


---------101:20----------
adhd


---------101:21----------
is


---------101:22----------
dysregulated attention so a lot of times


---------101:25----------
people assume that adhd means a very


---------101:28----------
small attention span but the truth is if


---------101:31----------
you talk to people with adhd what you


---------101:33----------
find is dysregulated attention and what


---------101:36----------
that means is that


---------101:37----------
sometimes their attention is very very


---------101:40----------
small but the flip is also true where


---------101:42----------
sometimes they get so deeply absorbed in


---------101:45----------
something


---------101:46----------
where like


---------101:48----------
like everything around them ceases to


---------101:50----------
exist so this is a disorder of attention


---------101:52----------
instead of your attention staying kind


---------101:53----------
of in the middle where you can get


---------101:55----------
distracted when you need to get


---------101:57----------
distracted but you can focus when you


---------101:58----------
need to focus what you'll see oftentimes


---------102:00----------
in adhd is a hyper focus


---------102:03----------
to the impairment of their life


---------102:05----------
so i get so caught up in a video game


---------102:07----------
that i lose all track of time i get so


---------102:10----------
obsessive about something that i stop


---------102:12----------
paying attention to everything around me


---------102:14----------
so there is obsession is actually like a


---------102:16----------
very interesting hallmark of adhd and


---------102:19----------
something that leads to the a


---------102:21----------
misdiagnosis


---------102:22----------
because what you'll find is sometimes


---------102:24----------
people will be like you know parents


---------102:25----------
will think about their kids and they're


---------102:26----------
like well my kid sometimes has paying


---------102:29----------
attention but then once he starts


---------102:30----------
playing legos it's clear that legos can


---------102:33----------
hold his attention for three hours at a


---------102:34----------
stretch without any interruption so that


---------102:36----------
must not be adhd because he's sitting


---------102:38----------
there he's playing with the legos at


---------102:39----------
three hours of stretch that can actually


---------102:40----------
be a feature of adhd so it's disordered


---------102:43----------
attention okay


---------102:45----------
the second thing is so that's the


---------102:47----------
obsession so the second thing is


---------102:49----------
obsessing over failures so remember we


---------102:52----------
talked a little bit about how the volume


---------102:54----------
of the amygdala and the insula and


---------102:56----------
people with adhd is smaller


---------102:59----------
the interesting thing is that volume


---------103:01----------
loss correlates with worsening symptoms


---------103:03----------
of depression so it appears that the


---------103:05----------
brains of people with adhd are actually


---------103:08----------
more vulnerable to negative emotions


---------103:11----------
right which is why they're prone to


---------103:13----------
depression


---------103:14----------
so obsessing over your failures is


---------103:16----------
completely consistent with with our


---------103:18----------
understanding of adhd


---------103:20----------
now being apathetic to your successes


---------103:22----------
has two elements one that i've sort of


---------103:24----------
already talked a little bit about and


---------103:25----------
the second one that's kind of new


---------103:28----------
so the first is being apathetic to your


---------103:29----------
successes is likely an avoidance


---------103:31----------
strategy to help emotionally regulate


---------103:34----------
yourself so remember that people with


---------103:36----------
adhd have difficulties with emotional


---------103:38----------
regulation and so their inability to


---------103:41----------
regulate their emotional emotions


---------103:43----------
results in three coping strategies


---------103:46----------
avoidance suppression or reappraisal


---------103:49----------
avoidance is when we kind of mentally


---------103:51----------
check out from the thing we either avoid


---------103:53----------
the situation entirely we literally


---------103:55----------
don't go so we can physically check out


---------103:57----------
of the situation or what we'll do is


---------103:59----------
mentally check out of the situation so


---------104:01----------
we'll even go to the place but we'll


---------104:03----------
devalue something in in my mind so that


---------104:06----------
it doesn't i don't have to be hurt by it


---------104:08----------
right so i kind of go afk in a situation


---------104:12----------
that's absolutely a tactic


---------104:14----------
used to overcome my disordered emotions


---------104:18----------
to begin with it's a coping mechanism so


---------104:20----------
healthier than that is suppression where


---------104:22----------
at least i feel the emotion but i push


---------104:24----------
it down so there's internal conflict


---------104:26----------
versus mentally checking out and then


---------104:28----------
the third and healthiest thing is


---------104:29----------
reappraisal which is when i kind of work


---------104:31----------
through the emotion and i end up like


---------104:32----------
looking at the silver lining or


---------104:34----------
realizing that okay even though i got


---------104:36----------
you know even though my partner dumped


---------104:38----------
me like in the grand scheme of things


---------104:39----------
like there are other people out there i


---------104:41----------
learned a lot from the relationship i'm


---------104:42----------
gonna know better what mistakes not to


---------104:44----------
make next time that's an example of


---------104:45----------
reappraisal so we can see how apathy to


---------104:48----------
success absolutely falls into that


---------104:50----------
avoidance category


---------104:52----------
as a coping strategy against your


---------104:54----------
difficult emotional regulation which we


---------104:56----------
once again know that people with adhd


---------104:58----------
have


---------104:59----------
so that's consistent apathetic with


---------105:01----------
success the last thing that i'll mention


---------105:03----------
which is a little bit different which is


---------105:04----------
a little bit more from the yogic


---------105:06----------
perspective or the eastern perspective


---------105:10----------
is when you're a child with adhd


---------105:12----------
and it's hard for you to succeed because


---------105:15----------
you have certain


---------105:16----------
neuro


---------105:17----------
neurological disadvantages in terms of


---------105:19----------
like attention and things like that


---------105:23----------
one of the things that you have to learn


---------105:25----------
how to do


---------105:27----------
is


---------105:28----------
divorce yourself from success


---------105:30----------
and this is a protective mechanism so i


---------105:32----------
want you to put yourself in the shoes of


---------105:34----------
like a 12 year old who has difficulty


---------105:37----------
studying


---------105:38----------
and so if i have difficulty studying and


---------105:40----------
i'm afraid i'm going to do bad on the


---------105:41----------
test


---------105:42----------
what i have to learn how to do is numb


---------105:44----------
myself right because if i've been if i'm


---------105:47----------
invested in success and i have adhd and


---------105:51----------
then i go and fail the test i get


---------105:52----------
punished right because i wanted to


---------105:54----------
succeed i wanted to succeed i wanted to


---------105:56----------
succeed and so i i try really hard and


---------105:59----------
then i end up failing anyway because i


---------106:00----------
have adhd it's not my fault i spent


---------106:02----------
eight hours in front of a book but my


---------106:03----------
brain wouldn't focus and so that hurts


---------106:06----------
so much so what do i learn how to do i


---------106:08----------
become psychologically calloused


---------106:10----------
i learn how to numb myself i learn how


---------106:13----------
to be apathetic to my success because


---------106:15----------
the cool thing is that if i become


---------106:17----------
apathetic to my success


---------106:19----------
i also in a sense become apathetic to my


---------106:22----------
failure right because if i divorce


---------106:24----------
myself it's like ah i don't care about


---------106:26----------
the test whatever whether i succeed or


---------106:27----------
fail whatever


---------106:28----------
and so it sort of becomes a short-term


---------106:30----------
coping strategy which doesn't really


---------106:32----------
work because as you kind of mentioned


---------106:34----------
you do still obsess over your failures


---------106:35----------
right but that's because your brain is


---------106:37----------
vulnerable to the negative emotion so


---------106:39----------
despite the fact that you're numbing


---------106:40----------
yourself to the success and the failure


---------106:43----------
if you've got a brain that's more


---------106:45----------
vulnerable to the negative emotion what


---------106:47----------
you kind of end up with is i'm numbing


---------106:49----------
both equally but i'm hypersensitive due


---------106:52----------
to my small volume of insulin amygdala


---------106:55----------
to the failure so even though i'm


---------106:57----------
numbing both equally


---------106:58----------
i have an amplification of the negative


---------107:00----------
emotion due to the way that my my limbic


---------107:02----------
system is wired right and so that's sort


---------107:04----------
of like it's it's like actually a


---------107:06----------
perfect example of everything that we


---------107:08----------
understand from neuroscience everything


---------107:09----------
that we understand from development why


---------107:11----------
people with adhd are apathetic to their


---------107:13----------
successes


---------107:14----------
and obsess over their failures


---------107:18----------
and hopefully if you watch that whole


---------107:19----------
lecture you'll be able to follow that


---------107:21----------
you'll be able to arrive at that


---------107:22----------
conclusion as well


---------107:27----------
there are so people are asking about


---------107:29----------
gender differences between male and


---------107:30----------
female adhd


---------107:34----------
so the biggest difference is that men


---------107:36----------
seem to be more vulnerable to adhd than


---------107:39----------
women i don't have the exact statistics


---------107:42----------
but i think some of that also has to do


---------107:43----------
with maturation of the frontal lobe so


---------107:46----------
uh girls tend to have slightly more


---------107:48----------
mature frontal lobes than boys do so at


---------107:51----------
the end when everyone's fully grown it


---------107:53----------
all evens out but generally speaking


---------107:55----------
like sometimes girls will have you know


---------107:57----------
we'll have like be like developmentally


---------107:59----------
one to two years


---------108:01----------
or boys will be like one to two years


---------108:03----------
behind or girls will be like one to two


---------108:04----------
years ahead so that's pretty common a


---------108:06----------
lot of that has to do with frontal lobes


---------108:08----------
and adhd does appear to be more common


---------108:09----------
in men than women


---------108:12----------
um


---------108:18----------
would you argue oh man it's so hard


---------108:20----------
because everything i say you guys that's


---------108:22----------
so i'm like responding to questions from


---------108:23----------
like 10 minutes ago or comments which is


---------108:26----------
hard i have to figure out how to handle


---------108:27----------
that


---------108:29----------
would you argue that adults teenagers


---------108:31----------
these days have a harder time to cope


---------108:33----------
with adhd due to technology


---------108:35----------
because the human brain wasn't prepared


---------108:37----------
for the advancement compared to older


---------108:39----------
generations absolutely


---------108:41----------
so


---------108:43----------
you know if we look at older generations


---------108:45----------
oftentimes like


---------108:47----------
i don't mean to speak poorly of them but


---------108:49----------
like the boomer generation right which


---------108:51----------
it's not all boomers but some of them


---------108:53----------
tend to be very


---------108:57----------
not sympathetic


---------108:59----------
towards the mental health plights of


---------109:01----------
like the digital generation right so the


---------109:04----------
pre-digital generation is like i don't


---------109:06----------
understand why y'all are all so messed


---------109:07----------
up back in my day i had to walk 10 miles


---------109:10----------
through the snow


---------109:11----------
to get


---------109:12----------
to get a


---------109:15----------
glass of milk or whatever right they'll


---------109:17----------
like they'll look at their world and


---------109:19----------
then compare their world to our world


---------109:21----------
and when they look at the when they


---------109:22----------
compare their world to our world what


---------109:24----------
they'll do is they'll look at a lot of


---------109:26----------
the advantages that we have now which


---------109:28----------
they didn't have back then which are


---------109:29----------
fair right so for example like


---------109:32----------
food security i'm pretty sure is better


---------109:34----------
now than it was a hundred years ago you


---------109:36----------
know infant mortality is better now than


---------109:38----------
it was a hundred years ago um you know


---------109:40----------
the likelihood of like dying from


---------109:42----------
cholera is like way better now than it


---------109:45----------
was a hundred years ago


---------109:47----------
um you know


---------109:49----------
we have society has advanced society has


---------109:51----------
become more convenient you used to have


---------109:53----------
to go to a restaurant if you wanted to


---------109:55----------
eat food at a restaurant like from a


---------109:58----------
restaurant right now we have a bunch of


---------109:59----------
people that deliver you can get


---------110:01----------
groceries delivered you can get food


---------110:03----------
delivered you can get all kinds of stuff


---------110:05----------
delivered you can go to school online


---------110:07----------
our life has a bunch of convenience


---------110:10----------
right so there used to be a certain kind


---------110:11----------
of hardship


---------110:13----------
100 years ago that we don't experience


---------110:15----------
there are objective you know


---------110:17----------
life has gotten by a lot of objective


---------110:19----------
measures like mortality and life


---------110:20----------
expectancy and things like that better


---------110:22----------
than it was a hundred years ago


---------110:24----------
so you know the pre-digital generation


---------110:27----------
looks at us and they say things are so


---------110:29----------
much better and they point to all these


---------110:30----------
things and they say like why are you so


---------110:33----------
mentally unhealthy like why do you have


---------110:34----------
adhd why can't you just study why are


---------110:37----------
you depressed why do you have anxiety


---------110:39----------
i think things that i think the things


---------110:41----------
that they don't look at they take some


---------110:43----------
things for granted because they really


---------110:44----------
don't have any awareness of like what


---------110:46----------
it's like to grow up in these conditions


---------110:48----------
right so they see the change they see


---------110:50----------
some changes which are very external


---------110:53----------
but what the pre-digital generation


---------110:54----------
doesn't understand is like the internal


---------110:56----------
stresses that growing up


---------110:58----------
in this digital world sends us


---------111:01----------
so adhd is a good example of like if we


---------111:03----------
look at content right like first there


---------111:05----------
was youtube and sorry if i'm like


---------111:07----------
historically inaccurate


---------111:09----------
then there was twitch and if we kind of


---------111:10----------
look at the dynamic-ness of content like


---------111:12----------
youtube used to be like you know still


---------111:14----------
like it's a storehouse of content you


---------111:16----------
kind of pick what you watch you're not


---------111:17----------
missing anything because it's to be up


---------111:19----------
there forever and then we that sort of


---------111:20----------
evolves into twitch right


---------111:23----------
and like twitch is like more interactive


---------111:25----------
it's more temporary so you got to kind


---------111:26----------
of be there it's a little bit more adhd


---------111:28----------
and then like that evolves into tick


---------111:30----------
tock which is like the whole point of


---------111:31----------
tick tock is that it's super short right


---------111:33----------
we also have evolutions from text


---------111:35----------
messaging to things like snapchat and


---------111:37----------
i'm still not 100 sure about this but my


---------111:38----------
understanding about about snapchat is


---------111:40----------
that it's it's like you know the whole


---------111:42----------
idea is that the messages are temporary


---------111:44----------
so if you don't check it frequently like


---------111:45----------
it disappears into the ether so if we


---------111:48----------
look at the way that technology is


---------111:50----------
advancing it's selecting for and


---------111:53----------
entraining conditioning a shorter


---------111:55----------
attention span


---------111:57----------
and so that's why it's one of the


---------111:58----------
reasons why i think that adhd is getting


---------112:00----------
worse


---------112:01----------
but technology is also having effects on


---------112:03----------
things like depression and anxiety so


---------112:05----------
when we get bombarded with the worst


---------112:07----------
news from all over the world every


---------112:09----------
single day


---------112:10----------
we begin to see the world as falling


---------112:12----------
apart as we see the world as falling


---------112:15----------
apart we start to feel depressed and


---------112:17----------
hopeless because how can i fix climate


---------112:20----------
change i can't


---------112:21----------
might as well sit at home and do nothing


---------112:24----------
right how can i fix


---------112:26----------
all of this like you know


---------112:27----------
racial hatred i can't might as well sit


---------112:30----------
down and do nothing


---------112:31----------
you know how can i fix all of these like


---------112:34----------
income inequality like i can't fix it


---------112:36----------
i'm powerless so when you like when you


---------112:38----------
get bombarded with this sensory


---------112:40----------
information and you feel powerless and


---------112:42----------
then like the internet gives you this


---------112:44----------
sweet sweet tick tock right it's like


---------112:46----------
don't don't worry man it's okay like


---------112:47----------
don't worry about climate change here


---------112:49----------
watch this tick talk about climate


---------112:50----------
change which will like engage your


---------112:52----------
emotions and make you feel


---------112:53----------
self-righteous and will help you feel


---------112:54----------
better and after you watch that tick


---------112:56----------
tock about climate change why don't you


---------112:58----------
check this one about check out this one


---------112:59----------
about cats because cats are hilarious


---------113:01----------
don't you love cats


---------113:03----------
and so that's what happens right we have


---------113:04----------
like this this world that bombards us


---------113:06----------
with all this depressing information and


---------113:08----------
then it gives us like it creates this


---------113:11----------
problem and then it gives us this


---------113:12----------
solution


---------113:13----------
and we take the solution our brain loves


---------113:16----------
the solution and then we end up trapped


---------113:17----------
in this cycle


---------113:19----------
of like you know being emotionally like


---------113:22----------
pulled around like a like a puppet on on


---------113:24----------
strings and we get like emotionally like


---------113:28----------
existentially depressed and then we get


---------113:30----------
like coping strategies but that's not


---------113:33----------
even a coping strategy it's an addiction


---------113:34----------
really


---------113:35----------
it's like we'll fix that for you oh like


---------113:37----------
you're in withdrawal from heroin like


---------113:38----------
here have some more heroin that's


---------113:40----------
essentially what like is happening in


---------113:42----------
the in on the internet right now is that


---------113:44----------
it's like addicting us to heroin by


---------113:46----------
giving us all this negative emotion and


---------113:48----------
then it's like here i've got the


---------113:49----------
solution for you right here


---------113:51----------
right it's and so like yeah i think that


---------113:54----------
this is a societal thing it's a


---------113:55----------
technological thing in the pre-digital


---------113:57----------
generation i don't think understands


---------113:58----------
that


---------114:02----------
right and so this is even funny we even


---------114:04----------
have a word for it right so like the


---------114:06----------
internet has collectively realized


---------114:09----------
that this is going on so we developed


---------114:11----------
our own language of copium that's like


---------114:15----------
literally like we put we created a word


---------114:17----------
to describe this phenomenon


---------114:19----------
because it's happening and it's so


---------114:21----------
prevalent it's crazy


---------114:27----------
right


---------114:30----------
like even look at the icon like look at


---------114:32----------
this picture


---------114:33----------
of this pepe with his eyes closed who's


---------114:36----------
got he can't even


---------114:38----------
you guys understand he's got a mask on


---------114:40----------
because he can't even bring himself to


---------114:42----------
hold it to his face he is so afk from


---------114:45----------
the world that it needs to be strapped


---------114:47----------
onto him in order for him to get that


---------114:49----------
copium


---------114:50----------
he can't even be bothered to get get up


---------114:53----------
out of his chair and like walk over to


---------114:55----------
the copium machine and like take a hit


---------114:57----------
of copia


---------114:58----------
he just sticks it on he can't even keep


---------115:00----------
his eyes just gotta afk completely


---------115:04----------
you guys get that it's like actually


---------115:05----------
like in the image


---------115:14----------
i mean it's it's a beautiful image like


---------115:16----------
art is like a fantastic way to capture


---------115:20----------
what is happening in society


---------115:23----------
right so you guys think that like i'm


---------115:24----------
good at analyzing society in psychology


---------115:26----------
but like i'm a fraction of what a


---------115:28----------
brilliant artist is capable of


---------115:30----------
because here i am i've been lecturing


---------115:31----------
now for the better part of it's two


---------115:33----------
hours holy


---------115:35----------
and an artist will capture it like this


---------115:37----------
whoever made this


---------115:38----------
captured it in like 300 pixels


---------115:42----------
it's brilliant


---------115:48----------
right they've taken pepe


---------115:50----------
and they've just given pepe different


---------115:52----------
facial expressions


---------115:53----------
and they've encapsulated so much it's


---------115:55----------
also interesting because you know


---------115:57----------
i remember learning in history class


---------115:59----------
that hieroglyphics were a primitive


---------116:01----------
language and that the alphabet is a


---------116:03----------
superior language right because the


---------116:05----------
alphabet allows us to you know construct


---------116:08----------
words and things like that you only need


---------116:09----------
to learn 26 characters


---------116:11----------
and now it's like we've like swung


---------116:13----------
through alphabet and into emojis and so


---------116:16----------
we've come full circle back to


---------116:17----------
hieroglyphics


---------116:19----------
where now like people don't even


---------116:20----------
communicate and once again it was like


---------116:22----------
writing letters


---------116:24----------
used to be inferior to having a phone


---------116:26----------
call and now we've come full circle and


---------116:28----------
we're like back to texting is our


---------116:30----------
primary form of communication


---------116:32----------
and it's like we're coming full circle


---------116:34----------
and they've understood this in in like


---------116:36----------
east asia for a long time right so they


---------116:37----------
have like chinese characters and kanji


---------116:39----------
which are essentially like hieroglyphics


---------116:41----------
and so it's just interesting that a lot


---------116:43----------
of you know a lot of our understanding


---------116:45----------
of like language was like actually kind


---------116:47----------
of eurocentric


---------116:48----------
in terms of its you know a value system


---------116:50----------
that i don't think was actually accurate


---------117:02----------
you
