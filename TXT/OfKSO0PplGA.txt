---------00:00----------
so if we think about if we think about


---------00:02----------
our behaviors


---------00:04----------
we tend to focus on fixing a particular


---------00:07----------
behavior right we're like oh i


---------00:08----------
like i buy too many things and like


---------00:10----------
micro transactions and


---------00:11----------
and i spend too much money i'm impulsive


---------00:14----------
but i think if we really tunnel down


---------00:15----------
into our behaviors what we find is that


---------00:17----------
they're like


---------00:18----------
deep rooted psychological


---------00:21----------
issues or even like a sense of identity


---------00:24----------
there are things within us


---------00:25----------
that actually drive our behavior and a


---------00:28----------
lot of times we focus on the external


---------00:30----------
behavior and instead what we need to do


---------00:32----------
is


---------00:32----------
look at the internal roots of where that


---------00:35----------
behavior comes from


---------00:36----------
and if i had to say one thing about


---------00:37----------
today's interview it's that


---------00:39----------
that's what this interview illustrates


---------00:41----------
and that oftentimes if you want to work


---------00:43----------
on a particular thing


---------00:45----------
about yourself be open-minded and follow


---------00:48----------
where the road leads you because you'll


---------00:50----------
end up


---------00:50----------
finding something that's really


---------00:52----------
worthwhile


---------00:54----------
hi youtube


---------00:58----------
hey hey poggers how you doing


---------01:01----------
the rich lord i'm so excited to be


---------01:04----------
talking with you i think i have the


---------01:06----------
right


---------01:06----------
microphone and the right camera is my


---------01:09----------
mic sound all right


---------01:11----------
uh i think so all right cool cool


---------01:14----------
let me just check yeah i think it sounds


---------01:16----------
good um and so what do you what do you


---------01:18----------
go by


---------01:19----------
uh you just call me rich yeah okay yeah


---------01:22----------
yeah


---------01:22----------
welcome rich yeah i'm really excited to


---------01:25----------
be here you know i'm from new york so


---------01:26----------
talking to somebody from boston it's not


---------01:28----------
something i do very often


---------01:31----------
that makes sense i'm in texas now if


---------01:33----------
that makes a difference but


---------01:34----------
that makes a huge difference yeah way


---------01:36----------
more now yeah it's interesting so i was


---------01:38----------
i've always been a texan


---------01:40----------
um even in boston you know i use the


---------01:42----------
y'all which is usually the main sign


---------01:44----------
that i'm from texas


---------01:46----------
wait people are saying that i'm using


---------01:47----------
the wrong mic here give me one sec


---------01:51----------
that might be better oh my god that's so


---------01:53----------
much better yeah yeah my bad


---------01:56----------
oh i think he's hold on


---------01:59----------
he switched oh yep nice my bad yeah


---------02:03----------
my bad i've been running around all day


---------02:06----------
trying to get stuff fixed with my phone


---------02:08----------
so i think it might have actually been


---------02:09----------
using


---------02:10----------
like a mobile mic or something but oh my


---------02:12----------
god right now yeah


---------02:14----------
yeah so rich um you want to just tell us


---------02:17----------
a little bit about yourself and maybe


---------02:19----------
um you know what you want to talk about


---------02:20----------
today yeah


---------02:22----------
so i'm a relatively


---------02:25----------
i'm an extremely impulsive person i


---------02:28----------
think i'll start there


---------02:29----------
and uh even the way that i contacted you


---------02:32----------
was


---------02:32----------
extremely impulsive and i think that


---------02:35----------
i've been uh


---------02:36----------
pretty fortunate that a lot of my


---------02:40----------
a lot of my uh habits which could be


---------02:44----------
things that would lead to problems have


---------02:46----------
never actually led to the terrible


---------02:48----------
conclusion that they could lead to


---------02:50----------
but i think acknowledging some of them


---------02:51----------
early would definitely be good


---------02:53----------
that's not to say that i haven't had


---------02:55----------
problems with money in the past i


---------02:56----------
definitely had which is probably the way


---------02:58----------
the reason that i am the way that i am


---------03:00----------
uh but i yeah i figured i would just


---------03:02----------
talk to you


---------03:03----------
about it and kind of see what you had to


---------03:05----------
say


---------03:06----------
i uh i will spend large amounts of money


---------03:10----------
in in binge shopping trips and


---------03:13----------
uh things like that and i think that uh


---------03:16----------
my chat likes to joke around about


---------03:18----------
the the pokemon cards which i actually


---------03:20----------
don't think was bad


---------03:21----------
uh i think the gentian impact thing is


---------03:24----------
probably a lot worse


---------03:25----------
like and that's why after the tweet i


---------03:27----------
was like i'm gonna say it's less of a


---------03:29----------
gambling thing


---------03:30----------
and more of a micro transaction thing


---------03:32----------
because the fomo from the micro


---------03:34----------
transaction games


---------03:35----------
actually works on like even if i don't


---------03:37----------
play or plan to play


---------03:39----------
a game sometimes i will see micro


---------03:41----------
transactions and i'll be like oh my god


---------03:43----------
they're going away i need to buy them


---------03:44----------
because what if i need them later


---------03:46----------
which is probably pretty bad like i have


---------03:49----------
overwatch skins and i've never played


---------03:50----------
overwatch before


---------03:52----------
interesting i did work at blizzard at


---------03:54----------
the time though so i i think that uncle


---------03:56----------
bobby paid for it


---------03:57----------
but that i definitely injected some of


---------04:00----------
my own cash as well


---------04:01----------
so yeah the fomo from microtransaction


---------04:03----------
games definitely works as well and then


---------04:04----------
there


---------04:04----------
there's a host of other things that i've


---------04:06----------
always wanted to talk to you about


---------04:08----------
uh i think that there was a clip a long


---------04:10----------
time ago when people were like hey


---------04:12----------
rich should probably talk to dr k and i


---------04:15----------
was like


---------04:16----------
yeah yeah probably so i figured i would


---------04:19----------
kind of talk to you about


---------04:20----------
everything yeah so what what else


---------04:23----------
so you said there are a lot of things so


---------04:24----------
i'm hearing stuff about


---------04:26----------
impulsivity binge shopping fomo maybe


---------04:29----------
that


---------04:30----------
you have certain habits or predilections


---------04:32----------
that could end up


---------04:33----------
really bad but somehow you've managed to


---------04:35----------
escape through danger


---------04:36----------
yeah yeah um i definitely have authority


---------04:39----------
issues


---------04:40----------
uh that that's actually probably a


---------04:42----------
really big thing and


---------04:43----------
that's also probably why uh


---------04:47----------
i i've done so well with projects where


---------04:50----------
i


---------04:51----------
am in charge or i'm working with one


---------04:52----------
other person who i really respect


---------04:54----------
uh some people in chat probably know me


---------04:56----------
as asmongold's friend i


---------04:58----------
i loved when you you chatted with him as


---------05:00----------
well that was also one of the big


---------05:01----------
reasons that i wanted to


---------05:02----------
to talk to you but asman's somebody who


---------05:05----------
you know i've


---------05:06----------
trusted for years so it's really easy


---------05:08----------
for me to work with him and also


---------05:10----------
asmin lets me


---------05:14----------
control a lot of the things that we work


---------05:15----------
on together to like a crazy degree


---------05:18----------
which i think help is just beneficial


---------05:20----------
for me


---------05:21----------
uh and then also with otk you know i


---------05:24----------
work with uh i work with tips very


---------05:25----------
closely


---------05:26----------
it's another person i respect right but


---------05:27----------
it's like that if there's somebody who


---------05:29----------
i'm actually answering to


---------05:31----------
i don't do very well and i will


---------05:33----------
purposefully do things to


---------05:35----------
like assert dominance i think


---------05:39----------
i i don't know it doesn't feel like that


---------05:40----------
when i do it but i definitely think that


---------05:43----------
i probably have authority issues um and


---------05:46----------
so


---------05:47----------
i you know rich i i think first of all


---------05:49----------
like wow dude like


---------05:50----------
i think you're just an awesome blend of


---------05:53----------
authentic and also insightful like


---------05:55----------
you seem to recognize uh either


---------05:58----------
instinctively like


---------05:59----------
even when you're talking about the fomo


---------06:01----------
you kind of recognize


---------06:02----------
and notice the thought process that


---------06:04----------
leads to the behavior


---------06:06----------
which i think is a huge step in the


---------06:08----------
right direction


---------06:10----------
i'm good at understanding where a lot of


---------06:13----------
the problems come from as well


---------06:14----------
but that doesn't necessarily mean i try


---------06:16----------
to fix them uh sometimes like sometimes


---------06:18----------
i outright don't try to fix them


---------06:20----------
because i feel like they make stuff more


---------06:21----------
interesting which is a bad habit from a


---------06:23----------
long time ago


---------06:24----------
uh so i actually i went to nyu


---------06:27----------
and i started off and i was uh pre-med


---------06:31----------
and i wanted to major in psychology and


---------06:33----------
oh good god


---------06:34----------
uh yeah yeah so i'm the worst and then


---------06:37----------
uh after that i had a


---------06:40----------
i basically had a pre-rack for creative


---------06:43----------
writing


---------06:44----------
and it went really well and people were


---------06:46----------
really digging some of the stuff that i


---------06:48----------
was writing and i was like wow this is


---------06:49----------
getting me so much more attention


---------06:51----------
which i love uh than anything i was


---------06:54----------
doing


---------06:55----------
in pre-med in the giant lecture halls


---------06:57----------
where you know kind of felt like


---------07:00----------
just a fish in a giant sea and


---------07:03----------
i i really enjoyed it and i was like wow


---------07:05----------
i'm [ __ ] up


---------07:06----------
which actually makes me a more


---------07:08----------
interesting person and i'm being way


---------07:10----------
more creative than other people


---------07:11----------
did that for a while ended up uh ended


---------07:14----------
up being homeless for a little bit which


---------07:16----------
wasn't really entirely my fault i know


---------07:18----------
that people are probably like oh my god


---------07:19----------
yeah wow he does have terrible money


---------07:21----------
problems


---------07:21----------
uh but yeah i ended up uh being homeless


---------07:24----------
uh kind of


---------07:25----------
in wake of you know the whole 2008


---------07:28----------
housing crisis


---------07:29----------
my family we lost our house and uh


---------07:33----------
that that kind of it was a whole series


---------07:36----------
of events where i ended up not being in


---------07:37----------
college for a year


---------07:39----------
and i didn't want to go back when my


---------07:40----------
family had just lost their house


---------07:42----------
so i just kept working in the city uh


---------07:45----------
doing this and that and that's kind of


---------07:47----------
always been my attitude it was just


---------07:49----------
always like you know as long as i'm


---------07:50----------
working as long as i'm getting some


---------07:51----------
money i'll always be able to keep my


---------07:52----------
head above water


---------07:53----------
and then when i came back in school i


---------07:55----------
was like you know what everything that i


---------07:56----------
was doing before


---------07:58----------
this happened was stupid and now i'm


---------08:00----------
just gonna do what i like


---------08:02----------
because you know life is short i'm gonna


---------08:04----------
do whatever i like the most


---------08:06----------
so i started i kept doing creative


---------08:07----------
writing stuff


---------08:09----------
but i started focusing on video games


---------08:11----------
and that was how i ended up


---------08:12----------
in kind of the station and life that i'm


---------08:15----------
at now


---------08:16----------
wow yeah rich that's quite a story bro


---------08:21----------
yeah yeah it's been a it's been a wild


---------08:24----------
ride and that's the thing i i've enjoyed


---------08:27----------
you know people i i'm always nervous to


---------08:28----------
say this and i've said it a few times


---------08:31----------
kind of maybe publicly even with asmin


---------08:34----------
uh where i've just been like yeah i kind


---------08:37----------
of


---------08:38----------
liked having money issues at times


---------08:41----------
it was almost a part of my identity and


---------08:44----------
uh


---------08:46----------
i liked feeling like i was winning even


---------08:48----------
though


---------08:49----------
the world wanted to kick me in the dick


---------08:51----------
and i


---------08:52----------
never lost and it felt really good uh


---------08:55----------
there were definitely moments where


---------08:57----------
i felt like i couldn't help my parents


---------08:59----------
which hurt


---------09:00----------
um but yeah i think that it's a part of


---------09:03----------
my identity and i think that's probably


---------09:04----------
one of the reasons that i treat money


---------09:06----------
the way that i do now


---------09:07----------
because uh how do you treat money the


---------09:10----------
way you do now


---------09:11----------
you've alluded to treating money like


---------09:13----------
almost like it's a relationship


---------09:15----------
yeah yeah i i love money and i also


---------09:19----------
treat it like it's flammable i


---------09:21----------
definitely


---------09:22----------
i definitely uh i


---------09:25----------
i i go through phases


---------09:30----------
i i think is a thing that i've my dad


---------09:32----------
always said when i was a kid even


---------09:34----------
like when i was a kid like i needed all


---------09:36----------
of the power rangers figurines right it


---------09:37----------
was the most important thing ever


---------09:39----------
and then i get to a feeling where i feel


---------09:41----------
like i've beaten it and then i never


---------09:43----------
think about it again


---------09:44----------
and um i think one of my advantages


---------09:48----------
do i am as a human being is probably


---------09:50----------
that as well like i'm mildly obsessive


---------09:52----------
so like i once i get into something


---------09:56----------
i'm gonna do it and i'm gonna beat it


---------09:58----------
and it's the most important thing


---------10:00----------
whether that's a game


---------10:01----------
whether that's a project like with otk


---------10:05----------
i will not uh


---------10:08----------
i will not like sleep you know


---------10:11----------
and you know i have friends who are also


---------10:13----------
like that as well you know


---------10:15----------
tips literally had his uh had his baby


---------10:18----------
and


---------10:19----------
we're on the we're on the phone call and


---------10:20----------
he's like yeah did you know that babies


---------10:22----------
like


---------10:22----------
need to like be burped and i was like no


---------10:25----------
that's crazy by the way did you see the


---------10:26----------
new merch uh


---------10:27----------
like we just never stopped working and i


---------10:30----------
definitely


---------10:30----------
surround myself with people like that


---------10:33----------
and uh


---------10:34----------
i'm very momentum-based rich can i ask


---------10:36----------
you a question


---------10:37----------
yeah what's the problem here i'm not


---------10:40----------
having any problems i feel like the big


---------10:43----------
problem


---------10:44----------
is the money uh so like i feel like


---------10:48----------
i don't pay attention to how much money


---------10:51----------
i'm spending


---------10:52----------
like at all and i have actively said


---------10:55----------
that i wanted to fix it but then i don't


---------10:57----------
right so like even with the micro


---------10:58----------
transactions like i feel like


---------11:01----------
i need them every time they come around


---------11:04----------
and


---------11:06----------
i buy them and i don't think about them


---------11:08----------
and i haven't run into the problem yet


---------11:09----------
but i definitely could


---------11:10----------
you know what i mean like i haven't run


---------11:11----------
into the part where i'm like


---------11:13----------
oh i don't have any money left but i


---------11:15----------
asked myself if i had no money


---------11:18----------
would i still try to spend all my money


---------11:20----------
on micro transactions


---------11:21----------
and things like that because even when i


---------11:23----------
had less money


---------11:24----------
like i have a giant sneaker collection


---------11:26----------
over there i was


---------11:28----------
i was living paycheck to paycheck and i


---------11:30----------
would still


---------11:31----------
spend the money on dumb [ __ ]


---------11:34----------
you know what i mean what what so help


---------11:36----------
me understand


---------11:37----------
i know this is going to sound like a


---------11:38----------
weird question but like what's the


---------11:39----------
problem with like collecting sneakers


---------11:41----------
and living


---------11:42----------
paycheck to paycheck uh


---------11:45----------
i like really don't ever want to be


---------11:49----------
homeless or poor again and i feel like i


---------11:52----------
spend money in a way where if all the


---------11:54----------
sudden streaming


---------11:56----------
didn't continue to be a thing for me


---------11:59----------
or if like some of these projects that i


---------12:01----------
work on didn't continue


---------12:03----------
to go the way that they they did i would


---------12:06----------
have


---------12:06----------
nothing instead of having something


---------12:08----------
saved up to


---------12:09----------
to rely on


---------12:13----------
okay so can i think for a second


---------12:17----------
yeah i'm gonna compose my thoughts


---------12:19----------
there's a lot here man


---------12:34----------
okay so we're going to talk a little bit


---------12:37----------
about money


---------12:38----------
but i want to just lay out like other


---------12:40----------
dimensions of things that i thought were


---------12:41----------
like really fascinating and i'd love to


---------12:43----------
talk to you about them because


---------12:45----------
it seems like you do have such a good


---------12:47----------
leg up on your own sense of


---------12:48----------
understanding and like your own history


---------12:50----------
i think it'd be awesome to explore any


---------12:52----------
of these things one is authority issues


---------12:54----------
and then there's also this element of


---------12:56----------
control that you kind of talked about


---------12:57----------
that like you seem to work well with


---------12:59----------
people that let you


---------13:00----------
stay in control that sometimes you don't


---------13:03----------
try to fix things


---------13:04----------
that like you sort of know that there's


---------13:05----------
a problem but that there's another part


---------13:07----------
of you that's sort of like no


---------13:08----------
actually we actually thrive on chaos


---------13:11----------
like that's the other thing that i'm


---------13:12----------
hearing from you


---------13:14----------
is that you know your your terrain of


---------13:16----------
choice that gives you advantages to all


---------13:18----------
of your stats is actually chaos it's not


---------13:20----------
order


---------13:21----------
yeah and and there's also like a lot


---------13:24----------
that we could explore about your history


---------13:26----------
and how it shapes you


---------13:28----------
and the last thought that i kind of had


---------13:30----------
was and you know this i think we should


---------13:31----------
talk about money but


---------13:33----------
we could definitely have a conversation


---------13:34----------
about ayurveda because boy are you a


---------13:36----------
classic vata pitta


---------13:38----------
and what i mean by that is that like so


---------13:40----------
ayurveda sort of believes that


---------13:43----------
you know not all human beings have the


---------13:44----------
same sort of psychology like


---------13:46----------
you know in western psychology we like


---------13:49----------
we treat it like a subject that is


---------13:51----------
monolithic that applies to everyone


---------13:53----------
but in ayurveda they sort of describe


---------13:55----------
people's minds


---------13:56----------
using the elements and you are like a


---------13:59----------
classic example of a vata pitta and what


---------14:01----------
avata pitta means


---------14:02----------
is like you're like a combination of


---------14:04----------
wind and fire where


---------14:06----------
you switch directions easily but once


---------14:09----------
you switch a direction


---------14:10----------
you're like very fiery in your approach


---------14:13----------
and you kind of follow through to


---------14:14----------
completeness


---------14:16----------
and then you kind of switch to the next


---------14:18----------
thing and then follow through to


---------14:19----------
completeness


---------14:20----------
and a lot of people will like actually


---------14:22----------
wish they were like you because a lot of


---------14:24----------
plain vatas will say like


---------14:26----------
oh i i like switch things all the time


---------14:29----------
but then i don't


---------14:30----------
follow it through and so oddly enough


---------14:32----------
you know they'll look at you with envy


---------14:34----------
and they'll say like i wish when my


---------14:36----------
mind wandered i at least followed it


---------14:38----------
through to completeness before i


---------14:40----------
switched again


---------14:42----------
and and so anyway and everyone sort of


---------14:43----------
envies doshas that aren't theirs but


---------14:45----------
there may be certain things you can do


---------14:47----------
ayurvedically to like


---------14:48----------
literally change your physiologic


---------14:51----------
environment that causes your mind


---------14:53----------
to fluctuate and also be so


---------14:58----------
like you're like a dog with something in


---------15:00----------
its teeth that doesn't let go


---------15:02----------
right like and and so there's there's an


---------15:05----------
ayurvedic discussion absolutely to be


---------15:07----------
had here


---------15:08----------
um but do people who fall into that


---------15:11----------
typically get


---------15:12----------
like ridiculously bored


---------15:15----------
and frustrated with it like i like i


---------15:18----------
things that even that are going well


---------15:20----------
once i feel like i've


---------15:22----------
like i so i used to host esports and uh


---------15:25----------
everything was going really well like i


---------15:27----------
was i felt like i had


---------15:29----------
kind of reached my peak like i was doing


---------15:31----------
like a really good job


---------15:32----------
and then because i was doing well i was


---------15:33----------
like all right time to start over


---------15:35----------
when when i probably would have been


---------15:36----------
more comfortable in


---------15:38----------
a traditional sense if i i didn't do


---------15:40----------
that


---------15:42----------
yeah so that's a really good point right


---------15:43----------
so this goes back to like


---------15:45----------
you thrive on chaos yeah right so it's


---------15:48----------
sort of like i


---------15:49----------
you know there's this book that i read


---------15:51----------
many years ago called taipan by this guy


---------15:53----------
named james clavell it's a pretty cool


---------15:55----------
book


---------15:55----------
but there's this kind of one part in the


---------15:57----------
book where there's a captain who's on


---------15:59----------
the deck of his ship


---------16:00----------
and there's like a like there's a


---------16:02----------
typhoon and so the captain is sort of


---------16:04----------
like


---------16:06----------
like he kind of thinks a lot about i may


---------16:08----------
be getting books mixed up here but


---------16:10----------
he thinks a lot about like why he keeps


---------16:12----------
on going out to sea like he


---------16:13----------
he's like he's successful he's made


---------16:15----------
enough trading voyages


---------16:17----------
he could like retire at home in england


---------16:20----------
but he just chooses to go like back out


---------16:22----------
into the ocean for these moments where


---------16:24----------
there's like


---------16:25----------
our hurricane that's like heading


---------16:27----------
towards him and it's like a life or


---------16:29----------
death situation where he feels alive and


---------16:31----------
it's just like


---------16:32----------
he can't just stay at home and like you


---------16:34----------
know


---------16:35----------
drink tea like he's got to be out here


---------16:37----------
in the world like facing danger


---------16:38----------
over and over and over again it's his


---------16:41----------
element


---------16:42----------
yeah it gets the blood pumping it's like


---------16:44----------
jack nicholson in the departed


---------16:46----------
right he already has all the money but


---------16:47----------
he yeah he ends


---------16:49----------
yeah yeah so so i i think you know we


---------16:52----------
can sort of look at


---------16:53----------
where the origins of that thriving on


---------16:55----------
chaos comes from we can kind of explore


---------16:57----------
that there may be a vatican


---------16:58----------
element there but i i think we're going


---------17:00----------
to touch on that if we actually talk


---------17:02----------
about money okay


---------17:04----------
so the way i'd like to anyway so here's


---------17:06----------
the thought so


---------17:07----------
the five or six topics is sort of you


---------17:09----------
know money


---------17:10----------
which i've got kind of another i can we


---------17:12----------
can dig into that i have like i want to


---------17:14----------
say something about that too which i


---------17:15----------
think could frame that discussion


---------17:16----------
authority issues why you don't try to


---------17:18----------
fix things thriving on chaos


---------17:20----------
your history and how it's shaped you or


---------17:22----------
ayurveda like what would you like to


---------17:24----------
start with


---------17:25----------
but i'm going to toss this out there so


---------17:27----------
i have a hypothesis that you are a slave


---------17:29----------
to your mind


---------17:31----------
yeah i think if we have to root


---------17:32----------
everything back to one problem it's that


---------17:34----------
you are a slave to your mind


---------17:36----------
yeah and this is a real issue because


---------17:38----------
like once your mind


---------17:40----------
starts thinking oh my god you're bald


---------17:43----------
the only way you can calm it down is to


---------17:45----------
feed it to give in


---------17:46----------
right to like order some medication on


---------17:48----------
the off the internet and then your mind


---------17:50----------
is like ah


---------17:51----------
and then like there are times where


---------17:53----------
you're like oh my god like your mind


---------17:55----------
tells you like oh we need overwatch


---------17:56----------
skins because what if we one day play


---------17:58----------
overwatch


---------17:58----------
and then you're like yes sir aye aye


---------18:01----------
captain


---------18:02----------
right and so your mind has these


---------18:04----------
thoughts and these impulses and this is


---------18:06----------
kind of tricky because like


---------18:07----------
i'm talking about your mind like it's in


---------18:09----------
the third person


---------18:11----------
but what i'm really hearing is that that


---------18:13----------
you know your mind says jump and then


---------18:14----------
you say how high


---------18:16----------
that your biggest authority issue is


---------18:18----------
that the problem with your authority


---------18:20----------
issues is that


---------18:21----------
you need to have some degree of defiance


---------18:23----------
when it comes to your own mind


---------18:26----------
and that giving into your mind calms it


---------18:28----------
down


---------18:29----------
like and that's that's what you've


---------18:31----------
learned how to do you're sort of like


---------18:32----------
you know


---------18:33----------
europe hitler invades poland and then


---------18:36----------
like what does europe do europe is like


---------18:38----------
oh


---------18:38----------
that's okay right so like we we just we


---------18:42----------
just let the beasts run


---------18:43----------
rampant and we just hope and every time


---------18:46----------
your mind tells you to do something


---------18:47----------
you're like


---------18:48----------
yes sir yeah i might


---------18:51----------
do this thing i would go a step further


---------18:54----------
even


---------18:54----------
like the second that i have a thought


---------18:56----------
too it's like


---------18:58----------
it's like okay jump how many different


---------19:00----------
ways could i jump what's each one going


---------19:02----------
to lead to


---------19:03----------
maybe i should jump this way because


---------19:04----------
that'll lead to more jumping in the


---------19:05----------
future and i think jumping is like


---------19:06----------
pretty rad activity


---------19:08----------
and every single thing i do i think out


---------19:10----------
like that


---------19:11----------
yep to the point that's like my favorite


---------19:13----------
thing to do in life


---------19:15----------
by far i think one of the reasons i i


---------19:17----------
play video games too


---------19:18----------
is because it is the it takes away


---------19:21----------
all of my real life problems it gives me


---------19:23----------
problems that i can easily beat


---------19:25----------
and i can laser focus in on it and it's


---------19:28----------
like meditation i'm gone i'm not


---------19:29----------
thinking about anything else


---------19:31----------
and then my other favorite activity is


---------19:33----------
like by far sleeping


---------19:35----------
and i every morning when i wake up uh i


---------19:38----------
saw you post on instagram a thing about


---------19:39----------
attack on titan


---------19:41----------
uh so i feel like this example finally


---------19:43----------
somebody will understand it when i say


---------19:44----------
it


---------19:45----------
uh in season one when aaron


---------19:48----------
is like basically trapped in his own


---------19:51----------
head and he's under the blanket


---------19:53----------
and he's like i'll just sleep a little


---------19:54----------
bit longer and he


---------19:56----------
and armin's trying to get him out of it


---------19:58----------
and he just like can't


---------20:00----------
get aaron out of it i feel like that


---------20:01----------
every single morning when i wake up uh


---------20:03----------
even if there's somebody there trying to


---------20:04----------
wake me up


---------20:05----------
like i can't i can't wake up in the


---------20:06----------
morning and i think that it's because


---------20:08----------
my brain is finally uh quiet and so i


---------20:11----------
think that


---------20:12----------
that's one of the reasons i like


---------20:13----------
sleeping so what what happens to your


---------20:15----------
brain


---------20:16----------
when you purchase something with a


---------20:18----------
microtransaction


---------20:20----------
it's like [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] it's like


---------20:22----------
actually like that like it's like this


---------20:24----------
like


---------20:24----------
yeah [ __ ] them it's like it's really


---------20:27----------
aggressive like it feels


---------20:29----------
really good to spend money for me uh


---------20:31----------
even like losing money


---------20:33----------
feels good if like i gamble uh because


---------20:36----------
i'm like ha ha i can do that


---------20:39----------
uh at times yeah


---------20:43----------
okay yeah that sounds so dumb when i say


---------20:46----------
it like that but i don't know how else


---------20:47----------
to


---------20:48----------
decide so so let's let's try not to be


---------20:51----------
or it's fine to be judgmental but let's


---------20:53----------
not let our judgments dictate


---------20:55----------
our conversation yeah right so so when


---------20:57----------
you say


---------20:58----------
you know [ __ ] em


---------21:02----------
who who is the person doing the [ __ ]


---------21:07----------
i'm saying i am [ __ ] the world


---------21:10----------
back right and why is it important


---------21:14----------
why do you want to do that uh


---------21:18----------
because i i think


---------21:21----------
that if i really had to get down to it


---------21:25----------
i think that there's a level of proving


---------21:28----------
to myself that


---------21:30----------
i've beaten


---------21:33----------
the game already even though i probably


---------21:36----------
i know i haven't


---------21:38----------
um why do you feel like you need


---------21:41----------
why do you have to prove to yourself


---------21:42----------
that you've beaten the game


---------21:44----------
i i don't know but i i uh


---------21:48----------
because i feel like i already do know in


---------21:50----------
certain ways that i've already you know


---------21:54----------
done a lot yeah who has to prove that


---------21:57----------
they're a winner


---------22:00----------
people people who aren't usually


---------22:03----------
what are you um i


---------22:07----------
i think that uh i think that i've won


---------22:11----------
in a lot of things but i'm i definitely


---------22:13----------
don't feel like i'm done


---------22:15----------
but i've definitely i've definitely lost


---------22:18----------
i i i started completely losing


---------22:22----------
you know what i mean i grew up in


---------22:23----------
atlantic city i was poor as [ __ ]


---------22:26----------
out and you know i i


---------22:29----------
eat and that that wasn't the only time i


---------22:31----------
took a hit right


---------22:32----------
so i think that i still have that like


---------22:35----------
it's not even that i was losing it was


---------22:37----------
that the


---------22:37----------
the world was my enemy and it was like


---------22:41----------
you ever played yeah you ever play uh


---------22:45----------
you're playing like pandemic or a game


---------22:46----------
like that and you know


---------22:48----------
this the second that you flip over the


---------22:50----------
cards and it's like oh [ __ ]


---------22:52----------
like time to spread spread the virus i


---------22:53----------
felt like i was just flipping those


---------22:55----------
non-stop


---------22:55----------
and it wasn't there was stuff that was


---------22:57----------
out of my control and i know that it was


---------22:59----------
out of my control


---------23:00----------
and i would just try to keep changing


---------23:02----------
stuff


---------23:03----------
so yeah tell me about atlantic city


---------23:10----------
sucks uh i i grew up in


---------23:13----------
a town that was on the mainland


---------23:16----------
but it was uh it was kind of right in


---------23:18----------
between i was in like


---------23:20----------
i was in the most i'm trying to even


---------23:23----------
think about like what financial station


---------23:25----------
you would say people in my area were in


---------23:26----------
there was a really rich town next to me


---------23:29----------
and then there was like a really poor


---------23:30----------
town


---------23:31----------
and it very much felt like my my town


---------23:34----------
was in the middle


---------23:35----------
and it was like okay are you going to


---------23:38----------
kind of


---------23:38----------
be involved in the the shittier stuff


---------23:42----------
and the shadier stuff and and and deal


---------23:45----------
with that


---------23:46----------
uh or are you going to try to blend in


---------23:47----------
and pretend like you had money


---------23:50----------
uh and i wasn't particularly i think


---------23:52----------
most


---------23:53----------
really poor people will tell you this i


---------23:54----------
was so poor that i had no idea that i


---------23:56----------
was poor


---------23:57----------
uh and i thought that that was just how


---------23:59----------
the world worked


---------24:00----------
and it the people who were wealthier


---------24:03----------
didn't seem like they were


---------24:04----------
on a whole other realm of existence to


---------24:07----------
me


---------24:07----------
until i moved to new york and i was like


---------24:09----------
my my god


---------24:11----------
like these like this is sick that


---------24:16----------
what did you realize was help us


---------24:18----------
understand


---------24:19----------
like you know when you said like


---------24:22----------
there are different levels like what did


---------24:23----------
you realize and how did you grow up and


---------24:25----------
what did you realize wasn't maybe normal


---------24:28----------
um like i i'm trying to like even think


---------24:33----------
of


---------24:33----------
like the best way to say it because like


---------24:34----------
the moment when i like knew


---------24:37----------
like in new york at nyu obviously you're


---------24:40----------
around like a lot of people who are just


---------24:42----------
like


---------24:43----------
the top of the top like i have i had


---------24:45----------
moments where i was like


---------24:46----------
in these giant brownstones where i'm


---------24:49----------
looking at art that i had read about


---------24:50----------
and it's just like in their kitchen and


---------24:54----------
i'm like what the heck um and


---------24:57----------
i moments where you know a night of


---------24:59----------
drinking turned into me being on


---------25:01----------
my friend's private jet and i'm like


---------25:03----------
what the heck i rem


---------25:04----------
i would wear shoot when when i was a


---------25:06----------
freshman i bought


---------25:08----------
a pair of sneakers from flight club i


---------25:10----------
still have them


---------25:11----------
somewhere i wore them for a year


---------25:12----------
straight and they had an added feature


---------25:14----------
where every time it rained my feet got


---------25:16----------
to go swimming


---------25:17----------
and that was enough it was a cool pair


---------25:20----------
of shoes you know


---------25:21----------
and uh to think that people are just


---------25:24----------
wailing out on on art and things like


---------25:27----------
i don't know it just it changed my


---------25:29----------
perspective on a lot of things


---------25:31----------
and i don't know if it made me angry or


---------25:34----------
if it made me hungry or what it made me


---------25:36----------
i don't know i don't know i truly don't


---------25:39----------
know


---------25:39----------
how did your perspective change


---------25:42----------
felt bad for my mom and dad i wanted to


---------25:44----------
help them i think because i know i


---------25:46----------
knew some of the stuff they worry about


---------25:48----------
and my parents are


---------25:50----------
more stubborn than me which is hard uh


---------25:53----------
my mom and dad they work at a uh they go


---------25:55----------
to a flea mart i'm proud of them too i'm


---------25:57----------
not i'm very proud of them


---------25:59----------
and how hard they work but they go to a


---------26:00----------
they go to a flea market every weekend


---------26:02----------
and like sell makeup and dog toys and


---------26:06----------
i try to help and they they don't really


---------26:09----------
let me my sister actually does really


---------26:11----------
well too


---------26:12----------
uh like i i do i do good financially


---------26:14----------
like i'm pretty okay


---------26:16----------
uh besides my tendencies right uh but my


---------26:19----------
little sister you know she's


---------26:21----------
she's uh she's a little bit younger and


---------26:23----------
she's actually a producer


---------26:24----------
over at uh genius the music company uh


---------26:28----------
that like has like the song lyrics is so


---------26:31----------
pretty cool job she does well


---------26:32----------
and my parents just won't let us help uh


---------26:35----------
they're they're very stubborn


---------26:36----------
my my dad let me i'm trying to think how


---------26:40----------
long


---------26:40----------
ago it was but he let me give him like


---------26:43----------
uh


---------26:43----------
a decent amount of cash and every time i


---------26:46----------
talk to him


---------26:47----------
he's just like he's like yeah i can i


---------26:50----------
can pay back man


---------26:51----------
like kind of thing i'm like stop please


---------26:53----------
like just let me help


---------26:55----------
and yeah and at times i i don't even


---------26:58----------
i won't even call my parents as much


---------27:01----------
or see my parents because i'm almost uh


---------27:06----------
yeah i just feel like i could do more


---------27:08----------
and i don't know how


---------27:09----------
at times if they won't let me sure


---------27:13----------
yeah so i know this sounds kind of weird


---------27:17----------
rich but out of everything that you've


---------27:18----------
said this is the thing that i want to


---------27:19----------
talk about the most for a few minutes


---------27:22----------
yeah i almost want to like


---------27:25----------
coach you and how to talk to them yeah


---------27:28----------
how do you feel about that yeah yeah i i


---------27:31----------
i'd like that so what i'm hearing is


---------27:35----------
that


---------27:36----------
you know your parents are fiercely proud


---------27:38----------
fiercely independent


---------27:40----------
um but also like struggle and work


---------27:43----------
really hard for


---------27:44----------
like not a whole lot of gain yeah yeah


---------27:47----------
definitely


---------27:49----------
and and that you know by chance or grit


---------27:52----------
or some combination of the two you and


---------27:55----------
your sister have managed to


---------27:57----------
like you know become pretty financially


---------27:59----------
like secure at least more so than your


---------28:01----------
parents and


---------28:02----------
it sounds like you guys really did not


---------28:04----------
grow up with things being easy and i'm


---------28:06----------
guessing that your parents


---------28:07----------
did a lot and made a lot of sacrifices


---------28:09----------
to try to like help you guys


---------28:12----------
you know launch for lack of a better


---------28:15----------
term


---------28:16----------
yeah my parents did


---------28:19----------
everything with no regard for themselves


---------28:20----------
and just like everything for me and my


---------28:22----------
sister


---------28:23----------
like my my mom has always been that way


---------28:26----------
like uh


---------28:29----------
trying to get my mom to do something for


---------28:30----------
herself is very difficult and she


---------28:32----------
she's like the best parent on the face


---------28:34----------
of the earth


---------28:35----------
and my dad is very similar to me


---------28:40----------
where i think like that's where like a


---------28:41----------
lot of that uh


---------28:44----------
that like i'm gonna i'm gonna do


---------28:46----------
everything myself


---------28:47----------
uh side comes from maybe it's where i


---------28:50----------
got it from


---------28:52----------
uh i'm not 100 sure how that works right


---------28:55----------
um but yeah my dad's very similar to me


---------28:59----------
in that regard so i think that


---------29:00----------
there's probably a level of him enjoying


---------29:05----------
the the


---------29:08----------
struggle of it sure what does he enjoy


---------29:10----------
about it


---------29:12----------
uh well i i'm like potentially like just


---------29:16----------
projecting how i feel


---------29:17----------
uh right now but i've never really


---------29:19----------
thought about it this way


---------29:20----------
uh but yeah they're


---------29:25----------
yeah it's that feeling of like winning


---------29:26----------
right you know what you have to do and


---------29:28----------
you do it


---------29:29----------
and you keep your head above water and


---------29:32----------
and it feels good


---------29:33----------
so maybe he feels uh feels a similar way


---------29:37----------
yeah right yeah you don't need anyone's


---------29:39----------
help


---------29:40----------
yeah yeah you can do it on your own


---------29:45----------
yeah what's it like to get people's help


---------29:48----------
rachel rick


---------29:52----------
um


---------29:55----------
i i don't know i i'm like thinking of


---------29:58----------
like


---------29:59----------
i can't just take help usually


---------30:03----------
from like for no reason like uh


---------30:07----------
like uh even like on twitch right like


---------30:11----------
in


---------30:11----------
things that people see like um


---------30:14----------
i i don't like if i ever feel like


---------30:17----------
somebody's like helping my stream and i


---------30:19----------
haven't done something to warrant it it


---------30:21----------
bothers me


---------30:23----------
like what bothers you about that i feel


---------30:25----------
like i'm taking from uh


---------30:28----------
i feel like i'm taking from my friends


---------30:31----------
which i don't like um


---------30:34----------
yeah yeah i


---------30:38----------
yeah yeah i think i think taking help is


---------30:41----------
probably pretty hard for me


---------30:46----------
how do you understand what makes what


---------30:48----------
makes it hard how do you feel about


---------30:50----------
yourself when someone else helps you


---------30:54----------
uh


---------30:57----------
i'm trying to think of times when people


---------30:59----------
straight up helped me you know the thing


---------31:01----------
with um


---------31:02----------
you know most of the help that i would

---------31:55----------
yeah yeah what's it like to accept help


---------31:58----------
from people who


---------31:59----------

---------32:02----------
the last time i can remember doing that


---------32:07----------
is uh actually still my roommate now


---------32:10----------
today


---------32:11----------
uh right after


---------32:14----------
right after like um i'd been


---------32:18----------
homeless and i just gotten into a new


---------32:21----------
apartment


---------32:22----------
he started to live with us because he


---------32:24----------
knew one of my friends


---------32:25----------
and i didn't know him at all yet and i


---------32:28----------
needed a computer because i wanted to


---------32:29----------
start


---------32:30----------
um i need it for work and i wanted to


---------32:32----------
use it to


---------32:34----------
cast online tournaments and to try to


---------32:36----------
start streaming and he bought me a


---------32:37----------
computer for like two thousand dollars


---------32:39----------
and he barely knew me


---------32:40----------
and uh yeah now like


---------32:44----------
now i i haven't stopped living with him


---------32:46----------
for like six years and like i'll pay his


---------32:47----------
rent sometimes and [ __ ] like that


---------32:49----------
because i don't know he just did that


---------32:50----------
for me so i'll never


---------32:51----------
i'll never stop uh trying to try to


---------32:54----------
help him you know um so yeah


---------32:58----------
for him to do like something like that


---------33:00----------
for you


---------33:01----------
um i mean i just


---------33:04----------
basically said that you know if if he


---------33:07----------
ever needed


---------33:08----------
something i would always do it i didn't


---------33:09----------
feel guilty about it


---------33:11----------
uh i don't think but i basically was


---------33:14----------
just like yeah


---------33:15----------
like um after he did it i was just like


---------33:18----------
i


---------33:18----------
i owe him a lot i guess


---------33:22----------
yeah so i'm hearing you say you felt


---------33:25----------
indebted


---------33:27----------
yeah yeah yeah for sure you're paying


---------33:29----------
that debt back


---------33:31----------
it doesn't it doesn't feel like i'm like


---------33:34----------
like indentured to him but uh but there


---------33:37----------
is like


---------33:38----------
it's almost like a familial tie i guess


---------33:40----------
it feels like


---------33:41----------
yeah yeah i'm noticing


---------33:46----------
yeah so i think there's a certain


---------33:51----------
let me just think for a second


---------33:56----------
do you remember what you thought


---------33:59----------
about yourself


---------34:03----------
to be in a position where you needed his


---------34:05----------
help


---------34:06----------
or you couldn't get the computer on your


---------34:08----------
own


---------34:11----------
i felt like i might have been a very


---------34:13----------
different person at the time too


---------34:15----------
like when i'm even thinking back um


---------34:19----------
how are you different


---------34:23----------
um i was a lot angrier then


---------34:27----------
i i remember that um


---------34:30----------
i haven't remembered that in a while i


---------34:32----------
used to have really like a really bad


---------34:33----------
temper


---------34:34----------
um what would make you so angry


---------34:40----------
i don't know that's what i can't


---------34:42----------
remember like


---------34:43----------
um i think when i felt like people


---------34:47----------
weren't listening to me was probably


---------34:49----------
one of the things that made me the most


---------34:50----------
angry like uh


---------34:52----------
like if people didn't agree with me


---------34:54----------
after i like made an argument and like


---------34:56----------
was like wait i'm like 100


---------34:57----------
right like how are you not hearing what


---------35:00----------
i said


---------35:01----------
or or um sure yeah i think that was


---------35:03----------
probably one of the things that made me


---------35:04----------
the most angry


---------35:07----------
yeah i'm just kind of noticing that you


---------35:09----------
know you mentioned working with asthma


---------35:11----------
and gold and it seems like part of the


---------35:12----------
reason you can work with asthma gold is


---------35:14----------
because he lets you you know he listens


---------35:16----------
to your opinion respects you


---------35:19----------
yeah yeah 100 uh same with same with


---------35:21----------
everybody i work with


---------35:22----------
i do feel that way with everybody i work


---------35:24----------
with um even though like we'll disagree


---------35:26----------
right like


---------35:27----------
um i'll disagree with asthma and i'll


---------35:30----------
disagree with tips all the time


---------35:32----------
but uh i know i know they hear me


---------35:35----------
you know what i mean and i hear them and


---------35:37----------
you know i'll change my opinion


---------35:38----------
sometimes too like i'm not like the a


---------35:40----------
huge hardhead where it's my way or the


---------35:42----------
highway


---------35:44----------
but i definitely do feel like yeah i


---------35:48----------
i work with somebody who will hear both


---------35:51----------
sides like if i feel like i'm heard


---------35:53----------
i can have the conversation and change


---------35:55----------
my opinion and then i think where


---------35:56----------
i probably have the authority issues


---------35:58----------
where it's like they don't listen they


---------36:00----------
don't acknowledge the value of the other


---------36:02----------
opinion and then i'm like


---------36:03----------
ah sucks to suck we're doing it my way i


---------36:05----------
i do think that that is


---------36:07----------
probably um yeah


---------36:10----------
yeah yeah so i mean are there particular


---------36:13----------
times in your life where you felt like


---------36:15----------
really disrespected or like ashamed


---------36:20----------
um i'm trying to think of the time i


---------36:22----------
felt ashamed i i can't really think of


---------36:24----------
the time i've felt


---------36:25----------
super ashamed disrespected definitely uh


---------36:28----------
i i mean people mean without it but


---------36:29----------
definitely uh during the blizzard [ __ ]


---------36:31----------
i definitely felt uh what is the what is


---------36:34----------
the blizzard [ __ ]


---------36:35----------
i worked for uh so i when i started


---------36:38----------
working at mlg which i mentioned kind of


---------36:39----------
at the beginning of


---------36:40----------
us talking i um


---------36:44----------
i it ended up getting mlg got acquired


---------36:46----------
by activation blizzard so i worked at


---------36:48----------
activision blizzard


---------36:49----------
and i hosted and played by play casted


---------36:53----------
pretty much all of their esports events


---------36:54----------
i did uh call of duty


---------36:56----------
i did world of warcraft


---------36:59----------
other uh gigs that would come up i did


---------37:02----------
pretty like a lot for them


---------37:04----------
and uh yeah eventually i ended up


---------37:07----------
getting uh


---------37:08----------
if you were saying the ants and bobby


---------37:09----------
codex maze thing uh


---------37:11----------
yeah i i ended there was there was a


---------37:14----------
clip of me


---------37:15----------
there was there's one time that i've


---------37:17----------
lost my temper basically


---------37:19----------
uh while streaming there's one time that


---------37:22----------
i really lost my temper it was while


---------37:24----------
playing wow


---------37:25----------
and that that's actually the only time


---------37:26----------
that i've really lost my temper


---------37:28----------
and it was bad it was a bad lsf clip


---------37:31----------
uh but yeah that's pretty much the only


---------37:34----------
time i can remember losing my temper in


---------37:35----------
recent history and that was probably


---------37:36----------
like a year ago or something like that


---------37:38----------
um


---------37:40----------
can can you just hold on a second rich i


---------37:42----------
think i gotta reconnect the call because


---------37:44----------
you seem a touch out of sync


---------37:46----------
one second uh i actually think the out


---------37:48----------
of sync thing


---------37:50----------
might have been on my end because my


---------37:51----------
computer like locked up for a second


---------37:53----------
yeah um should should i just like leave


---------37:55----------
the call and come back in maybe


---------37:57----------
uh yeah hol um sure let's just


---------38:00----------
leave i'll leave the call and come back


---------38:02----------
in okay cool sounds good


---------38:07----------
is that better i think so yeah


---------38:10----------
so so hmm let me just try to get a


---------38:13----------
handle on this conversation for a second


---------38:15----------
yeah let me toss out a couple of things


---------38:17----------
okay so i'm gonna toss out sort of a


---------38:19----------
hypothesis you let me know like what


---------38:21----------
part of this


---------38:24----------
um yeah let me just let me just


---------38:28----------
sketch something out okay okay


---------38:54----------
yeah so like here's what i'm noticing


---------38:56----------
rich i i think like i mentioned earlier


---------38:58----------
you know


---------38:59----------
it seems to me that your core problem is


---------39:01----------
that you're a slave to your mind


---------39:03----------
and what i mean by that is that


---------39:04----------
sometimes you'll have like impulses


---------39:07----------
right and like the only way to like


---------39:09----------
satisfy that


---------39:11----------
the only way to quiet the impulse is


---------39:13----------
through satisfying it


---------39:15----------
right so it's like you can't tolerate


---------39:18----------
not


---------39:18----------
satisfying it there's also this sort of


---------39:21----------
idea


---------39:22----------
of i think somewhere along the way i


---------39:23----------
mean it sounds like you had a


---------39:24----------
challenging upbringing you know being


---------39:26----------
homeless and whatnot


---------39:27----------
sometimes that can really affect


---------39:29----------
people's identities


---------39:31----------
to be screwed over by the world and what


---------39:34----------
i'm sort of noticing is like in your


---------39:35----------
subconscious


---------39:36----------
there's a part of your mind that's like


---------39:38----------
keeping track of score


---------39:40----------
it's like there's like a grudge match


---------39:42----------
between you and the world


---------39:43----------
and here are all the ways in which the


---------39:45----------
world has screwed you and here are all


---------39:47----------
the ways where you've said okay world


---------39:48----------
you want to screw me like let's go [ __ ]


---------39:51----------
and then you come out on top i feel like


---------39:53----------
you're right and


---------39:54----------
so like you're fighting this like weird


---------39:57----------
cosmic battle against the universe


---------39:59----------
in which you like you want to come out


---------40:01----------
on top


---------40:02----------
and it feels so good to come out on top


---------40:07----------
and this is where like so then the


---------40:08----------
question is you know why do we feel


---------40:11----------
why does it feel so good to like come


---------40:13----------
out on top against the universe it's


---------40:15----------
sort of


---------40:16----------
and that's where sort of like i think


---------40:17----------
we're getting into some identities uh


---------40:19----------
issues of identity and why you need to


---------40:23----------
be a winner


---------40:24----------
and like you kind of said you know


---------40:26----------
people who need to prove


---------40:28----------
something are the ones that don't


---------40:30----------
believe it themselves


---------40:32----------
like i don't need to prove to anyone


---------40:33----------
that i'm indian


---------40:35----------
yeah like if people don't think i'm


---------40:38----------
indian like that's


---------40:39----------
totally fine like sometimes i get


---------40:41----------
mistaken as hispanic and like that's


---------40:43----------
cool you know like no big deal there are


---------40:46----------
things that sometimes i feel like i need


---------40:48----------
to prove to people


---------40:49----------
and the more that i've looked at like


---------40:52----------
you know if there's anything that you


---------40:53----------
feel like you need to prove to people


---------40:55----------
it's something that you need to


---------40:56----------
you tend to believe yourself and this is


---------41:00----------
where i can only imagine


---------41:01----------
all of the instances where life


---------41:05----------
tried to tell you that they're like


---------41:07----------
winners


---------41:08----------
and losers right there are people who


---------41:10----------
have homes and people who don't have


---------41:12----------
homes you grew up in this town where you


---------41:14----------
saw the losers over there


---------41:16----------
and the winners over here and it's like


---------41:17----------
which camp do i want to be in


---------41:20----------
yeah and then you like went to nyu where


---------41:22----------
you were like okay like


---------41:24----------
you thought you had figured everything


---------41:25----------
out and you were like okay i'm a pretty


---------41:26----------
decent human being my parents are legit


---------41:28----------
they're hard workers i can respect them


---------41:30----------
i can love them


---------41:31----------
and still this voice in the back of your


---------41:32----------
mind like you show up at your friend's


---------41:34----------
place and there's like this artwork in


---------41:35----------
the kitchen that you've only read about


---------41:36----------
you're like wait a minute


---------41:39----------
i thought i had this figured out but


---------41:40----------
like and then there's the private jets


---------41:42----------
and whatnot so as you kind of like


---------41:44----------
intermingle with these different people


---------41:46----------
like i get the sense that


---------41:48----------
on one level rich you're very very


---------41:50----------
confident in who you are it's clear to


---------41:52----------
me that like


---------41:53----------
you know you believe in what you do it's


---------41:55----------
clear to me that you're a caring person


---------41:57----------
it's clear to me that like you respect


---------41:59----------
your own work ethic as flawed as it is


---------42:02----------
um i think you can really say honestly


---------42:04----------
that you're someone that people can


---------42:06----------
count on


---------42:07----------
which i think is an awesome part of your


---------42:09----------
identity


---------42:10----------
like you know p you're reliable for


---------42:13----------
everyone else except for yourself


---------42:14----------
right so like if a friend needs you to


---------42:16----------
make a doctor's appointment you can make


---------42:18----------
it like that


---------42:19----------
but if you need to make your own


---------42:20----------
doctor's appointment uh


---------42:22----------
yeah you know and so i i'm getting a lot


---------42:25----------
of issues of really


---------42:26----------
identity and sort of like this idea that


---------42:28----------
like you need to win


---------42:30----------
which i think sort of tangles up with


---------42:32----------
these authority issues because i think


---------42:34----------
there are some relationships where


---------42:37----------
people


---------42:38----------
make you feel like they're trying to


---------42:42----------
disrespect you or like they're like


---------42:44----------
trying to push you back into the loser


---------42:46----------
category


---------42:46----------
and you're like i ain't having that like


---------42:49----------
there is no way that i'm going to let


---------42:51----------
you


---------42:52----------
push me back into the loser box because


---------42:54----------
that's not who i


---------42:56----------
am but that yeah go ahead


---------43:00----------
yeah i i feel like i um


---------43:04----------
any time that i'm trying to even think


---------43:07----------
how to


---------43:08----------
put it into words but like i feel like


---------43:11----------
there's


---------43:12----------
just this um any time that something


---------43:16----------
pushes back against my will


---------43:20----------
it it does feel like it's it's almost


---------43:23----------
war and that drives me and


---------43:26----------
i think that that's a lot of the reasons


---------43:28----------
that i'm able to do what i do


---------43:30----------
like the second that one thing doesn't


---------43:33----------
go my way it's like oh


---------43:34----------
i i will remember that and i am keeping


---------43:38----------
score


---------43:38----------
and i will balance the scale and i think


---------43:41----------
that that's something that's


---------43:42----------
always been a part of who i am


---------43:45----------
beautiful so now rich we get to the real


---------43:48----------
crux of the problem


---------43:50----------
which is that if you want to change you


---------43:52----------
have to give up something that works


---------43:54----------
really well for you yeah right


---------43:57----------
so so i think this is where like what


---------43:59----------
i'd say that that what i would


---------44:01----------
advocate for you and what i'd ask you to


---------44:03----------
think about


---------44:04----------
is i want you to think about your mind


---------44:06----------
is a group of like


---------44:08----------
horses pulling a chariot and the thing


---------44:11----------
is like when someone


---------44:13----------
you know takes like you know takes a cut


---------44:15----------
at you or disrespects you


---------44:17----------
those horses like take off or maybe we


---------44:20----------
should think about it more like a dog


---------44:21----------
sled where


---------44:22----------
like you know there's a group of dogs


---------44:23----------
and your mind is like is ready to throw


---------44:25----------
down it's gonna keep track


---------44:27----------
i think the problem though is that like


---------44:29----------
you can still what i'd really love to


---------44:31----------
start you on the path on is like taming


---------44:34----------
those dogs where like


---------44:35----------
you can still let them off the leash


---------44:38----------
right like you can still


---------44:39----------
access that scrappiness


---------44:42----------
that fight that gutsiness that drive to


---------44:45----------
succeed


---------44:46----------
that drive to prove other people wrong


---------44:48----------
but that


---------44:49----------
it doesn't drive you you control it


---------44:53----------
like the problem right now is you're the


---------44:54----------
one on the leash and the dog is the one


---------44:56----------
that's got like


---------44:57----------
you know the leash handle in its mouth


---------44:59----------
and it decides it's gonna


---------45:01----------
fly off the cuff whatever it feels like


---------45:04----------
and so it's a really powerful thing to


---------45:05----------
like


---------45:06----------
you know to have this sort of like i'm


---------45:09----------
going to prove the world


---------45:10----------
wrong and i'm going to stay up until 4am


---------45:12----------
and make sure


---------45:13----------
everything is done right to get to where


---------45:15----------
i need to go but the problem is like


---------45:17----------
that's wonderful


---------45:18----------
the issue is like who's in the driver's


---------45:20----------
seat


---------45:22----------
yeah yeah it's funny the second that you


---------45:24----------
even like


---------45:25----------
talk about changing or anything like


---------45:28----------
that


---------45:29----------
like instant resistance like i like like


---------45:32----------
it's not like uh


---------45:33----------
it's not like i'm gonna like freak out


---------45:35----------
uh and get mad but it's like a faint


---------45:37----------
like what


---------45:38----------
like no i why would i yeah it's just


---------45:41----------
like in the back of my mind like the


---------45:42----------
bottom of the stomach almost just like a


---------45:44----------
yeah rich so let's let's bring it to the


---------45:47----------
forefront right


---------45:48----------
so help me understand what that voice is


---------45:51----------
saying


---------45:52----------
what's your resistance um


---------45:57----------
it's just it is like a uh partially just


---------46:00----------
like


---------46:01----------
you've gotten here because of that why


---------46:03----------
would you just


---------46:05----------
and then and then the thing that uh the


---------46:08----------
thing that i always think about


---------46:10----------
um he's my agent but he became like one


---------46:13----------
of my best friends like very early on


---------46:15----------
uh so when i cast it i was on the road


---------46:19----------
nonstop


---------46:20----------
which is one of the things i really


---------46:22----------
enjoyed because there was this


---------46:23----------
like momentum to it where it was just


---------46:25----------
like yeah i have to get on this plane


---------46:27----------
like and there was just like this


---------46:29----------
constant pull back and forth and there


---------46:30----------
were moments where


---------46:32----------
there was a nice lack of control uh and


---------46:34----------
then the second that i would sit down


---------46:37----------
i was in control of the show you know


---------46:38----------
that's why i like hosting more than


---------46:39----------
play-by-play casting like i am in


---------46:41----------
control


---------46:42----------
this person's gonna say this and like i


---------46:44----------
have a feeling for when all of that's


---------46:45----------
gonna happen


---------46:46----------
i'm the one who calls for the ad break i


---------46:48----------
know the best time to do it


---------46:49----------
and there there was this constant back


---------46:51----------
and forth of it


---------46:52----------
and i couldn't like i never wanted to


---------46:55----------
stop doing that and the second that i


---------46:57----------
did i


---------46:57----------
i would that's when i would you know go


---------46:59----------
crazy


---------47:00----------
shopping doing whatever um gambling


---------47:04----------
maybe


---------47:04----------
uh just just going going nuts and my my


---------47:07----------
agent


---------47:08----------
his name's david um he he said to me


---------47:11----------
he was like you're missing peace in your


---------47:13----------
life that's like the one thing


---------47:16----------
that you're missing and i i've always


---------47:19----------
acknowledged that and i've always


---------47:20----------
thought about that


---------47:21----------
but i don't know if i could ever have


---------47:23----------
that peace and not just be bored out of


---------47:25----------
my mind


---------47:27----------
sure so i i think you can because like


---------47:30----------
this is where


---------47:31----------
peace for you doesn't need to be


---------47:34----------
not doing anything yeah right so but i i


---------47:38----------
think you definitely get there but i


---------47:39----------
think it requires some degree of


---------47:41----------
surrender i think your problem is that


---------47:42----------
you're hung up on control


---------47:45----------
so like this is where we have to really


---------47:46----------
think about and get to the root of like


---------47:48----------
what happens rich when you're not in


---------47:51----------
control


---------47:54----------
and even before we get to that question


---------47:56----------
when you spend a bunch of money


---------47:58----------
on a particular thing are you in control


---------48:00----------
or are you not in control


---------48:03----------
i think i'm not


---------48:06----------
at times and that's when it feels bad


---------48:08----------
but then at other times i feel super in


---------48:10----------
control which is


---------48:11----------
absolutely right and then i think i try


---------48:13----------
to chase the good part of it


---------48:15----------
and then i think my answer to me not


---------48:17----------
being in control is i genuinely believe


---------48:19----------
that most of the time it's the wrong


---------48:20----------
decision for me not to be in control


---------48:22----------
because i think i make the right call


---------48:24----------
i genuinely believe that so let's


---------48:27----------
let's talk about the purchasing for a


---------48:28----------
second so i'd say that purchasing is


---------48:30----------
your way of taking control


---------48:34----------
yeah i i would have i would agree and


---------48:36----------
then there are moments where


---------48:37----------
i feel like seeking sickness sickeningly


---------48:40----------
not in control yeah so those are the


---------48:43----------
moments when you realize that the


---------48:45----------
control you're creating is false


---------48:47----------
and what do you do when you feel those


---------48:49----------
sickening moments


---------48:51----------
of a lack of control


---------48:54----------
i usually keep going right so so i'm


---------48:57----------
gonna


---------48:58----------
try to toss an answer out you try to


---------49:00----------
push him away as hard as you can


---------49:02----------
right you're like forget it no no no oh


---------49:04----------
my god like there's a sickening pit in


---------49:06----------
your stomach i'm spending too much money


---------49:07----------
i could be homeless one day and you're


---------49:08----------
like


---------49:08----------
nope nope i'm losing control let me


---------49:11----------
purchase more things ah


---------49:14----------
yeah yeah


---------49:18----------
that was close we almost lost it rich we


---------49:21----------
almost realized we're


---------49:22----------
really not in control here good job


---------49:25----------
let's buy more stuff


---------49:26----------
and feel like we're taking in control oh


---------49:28----------
my god we're we're losing our hair we


---------49:30----------
could be bald oh my god what would


---------49:32----------
happen if we're bald oh my god asthma


---------49:34----------
gold who's so molding


---------49:35----------
thinks i'm bald we better take control


---------49:38----------
should we go see a doctor


---------49:40----------
oh no no no we shouldn't see a doctor


---------49:41----------
because what if they say


---------49:43----------
i don't know what they're going to say i


---------49:44----------
can't control what they're going to say


---------49:45----------
what if they prove me wrong i don't want


---------49:47----------
that


---------49:47----------
i better just order this [ __ ] on the


---------49:48----------
internet and do my own research because


---------49:50----------
i'm right most of the time


---------49:52----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------49:57----------
right yep and then we kind of get to


---------50:01----------
this thing where like you


---------50:02----------
are right most of the time why do you


---------50:04----------
need to be


---------50:05----------
in control because when you're not bad


---------50:07----------
things happen


---------50:09----------
right what happened to you that was bad


---------50:12----------
that


---------50:13----------
you weren't in control of like let's


---------50:15----------
think about that


---------50:16----------
uh definitely losing the house and


---------50:20----------
yeah and


---------50:24----------
i feel like even on project like any


---------50:26----------
time that i haven't


---------50:29----------
made the call on business decisions


---------50:33----------
it's a less than optimal outcome uh


---------50:37----------
now there are there are times when i


---------50:39----------
work closely with other people


---------50:41----------
that um you know like


---------50:45----------
ot otk in particular is like the


---------50:47----------
pinnacle of me


---------50:49----------
giving up large portions of control and


---------50:51----------
i don't feel bad about that


---------50:52----------
like i genuinely do not uh there are


---------50:55----------
there are big portions of me giving up


---------50:56----------
control that i don't feel bad about at


---------50:58----------
all


---------50:58----------
because i genuinely believe in all of


---------51:00----------
those people to a ridiculous degree


---------51:02----------
which is why


---------51:03----------
why it works but i've never felt that


---------51:04----------
before in my life and if i ever work in


---------51:06----------
another project i wouldn't be able to


---------51:07----------
give up the control in the same way


---------51:09----------
rich you ready for we're on the same


---------51:12----------
team right now


---------51:13----------
yeah yeah you ready for us to go into


---------51:15----------
versus mode


---------51:16----------
yeah i'm ready okay so here's the thing


---------51:20----------
like


---------51:21----------
i think that you really have to


---------51:22----------
re-examine some of those beliefs


---------51:26----------
which ones in particular i'm about to


---------51:27----------
lay them out so you say that when i'm


---------51:29----------
not in control things


---------51:30----------
wind up sub-optimally i know this sounds


---------51:33----------
really weird but that is a factually


---------51:35----------
impossible statement okay


---------51:38----------
i know it's going to sound right just


---------51:40----------
just run with me here and then biology


---------51:41----------
push back and prove me wrong


---------51:43----------
so i think that our mind does something


---------51:45----------
it's really interesting right because


---------51:46----------
you say like


---------51:46----------
when i surrender control if i do it with


---------51:48----------
otk people


---------51:50----------
it works out well and if i do it with


---------51:51----------
non-otaki people it doesn't work out


---------51:53----------
well


---------51:54----------
and i want you to be really really


---------51:55----------
careful here about what your mind is


---------51:57----------
projecting on the situation versus what


---------51:59----------
is actually reality


---------52:01----------
yeah okay so like the first thing is


---------52:03----------
that if i make a decision


---------52:07----------
i can say that this outcome was


---------52:09----------
sub-optimal like this happens all the


---------52:11----------
time at healthy gamer where like


---------52:12----------
you know my wife and i my wife is ceo


---------52:14----------
and sometimes we disagree on stuff


---------52:16----------
and so just to give you like my own


---------52:17----------
experience maybe i'm wrong here but i'm


---------52:19----------
curious what you think


---------52:20----------
so like something will happen and then


---------52:22----------
it was my wife's decision


---------52:24----------
and then i'll say that was a sub-optimal


---------52:26----------
outcome if we had done what i


---------52:28----------
said things would have turned out better


---------52:31----------
but the crazy thing is that even though


---------52:32----------
my mind


---------52:33----------
says that i don't actually know that


---------52:36----------
because i actually don't have data


---------52:38----------
about the road not taken but my mind


---------52:41----------
loves to think that


---------52:43----------
what do you think about that i do think


---------52:46----------
that i base


---------52:47----------
most of the how how i feel about this


---------52:50----------
particular thing


---------52:51----------
off of the successes i've seen when i've


---------52:53----------
made decisions


---------52:54----------
uh i i as do i bro yeah like the


---------52:58----------
so the thing with um


---------53:01----------
the thing with like like use my example


---------53:04----------
of like otk for example right


---------53:06----------
i i genuinely know that like i've


---------53:09----------
there's proven success with every


---------53:11----------
individual right and and i think that


---------53:13----------
that's why


---------53:13----------
the trust is there i think that there's


---------53:15----------
control


---------53:17----------
in if i play like a cooperative board


---------53:20----------
game though


---------53:20----------
with my friends like friends in general


---------53:23----------
i'm pretty much making


---------53:23----------
every move right and i i don't know


---------53:27----------
sometimes you know maybe they would make


---------53:28----------
a better move uh i do agree with that


---------53:31----------
and you know sometimes when


---------53:32----------
they've said uh you know like let's say


---------53:35----------
you know


---------53:35----------
use pandemic as an example again


---------53:37----------
sometimes it's like oh yeah well what if


---------53:38----------
i actually move here and i'm like oh


---------53:40----------
yeah that's a pretty good line maybe you


---------53:41----------
should go for that


---------53:42----------
you know maybe i don't see all of those


---------53:44----------
because i'm so


---------53:45----------
focused on what's going on in my head so


---------53:48----------
now we get to the important thing okay


---------53:50----------
which is


---------53:51----------
what's the consequence


---------53:55----------
of someone else being in control outside


---------53:57----------
of otk


---------54:01----------
uh well i mean it depends case by case


---------54:04----------
like what the


---------54:04----------
decision we're making right um but if i


---------54:07----------
was


---------54:08----------
if i was making let's say i was doing a


---------54:10----------
show


---------54:11----------
for example i was making a show and


---------54:12----------
somebody else would be in control


---------54:15----------
i know that the show would be


---------54:19----------
worse if most of the time if i wasn't


---------54:21----------
making a call


---------54:22----------
and i i do feel like i relinquish


---------54:24----------
control when


---------54:26----------
there are


---------54:29----------
very competent people involved like


---------54:33----------
i like i'm thinking about shows where i


---------54:35----------
have relinquished control like


---------54:37----------
just thinking about shows in particular


---------54:39----------
and those are a lot of


---------54:40----------
the the best crews that i've ever worked


---------54:43----------
with i would want to work again


---------54:44----------
and most of the the things where i was


---------54:47----------
like


---------54:47----------
if i don't have control like i really do


---------54:49----------
believe i'm right uh the more that i


---------54:51----------
think about it


---------54:52----------
which you know maybe maybe i'm not uh


---------54:54----------
you know i'm willing to


---------54:55----------
to dig in deeper but most of the shows


---------54:57----------
that i


---------54:58----------
don't work on anymore and didn't do


---------55:00----------
things the way that i wanted


---------55:02----------
them to be done they suck now they're


---------55:04----------
terrible like they're either actually


---------55:06----------
they're not as good


---------55:07----------
uh with so now and now rich we come to


---------55:09----------
an interesting point right so i'm not


---------55:11----------
doubting your competence


---------55:13----------
i think the main thing that i want to


---------55:14----------
point out to you is that like you know


---------55:16----------
so


---------55:16----------
so i sort of feel the same way that like


---------55:18----------
you know when it comes to healthy gamer


---------55:21----------
i i feel like when we do things based on


---------55:24----------
my conception


---------55:25----------
things tend to work out well but i think


---------55:27----------
i've managed to learn the hard way that


---------55:30----------
you know i had a lot of cognitive biases


---------55:32----------
in place that would allow like my mind


---------55:34----------
to filter information in a weird way


---------55:36----------
which is just how our mind works


---------55:38----------
our mind loves to take credit for the


---------55:40----------
successes


---------55:41----------
and loves to blame others for the


---------55:43----------
failures and so you just have to be a


---------55:45----------
little bit careful about that


---------55:47----------
i agree yeah i think the main thing for


---------55:49----------
that that i want to share with you and i


---------55:51----------
want you to focus on is not so much


---------55:53----------
about whether taking control or not


---------55:54----------
taking control


---------55:55----------
is the right decision what i want you to


---------55:58----------
really focus on


---------55:59----------
is what the internal feeling is


---------56:03----------
if you have to surrender control yeah


---------56:06----------
yeah


---------56:06----------
um


---------56:09----------
right because like even though it's like


---------56:11----------
this weird like ominous feeling


---------56:13----------
like like it does feel like something


---------56:15----------
bad about so happens so and here's


---------56:17----------
here's the other thing i don't think you


---------56:19----------
even really surrender control


---------56:20----------
like you're still in control when you


---------56:22----------
surrender control right


---------56:24----------
like you're like i'm gonna choose to put


---------56:26----------
my faith in otk people


---------56:27----------
which is actually you still being in


---------56:29----------
control


---------56:30----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------56:34----------
that that is a way that i've never


---------56:35----------
looked at it before and i totally agree


---------56:37----------
i i i choose actively


---------56:40----------
to trust those people yeah and and i


---------56:42----------
know that it was the right decision


---------56:44----------
yeah yeah but you see it's still your


---------56:47----------
choice you're not actually surrendering


---------56:48----------
anything


---------56:49----------
i agree with you fully yes right it's


---------56:51----------
like it's like if i'm


---------56:52----------
you know i will let my kid i let my kid


---------56:55----------
pick whatever they want off the menu but


---------56:57----------
like who's actually in control there


---------56:58----------
it's still me


---------57:00----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------57:03----------
so i've never i've never looked at it


---------57:04----------
that way before yeah so


---------57:06----------
so what is tell me about this ominous


---------57:08----------
feeling right so this is the


---------57:10----------
key thing remember we don't want we want


---------57:12----------
you to be in control of yourself but i


---------57:14----------
think the weirdest thing is that you're


---------57:16----------
ultimately a slave to your mind so


---------57:18----------
you're


---------57:18----------
you know in in your mind wants to be in


---------57:21----------
control so what is that ominous feeling


---------57:22----------
tell me about that


---------57:24----------
uh it manifests in a few different ways


---------57:26----------
uh


---------57:27----------
that are definitely interesting because


---------57:29----------
like um i actually


---------57:31----------
really don't get in most situations like


---------57:34----------
nervous in a typical way


---------57:36----------
it's definitely something that i've like


---------57:37----------
noticed about myself like um


---------57:39----------
i remember one of my first really big


---------57:40----------
shows uh for call of duty


---------57:42----------
the i had never been on like a stage in


---------57:46----------
front of people before


---------57:47----------
completely sold out venue sea of faces


---------57:50----------
like actually like felt like i was in a


---------57:52----------
movie and my ifb


---------57:54----------
broke and i so i couldn't hear anything


---------57:57----------
i had to hit three different marks i was


---------57:59----------
supposed to look at a camera before i


---------58:00----------
got optic gaming out on the stage


---------58:02----------
this is like one of my big moments you


---------58:03----------
know you mess up your career is over


---------58:06----------
everything's broken i didn't feel a


---------58:09----------
single ounce of stress i just got up


---------58:11----------
there and i did it


---------58:12----------
and it felt incredible and i was excited


---------58:16----------
because things went wrong uh i can


---------58:18----------
remember a lot of different


---------58:19----------
circumstances where things went wrong


---------58:22----------
and i did a good job and those are some


---------58:24----------
of my best memories


---------58:25----------
um because i once again something that


---------58:28----------
you've aptly pointed out i won


---------58:30----------
even though things went wrong but the


---------58:31----------
way that it manifests in normal


---------58:33----------
situations


---------58:34----------
like if i'm just thinking by myself and


---------58:37----------
i'm thinking something out


---------58:39----------
i get really i feel really warm and


---------58:42----------
uh like i just feel like really hot um


---------58:46----------
yeah beautiful beautiful connections


---------58:48----------
rich so let me just lay that out a


---------58:50----------
little bit


---------58:50----------
more okay so i think you hit up you hit


---------58:52----------
the nail on the head i love it that i


---------58:54----------
didn't even have to point it out so like


---------58:55----------
here's the thing so i wanna i'm gonna


---------58:57----------
toss out a hypothesis is that rich


---------58:59----------
lacks faith in himself why do you love


---------59:02----------
chaos because when you're in chaos


---------59:06----------
and everything in the world is against


---------59:08----------
you that's when you can get that


---------59:10----------
data you can see the evidence that rich


---------59:13----------
doesn't need to lack faith in himself


---------59:15----------
when all the world is against you and


---------59:17----------
then you triumph


---------59:19----------
that is such good


---------59:22----------
like energy against the idea that i am a


---------59:25----------
loser


---------59:26----------
it's when you feel your best self when


---------59:29----------
you feel alive and in that moment


---------59:32----------
you know a hundred percent that you are


---------59:34----------
a winner you are not a loser


---------59:36----------
it i would challenge that slightly i'm


---------59:39----------
not even necessarily fully disagreeing


---------59:41----------
but right now i feel like i have like


---------59:44----------
almost like a clarity of like how that


---------59:45----------
moment


---------59:46----------
feels it feels like my purpose in a


---------59:49----------
weird way


---------59:50----------
like yeah and i i maybe there there's a


---------59:53----------
portion


---------59:54----------
of proving in there like i definitely


---------59:57----------
think that there is


---------59:58----------
but it's like those are the moments when


---------59:59----------
i can win those are kind of the moments


---------60:02----------
that i live for


---------60:03----------
and if i don't have them i am


---------60:06----------
it's not even a self-worth thing it's


---------60:09----------
just like i'm


---------60:10----------
so bored and what is the [ __ ] point


---------60:13----------
you know what i mean


---------60:14----------
does that make sense so yes so here's


---------60:16----------
here i i completely agree with what


---------60:17----------
you're saying i think the proving is


---------60:19----------
going to come in a second but


---------60:20----------
i think in those moments you're kind of


---------60:22----------
in this flow state and i think that's


---------60:24----------
when you're actually


---------60:26----------
the closest to your truest self


---------60:29----------
yeah yeah right right so that's when


---------60:31----------
like you were put


---------60:32----------
on this earth to do particular things


---------60:35----------
and


---------60:35----------
the person who can handle the ifb broken


---------60:38----------
and hitting three marks and not like


---------60:39----------
that's you baby it's like everything


---------60:42----------
that you were born for


---------60:44----------
i can get behind that a hundred percent


---------60:46----------
i can get that it's your purpose


---------60:48----------
so then that begs the really weird


---------60:50----------
question


---------60:51----------
if you can thrive when there's chaos


---------60:55----------
around you


---------60:56----------
why the [ __ ] do you need to control


---------60:58----------
anything


---------60:59----------
because i know


---------61:02----------
all of those situations that are they're


---------61:05----------
not


---------61:05----------
natural and one day i'm not gonna have


---------61:07----------
them and then i feel like


---------61:09----------
even with the money even with like all


---------61:11----------
of these things i won't have anything


---------61:14----------
because one day i won't be


---------61:17----------
play by play casting anymore or hosting


---------61:19----------
anymore right i've already slightly


---------61:20----------
moved away from that


---------61:21----------
one day i won't be in like these


---------61:23----------
scenarios of extreme stress


---------61:25----------
like and then what am i going to do you


---------61:27----------
know what i mean am i just going to sit


---------61:29----------
on


---------61:29----------
like a beach and people you know what i


---------61:32----------
mean like


---------61:33----------
i think that that's what i'm scared of


---------61:34----------
i'm scared of like losing my


---------61:36----------
purpose i think which i've never thought


---------61:39----------
of it that way before but now i feel


---------61:41----------
like


---------61:41----------
that's what it feels like to me like


---------61:45----------
it's not even um it's not even like


---------61:49----------
the i do like the attention of the job i


---------61:52----------
definitely do but it's not even that


---------61:54----------
like i felt um


---------61:56----------
i used to there was like a week before i


---------61:59----------
fell into being on screen talent


---------62:01----------
where i was doing i was running the


---------62:02----------
graphics and that felt good too


---------62:05----------
because if i spelled something wrong if


---------62:07----------
i hit the wrong button


---------62:09----------
all these things i could ruin the show


---------62:11----------
and like that pressure


---------62:13----------
felt super good and


---------62:16----------
i don't know what i would do if i don't


---------62:19----------
have


---------62:20----------
these high moments of pressure where i


---------62:21----------
feel like everything can


---------62:23----------
explode if i don't do everything right


---------62:28----------
okay so this is going to require like


---------62:30----------
some very very fine tweezers


---------62:32----------
okay rich so first of all awesome i i


---------62:35----------
really think it's cool to hear you say


---------62:37----------
that you're kind of noticing that


---------62:39----------
it's sort of about purpose and all that


---------62:41----------
kind of good stuff i think that the the


---------62:42----------
the tricky thing here is that there's a


---------62:44----------
lot of genuineness


---------62:45----------
there's a lot of goodness and i still


---------62:48----------
think it's sort of wrapped by like other


---------62:50----------
weird things


---------62:51----------
so the first is is that like you know


---------62:54----------
you


---------62:54----------
fear being bored which i can kind of get


---------62:58----------
but like i don't know how to say this to


---------62:59----------
you but


---------63:02----------
so in a very practical sense i think you


---------63:05----------
should structure your life


---------63:07----------
over being what i would call a vata


---------63:09----------
which means that like


---------63:11----------
i think you're going to be the most


---------63:12----------
successful and feel the most fulfilled


---------63:15----------
when what you do is not the same every


---------63:17----------
single day


---------63:18----------
and requires a lot of thoroughness


---------63:20----------
follow through in energy


---------63:23----------
and the other part of me says so like i


---------63:25----------
think it's good to think about how


---------63:27----------
you're


---------63:27----------
kind of like that's the situation which


---------63:30----------
you thrive so that's the life you should


---------63:31----------
cultivate for yourself


---------63:33----------
absolutely at the same time i think


---------63:35----------
you're doing it a little bit blind


---------63:37----------
because like sometimes you know you're


---------63:39----------
rebelling against authority and like


---------63:40----------
sometimes you're like craving chaos and


---------63:42----------
like there are other things like you


---------63:43----------
should like see a doctor and all this


---------63:45----------
kind of crap


---------63:46----------
and so i think sort of the the boredom


---------63:49----------
aversion


---------63:49----------
is different from trying to cultivate


---------63:52----------
the kind of life that you thrive in


---------63:55----------
yeah i agree with you i i think like as


---------63:57----------
i'm like looking at it more deeply too


---------63:59----------
like


---------63:59----------
the right right in that split second


---------64:02----------
before you started


---------64:03----------
speaking i i thought to myself it's like


---------64:06----------
wait


---------64:07----------
why are you like why are you so afraid


---------64:10----------
of


---------64:11----------
of being bored and i feel like um


---------64:15----------
it comes back to kind of what you said


---------64:17----------
when you were speaking you said


---------64:18----------
something about how it's


---------64:20----------
wrapped up in these weird things and


---------64:24----------
it comes back to identity again i i


---------64:28----------
think that


---------64:29----------
living my life in like this state of


---------64:32----------
chaos


---------64:33----------
i feel like that's a part of who i am


---------64:36----------
um i like yeah i


---------64:40----------
feel like it it always comes back to


---------64:42----------
identity and


---------64:44----------
rich yeah who will you be if you're


---------64:46----------
sitting alone on a beach


---------64:48----------
sipping a beverage i actually do


---------64:52----------
have such a huge ego that i still do


---------64:54----------
believe i will feel like i am the [ __ ]


---------64:56----------
because i'll think about all the other


---------64:57----------
stuff and be like oh these are all the


---------64:58----------
other things i can be doing


---------64:59----------
and i can have a full russian novel


---------65:01----------
going on in my head where i just go back


---------65:02----------
and forth


---------65:03----------
with myself like i'm [ __ ] calling but


---------65:06----------
the


---------65:06----------
but i do think that um there are


---------65:10----------
there have been times where i got really


---------65:12----------
sad


---------65:13----------
thinking about not doing the certain


---------65:14----------
things so i i'll go back


---------65:16----------
and try not to put up a wall again the


---------65:18----------
second that you said it and say it maybe


---------65:20----------
i don't know


---------65:21----------
yes so see that that's the interesting


---------65:23----------
thing right because like you fear


---------65:24----------
boredom but then i


---------65:25----------
ask you what would it be like if you


---------65:28----------
were actually there and you're like oh


---------65:30----------
it would be totally fine


---------65:32----------
yeah well i think i think that i just


---------65:33----------
like pushed back probably


---------65:35----------
well so so possibly right so maybe the


---------65:38----------
the wrong thing was the pushback but


---------65:40----------
maybe


---------65:41----------
actually i think the wrong thing is your


---------65:42----------
fear of boredom that's what's not rooted


---------65:44----------
in reality


---------65:45----------
i think you would actually be fine being


---------65:46----------
on a beach yeah


---------65:48----------
maybe i i think it's your fear of


---------65:50----------
boredom that's actually not rooted in


---------65:52----------
reality


---------65:53----------
like you believe it you have a good


---------65:54----------
reason to believe it don't get me wrong


---------65:56----------
your mind learned to fear boredom


---------65:58----------
and what i'm sort of hearing if i had to


---------66:00----------
like kind of try to tie it together in a


---------66:01----------
nice bow which by all means you know


---------66:03----------
modify it tell me i'm wrong whatever


---------66:05----------
is that like you've developed this


---------66:07----------
identity as the guy who's


---------66:09----------
clutch yeah and if there's no


---------66:12----------
situation for you to be clutching


---------66:15----------
you're a no one yeah and so like


---------66:20----------
you don't wanna i mean chaos like you


---------66:22----------
gotta you gotta like mess


---------66:24----------
you gotta you know keep things cause


---------66:25----------
like that's who you can be when you say


---------66:27----------
you were on this earth


---------66:29----------
to like be in this situation and shine


---------66:32----------
when like


---------66:33----------
99 out of 100 people would fail that's


---------66:35----------
who you are


---------66:37----------
yeah yeah yeah and so if you're bored


---------66:39----------
like then who are you


---------66:40----------
you're just and i still haven't really


---------66:42----------
dug into this but i think


---------66:44----------
you're you go back to becoming who you


---------66:47----------
were before you were this person which


---------66:49----------
is something you do not want


---------66:51----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah we haven't even


---------66:53----------
talked about it yeah you touched on it


---------66:55----------
so well and it's not like um


---------66:57----------
i i'm never like it


---------67:00----------
is really really focused on me like


---------67:06----------
i do a really good job of not comparing


---------67:07----------
myself to other people which is


---------67:08----------
something that i'm proud of about who i


---------67:10----------
am


---------67:10----------
like for example with my stream i've


---------67:12----------
always been happy with my stream for


---------67:14----------
example but


---------67:15----------
all of my friends are like the biggest


---------67:17----------
streamers on the platform and i'm not


---------67:19----------
but i'm happy with what i have uh so


---------67:21----------
that's something that i'm really


---------67:23----------
good at dealing with you know and in any


---------67:27----------
station in life i'm like i feel


---------67:28----------
fortunate with with what i have


---------67:30----------
but if you take away those little things


---------67:33----------
about


---------67:34----------
like the the things that you've


---------67:36----------
mentioned about yeah like


---------67:38----------
i feel like i almost need to get [ __ ] on


---------67:41----------
and beat it to feel good and i


---------67:44----------
yeah i i i think i i'm like trying to


---------67:47----------
even piece it together because i


---------67:48----------
do feel like you've worded it so well i


---------67:50----------
feel like i seek that cycle because


---------67:52----------
that's who i


---------67:53----------
am and i almost don't even know if i


---------67:56----------
don't want to be that person


---------67:59----------
yeah yeah i i don't yeah we desynced


---------68:02----------
again do you mind just reconnecting


---------68:05----------
uh yeah sure one sec


---------68:11----------
all right let me make sure perfect we're


---------68:13----------
good so so here's


---------68:14----------
so well well done rich well done i think


---------68:17----------
it's it's it


---------68:18----------
i think you know i think what you're


---------68:19----------
saying makes a lot of sense to me it's


---------68:21----------
really cool


---------68:22----------
to hear you kind of say that so let me


---------68:23----------
try to tie things up a little bit okay


---------68:25----------
so i think the issue here is that like


---------68:28----------
you kind of said


---------68:29----------
you you know and and now we sort of


---------68:32----------
understand your resistance right this


---------68:34----------
whole like


---------68:35----------
this whole branch of our conversation


---------68:37----------
started off when i said something about


---------68:39----------
like


---------68:40----------
changing who you are and there was a


---------68:41----------
part of you that's like uh-uh


---------68:43----------
yeah you don't want that right and and


---------68:45----------
now this is where like i don't know if


---------68:47----------
we have time to really dig into this but


---------68:49----------
i think that you're good


---------68:50----------
in not comparing yourself to other


---------68:53----------
people


---------68:54----------
but i think you have so what i'm what


---------68:56----------
i'm hearing a lot of is


---------68:57----------
identity there's a lot about identity


---------68:59----------
ahamkara is the sanskrit word


---------69:01----------
and the ahamkara always compares


---------69:05----------
and so the tricky thing is you say i


---------69:06----------
don't compare myself to other people i


---------69:07----------
completely agree


---------69:08----------
i think what you do is probably if i had


---------69:10----------
to hypothesize we don't really know but


---------69:12----------
just


---------69:12----------
understanding the am guard what you do


---------69:14----------
is compare yourself to the previous you


---------69:17----------
yeah there's the rich and uh i would


---------69:19----------
even go a step further because i fully


---------69:20----------
agree with you


---------69:21----------
i think i compare myself to


---------69:25----------
my perceived self-actualized self


---------69:29----------
too and i i constantly compare myself to


---------69:32----------
that


---------69:33----------
and that's where i feel failure at times


---------69:35----------
if i don't live up to that


---------69:37----------
so and and now we get to sort of like


---------69:39----------
the weird ass punch line which is that


---------69:41----------
like


---------69:42----------
the you of the past that you're trying


---------69:44----------
to no longer be


---------69:45----------
and the you of the future that you're


---------69:47----------
trying to become through these moments


---------69:49----------
of chaos and self-actualization and


---------69:51----------
feeling like you


---------69:52----------
exist on this world for a reason all of


---------69:54----------
those are false


---------69:56----------
you are just you yeah


---------70:00----------
right and this is where like it also


---------70:01----------
seems like you don't experience a whole


---------70:03----------
lot of shame


---------70:04----------
but i would venture that you probably


---------70:07----------
need to learn how to


---------70:09----------
because i think part of like what's


---------70:10----------
difficult about this is that


---------70:12----------
you know i think i get the sense that


---------70:14----------
you're really struggling


---------70:16----------
and you're terrified of becoming


---------70:18----------
something that


---------70:19----------
you know you're like running away from


---------70:21----------
like being you call it being bored i


---------70:22----------
don't know what that is but like


---------70:23----------
yeah you know you know losing your


---------70:25----------
identity and all that good


---------70:26----------
good business but the interesting thing


---------70:28----------
is that i don't actually think you're


---------70:30----------
lying when you say you would be fine


---------70:31----------
sitting on a beach


---------70:32----------
because i think like rich i have faith


---------70:34----------
in the person that you


---------70:35----------
are like you are that thing no one can


---------70:38----------
take it away from you


---------70:39----------
you are what you are and nothing can


---------70:41----------
take it away from you whether you're


---------70:42----------
penniless or rich like sure you don't


---------70:45----------
want to be penniless and you have to


---------70:46----------
work on you know put


---------70:47----------
stocking stuff away and and things like


---------70:48----------
that but i think at the end of the day


---------70:50----------
like what you


---------70:51----------
are is what you are your character is


---------70:53----------
your character you are yourself


---------70:55----------
you don't need to like you talk about


---------70:57----------
being a self-actualized version you know


---------70:59----------
you


---------71:00----------
strive towards being a self-actualized


---------71:01----------
version where whereas i think you know


---------71:03----------
that in those moments when the ifb goes


---------71:06----------
out you


---------71:07----------
are you're self-actualized like you're


---------71:09----------
the perfect version of yourself


---------71:11----------
but what happens when i don't have those


---------71:14----------
anymore


---------71:15----------
right like those that's the thing that


---------71:16----------
i'm tied to so rich


---------71:19----------
rich as long as you have those things


---------71:22----------
your sense of self will be tied to those


---------71:24----------
things


---------71:25----------
how can you develop confidence in


---------71:27----------
yourself if i if i


---------71:28----------
eat burritos every day and then i say to


---------71:31----------
myself what am i going to eat if there


---------71:32----------
are no more burritos


---------71:33----------
i have to stop buying burritos and see


---------71:36----------
what happens


---------71:37----------
that's when i discover confidence in who


---------71:39----------
i am


---------71:40----------
yeah well so so just to talk about that


---------71:43----------
further


---------71:44----------
you know buying burritos every day it's


---------71:47----------
like


---------71:48----------
what do you need to set up your reality


---------71:50----------
to be able to eat burritos every day is


---------71:51----------
that your favorite thing to do


---------71:52----------
you need to make uh you need to have a


---------71:54----------
job where you can make


---------71:55----------
8.95 the abouts like every single day


---------71:58----------
so you get the job then you eat burritos


---------72:00----------
every day and that's what you do


---------72:02----------
uh for me i like the


---------72:05----------
i feel the most alive and like love


---------72:09----------
the situations when [ __ ] goes wrong and


---------72:12----------
it's much harder to create a reality


---------72:13----------
where you can do that every day right


---------72:15----------
so you need to you need to either get


---------72:17----------
hired for a bunch of shows and do that


---------72:19----------
every single day


---------72:20----------
and not be fully in control uh or you


---------72:23----------
can create an entire company that makes


---------72:25----------
shows


---------72:25----------
uh every single day so you can be a part


---------72:27----------
of those shows every single day which


---------72:28----------
i'm realizing i did


---------72:31----------
absolutely and is it bad to try to have


---------72:34----------
that much control over the world


---------72:36----------
to create the reality that you want to


---------72:37----------
live in or is it a good thing


---------72:39----------
uh that depends on whether you want to


---------72:41----------
change


---------72:42----------
yeah yeah right so i i don't i don't i


---------72:44----------
think you've done a wonderful job of


---------72:46----------
cultivating the life in which you thrive


---------72:48----------
i'm not saying throw that life away


---------72:50----------
but what i'm saying is that your


---------72:51----------
identity as long as you derive your


---------72:54----------
identity from


---------72:55----------
shining in moments of chaos your


---------72:57----------
identity will be based upon shining


---------72:59----------
in those moments of chaos and you will


---------73:01----------
become dependent on shining in


---------73:03----------
those moments of chaos it is only very


---------73:05----------
shallow


---------73:06----------
it's like it's absolutely full yes right


---------73:09----------
so so


---------73:10----------
the crazy thing is that i'm telling you


---------73:12----------
bro i have faith that if you don't


---------73:14----------
have those shining moments of chaos you


---------73:17----------
will discover


---------73:19----------
that you are still yourself and that you


---------73:22----------
don't


---------73:22----------
need those things and when you don't


---------73:25----------
need those things anymore


---------73:26----------
then you will be in control and your


---------73:29----------
mind won't


---------73:30----------
because right now your mind is like oh


---------73:32----------
my god what will i become


---------73:33----------
unless i have these moments of chaos


---------73:37----------
and so then it you you're hungry and you


---------73:39----------
can't control it right like


---------73:40----------
you're you're cultivating you're


---------73:42----------
creating this thing this thing this


---------73:43----------
thing this thing this thing


---------73:45----------
and you're looking at all of this like


---------73:47----------
train wreck of the rest of your life


---------73:48----------
where you're like ordering finasteride


---------73:50----------
off the internet


---------73:51----------
and can't find a doctor and like won't


---------73:52----------
pay your bills or whatever and what i'm


---------73:54----------
telling you is that like


---------73:55----------
in order to discover who you truly are


---------73:58----------
you need to see


---------73:58----------
what is common in all of these different


---------74:00----------
scenarios instead of recreating the same


---------74:03----------
scenario


---------74:04----------
over and over and over again yeah


---------74:07----------
yeah it almost reminds me of my patients


---------74:09----------
who like wind up in abusive


---------74:10----------
relationships over and over and over


---------74:12----------
again because it's like


---------74:13----------
they're like this is i know i can


---------74:14----------
survive this and they look for the same


---------74:16----------
kind of


---------74:17----------
like subconscious signals with abusive


---------74:19----------
partners and they get abused


---------74:20----------
over and over and over again and the


---------74:22----------
most terrifying thing to them i'm


---------74:24----------
telling you


---------74:25----------
if you talk to them most terrifying


---------74:27----------
thing is if they start dating someone


---------74:28----------
who's like really caring


---------74:30----------
and is like genuinely a nice person and


---------74:32----------
then they just get really confused and


---------74:34----------
their


---------74:34----------
mind is waiting for the other shoe to


---------74:36----------
drop because in their entire life


---------74:38----------
they've never been with a nice person


---------74:40----------
and then what they end up doing is


---------74:41----------
[ __ ] self-sabotaging


---------74:44----------
because they're like this person can't


---------74:46----------
really be this nice because the five


---------74:47----------
people i've dated before


---------74:49----------
have always turned out nasty and the


---------74:51----------
nicer they are the nastier they are


---------74:53----------
and then they run across someone who's


---------74:54----------
genuinely a good person they're like


---------74:56----------
when is the toxicity going to start when


---------74:58----------
is the toxicity going to start they get


---------74:59----------
paranoid they get uncomfortable


---------75:01----------
and they like pull out of the


---------75:02----------
relationship yeah


---------75:04----------
and then they engage with the sixth


---------75:06----------
person who is not nice


---------75:08----------
and then it becomes a self-fulfilling


---------75:09----------
prophecy


---------75:11----------
and so what's happening with you is like


---------75:13----------
it's becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy


---------75:14----------
where


---------75:15----------
you only are alive in moments of chaos


---------75:18----------
which i completely agree that's your


---------75:20----------
best self


---------75:21----------
but i think that your best self your


---------75:23----------
carry with you all the time


---------75:25----------
yeah yeah i i think it's funny kind of


---------75:29----------
the


---------75:30----------
the idea that you put it's almost like


---------75:32----------
you know i always think of uh


---------75:36----------
miss havisham in the wedding dress you


---------75:38----------
know just like holding on to like those


---------75:39----------
that that best moment like holding on to


---------75:41----------
that one thing and just being the old


---------75:43----------
lady until you fall into the fire


---------75:45----------
i i do feel like in a lot of ways it's


---------75:47----------
it's me and my


---------75:48----------
my caster suit holding a mic and just


---------75:50----------
like i'll tell you about my


---------75:52----------
my story uh and yeah i agree that it's


---------75:54----------
not only me and it's


---------75:56----------
the the relationship with control is


---------75:57----------
really weird right


---------75:59----------
because even with the it's like that


---------76:02----------
rush


---------76:03----------
even with gambling right it's like


---------76:05----------
somewhat out of my control


---------76:06----------
but even if i lose i feel like i'm


---------76:08----------
winning and i'm always trying to keep


---------76:10----------
track of it


---------76:12----------
yeah i think that those are kind of


---------76:13----------
probably the biggest things that i need


---------76:14----------
to change


---------76:15----------
i i agree uh


---------76:19----------
well for the record i'm not saying you


---------76:20----------
need to change them


---------76:22----------
i'm just saying what i want yeah i want


---------76:24----------
to right


---------76:25----------
uh it's something you've got to decide


---------76:28----------
whether you want to start to see because


---------76:29----------
like


---------76:30----------
here's the thing i mean i could point


---------76:31----------
out to you rich half a dozen moments


---------76:33----------
where


---------76:34----------
you weren't thriving through chaos and


---------76:36----------
you were still an


---------76:37----------
awesome best self right like i


---------76:41----------
and and we've heard them i think


---------76:42----------
especially if you look to things like


---------76:43----------
your family and stuff like those are not


---------76:46----------
you know like like if we think about the


---------76:48----------
relationship you have with your parents


---------76:50----------
it doesn't sound like there's much chaos


---------76:51----------
anymore but i still think you're


---------76:53----------
you're your best self with them i i


---------76:55----------
don't know


---------76:56----------
i i don't know i think i i think i could


---------76:58----------
be better i think that um


---------77:02----------
i think that like when there's a problem


---------77:03----------
i'm always there and


---------77:05----------
i don't think i focus as much on the the


---------77:08----------
the times when there isn't a problem


---------77:10----------
uh so yeah so i do so rich


---------77:14----------
what are you gonna do about that


---------77:17----------
um i i've often said that i'm going to


---------77:23----------
to call them more and be there more i


---------77:25----------
even


---------77:26----------
you know like help them


---------77:29----------
get uh their because they're at risk


---------77:33----------
help them get their


---------77:34----------
um their cold vaccine so i would feel


---------77:37----------
safe for visiting them soon


---------77:38----------
um but then usually what happens when i


---------77:41----------
say that i'm gonna call them more is


---------77:43----------
something super chaotic happens and then


---------77:46----------
it gets my attention


---------77:47----------
and i deal with it and then i don't talk


---------77:50----------
to them as much as i want to


---------77:51----------
there's the dog off the leash right


---------77:55----------
so so i think the key takeaway here so


---------77:57----------
this is where like normally


---------77:59----------
what i feel like doing is asking you to


---------78:01----------
call them today


---------78:03----------
which is good but at the same time i


---------78:05----------
think the most important thing is to


---------78:07----------
recognize that sometimes you want to do


---------78:09----------
things


---------78:10----------
and who's in control is the dog in


---------78:13----------
control


---------78:13----------
or are you in control and notice that


---------78:16----------
when something chaotic happens your mind


---------78:18----------
is going to want to run towards it at


---------78:19----------
full speed


---------78:22----------
yeah i mean like even even like the the


---------78:24----------
second that you said call them today i


---------78:25----------
was like i can't


---------78:26----------
like the second that you said it like it


---------78:28----------
just just instantly i was like no i


---------78:30----------
can't


---------78:30----------
and then i don't know why i like i


---------78:33----------
genuinely don't know why


---------78:34----------
and then i rationalized and thought of


---------78:37----------
uh


---------78:37----------
like four different calls that i have


---------78:39----------
today see like four different discord


---------78:41----------
messages that i know i need to attend to


---------78:44----------
um and i don't know why just instantly


---------78:46----------
because


---------78:47----------
i definitely feel like even if i try to


---------78:50----------
slow down the way that my brain just


---------78:51----------
worked i think that i


---------78:52----------
rationalized and made up a bunch of


---------78:54----------
things that i not made up but i


---------78:56----------
i rationalized found a bunch of things


---------78:57----------
that i had to do uh


---------78:59----------
but instantly the second that you say


---------79:00----------
call them today i just when i can't in


---------79:01----------
my head yep


---------79:02----------
yep so you've also discovered another


---------79:05----------
important thing so


---------79:06----------
there's a relationship between your ego


---------79:08----------
and your intellect


---------79:10----------
and the funny thing is that your ego


---------79:12----------
bullies your intellect and comes up with


---------79:14----------
rationalizations


---------79:15----------
the feeling comes first and then your


---------79:18----------
ego goes to your intellect and is hey


---------79:21----------
egos or emotions are going to your


---------79:23----------
intellect and saying i don't want to


---------79:24----------
call mom and dad today


---------79:26----------
come up with good reasons that i can


---------79:27----------
justify not calling them


---------79:30----------
but if you pay attention to your


---------79:31----------
response the i


---------79:33----------
can't comes first and the reasons come


---------79:35----------
after and then we think logically i


---------79:37----------
can't but that's not the order of


---------79:38----------
operations


---------79:39----------
it's not you think about all the things


---------79:41----------
you need to do oh by the way i can't


---------79:43----------
call them


---------79:44----------
the i can't call them comes first and


---------79:46----------
the rationalization comes after


---------79:48----------
so the question is what how do you feel


---------79:51----------
when i


---------79:52----------
ask you to call them i i don't know why


---------79:54----------
i just instantly said i can't


---------79:55----------
and it was emotional like i i know that


---------79:58----------
it was


---------79:59----------
and i don't know why like i i


---------80:04----------
am i lazy like what's going on it's not


---------80:07----------
lazy


---------80:08----------
lazy is lazy is an umbrella term that we


---------80:10----------
use when we don't have good diagnostic


---------80:11----------
information


---------80:12----------
yeah um i can toss out a couple of


---------80:16----------
things


---------80:16----------
are you afraid that is there some


---------80:19----------
negativity hanging between you and your


---------80:21----------
parents like


---------80:22----------
are you afraid that like your dad is


---------80:24----------
gonna think about the money he owes you


---------80:26----------
and things like that and it's gonna go


---------80:27----------
down that route and like what are you


---------80:29----------
trying to avoid


---------80:31----------
by not calling them there's a million


---------80:34----------
things that i could be trying to avoid


---------80:35----------
but none of them pop up right like


---------80:38----------
um like uh


---------80:41----------
maybe maybe it's guilt but i feel like i


---------80:45----------
do this with multiple


---------80:46----------
things not just the parents thing too so


---------80:48----------
there could be different reasons for all


---------80:49----------
of them i mean with my parents


---------80:51----------
um


---------80:55----------
maybe there maybe there's a level of


---------80:56----------
guilt maybe there's there are things


---------80:57----------
that i'm trying to avoid with


---------80:59----------
um i i don't know i


---------81:02----------
but some of those problems that would be


---------81:04----------
causing the guilt are always


---------81:06----------
also the things that make me


---------81:09----------
actually call you know what i mean yeah


---------81:12----------
so so this is where this is where


---------81:14----------
i think at the end of the day rich i i


---------81:15----------
mean maybe we can dig into this but i


---------81:17----------
think it could take some time so i'm


---------81:18----------
going to leave you with one or two


---------81:19----------
hypotheses and i'm going to leave you


---------81:21----------
with a plan


---------81:22----------
so the most important thing in this


---------81:24----------
moment rich is not to figure out why you


---------81:26----------
can't call them


---------81:28----------
the most important thing is to recognize


---------81:29----------
that your mind is


---------81:31----------
saying one thing and you have to make a


---------81:33----------
choice whether you're going to let it be


---------81:34----------
in control or whether you're going to be


---------81:36----------
in control


---------81:37----------
yeah that's the most important thing


---------81:39----------
notice


---------81:40----------
that like this is the problem the world


---------81:42----------
can't actually compete against you rich


---------81:43----------
you


---------81:44----------
own the world all the time you dumpster


---------81:46----------
it right and left


---------81:48----------
true true right your biggest enemy is


---------81:51----------
yourself


---------81:52----------
yeah yeah and so like that's like that's


---------81:55----------
the battle you have to fight so like


---------81:57----------
even though you don't want to and you


---------81:58----------
can't figure out the reason


---------82:00----------
you know like we can go down that road i


---------82:02----------
suspect it has something to do with


---------82:03----------
shame to be honest because i think that


---------82:05----------
there's a


---------82:05----------
there's a noticeable absence of shame in


---------82:08----------
all of what you're saying


---------82:11----------
and and like i think it could be


---------82:12----------
something weird like protecting your


---------82:14----------
parents from the shame of like


---------82:16----------
that you know is going to happen if you


---------82:18----------
call them because


---------82:19----------
every time you call like you're going to


---------82:21----------
want to give them money


---------82:22----------
and you're going to want to help them


---------82:24----------
and your dad isn't going to want to


---------82:25----------
accept it


---------82:26----------
and like that whole mess is like so hard


---------82:28----------
to navigate that like it just makes you


---------82:30----------
not want to


---------82:31----------
call yeah i i don't know maybe


---------82:35----------
the shame thing's interesting uh the the


---------82:38----------
thing is though is like i


---------82:39----------
i genuinely do believe that my parents


---------82:43----------
are just overwhelmingly proud


---------82:47----------
so i don't even know even if they do


---------82:49----------
push that away if they would experience


---------82:51----------
shame


---------82:52----------
and i do think that it's weird that


---------82:55----------
when you bring up shame i can't think of


---------82:56----------
a single time where i've


---------82:59----------
experienced shame which is weird


---------83:03----------
i can't it's very time i've ever i've


---------83:06----------
because usually when people are homeless


---------83:08----------
they experience a little bit of shame


---------83:10----------
usually when people grow up poor and


---------83:11----------
they walk into their friend's place and


---------83:13----------
their friend


---------83:14----------
has a painting which they read about on


---------83:15----------
the internet they feel a little bit


---------83:17----------
shamed


---------83:18----------
usually when people are like grew up


---------83:20----------
broke and have parents who work at flea


---------83:21----------
markets


---------83:22----------
and you get on a private jet of your


---------83:24----------
body in college you feel a little bit of


---------83:26----------
shame


---------83:26----------
like usually it's gotta be somewhere in


---------83:29----------
there


---------83:30----------
and there's a conspicuous absence of it


---------83:32----------
and because they're proud they don't


---------83:33----------
feel shame on the contrary


---------83:35----------
shame and pride are like two opposite


---------83:37----------
there's two sides of the same coin


---------83:39----------
right the pride is the reaction to the


---------83:41----------
shame it's the protection against the


---------83:43----------
shame


---------83:44----------
yeah your dad i can't even think of a


---------83:47----------
time that i've been


---------83:49----------
extremely prideful because


---------83:52----------
when i've needed to i do think that i


---------83:54----------
have accepted help the help thing is


---------83:56----------
like where i'm trying to look now


---------83:58----------
because of the shame thing


---------83:59----------
but like i received help from a friend


---------84:02----------
and i know if i didn't receive that help


---------84:03----------
and i don't feel bad about it i don't


---------84:04----------
feel any shame about it if i didn't


---------84:06----------
receive that help i probably wouldn't


---------84:07----------
even be where i'm at today


---------84:08----------
now i'm thankful for it you know i'll do


---------84:11----------
yeah i i think the two aren't mutually


---------84:13----------
exclusive because i think there are


---------84:14----------
moments where you're closer to the


---------84:17----------
true rich and there are moments where


---------84:19----------
there's like this other weird


---------84:20----------
rich you know this this i don't know


---------84:23----------
what else to call it but like i'm just


---------84:24----------
gonna call it like you know the


---------84:25----------
loser rich or the poor rich or the


---------84:27----------
homeless rich like there's something


---------84:30----------
there's something about like you know


---------84:31----------
and i think you even fear even when we


---------84:33----------
talk about the money


---------84:35----------
you fear being that rich again and the


---------84:38----------
reason that you


---------84:39----------
but i i'm sorry to cut you off dr k


---------84:42----------
there's this thing that


---------84:43----------
though like where i'm still so proud of


---------84:45----------
that like that there is a


---------84:46----------
i am proud of the fact that i was


---------84:49----------
homeless


---------84:49----------
where i think you know most people would


---------84:51----------
feel shame like no i


---------84:52----------
look i that i did that was my chapter


---------84:55----------
that was one of my challenges


---------84:56----------
and what's on the opposite side of the


---------84:58----------
coin from prison that that's that's


---------85:01----------
yeah there you go like that that's issue


---------85:02----------
but i am proud of it and


---------85:04----------
do see identity with it so absolutely


---------85:06----------
yeah


---------85:07----------
and i think it's it's neither something


---------85:09----------
it's not something to be


---------85:10----------
at the end of the day it's not something


---------85:12----------
to be proud of or ashamed of it's just


---------85:14----------
it's just what you are


---------85:16----------
right like it's like actually just a


---------85:17----------
piece of you and it's not like good or


---------85:20----------
bad


---------85:20----------
but i i think it makes i really found a


---------85:22----------
little bit of the pride right like


---------85:23----------
yeah but but i i think it's it's


---------85:25----------
interesting because developmentally what


---------85:27----------
i'm also hearing is that like you


---------85:28----------
weren't


---------85:29----------
you don't really even know what shame


---------85:30----------
looks like yeah


---------85:33----------
and that's probably because like you


---------85:34----------
said when you know when when you call


---------85:36----------
your parents you're like


---------85:37----------
they're so proud i don't even know if


---------85:38----------
they know how to feel shame so i think


---------85:40----------
you're


---------85:41----------
you grew up con


---------85:44----------
learning how to convert shame into pride


---------85:48----------
it's going to be heads every single flip


---------85:50----------
even though the details is right


---------85:52----------
underneath like


---------85:53----------
it's just how your your family like


---------85:55----------
functioned right


---------85:56----------
and so there's something about like i


---------85:58----------
don't know why but like i don't think


---------85:59----------
you are not


---------86:00----------
calling them because of your fear i


---------86:03----------
think you're


---------86:04----------
a loving son i think you're a protective


---------86:07----------
son


---------86:08----------
and i think the reason that you don't


---------86:09----------
call them is for their sake


---------86:11----------
not for yours


---------86:21----------
why don't you call them rich why don't


---------86:24----------
you


---------86:25----------
call them today i i think i think that i


---------86:26----------
think that i will


---------86:28----------
but i i'm trying to think why my my


---------86:30----------
knee-jerk reaction was to


---------86:32----------
to say no right and


---------86:35----------
i i when you say that i'm doing it to


---------86:39----------
protect them i do feel like a little bit


---------86:41----------
of anger


---------86:43----------
insinuating that they need me to protect


---------86:44----------
them so i do think that maybe that


---------86:48----------
that reaction shows that maybe there is


---------86:50----------
a level of


---------86:51----------
uh maybe you're right uh because


---------86:55----------
even you saying that i'm like they don't


---------86:57----------
need me to protect it like


---------86:59----------
i'm protect i'm protecting them from you


---------87:02----------
saying that they need to be protected


---------87:03----------
absolutely right


---------87:06----------
it makes me angry that if you said


---------87:07----------
something negative about me yeah yeah


---------87:09----------
it's weird right


---------87:10----------
yeah very well done by the way i mean


---------87:12----------
like i said


---------87:13----------
i mean i noticed at the beginning i


---------87:15----------
thought you were pretty insightful but


---------87:16----------
damn sound like you just


---------87:17----------
you just did it usually i have to walk


---------87:19----------
people through that


---------87:20----------
right like that noticing of like oh crap


---------87:22----------
like how dare you say they need to be


---------87:25----------
protected


---------87:25----------
they don't need to be protected yeah and


---------87:28----------
in doing so you protect them


---------87:30----------
yeah right it's interesting


---------87:34----------
yeah yeah it's definitely interesting


---------87:35----------
and i i think that


---------87:37----------
it's funny because i i think uh a lot of


---------87:39----------
what i do


---------87:40----------
even when i'm doing stuff online too


---------87:43----------
because it's like it's easier uh and you


---------87:46----------
feel like much more


---------87:48----------
i think most people who watch anything i


---------87:50----------
do online would probably think that i'm


---------87:51----------
like an absolute idiot which is fun like


---------87:53----------
i like doing that you know i'll go on


---------87:55----------
i'll say my poop jokes and you know that


---------87:56----------
that's


---------87:57----------
that's what i do feel like made some


---------87:58----------
people happy uh


---------88:00----------
even when um when i'm hosting


---------88:03----------
usually i will pretend that i don't know


---------88:06----------
very much


---------88:06----------
about the game right because i know


---------88:10----------
that what people need to hear like the


---------88:12----------
the actual thing that people


---------88:14----------
need to hear uh because they will


---------88:16----------
respect it the most


---------88:18----------
is the player the analyst saying these


---------88:20----------
things about the game


---------88:21----------
so i'll play dumb and i'll have them say


---------88:25----------
the things that need to be said even


---------88:27----------
though i know what they're going to say


---------88:28----------
already


---------88:29----------
and i feel in control with it and i'm


---------88:31----------
fine to to play the clown


---------88:33----------
and get it out there but there you are


---------88:35----------
teeing other people up for success


---------88:38----------
which works for hosting right i think


---------88:40----------
that that's the entire thing of the job


---------88:42----------
but i don't really have many outlets


---------88:45----------
where i talk to people about


---------88:48----------
what's going on in my head also because


---------88:51----------
i don't ever want to burden people with


---------88:53----------
it


---------88:54----------
um like uh like even with um


---------88:59----------
like if i if i'm dating somebody or


---------89:01----------
something like that i won't tell them if


---------89:02----------
anything's going wrong


---------89:03----------
i i like i won't um


---------89:07----------
so i i know that that's that's a thing


---------89:09----------
there as well and the only people that


---------89:10----------
i'll ever like


---------89:11----------
really go into


---------89:14----------
maybe like crazy details about what's


---------89:16----------
going on my head are probably


---------89:17----------
like asthma and tips again sure yeah


---------89:20----------
yeah i think i'm noticing that there are


---------89:22----------
some people you let into the circle


---------89:24----------
and once they're in the circle there are


---------89:26----------
no authority issues there are no control


---------89:28----------
issues


---------89:29----------
there's no issues of help and pride and


---------89:31----------
shame and


---------89:32----------
all that kind of stuff it's like there


---------89:34----------
are people that get to see the real you


---------89:36----------
you get to be the real you with them


---------89:38----------
and it sounds like your parents are


---------89:40----------
actually outside of that circle


---------89:42----------
yeah yeah um they they didn't even know


---------89:45----------
that


---------89:46----------
um i didn't have a place to stay when i


---------89:49----------
was in new york i lied


---------89:51----------
they they don't know half half of the


---------89:53----------
yeah why did you lie


---------89:55----------
because i didn't want them to know and i


---------89:57----------
didn't want them to feel like they


---------89:58----------
failed me


---------89:59----------
i i know that i i know that yeah


---------90:02----------
yeah look look at this main tank over


---------90:05----------
here


---------90:06----------
yeah right tanking everything taunting


---------90:08----------
everything gotta protect mom and dad


---------90:11----------
can't let them get aggro can't let them


---------90:12----------
know that you know


---------90:14----------
they raised a son who's struggling


---------90:18----------
yeah um i do feel like that


---------90:21----------
that maybe one of the the failures with


---------90:24----------
that too is i i feel like um


---------90:26----------
a lot of people in my life probably feel


---------90:27----------
like an absence because of it of me


---------90:30----------
yep for sure yeah


---------90:34----------
so rich i think you should call them


---------90:38----------
and i'm gonna equip you with one thing


---------90:41----------
that


---------90:42----------
to so if your dad brings up the money


---------90:44----------
and says i'm gonna pay you back


---------90:48----------
i want you to ask him a question and


---------90:51----------
and this que the question is can you


---------90:53----------
help me understand


---------90:55----------
why you need to pay me back yeah


---------91:03----------
right and and i think you guys need to


---------91:06----------
get


---------91:06----------
eventually to a conversation about like


---------91:09----------
does family


---------91:10----------
owe each other things i i i


---------91:14----------
instantly hear his voice in my head like


---------91:16----------
i just instantly


---------91:17----------
uh like hear him talking about


---------91:21----------
we're your parents we do everything for


---------91:24----------
you


---------91:25----------
why would we you know like yes like i


---------91:28----------
can literally hear him


---------91:29----------
in in my head my father's very uh


---------91:32----------
my father's like a very rough person


---------91:36----------
at times like with how he speaks but


---------91:37----------
then also like incredibly


---------91:39----------
smooth talker randomly i he'd know that


---------91:42----------
this is something that he will handle in


---------91:44----------
that very


---------91:45----------
head-on gruff manner like i can hear his


---------91:48----------
accent even in my head like like the


---------91:50----------
philly accent would come out


---------91:52----------
and all of a sudden you know it would


---------91:54----------
yeah yeah


---------91:55----------
yeah so then i think the next question


---------91:57----------
is like he's like oh you know


---------91:59----------
we're your parents and we take care of


---------92:01----------
you


---------92:02----------
and and then this is where you can kind


---------92:05----------
of say like


---------92:06----------
are you sure about that or like how does


---------92:09----------
it feel


---------92:11----------
to like be up you know to


---------92:14----------
kind of essentially what i'm hearing is


---------92:16----------
that he views himself as a failure of a


---------92:17----------
parent and how can you guys have a


---------92:19----------
conversation


---------92:20----------
around um


---------92:24----------
you know that you just don't see it that


---------92:26----------
way


---------92:28----------
does it have to be that way is that what


---------92:30----------
parents have to do yeah and


---------92:32----------
and how can you explain to him and you


---------92:34----------
can even say this and you can say that


---------92:35----------
you know dad you guys have given me so


---------92:37----------
much


---------92:38----------
you've given me so much like i don't


---------92:39----------
know how to explain to you that


---------92:42----------
you've given me so much that


---------92:45----------
like the money is like it means so


---------92:47----------
little to me compared to everything that


---------92:49----------
you've done for me


---------92:50----------
it's so funny when you said that like i


---------92:52----------
got so [ __ ] mad


---------92:54----------
when when you said like called my dad


---------92:55----------
like like saying that he might feel that


---------92:57----------
way like i can't even say it


---------92:59----------
and it reminded me of two things that i


---------93:01----------
didn't remember


---------93:02----------
i tried to talk to a therapist when i


---------93:03----------
was in college uh one time and i got a


---------93:06----------
huge fight with him


---------93:07----------
and left and i never did it again i


---------93:08----------
actually forgot


---------93:10----------
uh until right now and then uh


---------93:13----------
i remember that when we lost the house


---------93:15----------
my dad and i had a conversation just me


---------93:17----------
and him


---------93:18----------
and i i remembered he actually said


---------93:21----------
those


---------93:21----------
words and uh and cried


---------93:25----------
uh uh to me and yeah


---------93:28----------
i i haven't thought about that i was


---------93:31----------
probably 17


---------93:33----------
and yeah i haven't really thought about


---------93:35----------
that uh


---------93:37----------
i kind of forgot that it happened


---------93:42----------
yeah yeah so you know that's how we know


---------93:44----------
we're moving in the right direction


---------93:46----------
yeah yeah right so when i say things and


---------93:47----------
they trigger responses i i hope i didn't


---------93:50----------
you know i i hope it didn't cause you


---------93:52----------
too much pain i mean i had a feeling it


---------93:54----------
would cause you some pain and i did it


---------93:56----------
i just got mad at you for a second you


---------93:58----------
got really mad at it


---------93:59----------
yeah yeah right so so that means that


---------94:01----------
there's like so anger is a protective


---------94:03----------
emotion


---------94:04----------
anger is like the main tank of the mind


---------94:06----------
it protects us from things like shame


---------94:08----------
and hurt


---------94:09----------
and fear and and other things because


---------94:11----------
anger especially for men like


---------94:13----------
we're basically allowed or taught to


---------94:15----------
express one emotion which is anger


---------94:17----------
it's the only socially acceptable


---------94:19----------
emotion it's the only one that we're


---------94:20----------
given any kind of training on


---------94:22----------
and so the rest of it is all a blur and


---------94:24----------
everything just kind of turns into anger


---------94:26----------
but i i think rich like here's what i


---------94:28----------
would say i think we should probably


---------94:30----------
wrap up and we can talk about meditation


---------94:32----------
if you want to but


---------94:33----------
i do think that um it feels important to


---------94:36----------
me or i place a value


---------94:38----------
on you like having some of these


---------94:41----------
conversations with your dad like you


---------94:42----------
don't have to go very deep


---------94:44----------
but i think it's important even if he


---------94:46----------
resists your signal or feels like he's


---------94:48----------
not


---------94:48----------
accepting it i think it's important for


---------94:51----------
him


---------94:51----------
to receive in some even if he bats it


---------94:54----------
away


---------94:55----------
for him to hear from you that you think


---------94:57----------
he did a good job


---------95:01----------
yeah i'm trying to think i feel like


---------95:04----------
too i do say that a lot


---------95:09----------
and i'm trying to think of the best way


---------95:12----------
to make sure that he really


---------95:14----------
does know you know and this is this is


---------95:17----------
hard but like what you have to do is sit


---------95:18----------
like what you want to do is oddly enough


---------95:20----------
like kind of evoke the shame


---------95:21----------
and in a weird way like the worse he


---------95:24----------
feels about


---------95:24----------
himself that's


---------95:28----------
when he needs to hear it right like you


---------95:30----------
need to see him at his lowest point


---------95:32----------
and then accept him in spite of that


---------95:36----------
right it's sort of like and i know it


---------95:38----------
sounds kind of weird but just drawing a


---------95:39----------
connection like


---------95:40----------
when that roommate bought you the 2 000


---------95:42----------
computer like


---------95:43----------
it means the most when it's the least


---------95:46----------
expected


---------95:47----------
and when you feel like who is this guy


---------95:49----------
like i don't deserve this this person


---------95:50----------
doesn't need to do this


---------95:52----------
and that's when it's the most impactful


---------95:56----------
yeah yeah it's just like one of those


---------95:59----------
weird things where it's like uh


---------96:01----------
i don't want him to get to them the the


---------96:04----------
like the bad spot


---------96:05----------
you know absolutely yeah so i think you


---------96:07----------
protect him a lot


---------96:09----------
yeah yeah right so so anyway i mean i i


---------96:12----------
think


---------96:13----------
you start with a phone call if you can


---------96:16----------
if you can't


---------96:16----------
if you can't call them that's actually


---------96:18----------
okay too just do your best to collect


---------96:20----------
information


---------96:21----------
about like what is it within you that


---------96:22----------
says you can't


---------96:24----------
and i think you can yeah okay so the


---------96:27----------
more you understand yourself like the


---------96:29----------
better you'll you'll be and


---------96:30----------
i think you and your dad will get there


---------96:32----------
i'm sure you and your mom and your


---------96:33----------
sister


---------96:34----------
and whatnot like you guys have hopefully


---------96:35----------
have some time right so if you work at


---------96:37----------
it


---------96:38----------
i have faith that you'll get there how


---------96:41----------
do you feel about


---------96:42----------
meditation um it's


---------96:45----------
something that i've always said that i


---------96:47----------
would do


---------96:48----------
and uh it's it's it's a tomorrow thing


---------96:51----------
you know


---------96:52----------
it's like yeah tomorrow i'll get to it i


---------96:54----------
i've thought about it


---------96:55----------
uh many times yeah so do you want to do


---------96:58----------
it today or you want to do it tomorrow


---------97:00----------
um i know i think if i


---------97:03----------
i think if i do it tomorrow it'll be the


---------97:05----------
next tomorrow and the next tomorrow


---------97:06----------
again so should probably just do it


---------97:08----------
today yeah


---------97:09----------
okay now um i'm gonna try to give you


---------97:12----------
a technique that is uh let me just think


---------97:15----------
about what technique to give you


---------97:18----------
something so i feel like doing something


---------97:22----------
a little bit more


---------97:24----------
um physical or in nature so i think some


---------97:27----------
kind of like chanting


---------97:29----------
is gonna be good so i don't want you to


---------97:31----------
do something that's a very cerebral


---------97:33----------
technique


---------97:34----------
okay because like chances are like


---------97:35----------
you're about that mind like you're a


---------97:37----------
little


---------97:37----------
bit 80d i think it could be a little bit


---------97:39----------
harder for you


---------97:41----------
so i want you to do something that's


---------97:42----------
going to be very experiential


---------97:44----------
okay and may also be challenging i'm


---------97:46----------
leaning towards


---------97:48----------
oh hmm


---------97:52----------
let me just think for a second i wonder


---------97:54----------
if i'm underestimating you


---------97:58----------
just thinking a little bit about how you


---------98:00----------
rise to the challenge


---------98:02----------
hold on


---------98:07----------
what do you want to work on tell me that


---------98:11----------
i i think like the


---------98:14----------
i i actually like so i went around and i


---------98:17----------
i


---------98:18----------
studied religion for a little while to


---------98:20----------
try to figure out


---------98:21----------
stuff like during college and there was


---------98:23----------
this one


---------98:25----------
thing that a rabbi told me that i always


---------98:27----------
thought was


---------98:28----------
exactly what i would want to get out of


---------98:30----------
meditation he said uh


---------98:32----------
you know like the the practice of


---------98:34----------
rapping


---------98:35----------
to fill in where they basically they


---------98:37----------
they wrap


---------98:38----------
um like uh basically like a prayer box


---------98:41----------
around their head and then


---------98:43----------
seven times they wrap around their arms


---------98:45----------
and the thought process to it


---------98:47----------
is if you control your your thoughts


---------98:50----------
and if you can control it's seven to


---------98:52----------
supposed to represent like the seven


---------98:54----------
uh primary emotions i believe uh and if


---------98:57----------
you can control your emotions


---------98:59----------
it's on the left hand because it's


---------99:00----------
supposed to be close to your heart then


---------99:01----------
you're completely in control of your


---------99:03----------
life


---------99:03----------
and i once again i notice i'm getting


---------99:05----------
back to control but


---------99:07----------
i always thought that if i could


---------99:09----------
meditate


---------99:10----------
and actually be able to think on my


---------99:13----------
thoughts and why i'm thinking about


---------99:15----------
things


---------99:15----------
and control my emotions that's always


---------99:17----------
what i wanted to get out of meditation


---------99:19----------
and my version of meditation is


---------99:22----------
sitting and thinking really really fast


---------99:26----------
right now so i probably would need to


---------99:28----------
slow down as well


---------99:29----------
and i think that the assessment that


---------99:31----------
maybe something more physical


---------99:32----------
might be wise is probably correct


---------99:36----------
because like right now i have my own


---------99:38----------
version of meditation which is uh


---------99:40----------
like sitting in my bed looking out at


---------99:42----------
the city


---------99:43----------
and having like my own version of it


---------99:45----------
like


---------99:46----------
moffat sherlock holmes episode in my


---------99:48----------
head uh where i'm just my mind's like


---------99:51----------
all over the place


---------99:52----------
so i'm leaning towards actually so i


---------99:54----------
think i'm going to pick the thing that i


---------99:56----------
don't think is the best for you


---------99:58----------
i'm going to pick the thing that you


---------100:00----------
want instead of picking the thing that


---------100:01----------
you need


---------100:03----------
and and what i actually want to teach


---------100:05----------
you what what my heart tells me to teach


---------100:07----------
you


---------100:07----------
is different from my head my head says


---------100:09----------
this guy needs like a solid grounding


---------100:11----------
technique that sort of like balances his


---------100:13----------
mind and like


---------100:14----------
puts himself into the present will help


---------100:16----------
him discover his true self and like


---------100:17----------
will help him recognize his emotions i


---------100:20----------
want to teach you something that


---------100:21----------
kind of clears your mind so that in the


---------100:23----------
vacuum of your mind some of these more


---------100:25----------
suppressed emotions can come up


---------100:27----------
that's what i want to teach you that's


---------100:28----------
what i think i should teach you but


---------100:30----------
actually that's what i should teach you


---------100:31----------
but what i want to teach you is actually


---------100:33----------
a more intensive practice that may


---------100:35----------
actually be a little bit harder


---------100:37----------
that's actually designed to give you


---------100:39----------
awareness


---------100:40----------
and it's designed to give you insight


---------100:43----------
and intuition


---------100:44----------
and i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------100:46----------
like i think rich you're like you've


---------100:47----------
come


---------100:47----------
so far on your own i want to equip you


---------100:50----------
with a tool that me that you're not


---------100:51----------
going to need anyone you can just do


---------100:53----------
this


---------100:54----------
and you'll do all the discovery you need


---------100:56----------
to on your own how does that sound


---------100:58----------
sounds good it's going to be harder


---------101:00----------
though okay


---------101:02----------
okay so i'm going to teach you a


---------101:03----------
technique called charging the laser beam


---------101:05----------
okay that's what twitch chat calls it


---------101:07----------
okay so he did this technique and then


---------101:09----------
like


---------101:09----------
i was asking someone you know how does


---------101:11----------
it feel and they said it feels like


---------101:12----------
charging a laser beam


---------101:14----------
so the tricky thing is that there there


---------101:15----------
could be a very slight physical


---------101:17----------
sensation it's not going to be intense


---------101:20----------
but i'm going to just essentially can


---------101:22----------
you sit up straight


---------101:23----------
yeah and can you take off your cap and


---------101:25----------
your glasses


---------101:27----------
yep okay all right i can't see at all


---------101:32----------
that's okay you don't need i mean can


---------101:33----------
you see vaguely


---------101:35----------
yeah yeah so so what i'm going to do is


---------101:37----------
i'm going to take this so just give me


---------101:38----------
the middle finger


---------101:40----------
yes no no no no so this is


---------101:44----------
so we unfortunately have to use the


---------101:46----------
middle finger but so you know between my


---------101:48----------
eyebrows


---------101:49----------
there's like a point where kind of my


---------101:51----------
eyebrows meet and there's an area just


---------101:52----------
kind of right above it yeah


---------101:54----------
like right there oh good yeah okay so


---------101:56----------
what i'm going to do is take my middle


---------101:58----------
finger and i'm going to hover it


---------102:00----------
over that point okay not touching


---------102:04----------
and then i'm going to close my eyes


---------102:07----------
and i want you to just feel the


---------102:08----------
sensation right


---------102:10----------
there where your finger is hovering do


---------102:12----------
you feel anything


---------102:16----------
yeah yeah kinda what does it feel like


---------102:20----------
well sometimes i'm like accidentally


---------102:22----------
touching


---------102:23----------
so move further away and then i like


---------102:25----------
kind of think about like what that feels


---------102:27----------
like it's like


---------102:28----------
um it's like a little blue fuzzy dome


---------102:32----------
yep okay good so i think it helps so


---------102:35----------
look at me open your eyes


---------102:37----------
so you have your finger pointing this


---------102:39----------
way i want you to go like this right so


---------102:42----------
pointing into it yep a little bit higher


---------102:44----------
and then are you reluctant to use your


---------102:46----------
middle finger


---------102:47----------
yeah i want to flip you off yeah you're


---------102:50----------
flipping yourself off


---------102:51----------
right yeah so so try to find that brain


---------102:54----------
central point and i want you to kind of


---------102:56----------
like pull a little bit


---------102:57----------
pull further away okay and then you can


---------103:01----------
kind of go


---------103:01----------
in or out just a little bit until you


---------103:04----------
find the sensation if that makes sense


---------103:07----------
oh yeah you got it right it's weird


---------103:09----------
right so like


---------103:10----------
you're kind of like past the blue fuzzy


---------103:12----------
dome and then you're kind of like


---------103:13----------
touching the blue fuzzy dome


---------103:14----------
but yeah so i want you to just focus on


---------103:18----------
that we're gonna do this for about 60


---------103:19----------
seconds


---------103:22----------
and i'll guide you as to what to do next


---------103:24----------
but i want you to just focus on that


---------103:36----------
sensation


---------103:48----------
okay you you got that sensation


---------103:51----------
yeah yeah yeah okay so eyes closed go


---------103:53----------
ahead and relax your hands


---------103:55----------
just yeah just bring it down let your


---------103:58----------
eyes stay closed and i want you to still


---------104:00----------
focus on that point though


---------104:03----------
and i'm gonna give you a couple of


---------104:05----------
different options one is when you take a


---------104:07----------
deep breath i want you to feel that cold


---------104:09----------
air come


---------104:09----------
in your nose kind of imagine that breath


---------104:12----------
going up your nose and into that point


---------104:23----------
some people may even feel like a slight


---------104:25----------
cooling sort of swirly sensation kind of


---------104:28----------
in their


---------104:28----------
upper sinus


---------104:37----------
and then the second thing you can try is


---------104:39----------
to sort of like


---------104:40----------
drive your attention into that point


---------104:43----------
almost as if you're like


---------104:44----------
cognitive energy is like kind of


---------104:48----------
drilling into it


---------104:51----------
i feel way more when i do that yep and


---------104:54----------
then i just want you to drill baby


---------104:55----------
just drill we'll do that for about


---------104:58----------
another minute


---------105:39----------
so your mind may wander you may have


---------105:41----------
thoughts i'm thinking about way too many


---------105:43----------
things right now i'm really trying not


---------105:44----------
to


---------105:45----------
no that's okay so let those thoughts go


---------105:47----------
and return to the drilling


---------105:50----------
you don't want to push them away you


---------105:52----------
don't want to keep them out just return


---------105:54----------
to the sensation of the drilling if you


---------105:56----------
can


---------106:06----------
if you lose the sensation you can return


---------106:08----------
to using your finger


---------106:23----------
now go ahead and relax a little bit let


---------106:25----------
your attention go


---------106:27----------
relax your eyebrows deep breath in and


---------106:30----------
out


---------106:33----------
all right we're coming back it's march


---------106:36----------
17th


---------106:38----------
2021 rich campbell


---------106:42----------
badass that you are


---------106:45----------
all the things you have to do today oh


---------106:48----------
god


---------106:50----------
see all the thoughts come rushing back


---------106:52----------
yeah


---------106:53----------
you're returning to the world welcome


---------106:56----------
hi i think i'm bad at that


---------107:00----------
i definitely think i need to practice no


---------107:02----------
you're not bad you're very good


---------107:05----------
i thought about like about a billion


---------107:07----------
different things you know how you know


---------107:09----------
you're good


---------107:10----------
oh when i said come back what did you


---------107:13----------
say


---------107:16----------
oh god oh yeah when you said yeah when


---------107:18----------
you said all the things you have to do


---------107:19----------
today yeah


---------107:21----------
right so so so what that means is that


---------107:23----------
what is the oh god that's


---------107:25----------
all of that stuff rushing back into your


---------107:27----------
mind


---------107:29----------
in order for you to get hit in order for


---------107:32----------
you to get hit by it and say oh god that


---------107:34----------
means it wasn't in your mind


---------107:37----------
true true right so let me explain one or


---------107:40----------
two things you're not bad at meditation


---------107:42----------
you're very good at it should you


---------107:44----------
practice absolutely


---------107:46----------
but i want you to you guys to understand


---------107:48----------
this so like


---------107:49----------
each time if you tell your mind to


---------107:51----------
concentrate on a point and it wanders


---------107:53----------
away


---------107:53----------
and you bring your mind back that is


---------107:56----------
like doing one push-up


---------107:58----------
and so the more your mind wanders and


---------108:00----------
the more you bring it back


---------108:01----------
actually the more the better you're


---------108:04----------
doing


---------108:05----------
you're doing like 10 push-ups 20


---------108:06----------
push-ups 30 push-ups 40 push-ups 50


---------108:08----------
push-ups


---------108:10----------
so like it doesn't you can't be bad at


---------108:13----------
it yeah i did a lot of push-ups


---------108:15----------
that's so good so so is doing is doing


---------108:19----------
lots of push-ups


---------108:20----------
bad no it's good get you where you're


---------108:23----------
going


---------108:23----------
yeah right and so i know it sounds kind


---------108:25----------
of weird but even despite your


---------108:27----------
perception that you had lots of thoughts


---------108:30----------
i still think you did a good job at


---------108:32----------
pushing most of your day away


---------108:34----------
yeah i was i thought about some old


---------108:36----------
random stuff i don't know where


---------108:38----------
yeah so that's that's the vacuum right


---------108:40----------
so like here's the thing


---------108:42----------
when you push your day away then you've


---------108:45----------
got like this vacuum in your mind where


---------108:47----------
random crap is going to come up


---------108:49----------
but that's how you're kind of cleaning


---------108:51----------
out your unconscious


---------108:54----------
yeah and you don't do that work because


---------108:55----------
you're usually thinking about your day i


---------108:57----------
think you did fantastic


---------108:58----------
okay thank you yeah i know it sounds


---------109:01----------
weird it's just all about our perception


---------109:02----------
of like


---------109:03----------
you're doing it you're doing a good job


---------109:06----------
i'm telling you just keep doing this


---------109:07----------
like do three to five minutes a day


---------109:10----------
and that is like a particular time when


---------109:14----------
it's dawn and dusk are ideal so maybe


---------109:17----------
just do it


---------109:18----------
uh three minutes twice a day yep sure


---------109:22----------
yeah i think i could i think i could do


---------109:24----------
that


---------109:26----------
yeah right you could do you do like six


---------109:28----------
minutes


---------109:29----------
twice a week now is it bad that i can't


---------109:32----------
stop thinking about like


---------109:33----------
now i'm making a list of my head of


---------109:35----------
everything that i thought about and


---------109:36----------
trying to figure out why i thought about


---------109:37----------
it like this is the type of


---------109:39----------
this is the type of mental gymnastics


---------109:41----------
that i'll do frequently


---------109:43----------
like right yeah is it bad i mean who the


---------109:46----------
[ __ ] cares you're doing it


---------109:47----------
so yeah yeah i think it's okay so so


---------109:50----------
your mind is naturally exploratory


---------109:53----------
i think it's part of the reason that


---------109:54----------
you're so insightful and you move so


---------109:56----------
quick and i don't have to lead you


---------109:57----------
places


---------109:57----------
so it's a double-edged sword i think the


---------109:59----------
main thing is it's a faculty ultimately


---------110:01----------
what i think is bad


---------110:02----------
is your inability to control it


---------110:05----------
yeah but if it's i mean if you know now


---------110:08----------
your mind is excited about why you


---------110:10----------
thought all those things okay fine let


---------110:11----------
it let it let go


---------110:13----------
cool i mean you're my you're it's not


---------110:15----------
fine whatever


---------110:16----------
just return to the practice as long as


---------110:17----------
you keep going back to the practice


---------110:19----------
your brain will change okay


---------110:22----------
yeah thank you you're very welcome any


---------110:25----------
last kind of thoughts or questions


---------110:27----------
about today definitely not even uh


---------110:30----------
what i expected to be talking about it


---------110:33----------
was way more helpful than


---------110:36----------
it's it's funny how that happens i'm a


---------110:37----------
little bit curious what did you find


---------110:39----------
helpful i know we covered a lot of


---------110:41----------
ground like what would you say were some


---------110:42----------
of your takeaways from today


---------110:44----------
uh i i think the i i think


---------110:47----------
you know the big things are just


---------110:51----------
how i can be more present uh


---------110:54----------
for for my family and kind of maybe what


---------110:56----------
some of those hold ups are


---------110:58----------
uh and maybe there's a level of


---------111:00----------
avoidance that i didn't fully


---------111:03----------
uh realize and then also


---------111:06----------
some of the identity things and the fact


---------111:09----------
that


---------111:10----------
even in areas where i thought that i had


---------111:11----------
given up control i


---------111:13----------
am completely in control of those and


---------111:16----------
choose who i surrounded myself with


---------111:19----------
and uh trying to to


---------111:22----------
piece together what that means and then


---------111:24----------
also i think one of my biggest takeaways


---------111:25----------
too


---------111:26----------
is just there's


---------111:29----------
a level of exploration and learning that


---------111:32----------
i can still


---------111:32----------
do about myself that's way larger than i


---------111:35----------
i mean i


---------111:36----------
obviously already knew that you know


---------111:38----------
that that's a big part of life and it's


---------111:39----------
in


---------111:40----------
one of the good things about life is is


---------111:42----------
getting to to find out all those crazy


---------111:44----------
things but i definitely think


---------111:45----------
maybe i should uh focus on this more


---------111:48----------
actively than i currently do


---------111:50----------
awesome man yeah i think it's um i think


---------111:52----------
you're you know


---------111:53----------
you've got the stats for it so if you


---------111:56----------
decide to


---------111:57----------
you know if you decide to walk that


---------111:58----------
journey i think you'll go really far


---------112:01----------
and best of luck to you rich yeah i


---------112:03----------

---------112:05----------
