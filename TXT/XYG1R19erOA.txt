---------00:00----------
i know that this past week has been very


---------00:02----------
exciting in terms of election stuff


---------00:04----------
but we are actually very excited because


---------00:06----------
november 9th is a big day for us we're


---------00:08----------
going to be launching a bunch of spots


---------00:09----------
or opening up a bunch of spots


---------00:11----------
in our coaching program so if you guys


---------00:13----------
haven't been able to get into the


---------00:15----------
program we hope that you all will be


---------00:16----------
able to get in on


---------00:17----------
november 9th coaching for those of y'all


---------00:19----------
who don't know is not a medical


---------00:21----------
treatment so it doesn't


---------00:23----------
it's not designed to treat depression or


---------00:25----------
anxiety or anything like that


---------00:27----------
it's really for people who feel kind of


---------00:28----------
stuck unmotivated


---------00:30----------
don't know how to kind of move forward


---------00:32----------
in life um


---------00:34----------
maybe feel like they don't know what to


---------00:35----------
do with themselves or things like that


---------00:37----------
it's basically like designed for the


---------00:38----------
problems of our community


---------00:40----------
we're you know if you really think about


---------00:42----------
medical treatment it's like


---------00:43----------
anti-depression right like so


---------00:45----------
like antidepressants we're not really


---------00:47----------
like anti-depression we're more like pro


---------00:49----------
happy


---------00:50----------
so it's about building a life that's fun


---------00:52----------
finding a community that you enjoy


---------00:53----------
doing like helping yourself helping you


---------00:56----------
learn about your behaviors and what


---------00:58----------
controls your behaviors and your


---------00:59----------
emotions so that you can start acting


---------01:01----------
in a way that's aligned with your values


---------01:04----------
and so that's that's a big part of what


---------01:06----------
we do in coaching


---------01:08----------
and today we actually have a stream to


---------01:10----------
kind of hopefully reflect on some of


---------01:11----------
those


---------01:12----------
issues so we're going to be talking with


---------01:13----------
someone from our community about


---------01:15----------
self-esteem and confidence


---------01:17----------
so we'll see where that goes


---------01:21----------
okay and welcome um thanks for coming on


---------01:26----------

---------01:41----------

---------01:52----------
deal


---------01:52----------
yeah just in a second okay


---------01:58----------
okay do you want to sorry nope for what


---------02:02----------
for using my techniques against me yeah


---------02:05----------
i said this day would come they said


---------02:07----------

---------02:09----------
[Laughter]


---------02:14----------
yeah so what are you nervous about it's


---------02:16----------
okay to be nervous


---------02:17----------
oh um i don't know i've been nervous


---------02:21----------
this whole week to


---------02:23----------
to talk to you and like be on stream


---------02:27----------
okay but um let's start with what does


---------02:30----------
that mean


---------02:31----------
you've been nervous all week can you


---------02:33----------
tell us about that um


---------02:35----------
like uh my heart wouldn't


---------02:38----------
like stop beating if i thought about it


---------02:41----------
and like


---------02:42----------
i just my stomach hurt all the time and


---------02:46----------
like oh my god


---------02:48----------
sorry that sounds really oh


---------02:51----------
what are you sorry for


---------02:54----------
i don't uh like


---------02:59----------
i don't know okay do you feel like you


---------03:02----------
did something wrong


---------03:03----------
do you feel like you did something wrong


---------03:05----------
just now


---------03:06----------
a little bit yeah it's weird right yeah


---------03:10----------
yeah sometimes we feel like we do things


---------03:12----------
wrong


---------03:14----------
and so if i were to tell you i don't


---------03:17----------
think you've done anything wrong


---------03:20----------
how would you what happens


---------03:23----------
in you if i say that


---------03:27----------
um i think i'd have like


---------03:30----------
split uh reactions like


---------03:33----------
one would be like oh okay he doesn't


---------03:35----------
think i did something wrong


---------03:37----------
but then the other would be like well i


---------03:39----------
i feel like i did something


---------03:41----------
very good yeah yeah it's weird how that


---------03:44----------
works right


---------03:45----------
so there's a part of you that is


---------03:46----------
reassured and then there's a part of you


---------03:48----------
that's


---------03:49----------
not reassured yeah yeah


---------03:52----------
cool were you were you nervous about


---------03:55----------
doing a bad job


---------03:57----------
yes well you're doing an awesome job


---------04:00----------
really because even when you share with


---------04:02----------
us that like hey there's a part of me


---------04:04----------
that would be reassured and there's a


---------04:05----------
part of me that would be like


---------04:07----------
i'm still doing a bad job he's just


---------04:09----------
being nice


---------04:10----------
yeah i'm actually messing up right


---------04:14----------
and and sometimes i didn't even do


---------04:15----------
anything yet


---------04:17----------
right so so here's the thing so if we


---------04:20----------
really look at that


---------04:21----------
um minnie it's like the feeling of doing


---------04:24----------
a bad


---------04:24----------
job doesn't actually come from our


---------04:27----------
interaction it doesn't come from


---------04:29----------
anything that you do


---------04:30----------
it just comes from you


---------04:33----------
yeah right and you're doing a great job


---------04:37----------
because this is exactly what people


---------04:39----------
with is what we're here to do you're


---------04:40----------
doing it even if you do a bad job that's


---------04:42----------
still a good job because people


---------04:43----------
come here to do a bad job and then we


---------04:47----------
learn about it


---------04:48----------
and so you can't you literally can't do


---------04:50----------
a bad job


---------04:53----------
but you can try i like your room


---------04:56----------
sorry uh no it looks great thank you


---------05:02----------
what do you like about it i like the


---------05:04----------
chair


---------05:05----------
in the back yeah it's a cool chair


---------05:12----------
sorry what did we mess up again


---------05:15----------
no no i um i'm just getting flustered


---------05:19----------
i'm okay


---------05:20----------
okay okay it's okay to get flustered


---------05:24----------
it's gonna be a painful hour and a half


---------05:26----------
minnie


---------05:27----------
[Laughter]


---------05:29----------
good luck with that


---------05:32----------
can i drink some water please absolutely


---------05:37----------
drink water stay hydrated


---------05:41----------
we're gonna need it um


---------05:44----------
so i understand that you wanted to talk


---------05:47----------
some about self-esteem and


---------05:49----------
and confidence yeah can you tell me what


---------05:52----------
you mean by that


---------05:54----------
um so


---------05:58----------
hmm where'd i start so i


---------06:04----------
i've kind of when i was little i didn't


---------06:07----------
really


---------06:07----------
struggle with like confidence issues


---------06:11----------
like i thought i was really cool and


---------06:15----------
i didn't worry too much about like


---------06:17----------
messing up or anything


---------06:20----------
um i mean i did but it wasn't


---------06:23----------
to the point of like you know shaking my


---------06:26----------
leg and


---------06:27----------
uh having a panic attack but


---------06:32----------
uh but like


---------06:35----------
in i think near the


---------06:38----------
end of middle school and then all the


---------06:41----------
way up till now


---------06:44----------
um i i've


---------06:48----------
i i've been noticing that i don't


---------06:51----------
really feel good about myself


---------06:55----------
at all okay i kind of just hate myself


---------06:59----------
okay um yeah so i guess


---------07:03----------
that's what we're here to talk about


---------07:06----------
cool


---------07:06----------
i mean you know not cool that you do


---------07:08----------
that but cool that you're here to talk


---------07:10----------
about it


---------07:11----------
um and i i noticed that when you say i


---------07:12----------
kind of hate myself you laugh


---------07:16----------
right and and what's your understanding


---------07:19----------
of of


---------07:20----------
what you feel when you say that and why


---------07:22----------
you laugh


---------07:24----------
um well i kind of laugh


---------07:29----------
when i talk about my prob like problems


---------07:33----------
because i feel like if i


---------07:36----------
say it in a serious tone um people are


---------07:40----------
gonna think that like


---------07:44----------
it's too much and


---------07:47----------
yeah yeah okay


---------07:51----------
so i guess i just like laugh when i


---------07:55----------
when i'm saying something


---------07:58----------
uh regarding like my mental health


---------08:02----------
sure so when you say people are gonna


---------08:04----------
think it's too much


---------08:06----------
what would be too much about it


---------08:12----------
what's more than people can handle what


---------08:15----------
makes it more than people can handle


---------08:20----------
well i think


---------08:24----------
when


---------08:27----------
when someone talks about like


---------08:30----------
if they're feeling sad or upset or


---------08:33----------
anxious or something


---------08:34----------
um i usually think that


---------08:37----------
people won't like to hear about it so


---------08:41----------
yeah because yeah because that kind of


---------08:45----------
stuff


---------08:45----------
like spreads what do you mean that kind


---------08:48----------
of stuff spreads what does that mean


---------08:50----------
like i think


---------08:54----------
talking to someone with


---------08:58----------
um anxiety and depression can like


---------09:03----------
at first you can it can be helpful to


---------09:06----------
talk to them but like you can also get


---------09:08----------
trained in the process of like


---------09:11----------
talking to them so i don't want to do


---------09:15----------
that to other people


---------09:17----------
okay so what i'm hearing you say is that


---------09:20----------
sometimes


---------09:21----------
you can it can feel good to talk to


---------09:23----------
other people but then


---------09:24----------
you can almost become addicted to


---------09:28----------
burdening them yeah


---------09:32----------
yeah definitely okay so i noticed that


---------09:35----------
you said that's a


---------09:36----------
good word yeah yeah yeah


---------09:40----------
i choose my words carefully um


---------09:43----------
so let's think about a couple things i i


---------09:45----------
want us to pay attention to okay minnie


---------09:48----------
one is people are gonna think


---------09:52----------
right so so like let's see how much of


---------09:56----------
what causes you suffering


---------10:00----------
is people are gonna think so that's


---------10:02----------
gonna be like a key phrase


---------10:04----------
that we're going to look out for okay


---------10:06----------
okay


---------10:07----------
um second thing is you know i think that


---------10:09----------
being a burden


---------10:10----------
is something that we can also kind of


---------10:12----------
keep an eye out for


---------10:15----------
um and so let's see if we can pay


---------10:16----------
attention and even if people are


---------10:17----------
watching


---------10:18----------
um if they can sort of like pay


---------10:20----------
attention like let's see if we can learn


---------10:21----------
and maybe


---------10:22----------
okay but you can see it too okay


---------10:25----------
so you said that um around seventh or


---------10:28----------
eighth grade you started to


---------10:30----------
use a strong word you said hate yourself


---------10:32----------
or you said that you hate yourself


---------10:34----------
what do you hate about yourself


---------10:38----------
well like i kind of hate


---------10:42----------
myself well i was thinking about this


---------10:44----------
the other day


---------10:46----------
and good for you


---------10:50----------
um like exterior wise


---------10:53----------
i just hate how i look but


---------10:56----------
interior wise like on the


---------11:00----------
inside i just feel like i'm a shitty


---------11:02----------
person


---------11:04----------
it when it's extreme and like i just


---------11:07----------
feel like


---------11:09----------
i cause people around me like


---------11:12----------
sadness and i don't like that about


---------11:15----------
myself


---------11:16----------
you close people around you sadness


---------11:19----------
burden


---------11:21----------
yeah burden there it is okay so good so


---------11:24----------
we caught it okay so and you say on the


---------11:27----------
exterior


---------11:28----------
so that's a strange


---------11:33----------
it sounds to me like you're trying to


---------11:34----------
avoid saying something


---------11:36----------
when you say on the exterior we i assume


---------11:39----------
we're talking about your physical


---------11:40----------
appearance


---------11:40----------
yes yes okay sorry my words sometimes


---------11:44----------
like yeah i i like


---------11:48----------
try to think of a word to say but then


---------11:50----------
like i can't really think about it


---------11:54----------
yeah um


---------11:59----------
so i'm not gonna try to be harsh here


---------12:01----------
but case


---------12:02----------
case in point we just had a i don't know


---------12:03----------
if you were watching the stream but we


---------12:05----------
just had someone say that they


---------12:06----------
you know they're ugly and me and


---------12:10----------
no no no no not you oh they're like they


---------12:13----------
were talking about themselves


---------12:14----------
that's true no don't say that but if


---------12:17----------
they said that about wait hold on so you


---------12:19----------
say don't say that about themselves but


---------12:20----------
if they had said that about you


---------12:22----------
then then what would be your reaction i


---------12:24----------
mean i'd agree


---------12:26----------
let's say


---------12:30----------
right no no so they were talking about


---------12:32----------
themselves


---------12:34----------
right so and and so i'm just curious


---------12:36----------
whether that


---------12:37----------
word feels loaded to you and you avoid


---------12:39----------
using it for a particular reason


---------12:42----------
which which word ugly


---------12:46----------
um yeah it's a


---------12:49----------
it's a loaded word yeah definitely


---------12:52----------
and what's it loaded with


---------12:56----------
it's like a lot of


---------13:00----------
i mean when i think of the word ugly it


---------13:03----------
can't ever be like


---------13:04----------
good if that makes sense


---------13:07----------
yep so there's that and then


---------13:10----------
it can make other people really sad if


---------13:13----------
you say to them


---------13:15----------
[Music]


---------13:16----------
then ah yeah


---------13:20----------
okay so i'm gonna ask you a couple of


---------13:23----------
questions


---------13:24----------
okay okay so number one is ugly is like


---------13:28----------
comes with permanence and hopelessness


---------13:30----------
there's like no chance for change


---------13:33----------
yeah wait


---------13:37----------
well to


---------13:44----------
i don't know i think


---------13:49----------
but at the same time i think ugly is


---------13:51----------
kind of subjective


---------13:53----------
like okay i would agree


---------13:57----------
but okay so see like what just


---------14:00----------
happened there like


---------14:04----------
so it's interesting right because we you


---------14:05----------
kind of talked just earlier you said


---------14:07----------
like ugly is like


---------14:08----------
can't do anything about that but then


---------14:12----------
so i want you to notice as we just start


---------14:14----------
to like look at your


---------14:15----------
your feelings and not we don't say


---------14:17----------
you're wrong


---------14:19----------
right so i i didn't say minnie don't


---------14:21----------
think that about yourself


---------14:23----------
you know you're beautiful we're all


---------14:24----------
beautiful


---------14:26----------
that's what my friends like to say yeah


---------14:29----------
right and


---------14:30----------
so let's think about that so so i i


---------14:32----------
think if people


---------14:33----------
i mean the impression that i got was


---------14:34----------
that you had a little bit of a light


---------14:35----------
bulb go off in your head


---------14:39----------
as we started to look at ugliness it


---------14:41----------
sounded like you felt pretty hopeless


---------14:42----------
about it but then you were like but


---------14:43----------
actually


---------14:44----------
it's actually kind of subjective so i


---------14:46----------
don't know if we got to the point of


---------14:47----------
maybe i'm not


---------14:49----------
but i got the sense you were looking at


---------14:52----------
it in a way that was a little bit


---------14:56----------
calmer


---------14:58----------
and the interesting thing is what


---------14:59----------
happens when when you feel ugly and you


---------15:01----------
tell your friends when you burden them


---------15:03----------
right and what do you say to them


---------15:06----------
about what i about being feeling ugly or


---------15:10----------
feeling


---------15:11----------
like you don't like your exterior as you


---------15:13----------
put i don't know like


---------15:14----------
i was just talking about this with my


---------15:16----------
other friend yesterday


---------15:18----------
um i was telling her i felt like not


---------15:21----------
confident about


---------15:23----------
how i look and then she was telling me


---------15:25----------
that like


---------15:26----------
um that i was kind of like self-sabot


---------15:29----------
sabotage


---------15:30----------
sabotaging myself then i told earth that


---------15:33----------
i'm


---------15:34----------
sorry and i i sound really frustrating


---------15:37----------
and i felt that too like that's what i


---------15:39----------
told her


---------15:43----------
and so let's think about that exchange


---------15:46----------
right so


---------15:47----------
you express a vulnerability to her


---------15:51----------
she tries to help you with it


---------15:54----------
tries to maybe reassure you maybe tries


---------15:57----------
to give you a way forward


---------15:59----------
and then how do you respond


---------16:04----------
i'm sorry yeah right


---------16:07----------
so let's think about that so so um so


---------16:10----------
that's just that's one possibility so


---------16:12----------
that's gonna be the possibility


---------16:14----------
of reassurance or problem solving like


---------16:17----------
if we were to tell you minnie i think


---------16:19----------
that you are not ugly at all


---------16:20----------
i think you're a wonderful person


---------16:23----------
actually that's not even about your


---------16:24----------
physical


---------16:25----------
appearance i've trained myself so hard


---------16:28----------
to not comment on people's physical


---------16:31----------
appearance that i find it


---------16:32----------
actually hard to comment yeah


---------16:36----------
like so if because i think it just it


---------16:38----------
just messes things up but if i were to


---------16:40----------
call you pretty if i said minnie you're


---------16:41----------
very pretty


---------16:43----------
right what would you say how how would


---------16:46----------
you react


---------16:47----------
i'd probably say thank you like


---------16:50----------
yeah but then on the inside i probably


---------16:53----------
think


---------16:54----------
no okay so there's an important lesson


---------16:58----------
to be learned here right so the first


---------16:59----------
thing is that like


---------17:00----------
when people try to tell you that you're


---------17:02----------
wrong you just


---------17:04----------
dig your heels in he heals and deeper


---------17:06----------
right like you're just like no


---------17:08----------
incorrect yeah okay like my immediate


---------17:11----------
response


---------17:12----------
yep and so then then okay so we've got


---------17:16----------
burden we've got sort of the the idea of


---------17:18----------
like reassurance


---------17:19----------
doesn't really work um


---------17:24----------
so let's try to figure out if there's


---------17:25----------
some way that we can help you with those


---------17:27----------
feelings


---------17:28----------
without telling you that you're wrong so


---------17:30----------
you said


---------17:31----------
kind of switching gears for a second i'm


---------17:32----------
going to ask you a little bit more about


---------17:34----------
your past is that okay


---------17:35----------
okay sure so you said around seventh or


---------17:38----------
eighth grade is when you started to be


---------17:40----------
started to feel what exactly


---------17:43----------
just like self-hatred but also


---------17:48----------
a lot of depression like depressive


---------17:51----------
phase episodes and like anxiety


---------17:55----------
okay did you see and you're allowed to


---------17:57----------
not answer


---------17:58----------
any question you don't feel comfortable


---------18:00----------
with right but um


---------18:01----------
i think it would just be helpful did you


---------18:03----------
see a mental health provider who


---------18:05----------
during that time okay so it sounds um so


---------18:08----------
like


---------18:09----------
not then but starting high school


---------18:12----------
uh and then up until today like i saw


---------18:16----------
therapists and stuff okay and do you


---------18:19----------
find that helpful


---------18:22----------
yes and no good answer


---------18:26----------
so what's helpful and what isn't


---------18:29----------
so i've seen about six therapists


---------18:33----------
now because uh


---------18:36----------
half of them was because we just didn't


---------18:38----------
click


---------18:39----------
and then the other half was because i


---------18:41----------
had to either move or like


---------18:43----------
just technical things um


---------18:48----------
but all of them they were really helpful


---------18:52----------
in like helping me find resources like


---------18:56----------
like who to call when you're not okay or


---------18:59----------
like


---------19:01----------
um or just like yeah


---------19:04----------
stuff like that but and also they were


---------19:08----------
helpful with


---------19:09----------
helping me like identify a problem


---------19:13----------
that makes sense but then


---------19:16----------
i felt like and i've definitely made


---------19:18----------
progress


---------19:20----------
in like the sense that i can get up out


---------19:22----------
of bed now and do


---------19:23----------
work and that kind of stuff but


---------19:26----------
um i think everything after


---------19:31----------
realizing a problem and giving it


---------19:34----------
technical solutions hasn't really


---------19:38----------
worked out yet what do you mean by


---------19:40----------
technical solutions


---------19:42----------
like stuff that


---------19:45----------
um stuff like


---------19:49----------
like i still feel like [ __ ] but i can at


---------19:53----------
least like


---------19:54----------
sorry my brother passed by i still feel


---------19:56----------
like [ __ ] but


---------19:59----------
um i can at least like go about my day


---------20:02----------
now


---------20:03----------
okay so let me see if i


---------20:06----------
understood you correctly so it sounds


---------20:08----------
like um you know there have been times


---------20:10----------
where they provided you with resources


---------20:12----------
that have been helpful


---------20:13----------
um i commend you for you know not


---------20:16----------
sticking with people that you didn't


---------20:18----------
feel like were a good fit


---------20:20----------
i think that's really important so a lot


---------20:21----------
of people think that you know if they


---------20:23----------
see a therapist


---------20:24----------
and they don't like it they don't like


---------20:26----------
therapy but you may just


---------20:28----------
not like that therapist right it's kind


---------20:30----------
of like going to a restaurant and saying


---------20:31----------
oh i hate all restaurants and it's like


---------20:33----------
you just


---------20:34----------
may not like that kind of food right


---------20:37----------
um so that that's really awesome on your


---------20:39----------
part i think you


---------20:40----------
you know i i commend you for doing that


---------20:43----------
and what i'm also hearing from you is


---------20:44----------
huh yes sorry oh no you could you can


---------20:48----------
um so then the next thing that i kind of


---------20:50----------
heard which is


---------20:52----------
you know tricky but i'm glad you're


---------20:54----------
being honest about it is that like


---------20:56----------
you're kind of living your life like you


---------20:57----------
can get out of bed and stuff


---------20:59----------
but internally you still feel like [ __ ]


---------21:04----------
i think i can live my life to the extent


---------21:07----------
where


---------21:10----------
it doesn't pain other people to see me


---------21:14----------
upset like family and friends


---------21:19----------
but um yeah that's why i was


---------21:23----------
i wanted to talk about self-esteem


---------21:25----------
because i just feel like i'm not good


---------21:27----------
enough to try like


---------21:29----------
new things and and stuff


---------21:33----------
okay so there's that


---------21:37----------
look at you steering the conversation oh


---------21:40----------
no not me shocking


---------21:45----------
right now how do you feel when i point


---------21:48----------
that out to you


---------21:51----------
um


---------21:55----------
i feel like i've been called down called


---------21:58----------
out


---------21:58----------
yeah i called you up that's because


---------22:00----------
that's what i did yeah i feel to be


---------22:02----------
called out


---------22:04----------
bit embarrassed what are you embarrassed


---------22:07----------
by


---------22:10----------
um


---------22:16----------
uh i'm not i'm not sure


---------22:20----------
okay so the first thing is when i called


---------22:22----------
you out is that a good calling out or a


---------22:24----------
bad calling out


---------22:28----------
i'm not sure okay cool actually yeah


---------22:31----------
yeah so who are we here for today minnie


---------22:39----------
me yes


---------22:42----------
that is the correct answer how does that


---------22:44----------
feel


---------22:49----------
[Music]


---------22:52----------
uh


---------22:54----------
bit weird yes


---------22:57----------
yeah that is the right answer too what


---------23:00----------
feels weird about that


---------23:03----------
that i'm uh


---------23:07----------
having a therapy session with the dude i


---------23:11----------
saw


---------23:12----------
on youtube uh for the past month


---------23:16----------
in front of thousands of audience


---------23:20----------
again not the answer that i was


---------23:23----------
expecting but a fair one


---------23:25----------
what i was what i was expecting was


---------23:29----------
that you know like you don't we don't


---------23:33----------
i don't imagine that you do many things


---------23:35----------
in your life where you come first


---------23:38----------
where it's about you and it's about what


---------23:40----------
you want


---------23:41----------
right i'm not


---------23:46----------
i'm not sure if that's true tell me


---------23:48----------
about that i just


---------23:50----------
i don't know like um when i was getting


---------23:54----------
therapy


---------23:55----------
like for the first time um


---------23:58----------
i felt really selfish because


---------24:02----------
my mom didn't want me to


---------24:05----------
uh and my dad either i don't think they


---------24:09----------
realized i was depressed but i was


---------24:12----------
thinking


---------24:13----------
what's going on i guess just like


---------24:16----------
teenage angst or something and like i


---------24:19----------
was


---------24:20----------
having problems with like toxic


---------24:24----------
friends and stuff so i guess they


---------24:25----------
thought like we had a fight and i was


---------24:27----------
feeling sad about that


---------24:29----------
but i was kind of realizing that


---------24:35----------
um something was wrong so


---------24:38----------
i wanted to get therapy but


---------24:41----------
my mom was


---------24:45----------
well she didn't really like she


---------24:46----------
preferred she told me that she preferred


---------24:48----------
i didn't


---------24:49----------
get therapy but also i like told her i


---------24:52----------
wanted it so


---------24:54----------
she did look for a therapist but it was


---------24:57----------
taking like two months


---------25:01----------
and i needed help like then so i went to


---------25:04----------
like


---------25:05----------
my school counselor and then told her


---------25:06----------
about it and then i was kind of like


---------25:10----------
you know uh


---------25:14----------
taken to therapist okay


---------25:17----------
and then that didn't really


---------25:20----------
make my mom happy or am i done yeah so


---------25:23----------
why were they upset


---------25:27----------
i guess they just didn't want the school


---------25:29----------
to know


---------25:30----------
and they didn't want things to escalate


---------25:34----------
uh which i understand


---------25:38----------
because explain it to us


---------25:43----------
um


---------25:49----------
like i know


---------25:52----------
i feel like i should have waited two


---------25:55----------
months for my


---------25:56----------
first appointment that my mom


---------25:59----------
assigned me up for instead of


---------26:02----------
going to the therapist i mean going to


---------26:05----------
the school counselor the day after


---------26:08----------
and then telling her that i was feeling


---------26:11----------
really upset


---------26:12----------
and slightly suicidal


---------26:15----------
and stuff oh it's like it's just


---------26:18----------
like wait


---------26:21----------
sorry guys i shouldn't talk about


---------26:25----------
suicide so casually but like i mean hey


---------26:28----------
you do you this is your time minnie


---------26:32----------
there you go are you would you be


---------26:34----------
burdening people if you talked about


---------26:35----------
suicide what will people think how will


---------26:38----------
you affect others


---------26:40----------
i know some people can get very


---------26:44----------
uh triggered when suicide is talked


---------26:47----------
about casually


---------26:48----------
like i was kind of like that


---------26:51----------
when i was feeling suicidal so let's


---------26:54----------
understand that


---------26:57----------
um well


---------27:01----------
it was more so that when i was feeling


---------27:04----------
when i was very depressed and suicidal i


---------27:09----------
i would joke about it a lot


---------27:13----------
but then what


---------27:16----------
but then when other people did it it


---------27:18----------
made me a bit upset


---------27:22----------
so hypocritical of me but like yeah


---------27:28----------
so it looks like you just took a quick


---------27:30----------
chance to beat yourself up there


---------27:32----------
i did yeah did you not


---------27:36----------
does that what did i do you called


---------27:38----------
yourself a hypocrite


---------27:40----------
oh wait but like that was hypocritical


---------27:43----------
kind of


---------27:44----------
sure i i don't doubt that you have a


---------27:46----------
good reason for


---------27:47----------
feeling that way or believing that but i


---------27:50----------
just still want to point out that you


---------27:51----------
did it


---------27:52----------
right because when we beat ourselves up


---------27:54----------
like we don't have bad reasons


---------27:58----------
it's like when i look at myself in the


---------28:00----------
mirror i'm not like oh my god


---------28:01----------
why don't you have gills and flippers


---------28:04----------
look at how human like


---------28:05----------
we pick things that make sense all right


---------28:10----------
okay yeah yeah sorry it was no sorry


---------28:13----------
yeah um


---------28:17----------
okay so um can we actually go back to


---------28:21----------
seventh and eighth grade for a second


---------28:23----------
sure so uh


---------28:26----------
when did this stuff so you started to


---------28:28----------
feel what


---------28:29----------
around that time like end of middle


---------28:31----------
school


---------28:33----------
so like uh i was in a lot of


---------28:38----------
middle school drama


---------28:39----------
[Music]


---------28:42----------
with like friends during that time


---------28:45----------
so not like theater no no


---------28:49----------
no like uh like you know


---------28:52----------
fighting with friends and uh getting


---------28:55----------
backstabbed and


---------28:56----------
you know stuff like that


---------29:00----------
what do you mean getting backstabbed and


---------29:02----------
stuff like that


---------29:03----------
can you oh i don't want to get into the


---------29:06----------
middle school drama


---------29:08----------
um why not you don't have to but i'm


---------29:12----------
just curious why not oh um i just


---------29:14----------
i feel like i've i should be over it


---------29:18----------
kind of yeah okay should be over it


---------29:23----------
okay i just get another set


---------29:26----------
yes you can hydrate as often as you want


---------29:30----------
to


---------29:30----------
hydrate yourself um


---------29:34----------
so if someone says i should be over it


---------29:37----------
are they over it


---------29:38----------
no no right


---------29:43----------
and so you got to be careful minnie


---------29:44----------
because like i hear that also that self


---------29:46----------
judgment there that like


---------29:48----------
you're not over it and then we're not


---------29:50----------
going to talk about it because you


---------29:51----------
should be over it


---------29:54----------
yeah right so it's like if i'm bleeding


---------29:56----------
and it's like


---------29:57----------
oh my god i shouldn't be bleeding and


---------29:59----------
then i'm like do you want a bandage and


---------30:01----------
you're like no no no


---------30:02----------
no no i shouldn't leave you bleeding


---------30:05----------
so i i don't want the basic


---------30:09----------
and then like


---------30:14----------
how do you feel about telling us you


---------30:17----------
don't have to


---------30:18----------
but you know i think it's like i think


---------30:21----------
it's important


---------30:22----------
that i do though and i i want to


---------30:25----------
but like yeah but what but


---------30:28----------
the but the self-judgment part of me is


---------30:32----------
like


---------30:33----------
no okay good so now we're gonna pause


---------30:36----------
for a second before we get into it so


---------30:38----------
minnie i want you to pay attention to


---------30:39----------
what you're about to do because it's


---------30:40----------
about to be awesome


---------30:42----------
okay so you are judging yourself


---------30:45----------
and that voice inside of you is saying


---------30:47----------
you shouldn't say this


---------30:49----------
right it's like how dare you you should


---------30:51----------
be over it it's beating you up


---------30:54----------
and then you are about to not listen to


---------30:57----------
that voice


---------31:00----------
so remember that there are two ways to


---------31:02----------
deal with self-esteem


---------31:04----------
for lack of a better term or for just


---------31:06----------
one conception


---------31:07----------
right or one kind of structure to think


---------31:09----------
about one is that we make the


---------31:11----------
self-esteem the self-hateful thoughts


---------31:15----------
decrease so that we don't have them as


---------31:17----------
often


---------31:19----------
the second thing that we can do is not


---------31:21----------
listen to them


---------31:22----------
don't let them dictate our life


---------31:26----------
right so there's a difference between


---------31:27----------
that beast existing


---------31:29----------
and that beast controlling you


---------31:34----------
and so what i think is actually really


---------31:36----------
cool is that if you you know do tell us


---------31:37----------
the story now i feel like you can't


---------31:39----------
not tell us because then oh no


---------31:42----------
you really you don't you don't have to


---------31:43----------
but i just want to illustrate a point


---------31:45----------
but like you know because you don't want


---------31:47----------
to you're like i shouldn't i should be


---------31:48----------
over it like it's dumb but then you say


---------31:50----------
like i want to so like


---------31:51----------
there it's that same part that you talk


---------31:54----------
talk to us about where there's like


---------31:55----------
you know you know the the part of you


---------31:58----------
that says oh thank you very much and


---------31:59----------
then


---------32:00----------
but i'm still a terror you know they're


---------32:03----------
like


---------32:03----------
it's that war between the two parts of


---------32:05----------
you so you know if you share that story


---------32:07----------
with us what you're doing is actually


---------32:09----------
like learning how to like


---------32:10----------
not listen to that part it's gonna keep


---------32:13----------
speaking for a while


---------32:14----------
and we'll get to that but does that make


---------32:16----------
sense


---------32:17----------
yeah you are acting in spite of your low


---------32:19----------
self-esteem and your self-judgment which


---------32:21----------
i think is a really important skill


---------32:23----------
to have so what happened in middle


---------32:25----------
school i i could use a dose yes


---------32:28----------
you know decent 12 year old drama yes


---------32:32----------
it's friday afternoon you know


---------32:35----------
um yeah so


---------32:37----------
[Music]


---------32:40----------
sorry i'm just gonna think for okay


---------32:45----------
uh


---------32:50----------
okay i'll think i'll talk about the one


---------32:52----------
that affected me the most


---------32:54----------
um so i had


---------32:58----------
i had two friends um


---------33:03----------
we'll call one a and then we'll call one


---------33:05----------
b


---------33:07----------
um so and i


---------33:10----------
started and i were really good friends


---------33:12----------
in middle school


---------33:14----------
um but


---------33:18----------
she was


---------33:21----------
um starting like seventh eighth grade


---------33:26----------
she started getting very depressed for


---------33:28----------
her own reasons


---------33:30----------
um and i really


---------33:34----------
wanted to like help her not be depressed


---------33:38----------
because


---------33:38----------
you know it made me sad that she was sad


---------33:43----------
i think honestly in retrospect i did it


---------33:47----------
more out of like


---------33:49----------
me not wanting to feel sad around her


---------33:51----------
rather than me wanting to help her


---------33:54----------
but but so i tried to help her


---------33:58----------
you know be there for her hear her when


---------34:01----------
she


---------34:02----------
like ranted about stuff uh but then like


---------34:07----------
you know i didn't understand that she


---------34:10----------
needed a therapist


---------34:11----------
back then so


---------34:15----------
so the summer before high school started


---------34:19----------
um she tried to like attempt suicide


---------34:23----------
um and it was kind of traumatic for me


---------34:26----------
because


---------34:27----------
for like three days i couldn't reach her


---------34:30----------
like through phone or anything


---------34:32----------
and uh the last thing she said was like


---------34:36----------
i love you


---------34:37----------
so i was like the [ __ ] going on and


---------34:40----------
then i even went to her house


---------34:43----------
and then only after three days


---------34:47----------
like she finally texted me saying that


---------34:49----------
she was at the hospital


---------34:50----------
and i couldn't really go see her


---------34:54----------
because like both our parents were like


---------34:58----------
both her parents and mine were like


---------35:00----------
let's not like you know


---------35:03----------
so uh


---------35:06----------
so she did that but she was she did not


---------35:10----------
you know she only attempted but she was


---------35:12----------
still alive and stuff


---------35:14----------
uh so


---------35:18----------
there was that you know


---------35:21----------
dealing with her this doesn't sound like


---------35:24----------
middle school drama to me


---------35:27----------
oh um this is the last middle school


---------35:29----------
drama this is like


---------35:30----------
actual like scary events


---------35:33----------
yeah i was like


---------35:36----------
i was like i'm not i'm a little bit


---------35:39----------
terrified how this is


---------35:41----------
into like middle school drama because we


---------35:43----------
haven't heard anything about b


---------35:45----------
it's like is b gonna start you came for


---------35:48----------
the


---------35:48----------
like you came for the beast but you left


---------35:51----------
with like


---------35:53----------
back okay yeah you came for the what


---------35:57----------
oh no nothing yeah


---------36:00----------
so um there's there was that and then


---------36:04----------
uh entirety of freshman year was just


---------36:07----------
like


---------36:08----------
us being depressed together and then


---------36:11----------
uh at the end of freshman year she moved


---------36:14----------
schools


---------36:15----------
uh without like telling me uh


---------36:18----------
and then like i also moved schools


---------36:22----------
uh because i didn't really want to be in


---------36:24----------
that school


---------36:26----------
uh so that's the first a friend


---------36:30----------
then be friend um


---------36:34----------
be friend i was friends with her in


---------36:37----------
middle school as well


---------36:39----------
and then this was like seventh to eighth


---------36:41----------
grade


---------36:43----------
uh she started liking me but then


---------36:47----------
um so a little background i grew up like


---------36:51----------
very christian um


---------36:54----------
all the way up until like eighth grade


---------36:57----------
um


---------36:59----------
and i didn't really learn about like uh


---------37:02----------
sexual identity all the way until like


---------37:06----------
seventh grade in middle school because


---------37:08----------
no one taught me about it


---------37:11----------
um so she started liking me


---------37:14----------
and then and then like


---------37:18----------
we used to exchange letters like


---------37:21----------
even though we saw each other every day


---------37:24----------
uh


---------37:25----------
and i thought it was like a friend thing


---------37:28----------
but like


---------37:28----------
clearly it was not um


---------37:31----------
and then made it clear that it wasn't


---------37:34----------
well i mean like i don't think


---------37:36----------
friends really exchange like


---------37:40----------
two to three pages of letter every day


---------37:43----------
okay but i guess i thought that true um


---------37:47----------
so one day it's like actually a pretty


---------37:48----------
cool friendship


---------37:51----------
yeah if there was a friendship like that


---------37:54----------
but anyway i don't mean to derail you


---------37:55----------
sorry


---------37:56----------
yeah i kind of miss her but like


---------38:01----------
so there's that and then just a little


---------38:03----------
bit


---------38:05----------
just um and then she


---------38:09----------
she liked me so one day she gave me like


---------38:14----------
a love letter and then


---------38:18----------
i i checked it when i got home


---------38:21----------
and uh i


---------38:25----------
i was smiling a lot when i read it for


---------38:28----------
some reason


---------38:30----------
but then like i told my mom about it


---------38:33----------
and uh because my mom and i are pretty


---------38:37----------
close


---------38:39----------
uh or like back then we were still


---------38:42----------
i mean yeah we were close uh


---------38:45----------
but then she was like i don't know she


---------38:48----------
she had this weird reaction


---------38:50----------
where she was like oh you know like it's


---------38:53----------
probably just as a friend or something


---------38:57----------
uh and she told me that like she like


---------39:01----------
she liked girls when she was young too


---------39:03----------
but it was just like


---------39:04----------
confusion and she like she basically


---------39:08----------
told me


---------39:09----------
like you're probably a bit confused and


---------39:10----------
so she and i was like


---------39:12----------
and then she told me that i shouldn't


---------39:13----------
like stay friends with people like that


---------39:16----------
because they'll


---------39:17----------
confuse me more so i was like


---------39:20----------
really confused um


---------39:25----------
it's a common state for middle schoolers


---------39:27----------
yes


---------39:28----------
confused and scared um


---------39:32----------
but and then so i got the letter and


---------39:35----------
then


---------39:36----------
uh i had the exchange with my mom and


---------39:38----------
then


---------39:39----------
i had this weird


---------39:43----------
like and i started like


---------39:46----------
realizing i'm seeing this girl the same


---------39:48----------
way as i see a dude


---------39:51----------
uh so then i got really scared for some


---------39:55----------
reason


---------39:56----------
i still don't know why uh


---------39:59----------
so i got really scared and then and i


---------40:02----------
did


---------40:03----------
the worst thing possible and i just


---------40:05----------
started avoiding her


---------40:08----------
uh in true middle school fashion


---------40:12----------
so we avoided each i avoided her


---------40:15----------
and then she tried to confront me once


---------40:19----------
but then i like ran away like quite


---------40:22----------
literally


---------40:23----------
so we stopped being friends but then


---------40:26----------
like


---------40:27----------
a few other people started thinking i


---------40:29----------
was homophobic


---------40:32----------
so i was like oh no and i tried to tell


---------40:36----------
them i wasn't


---------40:37----------
but like you know they


---------40:40----------
they kind of didn't want to hear me so


---------40:43----------
so that happened


---------40:45----------
and then this was in eighth grade


---------40:48----------
and then i got really depressed after


---------40:51----------
sunny


---------40:52----------
after i tried to commit like


---------40:55----------
suicide and then


---------41:00----------
uh i got really depressed and


---------41:06----------
i really missed be like


---------41:09----------
i really missed befriend so i wanted to


---------41:12----------
like


---------41:13----------
talk to her again right so i started


---------41:16----------
like


---------41:17----------
messaging her and then talking to her


---------41:19----------
again before high school


---------41:21----------
started without having


---------41:24----------
uh ever apologized to her


---------41:28----------
uh and like


---------41:32----------
and like that was like my first mistake


---------41:38----------
and then and


---------41:41----------
this is where things get like kind of


---------41:45----------
shitty


---------41:45----------
and like yeah okay


---------41:49----------
but how's your nervousness by the way


---------41:53----------
right now like up the roof and gone


---------41:57----------
up through like


---------42:00----------
through the roof and god okay


---------42:04----------
keep going so you said okay and things


---------42:06----------
get really bad


---------42:07----------
okay so then if i really bad i just mean


---------42:12----------
like


---------42:13----------
now i make a lot of actual shitty


---------42:16----------
mistakes


---------42:17----------
uh and then i realized in


---------42:20----------
my freshman year of high school that i


---------42:22----------
liked her a lot


---------42:24----------
uh like in a non-straight way


---------42:29----------
so i was really confused about that uh


---------42:33----------
and then she but


---------42:36----------
at the time when i realized i liked her


---------42:39----------
she had a girlfriend


---------42:42----------
so so i


---------42:45----------
i knew about them and i like supported


---------42:47----------
them too


---------42:48----------
i like you know


---------42:52----------
uh like this one time b told me to like


---------42:57----------
he asked me if like i could get


---------42:59----------
chocolates for her girlfriend and then


---------43:01----------
she would pay me back


---------43:02----------
so i agreed to that um


---------43:05----------
like stuff like that uh


---------43:10----------
so then i started liking her and then


---------43:15----------
uh i really wanted to tell


---------43:18----------
her because like things were


---------43:22----------
getting a bit like too hard for me to


---------43:25----------
handle


---------43:27----------
what was getting hard for you to handle


---------43:29----------
like i felt like


---------43:31----------
i had to tell her because


---------43:34----------
um it was


---------43:37----------
getting in the way of like me


---------43:40----------
functioning normally around her


---------43:43----------
so


---------43:50----------
maybe i was


---------43:54----------
um yeah but then like she had a


---------43:57----------
girlfriend so


---------43:58----------
you're not really supposed to do that


---------44:01----------
but like


---------44:02----------
i did uh you're not supposed to do what


---------44:06----------
like fall in love with people who are in


---------44:08----------
relationships


---------44:09----------
yeah okay


---------44:12----------
okay so then i told her about it


---------44:16----------
but i told her that i i wasn't trying to


---------44:19----------
do anything i just wanted to like


---------44:23----------
her to acknowledge it and then tell me


---------44:25----------
like it can't happen


---------44:27----------
and tell me to move on which is which is


---------44:29----------
what she told me so like


---------44:31----------
so then i was like okay um oh sorry guys


---------44:36----------
so you did share with her and she said


---------44:38----------
i'm sorry i'm with someone i want you to


---------44:39----------
move on


---------44:40----------
yeah okay and then i was like okay now


---------44:43----------
we can be


---------44:45----------
friends again um but like


---------44:50----------
uh i found this out way later but


---------44:54----------
she told me i mean no she


---------44:57----------
uh when i told her about it she told her


---------44:59----------
girlfriend


---------45:01----------
and then they had a fight and broke up


---------45:05----------
uh so


---------45:08----------
so then b started ignoring me


---------45:13----------
uh and then that got me really anxious


---------45:18----------
uh because like yeah and then


---------45:23----------
so after her ignoring me for two weeks


---------45:27----------
like


---------45:28----------
i confronted her about it i was like hey


---------45:30----------
like could you just like please talk to


---------45:32----------
me


---------45:32----------
i'm sorry if i did something wrong


---------45:34----------
because i didn't know she told her


---------45:36----------
girlfriend that they


---------45:37----------
yeah so


---------45:40----------
uh so i confronted her and this was in


---------45:45----------
the middle school lunch cafeteria we


---------45:48----------
were


---------45:48----------
in the middle school yeah uh


---------45:52----------
well we were there for a class um


---------45:56----------
but like we were there right and people


---------45:59----------
are relatively


---------46:00----------
quiet so it's just me and her talking


---------46:03----------
uh because we had a sub


---------46:07----------
that day and like i remember i was


---------46:10----------
asking her hey what did i do wrong like


---------46:12----------
could you please tell me


---------46:13----------
and stuff like that and then she told me


---------46:16----------
that


---------46:18----------
uh she told me that


---------46:22----------
she never really like liked me from the


---------46:26----------
beginning and that uh


---------46:30----------
and that uh she was tired of hearing me


---------46:34----------
like talk about being depressed all the


---------46:36----------
time


---------46:39----------
and that i was making people around me


---------46:43----------
like


---------46:44----------
tired and stuff so


---------46:48----------
that was like our last conversation


---------46:52----------
before freshman year ended and then and


---------46:55----------
then i moved


---------46:57----------
uh


---------47:00----------
yeah and then okay


---------47:05----------
we actually did talk though on like


---------47:08----------
the phone and stuff


---------47:11----------
after after that like two years later


---------47:16----------
but it was just like


---------47:19----------
i don't really remember how it went but


---------47:21----------
we did talk but


---------47:22----------
we don't really talk we haven't talked


---------47:25----------
at all


---------47:26----------
for three years four years


---------47:29----------
five years yeah okay so


---------47:33----------
if i'm doing mental math then you're in


---------47:35----------
your early twenties


---------47:36----------
ballpark


---------47:40----------
mom i'm in a class


---------47:50----------
class


---------47:52----------
i'm 18.


---------47:56----------
yeah i'm in college i might i'm in my


---------47:58----------
freshman year of college


---------48:00----------
okay hence why i'm talking about middle


---------48:02----------
school drop


---------48:04----------
but uh yeah so


---------48:10----------
okay yeah that's it what are you


---------48:12----------
studying


---------48:14----------
uh i'm in this program where i choose my


---------48:18----------
major


---------48:18----------
two years later so i'm just studying


---------48:21----------
like


---------48:21----------
philosophy and stuff right now in the


---------48:24----------
meantime


---------48:24----------
your basics yeah basic stuff yeah okay


---------48:36----------
i'm thinking is that cool yeah no go


---------48:38----------
yeah can we just check in like how


---------48:40----------
you seem even though you say your


---------48:42----------
anxieties through the roof i get the


---------48:43----------
sense that you're actually like


---------48:45----------
more relaxed i am


---------48:48----------
yeah my heart is like not beating a lot


---------48:51----------
anymore so that's really good


---------48:53----------
okay um


---------48:57----------
how does it feel so you remember there


---------48:58----------
was that part of you that didn't want


---------49:00----------
you to speak


---------49:02----------
and how does that part feel right now


---------49:07----------
it's not saying anything right now but i


---------49:10----------
feel like


---------49:11----------
yeah but i feel like later on i'll


---------49:13----------
probably think why'd i do that


---------49:15----------
or something yep yeah so so i i think


---------49:18----------
that's also an important point that i


---------49:20----------
want to make is that


---------49:22----------
the parts of us so if we think about


---------49:24----------
anxiety


---------49:26----------
right anxiety like is a fear of the


---------49:28----------
future


---------49:29----------
it's afraid of what's going to happen


---------49:31----------
and then often times if we can actually


---------49:33----------
like overcome that hump


---------49:35----------
the actual reality is not what we


---------49:38----------
pictured


---------49:40----------
and our our brain is designed to imagine


---------49:44----------
bad things to keep us from doing


---------49:47----------
catastrophic make catastrophic mistakes


---------49:50----------
so it makes the things that we imagine


---------49:52----------
in the future actually be amplified


---------49:54----------
which is like evolutionary it's not


---------49:56----------
you know if i run across a snake in the


---------49:59----------
wilderness


---------50:01----------
and my brain is like well chances are if


---------50:03----------
i get bit it'll hurt a lot


---------50:05----------
and i'll be like out like we think about


---------50:07----------
death like our brain teaches us to fear


---------50:10----------
death and we take


---------50:11----------
dangers and then we actually amplify


---------50:13----------
them which is what it's supposed to do


---------50:15----------
but i want you to just notice that


---------50:16----------
because many i think a lot of times


---------50:18----------
going forward if you want to move


---------50:19----------
past your that voice in your head


---------50:23----------
all you've got to do is like get over


---------50:24----------
the hump but i know it's going to come


---------50:26----------
back it's definitely going to come back


---------50:30----------
but i just kind of wanted to point that


---------50:32----------
out so


---------50:36----------
yeah so i mean did other stuff continue


---------50:38----------
to happen in high school are there other


---------50:39----------
things that sort of


---------50:41----------
affected your self-esteem um


---------50:46----------
high school was like mentally i was


---------50:50----------
worse than i was in middle school but


---------50:53----------
like


---------50:54----------
nothing was actually like going on if


---------50:56----------
that makes sense


---------50:58----------
yeah what do you mean by mentally you


---------50:59----------
were worse like i wasn't


---------51:03----------
like sometimes i just couldn't go to


---------51:05----------
school even after i moved


---------51:07----------
out of the old one uh


---------51:11----------
uh like i was crying a lot


---------51:16----------
then i wanted to isolate myself a lot


---------51:19----------
and like you know uh


---------51:22----------
my grades went down a lot in freshman


---------51:25----------
year so


---------51:27----------
sophomore junior and senior was just me


---------51:29----------
trying to get them up


---------51:30----------
because my parents wanted them up so


---------51:38----------
oh yeah but like besides that like it


---------51:40----------
was just


---------51:41----------
me in my head rethinking uh


---------51:45----------
that things from middle school and


---------51:48----------
freshman year of high school over and


---------51:49----------
over again


---------51:51----------
so so you were you were replaying that


---------51:54----------
stuff


---------51:56----------
yeah okay a lot


---------52:02----------
okay can i share some thoughts with you


---------52:04----------
sure


---------52:05----------
so first of all good job today


---------52:08----------
um just a reminder that this is not


---------52:10----------
therapy right we're just talking about


---------52:12----------
your past


---------52:13----------
yeah um i'm glad you you do have


---------52:16----------
uh treat like a treatment team right um


---------52:20----------
so let so a lot of times


---------52:24----------
what we explore with people is where the


---------52:26----------
origins


---------52:27----------
of their beliefs about themselves come


---------52:30----------
from so the first thing


---------52:32----------
to understand this sounds kind of weird


---------52:34----------
but like you know when we were talking


---------52:36----------
earlier about reassurance and like you


---------52:38----------
feel basically like you're not a good


---------52:41----------
person


---------52:42----------
and that you burden people and that like


---------52:46----------
your hurt like


---------52:49----------
trickles out like almost like secondhand


---------52:51----------
smoke and then like


---------52:52----------
pollutes like yeah people's lives around


---------52:56----------
you right like your presence is like


---------52:58----------
you know it's like you're peeing in the


---------53:00----------
swimming pool and everyone else is in


---------53:02----------
the swimming pool and then like


---------53:03----------
oh no oh no


---------53:07----------
yeah um


---------53:10----------
so so that that's what i'm getting from


---------53:13----------
you is that you really feel like a


---------53:14----------
burden you feel like


---------53:15----------
you're not a good person you feel like


---------53:17----------
you mess up other people's lives by your


---------53:19----------
presence


---------53:23----------
and so what most people do is they would


---------53:25----------
reassure you right and they'd say like


---------53:26----------
no minnie like you're an amazing person


---------53:28----------
like you're beautiful


---------53:29----------
you're a force for positivity why'd you


---------53:31----------
say that in the british accent


---------53:33----------
like the british


---------53:37----------
because i'm i'm trying to poke fun at it


---------53:40----------
but but you know people will say oh


---------53:42----------
you know you're an amazing person i i do


---------53:44----------
think you are an amazing person


---------53:45----------
um i i actually i'm really optimistic


---------53:47----------
for you


---------53:49----------
um yeah and and i'll get to why but


---------53:52----------
i think the first thing that we've got


---------53:53----------
to do is that you're not dumb


---------53:55----------
unfortunately you are quite smart and so


---------53:59----------
the smarter you are if you have a belief


---------54:03----------
like this is the problem is that when we


---------54:04----------
try to when we see someone who's


---------54:06----------
struggling with a belief


---------54:08----------
we tell them they're wrong because


---------54:10----------
that's not what we see


---------54:13----------
right and so like but that's it's kind


---------54:15----------
of silly because you're not dumb like


---------54:17----------
that belief comes from somewhere


---------54:18----------
i think actually you're justified in


---------54:20----------
believing that you are a burden to other


---------54:22----------
people


---------54:24----------
i don't have i just don't think that


---------54:26----------
that's the whole story so let's just


---------54:28----------
take a step back and think about being a


---------54:29----------
burden


---------54:30----------
so the first thing is that we do burden


---------54:32----------
on other people


---------54:34----------
like that's true right so like if i'm


---------54:37----------
having a bad day and like i'm moody


---------54:39----------
like that's gonna affect my kids


---------54:44----------
right it's gonna affect my wife if my


---------54:46----------
wife is having a bad day my kids are


---------54:48----------
like you do affect the people around you


---------54:50----------
and sometimes you can affect the people


---------54:52----------
around you in a negative way like that's


---------54:54----------
not


---------54:54----------
false um i also think that i know this


---------54:58----------
is gonna sound crazy


---------55:00----------
but i i do think that you know if you


---------55:02----------
are sad and depressed


---------55:04----------
that it negatively affects the people


---------55:06----------
around you


---------55:08----------
i don't i i know it's weird so be


---------55:11----------
careful here because


---------55:13----------
i mean i i don't know how else to say it


---------55:14----------
but like when one person is depressed


---------55:16----------
like as a psychiatrist i work with


---------55:17----------
people who are depressed it's really


---------55:18----------
hard on their families


---------55:21----------
that's a fact now


---------55:26----------
even though that's true we have to ask


---------55:28----------
another question which is equally


---------55:30----------
important i think this is the question


---------55:31----------
you need to ask yourself


---------55:33----------
is it okay to do that


---------55:41----------
i don't i don't feel like


---------55:45----------
no okay like i i feel like


---------55:49----------
even though i know objectively that


---------55:53----------
they're my family because they are there


---------55:55----------
to support me


---------55:56----------
through hard times like like


---------56:00----------
on the inside like i really feel like


---------56:04----------
i shouldn't yep


---------56:07----------
so i get that right and


---------56:10----------
and see we said you're smart because you


---------56:13----------
know what the right answer is


---------56:15----------
and you're like i disagree with the


---------56:16----------
right answer which is entirely


---------56:18----------
acceptable


---------56:20----------
that is where i think you frankly we


---------56:23----------
you know we need to work on your beliefs


---------56:25----------
about what the world is and what human


---------56:27----------
beings deserve from one another


---------56:30----------
because i do think that's okay because i


---------56:32----------
think that's how life


---------56:34----------
works like i think it's i just don't see


---------56:36----------
how else


---------56:37----------
you know when i'm having a bad day i'm


---------56:38----------
gonna burden the people around me


---------56:40----------
and when other people are having a bad


---------56:42----------
day they're gonna burden me that


---------56:44----------
you know life is a multiplayer game it's


---------56:46----------
not a single player game and that


---------56:47----------
on any given day one of us is screwing


---------56:49----------
up


---------56:50----------
right now this is where you say like


---------56:52----------
okay fine even that's true the problem


---------56:54----------
is that i screw up more than everyone


---------56:56----------
else


---------56:58----------
right wait i'm like scared because you


---------57:00----------
just thought of what i was thinking


---------57:02----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------57:06----------
that's what we do here right


---------57:09----------
so like you say like in theory


---------57:12----------
fine you know i get to burden my parents


---------57:14----------
sometimes my parents get to burden me


---------57:16----------
but it's me burdening them all the


---------57:17----------
[ __ ] time


---------57:18----------
so it's not fair and that makes it not


---------57:20----------
okay because if it was even


---------57:22----------
fine okay


---------57:25----------
so this is why i think it's great that


---------57:26----------
you're 18. because you're just getting


---------57:28----------
started


---------57:29----------
there are gonna be a lot of people that


---------57:30----------
get to burden you down the road and my


---------57:32----------
hope is that actually as you


---------57:33----------
as you continue to grow like and is


---------57:36----------
just put more years under your belt


---------57:39----------
you'll begin to see and i hope that


---------57:40----------
you're able to see now we have to be


---------57:42----------
tricky because this is where cognitive


---------57:43----------
bias comes in


---------57:44----------
because you may not be able to


---------57:46----------
appreciate because you're so stuck in


---------57:47----------
your own head


---------57:48----------
that other people lean on you too


---------57:53----------
so i'd give it a couple of years but


---------57:54----------
we'll we'll get to that


---------57:56----------
eventually yep yeah


---------58:00----------
so i i think that you're gonna be


---------58:03----------
i honestly many and this may hurt you


---------58:06----------
here and hopefully i can repair this


---------58:07----------
damage a little bit


---------58:08----------
i think you're going to be a burden on


---------58:10----------
people for a couple more years because i


---------58:11----------
think that's what children


---------58:13----------
are like i don't know how to say this


---------58:16----------
huh but i'm 18. yeah i still think of


---------58:20----------
y'all as kids


---------58:23----------
and that's not it's it i don't try to be


---------58:25----------
condescending


---------58:26----------
yeah but like i know i mean i [ __ ]


---------58:28----------
wasn't anywhere near an adult when i was


---------58:30----------
18.


---------58:32----------
i i earned my first real paycheck at the


---------58:34----------
age of 32.


---------58:37----------
like i you know i i just i was a late


---------58:41----------
bloomer like literally 14 years is like


---------58:45----------
14 years later is when i started


---------58:47----------
becoming a self


---------58:49----------
like sufficient adult where i could pay


---------58:52----------
my own bills and stuff like that


---------58:56----------
and it's just it just takes time


---------58:59----------
right so like we don't we don't actually


---------59:01----------
consider 18 i mean we consider 18 year


---------59:03----------
olds adults but if you're in near us


---------59:04----------
you're not allowed to drink


---------59:07----------
right you're still actually in education


---------59:09----------
you're just starting your


---------59:10----------
final base of education potentially


---------59:14----------
and so so i think it's just you know


---------59:16----------
you're not going to be like


---------59:17----------
as productive like you'll be a far more


---------59:19----------
productive member of society at 30 than


---------59:20----------
you are at 18.


---------59:22----------
that's just a fact it doesn't mean that


---------59:25----------
18 year olds can't be productive adults


---------59:27----------
i'm not saying that but i'm just like


---------59:28----------
give yourself a little bit of time


---------59:31----------
um the next thing is that we've got to


---------59:34----------
think a little bit about like


---------59:36----------
where your belief that you're a burden


---------59:38----------
comes from and this is what i love about


---------59:40----------
your story is because we actually


---------59:41----------
already have the answer you usually have


---------59:42----------
to dig around for with people but


---------59:44----------
where when did you start believing that


---------59:46----------
you were a burden to the people around


---------59:48----------
you


---------59:49----------
like when i started getting depressed


---------59:52----------
which was eighth grade yeah i i don't


---------59:55----------
even think that's it


---------59:56----------
so i think it really comes from when the


---------59:58----------
woman that you were in love with told


---------60:00----------
you that you're a burden to other people


---------60:03----------
and that you ruined their lives


---------60:08----------
i don't know if it was love okay sure


---------60:12----------
sure as hell sounds like it from my


---------60:13----------
perspective


---------60:15----------
and maybe it wasn't i mean i'm in a


---------60:18----------
relationship right now


---------60:20----------
okay okay sorry


---------60:23----------
i mean no it's okay i i mean it sounds


---------60:26----------
like a [ __ ] rom-com


---------60:27----------
mini it's a story out of a rom-com


---------60:32----------
i don't i'm not trying to you know mess


---------60:34----------
up your life but


---------60:35----------
yeah yeah you know i mean like it sounds


---------60:38----------
like you guys had a real connection


---------60:40----------
whether it's like


---------60:41----------
you know whether it's like friendship


---------60:43----------
love or romantic love or something in


---------60:44----------
between


---------60:45----------
it sounds like you guys genuinely cared


---------60:47----------
for each other in a very deep way


---------60:51----------
yeah you know i mean even if if there


---------60:53----------
wasn't romantic love or it really wasn't


---------60:55----------
romantic love like whatever there's


---------60:56----------
there's clearly like some i mean you


---------60:59----------
like you said


---------61:00----------
it's not common for seventh or eighth


---------61:02----------
graders to write each other two to three


---------61:04----------
page letters on a daily basis


---------61:06----------
yeah i don't know what you call that


---------61:11----------
i would just call it a deep connection


---------61:13----------
of which i think the word


---------61:15----------
love approximates the best


---------61:19----------
and and if we think about it like you


---------61:21----------
know what does it do to someone when


---------61:22----------
they care about someone so much when


---------61:24----------
someone is so important to them


---------61:27----------
and to hear those kinds of words from


---------61:30----------
her


---------61:33----------
like what did it feel like when she said


---------61:35----------
that


---------61:37----------
like the exaggeration but also not


---------61:41----------
really


---------61:42----------
but my like my physical


---------61:45----------
chest area hurt when i heard that


---------61:48----------
like i started crying and then like


---------61:52----------
felt like my


---------61:55----------
heart was like breaking and stuff


---------61:59----------
literally yeah yeah


---------62:03----------
right so and i hate to say this many


---------62:07----------
you've been a little bit broken ever


---------62:08----------
since


---------62:11----------
and and because that's the thing is like


---------62:13----------
like when you say you should have gotten


---------62:15----------
over it like you haven't gotten over it


---------62:16----------
and like no wonder you feel like a


---------62:18----------
burden because


---------62:19----------
you know it sounds like in some ways and


---------62:21----------
so you're


---------62:22----------
you're down playing things so i'm gonna


---------62:24----------
amplify things and the truth is probably


---------62:26----------
somewhere in the middle


---------62:27----------
so like probably one of the most


---------62:29----------
important people in the world to you


---------62:32----------
or maybe the most important person in


---------62:34----------
the world to you tells you that you're a


---------62:36----------
burden


---------62:37----------
and you ruin the lives of people around


---------62:38----------
you


---------62:40----------
and then you said that your heart was


---------62:42----------
breaking literally okay


---------62:44----------
so like like if we think about it you


---------62:46----------
know where a lot of these thoughts


---------62:47----------
coming from


---------62:48----------
it's like because she told you that


---------62:49----------
right like you learned that lesson about


---------62:52----------
yourself


---------62:53----------
and it dug it like sunk in really deep


---------62:56----------
and then you sort of had this belief and


---------62:58----------
it sounds like it may have started


---------62:59----------
before that even like when you started


---------63:01----------
to get depressed


---------63:02----------
and stuff but if i were to say you know


---------63:04----------
it's kind of like


---------63:06----------
maybe there were some cracks but like


---------63:07----------
that was the shattering


---------63:09----------
yeah yeah right so


---------63:13----------
and so and so if we think about it you


---------63:16----------
know if you really want to heal


---------63:18----------
like it has to be through that


---------63:21----------
experience


---------63:22----------
and there are even signs like more from


---------63:25----------
like a psychological or even


---------63:26----------
neuroscientific perspective


---------63:28----------
that that was this the seminal event and


---------63:31----------
the reason that i say that is because


---------63:33----------
you remember that there was a substitute


---------63:35----------
teacher that day


---------63:38----------
so if we look at memory


---------63:42----------
memory is tied to importance


---------63:46----------
right people like what do you remember


---------63:47----------
like do you remember what you had for


---------63:49----------
lunch


---------63:50----------
on october 28 2014


---------63:55----------
no of course not right it's completely


---------63:58----------
unimportant


---------63:59----------
but people remember where they were


---------64:01----------
during 9 11.


---------64:04----------
you remember you were in the cafeteria


---------64:06----------
for a class


---------64:07----------
with a substitute teacher and so like


---------64:10----------
what that tells me is that


---------64:11----------
moment in time sunk


---------64:15----------
deep into your mind like it's frozen


---------64:18----------
it's like a perfect picture


---------64:20----------
and even like when you think about it


---------64:22----------
like the picture in your mind is so


---------64:24----------
vivid that even


---------64:25----------
thinking about it brings up emotions


---------64:29----------
brings up thoughts it's like this whole


---------64:31----------
whirlwind of stuff


---------64:33----------
and so now what that is is like it's


---------64:35----------
sitting in your unconscious or


---------64:36----------
subconscious mind


---------64:38----------
and it's generating the energy of that


---------64:40----------
moment is generating these thoughts


---------64:43----------
it's like a projector that's like


---------64:45----------
putting stuff up into your mind and like


---------64:47----------
the projector is over here


---------64:48----------
but what you see is over here and this


---------64:51----------
is what where you are right now but you


---------64:53----------
don't realize


---------64:54----------
that it's all coming from like this


---------64:56----------
experience


---------64:59----------
right because that's like like it's


---------65:00----------
interesting because even the language


---------65:02----------
that we


---------65:03----------
talked about before hearing her words


---------65:08----------
are like almost identical to her words


---------65:13----------
right the way that you think about


---------65:14----------
yourself is a burden is polluting the


---------65:17----------
people around you


---------65:18----------
everything you touch turns to ash


---------65:22----------
you're like a plague right


---------65:26----------
yeah and so


---------65:29----------
now the question with me questions


---------65:32----------
thoughts yeah


---------65:32----------
comments uh


---------65:40----------
how dare you oh my god how dare i go to


---------65:44----------
the bathroom i know


---------65:47----------
i'll be back she's learning chat


---------65:52----------
she's learning how to troll us back


---------65:55----------
welcome back minnie


---------65:57----------
hi how you feeling


---------66:01----------
you know like less nervous


---------66:04----------
definitely okay


---------66:08----------
yeah so um


---------66:12----------
let me just offer you a couple of


---------66:13----------
directions okay


---------66:15----------
so one is uh you know we can talk a


---------66:18----------
little bit more about


---------66:22----------
the some scar or like this ball of


---------66:24----------
undigested emotion


---------66:26----------
that i think generates these negative


---------66:28----------
thoughts


---------66:31----------
we can also just talk a little bit about


---------66:35----------
uh you know some of the other thoughts


---------66:37----------
that you have


---------66:38----------
we can talk some about your parents or


---------66:41----------
kind of how you feel day to day what


---------66:43----------
what would you like to do


---------66:46----------
um i guess i could


---------66:50----------
talk about my day-to-day


---------66:53----------
yeah can you tell us about that um


---------66:57----------
so when i


---------67:01----------
when i started therapy in like ninth


---------67:03----------
grade


---------67:04----------
i was a mess like grades were down


---------67:08----------
uh couldn't get out of bed not going to


---------67:11----------
school isolating all that stuff uh


---------67:15----------
and


---------67:19----------
um so like day to day back then was like


---------67:23----------
terrible right but then


---------67:26----------
i did therapy and i moved schools and


---------67:29----------
everything and then


---------67:31----------
i realized i was definitely getting


---------67:34----------
better like going to school again um


---------67:39----------
grades are better or like


---------67:42----------
you know but then


---------67:45----------
but then like oh and then the panic


---------67:49----------
attacks got


---------67:50----------
less now i only have it like maybe once


---------67:54----------
every two months but


---------67:57----------
uh i realized recently that


---------68:02----------
when something bad happens


---------68:05----------
i like go straight back to when i was in


---------68:08----------
ninth grade and freshman year


---------68:12----------
like i'm back to not getting out of bed


---------68:17----------
and like


---------68:19----------
feeling like i'll never get better and


---------68:20----------
stuff like that


---------68:22----------
yeah what thoughts


---------68:26----------
oh yeah oh god god


---------68:30----------
so it's just like a constant cycle of


---------68:32----------
like


---------68:33----------
better and then not then better or not


---------68:36----------
yeah how does it how does it feel to be


---------68:38----------
getting better and worse all the time


---------68:42----------
yo-yoing exhausting


---------68:46----------
i can imagine exhausting and


---------68:50----------
uh kind of


---------68:53----------
of like the burden thing again


---------68:57----------
where i feel like i wish i could be this


---------69:00----------
perfect friend or


---------69:02----------
daughter to like and be stable


---------69:05----------
but i'm not so yeah


---------69:09----------
i can imagine that you're okay accepting


---------69:12----------
other people's help


---------69:13----------
if you actually got better yeah


---------69:17----------
but it feels like a waste to you because


---------69:19----------
you lose all that ground


---------69:24----------
are you a good daughter


---------69:30----------
no no i don't think so okay


---------69:34----------
help us understand that


---------69:38----------
uh so when i was little


---------69:43----------
like like


---------69:47----------
all the way until before middle school


---------69:50----------
i was really


---------69:53----------
i was really happy all the time like


---------69:55----------
most of the time


---------69:58----------
uh like i really enjoyed doing things


---------70:01----------
like


---------70:02----------
reading books or whatever uh


---------70:06----------
and stuff like that


---------70:09----------
and i was really happy most of the time


---------70:11----------
and i think my parents were glad that


---------70:14----------
i was like that because i have a brother


---------70:19----------
and he was really hard to deal with


---------70:23----------
for a while all the way until he got


---------70:27----------
into college um


---------70:32----------
like me and my brother are kind of


---------70:34----------
opposites


---------70:35----------
so he's like i


---------70:39----------
i perceive myself as pretty social


---------70:42----------
and i like feed off of um socializing


---------70:46----------
with people


---------70:46----------
because it makes me happy um


---------70:51----------
but like for my brother


---------70:54----------
uh he has a hard time socializing with


---------70:57----------
people


---------70:58----------
he's a bit like he's more the odd one


---------71:02----------
out of the


---------71:03----------
our family so my


---------71:07----------
parents kind of my parents kind of hate


---------71:11----------
him


---------71:13----------
and like i


---------71:17----------
i learned that like if i don't want to


---------71:18----------
be hated by my parents i kind of have to


---------71:21----------
be the opposite of him


---------71:22----------
even though i already was


---------71:26----------
uh so


---------71:30----------
sorry i lost my train of thought


---------71:34----------
that's great pick it up go ahead


---------71:37----------
why do your parents hate your brother


---------71:41----------
it's really like when we were


---------71:45----------
little like we're four years apart so


---------71:48----------
like when i was in


---------71:49----------
when i was six and he was like 10


---------71:53----------
uh they would fight a lot they fought


---------71:56----------
all the way until he was at the end of


---------72:00----------
his high school


---------72:01----------
years they always fought about like


---------72:04----------
grades or like they even thought about


---------72:08----------
him being bullied


---------72:11----------
uh being i don't know why yeah when he


---------72:14----------
was in


---------72:14----------
like when he was in


---------72:18----------
elementary school like he used to get


---------72:20----------
bullied


---------72:21----------
by his classmates it's a part of why we


---------72:24----------
moved from korea to here


---------72:27----------
but so yeah


---------72:30----------
they used to fight a lot and then


---------72:32----------
whenever they fought i would like


---------72:36----------
i like hide under the dining room table


---------72:39----------
and i just like


---------72:39----------
close my ears uh


---------72:43----------
and then and then i learned to hate him


---------72:46----------
my brother for a long time


---------72:50----------
because sometimes


---------72:54----------
like fights would get violent and then


---------72:56----------
sometimes


---------72:58----------
i would try to stop them but i was like


---------73:01----------
six you know so


---------73:03----------
uh yeah


---------73:08----------
uh or like 12 or i don't know


---------73:11----------
all the ages um


---------73:14----------
so like i learned to hate him because i


---------73:17----------
saw that my parents


---------73:18----------
were hating him and i kind of just hated


---------73:21----------
him because he was


---------73:22----------
really we didn't talk a lot


---------73:25----------
either but whenever we did i always felt


---------73:30----------
like i always felt like he was the one


---------73:33----------
causing troubles for


---------73:34----------
family uh but then like


---------73:38----------
but then i became depressed in eighth


---------73:41----------
grade


---------73:42----------
and then i started becoming the


---------73:44----------
troublemaker of the family


---------73:46----------
uh so then my parents were like


---------73:50----------
what the [ __ ] you're supposed to be the


---------73:51----------
good one


---------73:53----------
um what did they say to you


---------73:57----------
like my parents mhm


---------74:02----------
i mean they said a lot of things but


---------74:04----------
sometimes they're like really


---------74:06----------
supportive and stuff but


---------74:10----------
sometimes when we would fight when i was


---------74:12----------
depressed like they would say stuff like


---------74:16----------
like why are you getting any better or


---------74:18----------
like


---------74:19----------
or like i don't know


---------74:22----------
uh like you're


---------74:26----------
weighing our family business down


---------74:29----------
because my parents do business


---------74:33----------
and they were telling me that because i


---------74:34----------
was depressed like they were depressed


---------74:36----------
so they couldn't do


---------74:37----------
work or something uh


---------74:44----------
oh yeah yeah yeah they did oh


---------74:48----------
oh how wonderful um


---------74:51----------
oh that's all


---------74:55----------
class um


---------75:00----------
yeah but


---------75:03----------
at the same time like


---------75:07----------
like they did say some really mean


---------75:11----------
things


---------75:12----------
but i feel like it was out of like


---------75:16----------
like they had reasons for it yep yeah


---------75:21----------
they are bad people i really love them


---------75:25----------
i don't think they're bad people


---------75:29----------
they were just tired too and they didn't


---------75:31----------
understand why i wasn't getting along


---------75:32----------
with


---------75:33----------
my brother either uh


---------75:36----------
because whenever we talked we would


---------75:38----------
fight so


---------75:40----------
and what's your understanding what's


---------75:42----------
your understanding of why y'all would


---------75:43----------
fight so much


---------75:48----------
um he's done a lot of


---------75:52----------
mean things to me also


---------75:55----------
but like to my parents


---------75:58----------
as well and then whenever we would


---------76:02----------
go like whenever we would go somewhere


---------76:05----------
as a family


---------76:06----------
he would be troublesome socially so i


---------76:10----------
kind of had to cover for him what does


---------76:12----------
that mean troublesome socially


---------76:15----------
like so let's say my family was having a


---------76:20----------
dinner with like


---------76:21----------
a family friend right


---------76:24----------
so we'd be eating and talking


---------76:27----------
then my brother would like not really


---------76:31----------
get the social cues and talk about


---------76:32----------
whatever


---------76:33----------
he wanted to do or like or just do


---------76:37----------
just little things that would be like ha


---------76:40----------
to the guest but for


---------76:41----------
us we were like stop that um


---------76:45----------
so i would try to like sound cover


---------76:49----------
afraid of him embarrassing you yeah


---------76:53----------
we were we were and i was making the


---------76:55----------
family look bad


---------76:59----------
yeah we were and then i was also


---------77:02----------
scared that


---------77:05----------
i don't know yeah i was also scared that


---------77:08----------
like


---------77:10----------
they would look down on my brother


---------77:15----------
because like there were incidents where


---------77:19----------
he actually escalated into a fight with


---------77:21----------
like other people


---------77:23----------
outside of her family and that's when i


---------77:25----------
was like


---------77:26----------
no he can't do that uh


---------77:31----------
so it's just like you know


---------77:36----------
but he like mellowed down in high school


---------77:40----------
he's still a prick but like uh


---------77:44----------
we don't fight a lot anymore


---------77:47----------
i actually had like a semi heart


---------77:51----------
to heart with him in like like


---------77:55----------
a few months ago and i was just trying


---------77:58----------
to understand that like


---------78:00----------
he was really like he told me he was


---------78:02----------
really


---------78:03----------
depressed in middle school and like when


---------78:05----------
he was younger


---------78:07----------
and he was dealing with a lot too uh


---------78:10----------
so i like i remember asking


---------78:14----------
my parents to get hymn therapy


---------78:17----------
when we were in high school


---------78:23----------
yeah uh sorry that was tangent


---------78:27----------
it's a beautiful one


---------78:38----------
i'm gonna just try to take this in yes


---------78:42----------
go ahead


---------78:46----------
what do you talk about in therapy


---------78:50----------
the same thing i talked about here


---------78:53----------
okay and then a little bit more about


---------78:55----------
like


---------78:56----------
other stuff but you know yeah basically


---------78:58----------
but you your therapists know that for


---------79:00----------
example like you had this


---------79:02----------
when you grew up like you would hide


---------79:05----------
under a table and cover your ears when


---------79:07----------
your parents were


---------79:08----------
in a fight with your brother yeah


---------79:12----------
and what are your their how does that


---------79:14----------
conversation go in therapy


---------79:17----------
it depended on who it was but like


---------79:21----------
all six therapists like let's say


---------79:23----------
there's an hour in a session right


---------79:25----------
it's usually like 40 minutes of me


---------79:28----------
talking and then


---------79:28----------
20 minutes sometime talking or less


---------79:31----------
so it was just me talking a lot


---------79:35----------
and then giving advice like breathe or


---------79:37----------
something


---------79:40----------
which is good but


---------79:43----------
what do you want to hear


---------79:56----------
what's wrong with me because i always


---------79:59----------
hear


---------80:00----------
people reassure me that there's nothing


---------80:02----------
wrong with me but like


---------80:05----------
clearly


---------80:10----------
what makes it clear that something's


---------80:11----------
wrong with you can you hear me


---------80:13----------
um hi so you want to hear what's wrong


---------80:16----------
with you


---------80:24----------
and they won't tell you


---------80:28----------
why sorry and they won't tell you what's


---------80:30----------
wrong with you


---------80:32----------
yeah okay well except for my friend


---------80:38----------
and what did she say he tells me that


---------80:41----------
i'm self-sabotaging a lot what does that


---------80:44----------
mean which


---------80:45----------
like telling myself that i'm not good


---------80:48----------
enough for


---------80:49----------
like i'm burning people and stuff like


---------80:52----------
that


---------80:52----------
and i hear her but i don't know what to


---------80:56----------

---------80:58----------

---------81:02----------
someone okay and then


---------81:05----------
do you if you could change something


---------81:09----------
if i could wave a magic wand and change


---------81:12----------
something about your life what would you


---------81:14----------
change


---------81:21----------
um


---------81:26----------
i want my


---------81:30----------
this is going to sound real bad but i


---------81:33----------
would


---------81:34----------
want my brother


---------81:39----------
okay how does it feel to say that


---------81:45----------
i feel really


---------81:49----------
and why do you want him gone


---------81:54----------
flake


---------81:56----------
i don't know i often think about what it


---------81:58----------
would have been like if


---------82:01----------
i was like


---------82:04----------
holy child and what do you envision if


---------82:07----------
you were an only child


---------82:10----------
like less pain from what he does


---------82:14----------
do you sometimes wonder if you would be


---------82:16----------
normal if he wasn't around


---------82:19----------
yeah and i know


---------82:22----------
i know that's not true because how do


---------82:25----------
you know that's not true


---------82:26----------
because like he's not like that anymore


---------82:30----------
or a lot less like that and my life's


---------82:33----------
still


---------82:33----------
kind of you know so


---------82:47----------
hmm


---------82:50----------
minnie this is going to be tricky they


---------82:53----------
do something wrong


---------82:55----------
nope not at all


---------82:58----------
all right it's just


---------83:04----------
testing


---------83:06----------
you're the raid boss


---------83:09----------
people joke about you know you've heard


---------83:11----------
this meme before in our channel


---------83:14----------
people like oh my god this person's


---------83:16----------
going to be the right boss


---------83:18----------
and no no one expected it to be you


---------83:22----------
but let's see i know how does it feel to


---------83:25----------
be the raid boss


---------83:27----------
i'm sorry guys what are you sorry for


---------83:31----------
for being a raid whose fault is that


---------83:41----------
i'm not sure sure you are


---------83:46----------
my


---------83:49----------
do you see the cycle it keeps going


---------83:52----------
what's the cycle pointed out to me


---------83:54----------
uh so like it's like


---------83:59----------
oh there's a problem i blame myself


---------84:02----------
uh but then like someone tells me i'm


---------84:06----------
not


---------84:07----------
and i kind of believe it but then


---------84:09----------
there's a problem again


---------84:10----------
i play myself yeah very good


---------84:14----------
right and so i know this is going to


---------84:16----------
sound weird


---------84:18----------
but where can we break that cycle


---------84:24----------
there's a problem i blame myself


---------84:27----------
people tell me it's not my fault i sort


---------84:29----------
of believe it there's a problem where do


---------84:31----------
we break that cycle


---------84:35----------
the blaming part nope that's what you


---------84:38----------
would think


---------84:39----------
that's what you would think what do you


---------84:42----------
want


---------84:44----------
when i asked you what you wanted what's


---------84:46----------
your answer minnie


---------84:50----------
um do you remember what you said


---------84:53----------
what do you want from therapy


---------84:56----------
to to be more


---------85:02----------
less self-doubting no no no no see these


---------85:06----------
are all the [ __ ] answers


---------85:09----------
the real answer was you wanted you want


---------85:10----------
your therapist to tell you what's wrong


---------85:11----------
with you


---------85:12----------
oh yeah yeah yeah sorry i forgot so the


---------85:15----------
real problem with the cycle


---------85:16----------
is not there's a problem and i blame


---------85:18----------
myself because that shit's gonna happen


---------85:19----------
you're gonna blame yourself


---------85:21----------
right you can't stop that what we need


---------85:24----------
to change is the reassurance


---------85:27----------
what we need to do is tell you what's


---------85:29----------
wrong with you that's what you want


---------85:31----------
and that's what we need to do


---------85:35----------
because that's what they don't do right


---------85:38----------
and then the problem is that like when


---------85:39----------
they reassure you


---------85:42----------
it covers up the problem


---------85:45----------
but it doesn't actually solve anything


---------85:47----------
and so the cycle continues


---------85:50----------
right and so actually what we needed and


---------85:53----------
the reason you're the raid boss is


---------85:55----------
because


---------85:56----------
i'm gonna have to tell you why you're


---------85:57----------
the problem okay


---------86:00----------
because that's what you want so it's


---------86:01----------
what you gotta hear but before we do


---------86:03----------
that


---------86:04----------
before we do that how do you feel do you


---------86:06----------
feel anxious when i say things like that


---------86:08----------
yeah yeah oh my god and what are you


---------86:10----------
afraid i'm gonna say


---------86:12----------
ah you suck or something yeah i don't


---------86:15----------
think you suck i think you're awesome


---------86:16----------
okay um but i i do think it's


---------86:19----------
it's really challenging right because if


---------86:21----------
we don't


---------86:24----------
if we don't accept responsibility for


---------86:26----------
our situation we also have no power to


---------86:28----------
change it


---------86:31----------
it's like a really tricky double-edged


---------86:32----------
sword and i think in a bizarre way the


---------86:34----------
reason that you aren't changing is


---------86:35----------
because


---------86:37----------
people sort of take that away from you


---------86:39----------
and it's actually what you want you want


---------86:40----------
you want to hear like why


---------86:41----------
you're the problem and i think you're


---------86:43----------
we'll get there in a second


---------86:45----------
but i don't think it's going to be what


---------86:46----------
you think it is but it is actually going


---------86:48----------
to be a problem


---------86:48----------
so it's just gonna be hard that's what's


---------86:50----------
tricky so let me start with this


---------86:53----------
when your friend told you what she said


---------86:57----------
that day in the cafeteria


---------87:00----------
where were those words coming from


---------87:08----------
like when she says you're a burden and


---------87:10----------
you make everyone else's life around you


---------87:12----------
worse where are those words coming from


---------87:15----------
within her


---------87:20----------
from the things i did


---------87:24----------
not really sort of right so like if we


---------87:27----------
think about like


---------87:28----------
let me ask you this was she like of calm


---------87:30----------
and tranquil mind when she was


---------87:32----------
explaining this to you


---------87:33----------
no where what was she feeling in that


---------87:36----------
moment


---------87:38----------
anger yep and so like


---------87:41----------
the words were coming from a place of


---------87:43----------
hurt


---------87:44----------
does that make sense yeah


---------87:47----------
and so this is important to understand


---------87:49----------
because like even though


---------87:50----------
hurtful words can be true they're


---------87:53----------
incomplete


---------87:56----------
right and this is the problem with like


---------87:58----------
hearing what's wrong with you


---------88:00----------
a mini is that i'll tell you what's


---------88:01----------
wrong with you but what i need you to


---------88:03----------
understand


---------88:04----------
is that it's incomplete because that's


---------88:07----------
true right like i mean i mean come on


---------88:10----------
like


---------88:12----------
let's just think about what you've said


---------88:14----------
okay and then let's think about how


---------88:16----------
reasonable some of your conclusions are


---------88:20----------
if you find yourself thinking i wish my


---------88:22----------
brother had never existed


---------88:25----------
and then you're like i'm kind of an evil


---------88:27----------
person


---------88:29----------
and then what are we supposed to say no


---------88:31----------
you're not


---------88:35----------
right so the problem here minnie is is


---------88:37----------
not that you're


---------88:38----------
wrong the problem is that you're right


---------88:43----------
the bigger problem is that it's


---------88:45----------
incomplete


---------88:46----------
because what i want you to understand is


---------88:48----------
that in the same way


---------88:50----------
like do you believe like what do you


---------88:52----------
think that friend what do you think b


---------88:54----------
thinks about you as a complete person


---------89:04----------
she used to tell me that i was really


---------89:06----------
like


---------89:08----------
i made her happy yep yeah and that i was


---------89:12----------
really


---------89:13----------
fun to be around yeah yeah


---------89:16----------
right so that makes sense to me it makes


---------89:19----------
sense to me that you caused her a lot of


---------89:21----------
pain


---------89:23----------
and you brought her a lot of happiness


---------89:27----------
the problem is that in the in the


---------89:29----------
moments in the screenshots that your


---------89:31----------
mind


---------89:32----------
took it like


---------89:35----------
you know took way more or way bigger


---------89:37----------
screenshots of the negative moments in


---------89:39----------
your life as opposed to the positive


---------89:40----------
moments


---------89:41----------
and that's not your fault that's


---------89:42----------
literally the way that our brain is


---------89:43----------
wired


---------89:45----------
so our brain if you go to a restaurant


---------89:47----------
and you eat there 10 times and it's


---------89:49----------
really really yummy


---------89:50----------
you remember those 10 times pretty well


---------89:52----------
if you go there the 11th time and you


---------89:54----------
get food poisoning


---------89:55----------
what does your brain remember about the


---------89:57----------
restaurant


---------89:59----------
i had food poisoning okay at that


---------90:02----------
restaurant


---------90:05----------
yeah exactly right so that's what's


---------90:07----------
happened in your life and if we really


---------90:08----------
look at it


---------90:09----------
it's not that it's false that you had a


---------90:11----------
bad experience at the restaurant it's


---------90:13----------
not


---------90:13----------
wrong to believe that it's just


---------90:16----------
incomplete


---------90:17----------
and so in the same way that your friends


---------90:20----------
can you sort of


---------90:21----------
understand and let me know like if you


---------90:23----------
rebel against this internally because i


---------90:24----------
can kind of read your mind but i can't


---------90:26----------
read this next part


---------90:27----------
okay so i need so if i were to tell you


---------90:30----------
that your friend


---------90:32----------
what she said about you wasn't untrue


---------90:36----------
but at that that it came from a place of


---------90:38----------
like hurt


---------90:39----------
and was incomplete


---------90:43----------
what do you think about that


---------90:50----------
i i agree okay


---------90:53----------
so then what you have to do this is the


---------90:55----------
hard part


---------90:57----------
is that like i can imagine if you're a


---------91:00----------
six-year-old


---------91:02----------
and it sounds like there's an argument


---------91:05----------
and maybe even like a physical


---------91:06----------
altercation between your parents and


---------91:08----------
your brother


---------91:10----------
and you're six years old and you just


---------91:11----------
want to play with what did you play with


---------91:13----------
when you were six years old um


---------91:17----------
like a nintendo 3. okay so you're just


---------91:20----------
playing nintendo


---------91:21----------
and then that's what i played when i was


---------91:23----------
62.


---------91:25----------
um and uh you know you're just sitting


---------91:28----------
there playing your nintendo and this


---------91:29----------
like altercation breaks out


---------91:31----------
and then like they're yelling and then


---------91:32----------
you have to like like that child is like


---------91:34----------
afraid


---------91:36----------
and then the child runs under a table


---------91:38----------
and covers their ears and what do they


---------91:40----------
when a child covers their ears what do


---------91:42----------
they want


---------91:44----------
what are they thinking in their head


---------91:47----------
they wanted to stop absolutely


---------91:51----------
i just want to stop and if you're a


---------91:53----------
six-year-old


---------91:55----------
and you want to stop what do you see is


---------91:57----------
the problem


---------92:03----------
well in my case like my brother


---------92:05----------
absolutely right it's a six-year-old's


---------92:07----------
thought


---------92:09----------
like the six-year-old does it just like


---------92:11----------
i just wanted to stop i want him to go


---------92:13----------
away


---------92:14----------
because you're not dumb and when he


---------92:16----------
comes like when you're


---------92:17----------
if you stay at home from school and he's


---------92:19----------
not around you get to play on your


---------92:20----------
nintendo


---------92:21----------
and when he shows up


---------92:25----------
your parents and him get into it and


---------92:27----------
then your parents


---------92:28----------
their parents and you sort of get that


---------92:30----------
like even as a six-year-old you're like


---------92:32----------
my parents know what's up


---------92:34----------
right like that's how we think like we


---------92:36----------
think that our parents like know what's


---------92:37----------
going on


---------92:38----------
and so then your parents hate him


---------92:41----------
and they say certain things to him and


---------92:44----------
then you just know that when he's around


---------92:46----------
like


---------92:48----------
it's a mess and so you just want him to


---------92:50----------
go away you want him to never exist


---------92:52----------
it's the thought of a six-year-old


---------92:54----------
completely appropriate does it make you


---------92:56----------
an evil person


---------92:58----------
i don't think so is it an evil thought


---------93:00----------
absolutely


---------93:03----------
and this is where i i think the the real


---------93:05----------
problem many that you run into is that i


---------93:08----------
think that the


---------93:08----------
the bad thoughts that you have about


---------93:10----------
yourself are actually true


---------93:12----------
it's just just because you have an evil


---------93:15----------
thought


---------93:15----------
even if you really want it and evil even


---------93:18----------
if you really believe it on some level


---------93:20----------
doesn't make you an evil person that's


---------93:23----------
the jump that you need to stop making


---------93:27----------
because i have an evil thought i am an


---------93:30----------
evil person


---------93:33----------
because i burden people around me i am a


---------93:36----------
burden


---------93:38----------
do you see the difference in those two


---------93:39----------
statements


---------93:42----------
one is like an identity and then the


---------93:45----------
problem is once you


---------93:46----------
make that identity you carry it with you


---------93:48----------
wherever you go


---------93:50----------
and then you get into cognitive bias but


---------93:53----------
if you have like bad thoughts is it an


---------93:55----------
[ __ ] thought to like wish that your


---------93:56----------
brother didn't exist


---------93:58----------
sure and here's the crazy thing


---------94:01----------
i think it's okay for you to have that


---------94:04----------
thought


---------94:05----------
because i think that that thought comes


---------94:07----------
from a place of just wanting it to end


---------94:10----------
and when you're six years old the world


---------94:12----------
is not a complicated place


---------94:14----------
it's just like uh because six-year-olds


---------94:16----------
have like magical thinking and they're


---------94:17----------
like


---------94:18----------
if i waved a magic wand and made my


---------94:19----------
brother go away imagine how


---------94:21----------
simpler my life would be and then each


---------94:23----------
time you have that thought each time you


---------94:25----------
guys go to some


---------94:26----------
friend's house and i'm assuming they're


---------94:27----------
korean


---------94:29----------
and you guys go to some like you know


---------94:31----------
because it's like social [ __ ]


---------94:33----------
right yeah and then like in the korean


---------94:34----------
community you guys are viewed as like


---------94:36----------
rejects because you've got this brother


---------94:38----------
who gets into fights with people when


---------94:40----------
you guys go to dinner


---------94:42----------
and there's a lot of family shame


---------94:45----------
because that's what we do in east asia


---------94:47----------
and south asia


---------94:48----------
and all over the rest of the world too


---------94:50----------
but i think it seems to be more powerful


---------94:52----------
nowadays it lingers better in these


---------94:54----------
cultures


---------94:55----------
where it's about community and family


---------94:57----------
over individuality there's a whole


---------94:59----------
different system


---------95:00----------
of worth your worth as a human being is


---------95:03----------
not based on who you are


---------95:05----------
it's based on your family


---------95:10----------
thoughts responses questions


---------95:17----------
okay so what's wrong with you i think


---------95:21----------
that


---------95:21----------
uh a lot of the things that you think


---------95:23----------
about yourself happen to be true


---------95:26----------
so i some of them i don't think are true


---------95:28----------
but i think that you do burden people


---------95:30----------
around you


---------95:32----------
i do think that it's an evil thought to


---------95:34----------
wish that your brother never existed


---------95:39----------
i think actually what's wrong with you


---------95:41----------
is that you define


---------95:43----------
your identity based on those thoughts


---------95:47----------
but they're just thoughts like i had a


---------95:50----------
thought about a unicorn


---------95:52----------
doesn't make the unicorn real


---------95:57----------
right it's just a thought our mind just


---------95:59----------
thinks all kinds of weird stuff


---------96:02----------
and i think it's okay for you to like


---------96:04----------
acknowledge that you're a burden but i


---------96:06----------
also think you need to like really think


---------96:07----------
about


---------96:08----------
you know when people say that you're a


---------96:10----------
burden


---------96:11----------
to understand that like that's coming


---------96:13----------
from like a dark place inside them and


---------96:16----------
like we can't


---------96:17----------
let the dark places and each of us


---------96:21----------
define what the world is


---------96:24----------
because if your friend thinks you're a


---------96:25----------
burden and you think you're a burden


---------96:27----------
then like that's a bleak pace but you're


---------96:28----------
more than a burden right


---------96:30----------
you're someone who brought her happiness


---------96:31----------
and you're someone who brought her joy


---------96:32----------
and you're someone who like


---------96:34----------
you know taught her what love is if we


---------96:36----------
want to get corny


---------96:38----------
and and you know i know you're in a


---------96:40----------
relationship now so sorry about that


---------96:42----------
you know i can't help myself for the


---------96:45----------
memes


---------96:46----------
i do it for the music


---------96:49----------
but but i mean seriously like i i think


---------96:51----------
that the problem in here is that


---------96:52----------
what's wrong with you is that you don't


---------96:54----------
see that you're more than your


---------96:56----------
worst parts that's the real problem i


---------96:58----------
don't dispute that you have


---------97:00----------
bad parts i just don't think that that's


---------97:04----------
all of you right and and the other thing


---------97:08----------
is that i


---------97:08----------
forgive you for having


---------97:12----------
the bad parts of you that you do because


---------97:13----------
i think it's understandable like what do


---------97:14----------
you expect


---------97:15----------
what do you expect a six-year-old to


---------97:17----------
want to do when they have a brother who


---------97:19----------
comes home and fights with their parents


---------97:20----------
all the time


---------97:22----------
right and if your parents start hating


---------97:24----------
him you're just gonna learn so it's like


---------97:26----------
is it wrong to hate him yes do you hate


---------97:30----------
him


---------97:30----------
yes is that bad yes


---------97:34----------
does it make you a bad person no


---------97:40----------
right like in fact many what i think is


---------97:42----------
actually really amazing is that


---------97:44----------
you recognize like there's a part of you


---------97:47----------
that fights against all these thoughts


---------97:49----------
and feelings


---------97:51----------
right there's a part of you that makes


---------97:52----------
you the reason that having the thought


---------97:54----------
is fine what would really make you evil


---------97:56----------
is if you didn't think you were evil for


---------97:58----------
having the thought


---------98:02----------
right that's what makes you good is like


---------98:05----------
the fact that you feel guilty


---------98:08----------
is like what makes you a good person


---------98:12----------
yeah and then in terms of you know being


---------98:14----------
a burden like i think that's gonna get


---------98:16----------
better and i think that


---------98:19----------
frankly your parents sort of made some


---------98:22----------
potential mistakes here now i'm not


---------98:23----------
trying to bash your parents i know that


---------98:25----------
you haven't painted a


---------98:26----------
really you know rosy picture of them but


---------98:28----------
i think let's all be


---------98:29----------
clear and fair that i think your parents


---------98:31----------
are seem like actually really good


---------98:32----------
people


---------98:33----------
it seems like they did the best that


---------98:34----------
they could you know they grew up in a


---------98:36----------
particular culture where like


---------98:38----------
there's a lot of shame around mental


---------98:39----------
health and like that's just what they


---------98:40----------
grew up with so like let's not blame


---------98:42----------
them for it that's the whole thing


---------98:43----------
it's like are we going to blame people


---------98:45----------
for like what they grew up with


---------98:47----------
and if you're going to forgive your


---------98:49----------
parents for what they grew up with and


---------98:50----------
you're going to be understanding for


---------98:51----------
them you should be understanding for


---------98:52----------
yourself


---------98:53----------
now be careful because i'm not saying


---------98:57----------
you're wrong i'm just saying you need to


---------98:59----------
be more understanding to yourself


---------99:02----------
right you get a pass is what i'm saying


---------99:06----------
you have an excuse i don't it doesn't


---------99:08----------
count


---------99:11----------
how do you feel about that


---------99:14----------
i'm unsure i'll take it


---------99:18----------
like like i hear what you're saying


---------99:22----------
and i agree give me the butt like


---------99:27----------
but the little the little


---------99:31----------
mini me inside me is like but is that


---------99:33----------
pass okay


---------99:34----------
or something yep so so that's the


---------99:36----------
question that i think you should answer


---------99:39----------
right


---------99:40----------
is is d so who determines whether the


---------99:42----------
pass is okay


---------99:46----------
yeah so that's your choice to make


---------99:50----------
and i hope that you conclude that it is


---------99:53----------
okay


---------99:55----------
i hope that you can learn how to forgive


---------99:58----------
yourself


---------99:59----------
for the person that you are


---------100:02----------
and i hope that you can forgive be for


---------100:05----------
hurting you


---------100:06----------
and i hope that you can forgive your


---------100:08----------
brother


---------100:10----------
for all the disharmony he has caused


---------100:13----------
right because that's his real problem is


---------100:15----------
he's like disharmonious


---------100:19----------
yeah and and give yourself time minnie


---------100:21----------
and there may be like forgiveness for


---------100:23----------
your parents too somewhere in there but


---------100:24----------
like


---------100:25----------
you have to i if you're unsure like i'll


---------100:28----------
take it i think that's as far as we're


---------100:30----------

---------100:32----------
you know i i think that i'm i'm actually

think it's great that you're willing to


---------104:31----------
tolerate that discomfort because you've

you've become comfortable with your low


---------104:36----------
self-esteem


---------104:38----------
yeah right you've been you've become


---------104:40----------
comfortable with beating yourself


---------104:42----------
up and blaming yourself and it can


---------104:44----------
actually be


---------104:45----------
like uncomfortable to start to love


---------104:49----------
yourself


---------104:51----------
and to start to accept other people's


---------104:53----------
appreciation for who you are


---------104:55----------
because it's like


---------104:59----------
it's like icky why can't you just treat


---------105:01----------

---------105:03----------
what that feels like


---------105:06----------
oh they'll call me out like that


---------105:09----------

---------105:13----------
but no i'm i'm not going to because i


---------105:15----------
don't think you are and if it makes you


---------105:16----------
uncomfortable


---------105:17----------
tough luck


---------105:20----------
this is about helping you not making you


---------105:22----------
feel comfortable


---------105:24----------
it's about helping you grow thoughts


---------105:30----------
questions um


---------105:35----------

---------106:00----------
rain boss


---------106:01----------

---------106:06----------
yourself that you have to fight


---------106:08----------

---------106:14----------
doppelganger would be an 18 year old

korean girl with bunny ears on


---------106:19----------
that's when i visited when i envisioned

---------107:02----------
so you can't use them against me can't


---------107:04----------
do


---------107:05----------
uh can i think for a moment anymore


---------107:07----------

other thing so now i'm gonna


---------107:35----------
i'm gonna swing back so get ready get


---------107:37----------
ready for it you're inspiring too


---------107:39----------
right because like i can't do this on my


---------107:41----------
own


---------107:43----------
and actually what's really inspiring


---------107:45----------
about this is like the people who come


---------107:46----------
on


---------107:47----------
and that's what makes this what it is


---------107:49----------
and it's your


---------107:50----------
honesty and your authenticity and you're


---------107:53----------
like willing to share the darkest parts


---------107:54----------
of yourself that actually makes it


---------107:56----------
inspiring


---------108:01----------
thank you [ __ ] she said thank you she


---------108:04----------
just took it


---------108:06----------
thank you yeah she's you guys see that


---------108:09----------
she learned


---------108:10----------
she's like adapting and growing and


---------108:12----------
morphing she can just accept it


---------108:14----------
now and she can just maybe accept the


---------108:18----------
compliment


---------108:19----------
and maybe feel better about herself


---------108:21----------
despite her discomfort


---------108:24----------
she's learning she's evolving


---------108:27----------
she is but listen minnie this has been


---------108:30----------
fantastic do you want to learn about


---------108:31----------
meditation or we


---------108:33----------
if we mean ourselves out of that space


---------108:36----------
would i be taking too much time


---------108:38----------
or oh there it is you tell me no i won't


---------108:42----------
i want to do it okay okay but if you


---------108:45----------
want to


---------108:47----------
you're allowed to say no but you're not


---------108:48----------
allowed to say no because it takes too


---------108:50----------
much time


---------108:54----------
no i i do want to learn okay okay


---------108:58----------
so now i gotta now i'm okay i gotta


---------109:01----------
think about this


---------109:02----------
i have some water what are we gonna


---------109:04----------
teach minnie okay


---------109:16----------
so i want you to sit up straight


---------109:22----------
okay and then i want you to


---------109:26----------
put your hands together in front of your


---------109:28----------
chest like this


---------109:30----------
and i want your uh elbows to be at like


---------109:32----------
right angles to the ground so i want


---------109:34----------
your arms to be straight yeah


---------109:36----------
so you should feel like tension


---------109:39----------
um like at the base of your wrists


---------109:43----------
right so you just feel that tension for


---------109:44----------
a second and now what i want you to do


---------109:46----------
you can relax your elbows a little bit


---------109:48----------
and then pull your hands apart just a


---------109:50----------
tiny amount


---------109:53----------
and um i don't know if you're gonna need


---------109:55----------
to take off


---------109:56----------
uh pull your sleeves down i actually


---------109:59----------
don't know if it'll interfere


---------110:00----------
so close your eyes and i want you to


---------110:04----------
feel the space between your hands


---------110:11----------
and you may feel like almost like a


---------110:13----------
desire to kind of pull them together a


---------110:15----------
little bit


---------110:17----------
you may feel like something like you


---------110:20----------
know warmth between them


---------110:27----------
and now pull them apart a little bit


---------110:29----------
more


---------110:30----------
and feel that warmth expand


---------110:34----------
it's almost like a fluffy cushion i


---------110:38----------
don't know if that makes any sense


---------110:39----------
if it doesn't make any sense just shake


---------110:40----------
your head no you sort of get whatev


---------110:43----------
okay [ __ ] all right so do you feel


---------110:46----------
warmth between your palms


---------110:49----------
okay now bring them together a little


---------110:52----------
bit


---------110:54----------
and just focus on how the warmth changes


---------111:01----------
now pull them apart a little bit


---------111:06----------
focus on that warmth between your hands


---------111:10----------
and then a little bit further


---------111:13----------
and as you move your hands a little


---------111:15----------
further apart try to track the warmth


---------111:17----------
so do you feel it when they're this far


---------111:19----------
apart


---------111:22----------
yeah pull them a little bit further


---------111:26----------
you feel it now


---------111:30----------
bit further


---------111:34----------
how about now no


---------111:37----------
okay good so this is the limit so bring


---------111:39----------
them in a little bit


---------111:42----------
now you feel it okay


---------111:46----------
so now what i want you to do is open


---------111:48----------
your eyes for a second


---------111:50----------
i want you to take your left palm


---------111:53----------
and put your right palm inside it like


---------111:55----------
this


---------111:58----------
yep very good and then i want you to put


---------112:01----------
your arms in your lap


---------112:04----------
so that's kind of him sit up straight


---------112:07----------
and close your eyes


---------112:10----------
and what i want you to do is feel that


---------112:12----------
warmth coming out of your palm


---------112:19----------
i want you to breathe


---------112:22----------
and sort of imagine


---------112:26----------
almost like a circuit like there's


---------112:28----------
energy coming into you


---------112:30----------
either from the top of your head or your


---------112:32----------
breath


---------112:34----------
it travels through your arms


---------112:38----------
in a circuit and kind of out of your


---------112:42----------
palm


---------112:56----------
okay


---------113:01----------
and as you sit just focus on


---------113:05----------
any of those sensations that grab your


---------113:07----------
attention


---------113:09----------
so whether it's the feeling of energy


---------113:11----------
entering


---------113:13----------
or it passing through your body


---------113:17----------
or it coming out of your palms


---------113:38----------
and as you breathe notice the vitality


---------113:41----------
within yourself


---------113:44----------
it's kind of hard to describe but just


---------113:46----------
notice that you're


---------113:47----------
alive and there's like


---------113:51----------
life in there


---------114:04----------
there's a heartbeat there's breath


---------114:09----------
there's energy there's sensation


---------114:13----------
there's heat


---------114:27----------
and now see if there's darkness


---------114:31----------
are there ugly parts in there


---------114:37----------
if you can find something nod your head


---------114:40----------
yes


---------114:42----------
and what does that feel like where is it


---------114:46----------
tell us


---------114:49----------
like my head okay


---------114:53----------
what about your head


---------114:56----------
feels like i'm sweating so


---------115:02----------
okay


---------115:08----------
so the darkness is sort of localized in


---------115:10----------
your head


---------115:12----------
okay so just notice it that's where it


---------115:14----------
is


---------115:16----------
and now as you breathe in breathe in


---------115:18----------
through your nose


---------115:20----------
and breathe into that darkness


---------115:25----------
and it's kind of like almost like a


---------115:27----------
sticky smoke


---------115:29----------
kind of thing and then breathe into it


---------115:33----------
and you're probably kind of pumping


---------115:34----------
fresh air in and as you breathe out let


---------115:36----------
that out


---------115:46----------
and now i want you to


---------115:50----------
set that aside for a moment and focus on


---------115:53----------
the rest of your being once again on the


---------115:56----------
sensation of energy entering your body


---------115:58----------
traveling through the circuits of your


---------116:00----------
arms and coming out of your


---------116:01----------
palms


---------116:08----------
and notice that even though there is a


---------116:10----------
dark patch


---------116:11----------
within you that there's a lot of you


---------116:14----------
that isn't dark


---------116:18----------
and that this is who you are not all bad


---------116:22----------
not all good


---------116:26----------
that if you give yourself the time if


---------116:28----------
you give yourself the space


---------116:31----------
and if you're patient with yourself


---------116:35----------
what you really are will start to shine


---------116:37----------
through


---------116:41----------
and think about the difference between


---------116:42----------
the way that you feel now


---------116:45----------
and the way that you feel when that


---------116:47----------
darkness dominates your body


---------116:49----------
and when you can't get out of bed


---------116:57----------
that it's okay to be disappointed that


---------116:59----------
you always go back to square one


---------117:05----------
but then even if you do go back to


---------117:07----------
square one


---------117:10----------
that you still have this buoyancy of


---------117:12----------
life and vitality that pulls you out of


---------117:14----------
it


---------117:20----------
and just let yourself be with that


---------117:22----------
vitality for now


---------117:36----------
and now one last breath


---------117:39----------
really deep and then really slow as you


---------117:42----------
exhale


---------117:46----------
when you're ready open your eyes


---------117:58----------
what's behind the smile this time


---------118:02----------
i'm really sweaty


---------118:06----------
like sweaty where


---------118:09----------
where like my forehead


---------118:14----------
is that new no i think i'm just like


---------118:18----------
like temperature temperature-wise hot


---------118:20----------
right now


---------118:24----------
i mean i've i've heard a lot of things


---------118:26----------
in meditation and people having


---------118:27----------
reactions i've never heard people


---------118:29----------
get sweaty so i was like threw me for a


---------118:32----------
loop


---------118:35----------
i also kept like hearing my heartbeat


---------118:41----------
and whenever i hear my heartbeat i get


---------118:45----------
really


---------118:45----------
anxious but this time like it wasn't


---------118:48----------
anxious so i don't know what that


---------118:50----------
is but i'll take it


---------118:54----------
i'll take i'll take whatever you're


---------118:56----------
willing to give raid boss


---------118:58----------
wow no but seriously so so so i i think


---------119:01----------
that's important


---------119:02----------
okay so minnie i think that you know as


---------119:04----------
you learn how to be comfortable


---------119:06----------
with your heartbeat right that you you


---------119:09----------
can listen to your heartbeat it used to


---------119:10----------
be anxiety provoking but that you can


---------119:12----------
also like tap into it and find like


---------119:14----------
a regularity and a calmness to it


---------119:18----------
and just zone in on your heartbeat if


---------119:20----------
the circuits of energy and [ __ ] like


---------119:22----------
that doesn't mean anything to you you


---------119:23----------
can just focus on your heartbeat


---------119:26----------
and and just sit with yourself because


---------119:29----------
here's the thing


---------119:30----------
like for the most part i don't know if


---------119:31----------
this makes sense or not but like what


---------119:33----------
you sat with is not like a bad person


---------119:35----------
they're not a stain on the earth


---------119:37----------
like it's just not what you are does


---------119:40----------
that make sense


---------119:41----------
yeah and and so you just need to spend


---------119:45----------
more time with that person


---------119:49----------

---------119:51----------
that you spend


---------119:52----------
a lot of time with the most negative


---------119:55----------
parts of yourself


---------119:55----------
we're not saying that they're not real


---------119:58----------

---------119:59----------
you know the the tv is just stuck on


---------120:01----------
that channel


---------120:02----------
and there's so many other channels and


---------120:04----------
so give yourself the benefit of


---------120:06----------
of sitting with the part of you that is


---------120:08----------
