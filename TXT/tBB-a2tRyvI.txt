---------00:00----------
oh hi hey


---------00:03----------
uh so first i wanna thank you for doing


---------00:06----------
this


---------00:07----------
uh you and your whole team


---------00:10----------
you're very well uh and now we're just


---------00:12----------
gonna


---------00:13----------
thank you and then i'll just uh set the


---------00:15----------
scene uh i guess


---------00:16----------
uh you can call me puns by the way puns


---------00:20----------
uh puns yeah pawns blazing so pawn short


---------00:23----------
oh


---------00:23----------
okay pants got it so um


---------00:27----------
that's great once blazing is a pun in


---------00:29----------
and of itself


---------00:30----------
thank you how does one deal with like


---------00:33----------
short fuse


---------00:34----------
um and not not anger issues just initial


---------00:38----------
like um outraged visceral responses


---------00:41----------
uh or like feelings um


---------00:46----------
for example uh you know whenever someone


---------00:48----------
says or does something and


---------00:50----------
even if i don't say anything i would


---------00:52----------
have this initial


---------00:54----------
like you know my my heart start beating


---------00:56----------
faster and


---------00:57----------
you know i get uh sweaty palms and like


---------01:00----------
i feel like i'm holding my breath


---------01:03----------
because it's something that my sister is


---------01:05----------
the same way and we've talked about it


---------01:07----------
and


---------01:07----------
like 99 we got it from our parents but


---------01:11----------
it's just something i've noticed and i


---------01:12----------
don't know exactly how to


---------01:14----------
like deal with it because it becomes


---------01:17----------
more apparent for me because usually


---------01:19----------
i go from like super passive um


---------01:22----------
or like calm to like you know


---------01:26----------
very active i guess or engaged with


---------01:29----------
whatever we're doing


---------01:31----------
and often what like triggers it it's not


---------01:34----------
even important topics


---------01:36----------
uh it happens even when i'm like gaming


---------01:38----------
for example you know like a friend


---------01:39----------
messes up like a mechanic or something i


---------01:41----------
you know i get the feeling of like oh my


---------01:43----------
god what are you doing


---------01:44----------
and then it also you know manifests


---------01:46----------
whenever i'm like


---------01:48----------
talking or like arguing or debating on


---------01:50----------
stuff


---------01:52----------
oh okay so so uh are you are you okay


---------01:55----------
hold on let me can i think for a second


---------01:56----------
puns


---------01:57----------
of course yeah sorry i just threw a lot


---------02:01----------
on


---------02:01----------
you at once no it's fine it's it's


---------02:03----------
actually very helpful


---------02:07----------
i'm just processing um so


---------02:10----------
what i'm hearing is that it's not like


---------02:11----------
something personal it's just like your


---------02:14----------
mind gets caught up with


---------02:16----------
things like arguments or gaming


---------02:19----------
yeah or something that like an event


---------02:21----------
that happens can you give me an example


---------02:24----------
um okay so maybe someone like


---------02:28----------
breaks something like in the house or


---------02:31----------
um you know does something like you know


---------02:33----------
considered stupid


---------02:34----------
and then or like messes up something


---------02:37----------
obvious


---------02:38----------
and my initial response is like oh my


---------02:41----------
god how could you do that


---------02:42----------
even if i don't say anything that's like


---------02:44----------
my


---------02:45----------
like instinct reaction to it puns would


---------02:48----------
you say that you're intolerant of the


---------02:49----------
stupidity of others


---------02:53----------
um i wouldn't say so i'm quite


---------02:56----------
i've accepted that most people do stupid


---------03:00----------
stuff


---------03:00----------
myself included sometimes then why do


---------03:03----------
you get upset when they do stupid stuff


---------03:07----------
i don't know um i feel like part of the


---------03:10----------
reason is


---------03:11----------
uh you know when i was growing up


---------03:15----------
a lot of the times like my dad for


---------03:17----------
example he's very


---------03:19----------
he means like we mean the world to him


---------03:21----------
he does


---------03:22----------
everything for us but like often like


---------03:25----------
even if we do something like somewhat


---------03:26----------
right you'll be like okay you should


---------03:28----------
have also done this though


---------03:29----------
and stuff like that you know like he


---------03:31----------
wants us to be like the best we can


---------03:34----------
and i know it comes from a face


---------03:37----------
do you expect other people to be the


---------03:39----------
best too


---------03:41----------
uh no but i i have thought about this


---------03:45----------
and i know i put myself to like


---------03:47----------
impossible standard


---------03:48----------
and i feel like sometimes that initial


---------03:51----------
reaction is


---------03:52----------
me putting the standards for me on other


---------03:54----------
people


---------03:55----------
if that makes sense is that what happens


---------03:59----------
uh i'm not 100 sure but it makes sense


---------04:02----------
when i think about it


---------04:04----------
okay so puns we've got two options here


---------04:06----------
one is it sounds like you're very bitter


---------04:09----------
so i i would i would love to just see


---------04:12----------
your face because i'm curious whether


---------04:14----------
you know you have color in your face


---------04:16----------
whether you have like medium features


---------04:18----------
uh we can do that if you want yeah let's


---------04:21----------
can you just turn on video real quick i


---------04:22----------
don't have to stream it


---------04:23----------
i'm just curious all right you look like


---------04:26----------
cause my room is very messy


---------04:28----------
that's okay um


---------04:31----------
so so there there are two things here


---------04:33----------
one is like we normally take like the


---------04:35----------
psychological angle right of like figure


---------04:37----------
out you know what like oh like you're


---------04:38----------
putting these expectations that your dad


---------04:40----------
put on you on other people like oh my


---------04:42----------
god


---------04:43----------
so we take that angle which it sounds


---------04:44----------
like you're pretty familiar with so i


---------04:46----------
would encourage you to explore that


---------04:47----------
the second thing that you could do is


---------04:48----------
balance your ayurvedic dosha


---------04:51----------
so if we think about res like you're


---------04:53----------
you're asking me


---------04:54----------
not how to deal with the impulsive anger


---------04:57----------
but how to prevent the impulsive anger


---------05:01----------
right how to stop the short fuse in the


---------05:03----------
first place


---------05:05----------
and so that's where i encourage you to


---------05:06----------
think a little bit about expectation


---------05:09----------
and what you expect from other people


---------05:11----------
because i would suspect that


---------05:13----------
it is other people's inability to live


---------05:16----------
up to your expectations that is the


---------05:17----------
short


---------05:18----------
that leads to the shortness of views


---------05:21----------
so you're just asking a lot of them


---------05:23----------
right like especially if you're playing


---------05:24----------
a game


---------05:26----------
that's messing up i'm sorry yeah yeah


---------05:30----------
not the end of the world if you can't


---------05:32----------
get it to work but uh yeah i'm sorry i


---------05:33----------
don't want to waste your time


---------05:35----------
it's it's okay i think i uh you're


---------05:37----------
you're coughing better i think so like i


---------05:39----------
i noticed that you had like some redness


---------05:41----------
like


---------05:41----------
especially on your cheeks and stuff it


---------05:42----------
doesn't look quite like acne


---------05:44----------
do you have acne uh no but my skin gets


---------05:48----------
very dry


---------05:49----------
dry and does it get red uh yes


---------05:53----------
okay and and so we can't i didn't get


---------05:56----------
very good look because it was blurry but


---------05:58----------
so the other thing that you could do is


---------05:59----------
reduce your bit though do you know what


---------06:00----------
that is


---------06:02----------
uh can you remind me yeah so in ayurveda


---------06:05----------
so in western medicine we think like


---------06:08----------
everyone's mind is the same


---------06:09----------
right like we say that we don't sort of


---------06:11----------
say that they're different kinds of


---------06:13----------
minds


---------06:14----------
so we know that like in physical


---------06:16----------
attributes like some people have red


---------06:18----------
hair some people have black hair some


---------06:19----------
people


---------06:20----------
have brown hair some people have blonde


---------06:21----------
hair and in the same way there are


---------06:23----------
different


---------06:24----------
versions of like mental faculties


---------06:27----------
so it's not just like iq but then like


---------06:29----------
we sort of know that some people are


---------06:31----------
artistic some people are creative


---------06:32----------
whatever


---------06:33----------
some people are like more mathematical


---------06:35----------
but actually ayurveda says that even


---------06:37----------
like our emotional responses to stress


---------06:40----------
come in three buckets so some people get


---------06:43----------
anxious


---------06:44----------
some people get depressed and some


---------06:46----------
people get angry


---------06:47----------
so anytime we put pressure on your mind


---------06:50----------
you may be more likely to respond with a


---------06:52----------
short fuse


---------06:53----------
and so if you want to reduce that


---------06:55----------
intrinsic


---------06:57----------
like approach to anger what you need to


---------06:59----------
do is reduce your pitta


---------07:01----------
so bitte is reduced so this is it's kind


---------07:03----------
of weird but ayurveda sort of says that


---------07:05----------
they're like these


---------07:06----------
three elemental qualities that sort of


---------07:09----------
are


---------07:09----------
correlated with certain mental and


---------07:11----------
physical attributes


---------07:12----------
high pitta for example is associated


---------07:14----------
with anger irritability


---------07:17----------
ulcers indigestion and like hypertension


---------07:21----------
for example okay so if you reduce your


---------07:24----------
pitta and you have


---------07:26----------
any of these problems all of those


---------07:27----------
problems will get better


---------07:29----------
and in your case what i would suggest is


---------07:31----------
that you


---------07:32----------
do you like yogurt i i like everything


---------07:37----------
okay so i know this is gonna sound


---------07:39----------
really weird and it's not gonna make a


---------07:40----------
huge difference but if you do it for a


---------07:42----------
little while it'll probably like a


---------07:43----------
couple months


---------07:44----------
i'd be curious to see whether it helps


---------07:46----------
with your short fuse


---------07:47----------
but what i would say is take plain


---------07:49----------
yogurt okay no like sugar or fruit or


---------07:51----------
anything like that


---------07:52----------
take plain yogurt use like


---------07:57----------
you know get like a eight or ten ounce


---------07:59----------
glass


---------08:00----------
uh you sound like european so let me


---------08:02----------
just think about you know


---------08:03----------
like like 300 mls so like take like 300


---------08:07----------
like a 300 ml glass


---------08:09----------
and put 100 ml of yogurt


---------08:12----------
and 200 ml of water and mix it together


---------08:16----------
into a drink it'll be kind of like a


---------08:17----------
weird like sour


---------08:19----------
cool drink and i want you to drink that


---------08:22----------
i have that


---------08:22----------
drink i'm from bulgaria and we have that


---------08:24----------
drink it's called irian


---------08:28----------
what does it have sugar or anything no


---------08:30----------
it's just yogurt and water as you said


---------08:33----------
do you drink that i haven't had it


---------08:36----------
probably in like two years okay so but


---------08:39----------
no sugar okay


---------08:40----------
so make ariane and drink it like every


---------08:43----------
like


---------08:43----------
five days a week for like two months and


---------08:46----------
it should help your anger


---------08:47----------
i know it sounds weird i mean yeah i


---------08:50----------
mean it's


---------08:51----------
it's the body so it makes sense okay


---------08:53----------
yeah


---------08:56----------
from uh from a you know scientific


---------08:58----------
standpoint so like you know the things


---------08:59----------
that we put into our gut


---------09:01----------
are um okay so i'm gonna share a paper


---------09:06----------
on stream for a second and then


---------09:08----------
um i'll share it with you two over are


---------09:10----------
you watching stream


---------09:11----------
yeah yes okay so i'll just i'll just


---------09:13----------
share it on stream okay


---------09:15----------
so like this is just a a really


---------09:17----------
interesting paper that shows that


---------09:19----------
um you know the bacteria in your gut oh


---------09:23----------
look this is in zagreb sort of in your


---------09:24----------
neighborhood neighborhood


---------09:26----------
um but so role of gut microbiota


---------09:29----------
in the interaction between immunity and


---------09:31----------
psychiatry so like this is just a paper


---------09:32----------
that talks about


---------09:34----------
like we showed the links between your


---------09:37----------
gut microbiome and your brain gut axis


---------09:39----------
regulation


---------09:42----------
behavioral variations and


---------09:43----------
neuropsychiatric disorders so what that


---------09:45----------
means


---------09:46----------
let me try to find one because i think


---------09:47----------
there's actually something about um


---------09:51----------
anger here i know this is the one that


---------09:54----------
has anger


---------09:55----------
but there's actually a paper um i can't


---------09:58----------
find it right now


---------09:59----------
that talks about uh people with autism


---------10:03----------
who have


---------10:04----------
very angry like outbreaks and like throw


---------10:07----------
things and temper tantrums and stuff


---------10:09----------
and that actually adjusting their gut


---------10:10----------
microbiome actually reduces the number


---------10:13----------
of temper tantrums that people with


---------10:15----------
autism


---------10:16----------
will throw and so i'm not quite sure if


---------10:19----------
this is how it works but thousands of


---------10:20----------
years ago ayurvedic physicians basically


---------10:22----------
said


---------10:23----------
people who have short fuses should drink


---------10:25----------
aryan like


---------10:26----------
every day and they notice that people


---------10:29----------
who drink aryan


---------10:30----------
have fewer short fuses or have a longer


---------10:33----------
fuse


---------10:33----------
and now we have some evidence that at


---------10:35----------
least there's a connection between


---------10:37----------
because if you think about aryan and


---------10:38----------
yogurt like what's in there there's


---------10:40----------
going to be lactobacillus


---------10:41----------
and bacteria in there right yeah yeah


---------10:44----------
and so you don't want to drink it like


---------10:46----------
bottled or or pasteurized or whatever


---------10:48----------
because that'll kill


---------10:49----------
off all the bacteria but something about


---------10:51----------
that may actually adjust


---------10:52----------
the way that your gut bacteria is which


---------10:55----------
in turn will affect something called


---------10:57----------
dysbiosis


---------10:58----------
which is like inflammation in your gut


---------11:00----------
which actually has mental effects


---------11:05----------
so are they any foods or drinks i should


---------11:08----------
avoid


---------11:10----------
yeah so you want to avoid spicy foods


---------11:12----------
you want to try to eat raw foods


---------11:16----------
and you want foods that are cool if


---------11:18----------
possible


---------11:20----------
so salad is very good for you okay you


---------11:23----------
just killed me because i love spicy food


---------11:26----------
yep so this is the problem with pittas


---------11:28----------
is that oftentimes the foods that you


---------11:30----------
like are the ones that are worse for you


---------11:34----------
and so what i want you to notice though


---------11:36----------
is as you start to eat cooler foods


---------11:39----------
there's going to be there's two kinds of


---------11:41----------
love okay there's gonna be something


---------11:43----------
that


---------11:43----------
feels really aligned with you and


---------11:45----------
there's something that feels very


---------11:47----------
balancing to you


---------11:48----------
like me as a vata i love doing a


---------11:51----------
thousand things in one day


---------11:52----------
but i also find that like if i do a


---------11:54----------
thousand things in one day it's sort of


---------11:56----------
like


---------11:56----------
it feels really good in the moment but


---------11:58----------
it doesn't feel balancing


---------12:00----------
i actually feel really good when i like


---------12:02----------
start my day off grounded


---------12:04----------
it's kind of different there's a


---------12:06----------
different kind of feels good one is like


---------12:08----------
a balancing feels good


---------12:09----------
and one is like an exciting feels good


---------12:11----------
it's like let's go buddy


---------12:13----------
but then it's sort of like no that's


---------12:14----------
actually not good for me and as you


---------12:16----------
start to eat colder foods you'll see


---------12:18----------
you know how you start to feel different


---------12:20----------
and it'll start to feel like kind of


---------12:21----------
cooling refreshing


---------12:22----------
sort of countering the way that you feel


---------12:27----------
so going for like fruits salads as you


---------12:29----------
said just raw foods would


---------12:30----------
help me in the long run okay and try not


---------12:33----------
to


---------12:34----------
mix fruit and vegetables in one sitting


---------12:42----------
their digestive profiles are different


---------12:44----------
and so for optimal digestion you want to


---------12:46----------
eat them separately


---------12:49----------
what would you say is like a good space


---------12:51----------
between those


---------12:52----------
like times hour and a half 90 minutes


---------12:55----------
okay great


---------12:56----------
thank you okay can i ask a follow-up


---------12:59----------
question


---------13:00----------
sure wait so are kale smoothies bad then


---------13:05----------
so when we say bad right let's remember


---------13:09----------
that there's like


---------13:09----------
hierarchies of health so like


---------13:12----------
if your option is between a hamburger


---------13:15----------
and a kale smoothie


---------13:16----------
go kale smoothie but if you really want


---------13:18----------
to optimize your digestion you


---------13:20----------
actually should not mix different kinds


---------13:22----------
of macronutrients


---------13:24----------
and there's a really simple logical


---------13:25----------
reason for this you guys ready for it


---------13:30----------
yay nay okay who knows what a lipase is


---------13:34----------
does anybody know what a lipase is i'm


---------13:35----------
asking chat


---------13:40----------
anybody know if you guys know


---------13:43----------
french you know yeah it's an enzyme


---------13:46----------
so it's an enzyme that breaks down fat


---------13:49----------
so then there's also something called an


---------13:51----------
amylase which is an enzyme that breaks


---------13:53----------
down carbohydrates


---------13:55----------
and then there's something called a


---------13:56----------
protease which is an enzyme that breaks


---------13:59----------
down protein


---------14:00----------
now when i drink let's say i just eat so


---------14:02----------
what happens is when i put food in my


---------14:04----------
mouth


---------14:05----------
the tongue in in neurons receptors in my


---------14:09----------
mouth detect


---------14:10----------
what i'm eating and what they do is they


---------14:13----------
tell my


---------14:14----------
digestive enzymes they secrete the


---------14:17----------
appropriate digestive enzymes


---------14:19----------
from the stomach and gallbladder and


---------14:21----------
intestines so when i eat like a cake for


---------14:23----------
example that's carbohydrate and sugar


---------14:26----------
i mean sorry carbohydrate and fat it


---------14:28----------
sends signals to my gut and it says hey


---------14:30----------
we need lipase and we need an amylase


---------14:32----------
now the tricky thing is that if i just


---------14:34----------
eat one macronutrient


---------14:36----------
if i eat just protein for example then


---------14:39----------
like


---------14:40----------
my my i tell my gut to secrete protease


---------14:43----------
and then i have a hundred units of


---------14:46----------
protein that i


---------14:47----------
swallow and i have a hundred units of


---------14:49----------
protease so my digestion is a hundred


---------14:50----------
percent


---------14:52----------
because in my stomach there's like


---------14:53----------
protease that's floating around with the


---------14:55----------
protein and so the digestion works out


---------14:57----------
great


---------14:58----------
the problem is that if i eat for example


---------15:01----------
different kinds of things together


---------15:02----------
if i eat partially carbohydrate


---------15:05----------
partially protein and partially fat


---------15:07----------
then i've got three different kinds of


---------15:09----------
macro nutrients floating around in my


---------15:11----------
stomach


---------15:11----------
and three different kinds of enzymes


---------15:13----------
floating around in my stomach


---------15:14----------
and so the chance that a carbohydrate


---------15:17----------
molecule hits an amylase


---------15:18----------
is only 30 so that what that means is


---------15:21----------
that there's like


---------15:22----------
improper digestion does that make sense


---------15:29----------
yeah so the the problem with smoothies


---------15:32----------
if you talk to ayurvedic or naturopathic


---------15:34----------
physicians they'll say that smoothies


---------15:37----------
are not


---------15:37----------
good for you i mean it's it's not that


---------15:39----------
they're not good for you like servings


---------15:40----------
of fruits and vegetables are still


---------15:42----------
really healthy for you


---------15:43----------
but as you like if we think about you


---------15:45----------
know what's like


---------15:46----------
is a burger healthy well like it depends


---------15:49----------
on what you're comparing it to


---------15:50----------
right so like things are not healthy in


---------15:52----------
isolation there's like a hierarchy of


---------15:54----------
health


---------15:55----------
and and if your problem is you eat very


---------15:58----------
unhealthy throughout the entire day i'd


---------15:59----------
say by all means have a


---------16:01----------
have a kale smoothie and get like two


---------16:02----------
servings of fruits and vegetables and


---------16:04----------
fiber and all that good stuff


---------16:06----------
but if you want to go to the next level


---------16:08----------
right so this is where like the yogis


---------16:09----------
who meditated and tried to gain


---------16:11----------
enlightenment


---------16:12----------
realize that they're like very very


---------16:14----------
fine-tuning to like really optimize your


---------16:16----------
dps


---------16:17----------
the higher you want to get on the dps


---------16:19----------
meters the more fine-tuned you want to


---------16:21----------
be


---------16:22----------
and so eventually like a kale smoothie


---------16:24----------
is really good


---------16:26----------
if you're like you know in the bottom 80


---------16:28----------
of health


---------16:29----------
but if you're in that top 20 and you


---------16:31----------
want to optimize your digestion


---------16:33----------
you should split up some of those


---------16:34----------
macronutrients into separate meals


---------16:39----------
does that make sense yeah that makes


---------16:41----------
sense i shouldn't have a problem because


---------16:43----------
i would like i would rather eat like two


---------16:44----------
oranges than have like


---------16:46----------
orange juice okay


---------16:51----------
okay yeah and also that psychological


---------16:54----------
stuff is totally legit too i mean by all


---------16:55----------
means think about you know whether you


---------16:57----------
get pests at people because your dad got


---------16:58----------
pissed at you


---------16:59----------
like you should do that psychological


---------17:00----------
work like how did it feel when


---------17:02----------
you know you were never good enough for


---------17:04----------
him it's


---------17:06----------
it wasn't even like that it's more like


---------17:08----------
just being very critical


---------17:10----------
sure yeah so i i think i think


---------17:14----------
look into that stuff too but it's a good


---------17:16----------
ayurvedic kind of perspective


---------17:20----------
okay oh that that thing completely


---------17:24----------
new element in my equation yeah good


---------17:28----------
so that's that's gonna be the lowest


---------17:29----------
hanging fruit no pun intended


---------17:32----------
oh please please intent


---------17:36----------
right so it's the areas that we haven't


---------17:38----------
considered that we can oftentimes get


---------17:40----------
the most benefit from


---------17:42----------
okay i'll do that then i'll buy it


---------17:45----------
tomorrow


---------17:46----------
okay make sure it's not so puns if it's


---------17:50----------
pasteurized then you need to get yogurt


---------17:52----------
that has


---------17:52----------
active cultures and make it yourself


---------17:56----------
uh okay it's gonna be a bit difficult


---------17:58----------
because i live abroad right now


---------18:00----------
for my studies so they don't have like


---------18:02----------
the the best


---------18:04----------
just yogurt yeah okay okay okay okay


---------18:07----------

---------18:10----------

---------18:14----------
