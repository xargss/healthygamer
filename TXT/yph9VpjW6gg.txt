---------00:00----------
so let's talk a little bit more about


---------00:01----------
meditation how to choose a meditation


---------00:03----------
form just one I feel comfortable with


---------00:05----------
are they're in meditation forms for


---------00:07----------
specific things like in Qi Gong one form


---------00:10----------
is good for your heart one for your


---------00:11----------
liver yeah so okay how do you develop a


---------00:14----------
meditation regimen fantastic question so


---------00:16----------
the first thing to remember is that


---------00:18----------
meditation actually has two words in Sun


---------00:21----------
Swift more than two but let's start with


---------00:22----------
two


---------00:23----------
one is thought or not and one is Dionne


---------00:26----------
skipped my question what question


---------00:30----------
complacent the one about complacent yeah


---------00:39----------
I'm gonna get I'm gonna get to that one


---------00:41----------
it's just I'm trying to link them


---------00:43----------
together so that they like it's like


---------00:46----------
instead of answering them randomly I'm


---------00:48----------
gonna like make a chain so you guys


---------00:49----------
build up understanding and then we get


---------00:51----------
to that one so so how do you choose a


---------00:55----------
meditation how do you know what you're


---------00:57----------
comfortable with it's not that I could


---------00:59----------
skip the question it's a good one it's


---------01:00----------
just I want to lay some foundation which


---------01:02----------
will make it easier to answer so one is


---------01:08----------
good for your your heart one is good for


---------01:10----------
your lungs things like that fine so the


---------01:12----------
first thing to understand is there are


---------01:13----------
two Sun Squidward's for meditation one


---------01:14----------
is da da da which means focus so that


---------01:17----------
Erna is a verb so it's something that


---------01:19----------
you do and the other one is V on which


---------01:22----------
means a state of mind that you achieve


---------01:25----------
the first thing that people get confused


---------01:28----------
about in meditation is they say like oh


---------01:29----------
like the I'm not good at meditating and


---------01:32----------
what do they mean by that what they mean


---------01:35----------
by that is that when I do this


---------01:36----------
particular practice I do not enter the


---------01:40----------
state of mind that everyone keeps


---------01:41----------
talking about I don't feel this inner


---------01:44----------
peace or a no mind state or things like


---------01:46----------
that right and I would bet that niz may


---------01:51----------
not have gotten there today just based


---------01:53----------
on how he was talking


---------01:55----------
so it's this is how I kind of describe


---------01:59----------
it so people say like oh how do I find


---------02:00----------
the right technique of meditation it's


---------02:02----------
the one that gets you to the state of


---------02:04----------
mind so you can sit and you can meditate


---------02:06----------
we can do alternate nostril breathing


---------02:07----------
this is a torn-up actually it's a brand


---------02:09----------
I am but it's a dire enough there's


---------02:11----------
something that I do so while I'm doing


---------02:13----------
this my thoughts can be all over the


---------02:14----------
place but the hope is that when I do


---------02:17----------
this right that the focus of my mind on


---------02:22----------
my breathing will stop any extraneous


---------02:25----------
thoughts and then eventually I'll enter


---------02:28----------
the state of mind where I basically have


---------02:29----------
no thoughts that's the state of Beyond


---------02:31----------
and that takes practice but essentially


---------02:34----------
the kind of meditation technique that


---------02:36----------
you should choose is one that gets you


---------02:38----------
to be on as quickly as possible so if


---------02:41----------
you're doing this and your mind is


---------02:43----------
wandering all over the place that's not


---------02:44----------
the right technique for you practice


---------02:47----------
does make perfect but in my experience


---------02:49----------
if you try different buckets of


---------02:51----------
techniques there are some things that


---------02:53----------
work for someone's cognitive fingerprint


---------02:55----------
better than others so we each have a


---------02:58----------
brain and our brain has different kinds


---------03:00----------
of cortices and some people can focus


---------03:04----------
the attention of their mind through a


---------03:07----------
particular cortex so either through the


---------03:10----------
visual cortex somatosensory cortex audio


---------03:14----------
cortex and so like they're different and


---------03:17----------
when we think about a focused mind


---------03:18----------
there's some stuff that's going on on


---------03:19----------
the front in the frontal lobes but that


---------03:23----------
different people have like so that we


---------03:24----------
got to think about this like we each


---------03:25----------
have a unique face we have unique hands


---------03:27----------
we have unique fingerprints but no one


---------03:30----------
talks about the uniqueness of our mind


---------03:32----------
like no one [ __ ] talks about this


---------03:33----------
blows my mind everyone's mind is


---------03:36----------
different and so everyone's mind has a


---------03:39----------
different regimen of meditation


---------03:40----------
techniques that is going to be ideally


---------03:42----------
suited for them there are 112 meditation


---------03:45----------
techniques out of which one will work


---------03:47----------
relatively easily for in theory every


---------03:50----------
human who has ever been born is alive


---------03:52----------
now or will be born that this covers the


---------03:55----------
whole spectrum of different people's


---------03:57----------
cognitive fingerprints


---------03:59----------
and so you should do different


---------04:00----------
techniques based on what that is for


---------04:02----------
someone who's ADHD


---------04:03----------
I recommend this sound meditation and


---------04:06----------
this is the first one that I teach


---------04:08----------
inside meditation we can't really do it


---------04:09----------
here because it's not loud enough but


---------04:13----------
you go to you go to any kind of loud


---------04:19----------
place where there like people and things


---------04:21----------
going around so like a train station or


---------04:23----------
a cafeteria you close your eyes and you


---------04:25----------
try to listen to as many sounds as you


---------04:27----------
can as rapidly as you can don't engage


---------04:30----------
with the sounds but just have your mind


---------04:32----------
move from thing to thing to thing to


---------04:34----------
thing to thing because the mind of an


---------04:36----------
ADHD person is moving very fast and so


---------04:39----------
the way that you get a mind to calm down


---------04:41----------
is the same way that you get a baby to


---------04:43----------
sit still like you guys know how you get


---------04:45----------
a toddler to like sit the [ __ ] down you


---------04:48----------
have them run around a whole lot if you


---------04:51----------
try to force them into one place they're


---------04:54----------
gonna wriggle and things like that so


---------04:55----------
you just haven't like you exhaust them


---------04:57----------
you take them to a playground then the


---------04:58----------
child will calm down and the ADHD mind


---------05:00----------
is like that and so when like I tear my


---------05:03----------
hair out when I have people who have


---------05:04----------
ADHD and we were like trying all this


---------05:06----------
mindfulness stuff they're trying to like


---------05:08----------
brute force like have their mind set


---------05:09----------
there no no no man like exhaustion move


---------05:12----------
fast move from stimulus to stimulus to


---------05:15----------
stimulus to stimulus I hear someone


---------05:17----------
talking cell phone ringing someone


---------05:19----------
dropped a fort someone dropped something


---------05:21----------
over here someone opened a box there's


---------05:23----------
someone walking by another cellphone


---------05:25----------
laughter crying cell phone clinking


---------05:29----------
that's the way you do it and you push


---------05:33----------
your mind as fast as it can go as many


---------05:35----------
stimuli as you can cover and eventually


---------05:37----------
your mind will slow down and it will


---------05:39----------
calm down right


---------05:42----------
that's the Tecna


---------05:44----------
for people with ADHD hard to do here and


---------05:50----------
so someone says yeah I don't think that


---------05:52----------
would work for you fine there are


---------05:53----------
bunches of other techniques right so


---------05:55----------
maybe try an investigative technique so


---------05:58----------
these are some of my favorites so we did


---------06:00----------
this a couple weeks ago with or like one


---------06:01----------
week ago with the court so take a moment


---------06:06----------
yet in the middle of Ironforge is a


---------06:08----------
great place to do this technique now you


---------06:10----------
guys understand so take a moment to


---------06:13----------
notice your breath in the temperature of


---------06:15----------
your breath what do you think so


---------06:22----------
what do you notice about the temperature


---------06:24----------
of your breath


---------06:26----------
[Music]


---------06:35----------
so where do you feel the temperature


---------06:44----------
so now what I want you to do is follow


---------06:46----------
the coldness right see where that


---------06:50----------
coldness goes do you only feel it in


---------06:52----------
your nose where in your nose the tip of


---------06:54----------
your nose the middle of your nose the


---------06:55----------
top of your nose your sinuses your


---------06:58----------
throat right so now like think about


---------07:10----------
this so now what I want you guys to do


---------07:12----------
so this is actually trickery I'm sorry


---------07:13----------
I've tricked you now I want you to pay


---------07:16----------
attention every time you breathe what


---------07:19----------
happens in your mind


---------07:21----------
as you focus on the temperature of the


---------07:26----------
breath your thoughts cease for a moment


---------07:28----------
and then you analyze it and then


---------07:30----------
thoughts return so as you close your


---------07:33----------
eyes for a moment no thoughts and then


---------07:37----------
after the breath thoughts thoughts no


---------07:40----------
thoughts thoughts no thoughts so you're


---------07:43----------
training yourself to enter the no mind


---------07:45----------
state and now what happens is you start


---------07:50----------
to breathe slowly and then as you start


---------07:54----------
to believe slowly the space of time that


---------07:57----------
you have no thoughts increases


---------08:12----------
right and then some of you dumbasses are


---------08:15----------
getting upset with chat like let chat do


---------08:19----------
what it wants to it's not going to work


---------08:21----------
for everyone the goal here is not to get


---------08:24----------
chat in line just think about that for a


---------08:28----------
second for those of you who are raging


---------08:29----------
its chat like what are you trying to do


---------08:32----------
there what are you hoping to accomplish


---------08:34----------
what do you think happens when you yell


---------08:36----------
at chat does chat listen are they going


---------08:40----------
to be shamed into listening to you know


---------08:43----------
so notice that within yourself that


---------08:46----------
you're like holy [ __ ] this stuff is


---------08:48----------
working and chat why don't you like so


---------08:50----------
forget about them that's what we talked


---------08:52----------
about for the last hour and a half


---------08:54----------
don't worry about other people now


---------08:56----------
practice it notice your rage at chat and


---------08:59----------
then notice how is you rage at chat


---------09:02----------
you feel worse go back to the [ __ ]


---------09:06----------
breath let that thought go let the


---------09:09----------
judgment go let the frustration go just


---------09:13----------
feel the breath where does it go


---------09:24----------
you


---------09:33----------
you


---------09:38----------
right there we go that's your practice


---------09:41----------
so now you express gratitude towards


---------09:44----------
chat because chat has now helped you


---------09:47----------
understand how your mind gets off track


---------09:50----------
how your mind experiences judgment how


---------09:54----------
your mind feels disturbed how you can be


---------09:59----------
in a place of peace from meditating and


---------10:00----------
then rage a chat and then come back


---------10:05----------
right we can't blame chat for what it is


---------10:10----------
do you blame a rain cloud for raining on


---------10:13----------
your parade like you can but chat is


---------10:16----------
chat we can't you know like let's not


---------10:22----------
blame them for being who they are it's


---------10:25----------
not their fault that they're you know


---------10:27----------
confused in Peppe hands and more Peppe


---------10:30----------
hands and kacct


---------10:31----------
I don't even know what that what


---------10:33----------
attacked w-why is there a w lull w I


---------10:37----------
don't even there like some kind of


---------10:40----------
horrible bot that doesn't know what it's


---------10:44----------
saying right can't blame them for that


---------10:49----------
accept them for they who they are okay


---------10:59----------
so I've been practicing the meditation


---------11:01----------
techniques you've showed they've been


---------11:03----------
very therapeutic was wondering where to


---------11:04----------
find a good source for more of these


---------11:06----------
practices I don't think there is a


---------11:07----------
source right so the meditation


---------11:09----------
techniques like I studied for seven


---------11:11----------
years to become a monk and I learned a


---------11:14----------
lot of different techniques from a lot


---------11:15----------
of different masters and it's kind of an


---------11:17----------
amalgamation of like lots of different


---------11:19----------
texts and books so unfortunately I don't


---------11:22----------
have a good source but I'm gonna make


---------11:26----------
one so I'm gonna I'm gonna cover like


---------11:27----------
hopefully one day I'll cover all 112 and


---------11:30----------
then you'll have all of them okay so now


---------11:35----------
we're gonna actually go back to


---------11:40----------
complacent verses content I think was


---------11:46----------
the question right so now we so I okay


---------11:54----------
so if if we were like paying attention


---------11:56----------
to mrs. interview earlier he was talking


---------12:00----------
about being determined right so


---------12:03----------
determination comes from ambition and


---------12:05----------
ambition is like kind of a desire and


---------12:08----------
like a desire is sort of like a goal so


---------12:12----------
generally speaking we think about


---------12:13----------
ourselves as being motivated by goals by


---------12:17----------
the accomplishment of a particular thing


---------12:18----------
and complacency happens when you


---------12:22----------
accomplish that goal and you kind of


---------12:24----------
don't have another goal complacency


---------12:26----------
exists with a goal and achievement


---------12:29----------
oriented mindset like if you just think


---------12:32----------
about the word to be complacent is to


---------12:35----------
like not strive for something right like


---------12:37----------
that's what the word means so if you're


---------12:42----------
calm


---------12:43----------
then you're like you're not striving for


---------12:45----------
something and so it implies that in


---------12:48----------
order to achieve something you have to


---------12:50----------
strive and to strive is to try to


---------12:54----------
achieve a goal and to achieve a goal as


---------12:56----------
a particular outcome orientation and so


---------13:01----------
like if you're content


---------13:02----------
does that mean that you become


---------13:03----------
complacent actually no because you start


---------13:05----------
operating on a completely different axis


---------13:08----------
so you start operating on the axis of


---------13:11----------
action not goal so when I show up on


---------13:15----------
stream I'm not complete like am i


---------13:17----------
complacent no am i content like yeah I'm


---------13:21----------
not not Kentucky I'm not discontent like


---------13:24----------
I show up and I enjoy myself and I have


---------13:26----------
a good time and I'm content with where I


---------13:28----------
am and I'm not trying to achieve


---------13:31----------
anything particular right I mean like I


---------13:34----------
am in the sense that there's someone in


---------13:36----------
front of me and I try to talk to them


---------13:37----------
and I try to answer questions so I'm


---------13:38----------
trying to like do goal like goals in a


---------13:40----------
very microscopic sense but I'm not like


---------13:42----------
trying to achieve anything and so I I


---------13:45----------
think the the way the simple answer is


---------13:47----------
service so complacency is about ambition


---------13:51----------
and goals and service is not I mean


---------13:54----------
service can have goals too but like it's


---------13:56----------
kind of like a different mindset right


---------13:57----------
like I'm here to help and I'm gonna help


---------13:59----------
the best way that I can and I could be


---------14:01----------
content with that because I'm not


---------14:04----------
expecting to change anything I'm just


---------14:05----------
here to help and offer what I am I show


---------14:07----------
up and I say this is what I am how can I


---------14:09----------
help and for some people it's gonna help


---------14:11----------
and for some people that's fine that's


---------14:13----------
contentment but I'm still motivated to


---------14:16----------
do it but I'm just motivated out of


---------14:17----------
service the other word for service is


---------14:19----------
the Dharma right so I do by Dharma so


---------14:23----------
people think that personal ambition is


---------14:27----------
what leads to motivation and once you


---------14:31----------
achieve that ambition and then you are


---------14:34----------
complacent but you can operate from a


---------14:35----------
place of Dharma which is not about


---------14:37----------
personal ambition it can look a lot like


---------14:39----------
personal ambition but it's to serve so I


---------14:43----------
show up and I say like how can I help


---------14:44----------
and then I try my best to like actually


---------14:47----------
do a good job and to grow but that


---------14:50----------
doesn't lead to complacency but it also


---------14:51----------
keeps me content because I'm trying to


---------14:54----------
just do the best job that I can


---------14:56----------
so Dharma is the Sun script word for


---------14:59----------
duty or responsibility and I think


---------15:02----------
rather than thinking about morality in


---------15:03----------
terms of right and wrong I try to live


---------15:05----------
my life according to the anima to my


---------15:07----------
duty or my responsibility and Dharma is


---------15:09----------
kind of like it's it's complicated it's


---------15:13----------
a very complicated thing


---------15:14----------
to figure out your Dharma the other


---------15:16----------
thing about Dharma that I think is


---------15:17----------
really important is that Dharma allows


---------15:20----------
you to tolerate the hard things in life


---------15:22----------
so most of the time we tend to gravitate


---------15:27----------
away from pain and towards pleasure


---------15:30----------
right like I don't want to apply for


---------15:32----------
this job because they could reject me I


---------15:34----------
don't want to ask this girl out because


---------15:35----------
she may say no so the avoidance of pain


---------15:38----------
keeps us from doing a lot of things


---------15:43----------
that's just how human beings work but


---------15:47----------
Dharma sort of says like I don't [ __ ]


---------15:50----------
care how you feel you have to do it


---------15:52----------
because it's important right so like if


---------15:55----------
I'm trying to impress a girl like let's


---------15:57----------
say I'm in medical school and like I'm


---------15:59----------
attracted to someone and I want her to


---------16:04----------
think highly of me and so that's gonna


---------16:06----------
shape all my behaviors in all kinds of


---------16:08----------
weird ways like I'm gonna be like dress


---------16:10----------
a certain way and act a certain way you


---------16:11----------
know if I'm working in the emergency


---------16:14----------
room my favorite example of late and


---------16:16----------
someone comes in with like with a


---------16:19----------
gunshot wound and I have to like get in


---------16:21----------
there and do chest compressions and then


---------16:23----------
after I do chest compressions I'm gonna


---------16:26----------
like walk back to the call room and


---------16:27----------
she's gonna see me and I'm gonna be like


---------16:29----------
disheveled and covered in vomit and


---------16:31----------
blood and I'm gonna look [ __ ] awful


---------16:34----------
and smell awful but I don't [ __ ] care


---------16:38----------
about that because like I had to do the


---------16:40----------
chest compressions like everything all


---------16:43----------
of my personal [ __ ] goes away when


---------16:45----------
I'm doing my enema like it just doesn't


---------16:46----------
matter you just do the thing that you


---------16:48----------
need to do so anonymize is just helps


---------16:56----------
you like helps you do the tough thing


---------16:58----------
because it's more important than you so


---------17:00----------
you guys have to also understand it's


---------17:01----------
like if we think about like why you


---------17:02----------
avoid things in your life due to pain


---------17:05----------
it's paying for you that's what causes


---------17:07----------
you to avoid right it's not paying for


---------17:09----------
other people it's like paying for


---------17:12----------
yourself that causes you to avoid and


---------17:13----------
not do the things that you need to do in


---------17:15----------
fact most of the people that I work with


---------17:17----------
most of the gamers that I work with they


---------17:19----------
will do ten times as much for another


---------17:22----------
human being as they're willing to do for


---------17:23----------
themselves if someone says hey man like


---------17:27----------
I need to clean out my place and move


---------17:28----------
out can you give me a hand they're like


---------17:30----------
absolutely dude I'm there can you clean


---------17:32----------
your own [ __ ] room no [ __ ] way


---------17:34----------
but you'll help someone else clean that


---------17:36----------
room because you're a good person it's


---------17:40----------
[ __ ] weird right so why are you able


---------17:42----------
to do that why is it so easy for you to


---------17:45----------
clean someone's room if they ask for


---------17:47----------
your help but it's so hard to clean your


---------17:50----------
own room it's because that's part of


---------17:52----------
your dogma you have a tournament to that


---------17:54----------
and what gamers don't realize is that


---------17:56----------
they like don't have they don't have a


---------17:58----------
Dharma to themselves you owe this to


---------18:00----------
yourself you owe yourself a life where


---------18:04----------
you get better you owe yourself a life


---------18:06----------
of peace and contentment and happiness


---------18:08----------
and success you owe that to yourself but


---------18:12----------
you're not willing to do it for yourself


---------18:13----------
because you don't realize that you owe


---------18:14----------
yourself that you blame yourself for not


---------18:17----------
having it but that's not what the


---------18:18----------
dynamic person says the dynamic person


---------18:20----------
doesn't say why the [ __ ] haven't you


---------18:22----------
cleaned your room your dynamic person


---------18:24----------
says if you need help I'm there to help


---------18:26----------
you but as a gamer do you help yourself


---------18:28----------
no you [ __ ] blame yourself like [ __ ]


---------18:31----------
you you suck at life


---------18:32----------
why can't you beat Arabic to yourself


---------18:35----------
why can't you be like hey man it looks


---------18:37----------
like you need some help you feel bad


---------18:40----------
about yourself like let me help you out


---------18:42----------
let's go to the grocery store why don't


---------18:44----------
we like eat something healthy so we feel


---------18:46----------
better about ourselves why don't we do


---------18:48----------
some exercise like why don't we like


---------18:49----------
clean up our room a little bit like you


---------18:51----------
owe this to yourself man come on dude


---------18:52----------
like be your own best friend you don't


---------18:54----------
know how to do that that's because you


---------18:56----------
don't realize you have a Dharma to


---------18:57----------
yourself you have learn about other


---------18:58----------
people but you don't understand your


---------18:59----------
Thommo to yourself


---------19:01----------
so Dharma is an incredible source of


---------19:04----------
strength


---------19:05----------
it's an incredible source of like power


---------19:08----------
and tolerance for the negative


---------19:14----------
okay


---------19:19----------
all right so


---------19:24----------
okay so now we get to the next question


---------19:27----------
is the harm of the same as Dow or tau or


---------19:30----------
the way in doubt a chain is it the


---------19:33----------
current life the way of things of nature


---------19:36----------
of universal patterned currents is it


---------19:38----------
connected to the flow State is it


---------19:40----------
indicated by our emotions help us


---------19:44----------
understand the Irma better okay so Parma


---------19:46----------
is the same as doubt so I think that's


---------19:48----------
the same concept at its root it has


---------19:51----------
slightly different manifestations


---------19:58----------
I do think I you know it's been a long


---------20:01----------
time since I've studied the daodejing so


---------20:04----------
I'm not quite sure exactly what the


---------20:06----------
current means but generally I think that


---------20:09----------
all that [ __ ] is the same like it's


---------20:11----------
there all talking about the same stuff


---------20:12----------
so I think like in the Sun script system


---------20:15----------
there's the Ottoman there's karma and I


---------20:17----------
think Dao kind of encapsulates both of


---------20:19----------
those because there's a part that's duty


---------20:21----------
and then there's a part that's like kind


---------20:22----------
of circumstance or environment and and


---------20:25----------
my sense of Dao is that like it's kind


---------20:27----------
of like a combination sort of my meets


---------20:28----------
karma so Carter bar is like


---------20:30----------
circumstances it's the principle of


---------20:32----------
cause and effect so it's like current so


---------20:34----------
you haven't thought about but then there


---------20:36----------
are influences in your life that you


---------20:38----------
don't control which is your karma so I


---------20:42----------
think that's how those are related


---------20:44----------
so when you say of nature of universal


---------20:46----------
pattern currents like that sounds like


---------20:48----------
oprich to me I don't know what that


---------20:49----------
means like I don't I'm not saying that


---------20:51----------
it's not a real thing it's just like


---------20:53----------
sometimes people toss around these like


---------20:55----------
grandiose terms like universal patterns


---------20:58----------
like I don't know what is that I don't


---------20:59----------
know what that means


---------21:00----------
so I use the Sun squits terminology


---------21:02----------
because I think it's a little bit more


---------21:03----------
precise I mean it could be related to


---------21:06----------
that but I just don't I'm not familiar


---------21:07----------
with that terminology so I don't know is


---------21:09----------
it connected to the flow State no so


---------21:13----------
flow state is a state of mind karma is


---------21:15----------
not a state of mind Dharma is about like


---------21:17----------
duty or responsibility or a guide for


---------21:19----------
action Hana is a compass a flow state is


---------21:22----------
a state of being and while Dharma


---------21:26----------
generally speaking allows you to


---------21:28----------
facilitate getting into a state of mind


---------21:30----------
they're like apples and oranges flow


---------21:32----------
state is a state of consciousness it's


---------21:34----------
like sleep wakefulness dreaming flow


---------21:38----------
State right that's the category Dharma


---------21:40----------
is not in that category


---------21:41----------
Dharma is about duty or responsibility


---------21:43----------
it's sort of like a concept flow say to


---------21:47----------
some


---------21:47----------
that happens in your brain and karma is


---------21:49----------
not something that happens in your brain


---------21:50----------
is it indicated by our emotions no


---------21:53----------
Dharma Dharma is what allows you to


---------21:56----------
tolerate negative emotions but emotions


---------21:59----------
are also a product of the mind or the


---------22:01----------
body they're not like Dharma sort of an


---------22:03----------
abstract concept so these are good


---------22:05----------
questions because I don't think we think


---------22:07----------
about like what stuff is in my mind and


---------22:11----------
what stuff is my life and what stuff is


---------22:13----------
outside of my mind what are my emotions


---------22:15----------
what are my thoughts all of this stuff


---------22:17----------
has to be understood like you have to


---------22:18----------
understand like how this person that you


---------22:20----------
are works you have thoughts you have


---------22:23----------
emotions you have flow States you have


---------22:25----------
states of consciousness you have states


---------22:26----------
of beings you have goals what's the


---------22:28----------
relationship between all of this stuff


---------22:30----------
how can we understand how emotions


---------22:32----------
relate to motivation how can we


---------22:34----------
understand how states of mind relate to


---------22:36----------
motivation how can we understand how the


---------22:37----------
anima relates to motivation how can we


---------22:39----------
understand how karma relates to


---------22:40----------
motivation that's the goal of this


---------22:42----------
stream is for us to unpack all of these


---------22:46----------
different things because we don't get


---------22:47----------
taught this stuff it blows my [ __ ]


---------22:50----------
mind we get taught algebra but we don't


---------22:52----------
get taught what the relationship between


---------22:54----------
our mission and life a calling in life


---------22:57----------
our emotions and our mindset we don't


---------23:00----------
get taught that but I think that's


---------23:02----------
really like basic stuff that everyone


---------23:05----------
needs to understand what is the


---------23:07----------
relationship between a calling and your


---------23:09----------
emotions yeah because we don't get


---------23:12----------
taught this stuff infuriates me no


---------23:17----------
wonder no one knows what the [ __ ]


---------23:19----------
they're supposed to do in life like we


---------23:21----------
don't get taught how we work like we get


---------23:23----------
taught you can learn macroeconomics so


---------23:26----------
easily


---------23:27----------
you cannot go outside and learn a


---------23:30----------
definitive way in which your emotions


---------23:33----------
affect your Dharma in which your


---------23:36----------
emotions affect your behavior you you


---------23:38----------
can't they don't teach you that


---------23:41----------
interesting so they did social and


---------23:44----------
emotional skills training for students


---------23:46----------
that accounted for they took a study of


---------23:49----------
15,000 students half of them got we're


---------23:52----------
given a class called social emotional


---------23:55----------
skills training social emotional skills


---------23:58----------
training is worth 1.1 GPA points


---------24:01----------
more than a whole letter grade they


---------24:03----------
looked at the GPAs of these students who


---------24:05----------
are taught how like social and emotional


---------24:07----------
skills and they get one letter grade


---------24:10----------
higher than the people who are not


---------24:12----------
taught crazy-crazy
