---------00:00----------
hey Paul hey how are you let me just


---------00:03----------
actually see if can you guys hear Paul


---------00:05----------
is he quiet he sounds quite to me say


---------00:08----------
something Paul mm I shouldn't be hello


---------00:11----------
hey hey man hey welcome back thank you


---------00:17----------
yeah I wasn't sure if I there would be a


---------00:20----------
next time but there is a next time yeah


---------00:23----------
um yeah I I mean a lot of people don't


---------00:25----------
know if there's gonna be next time we


---------00:26----------
actually don't know I don't know if


---------00:27----------
there's gonna be a next time


---------00:29----------
no I kind of got the sense you don't


---------00:31----------
know who's coming on to like an hour


---------00:33----------
before yeah that's exactly how it works


---------00:36----------
yeah and there was there was some talk


---------00:38----------
about whether I should prepare for this


---------00:41----------
and I concluded I after thinking about


---------00:44----------
it I thought that preparing for it is


---------00:45----------
probably a bad idea


---------00:46----------
right have you been doing you know


---------00:55----------
things are mostly the same yeah I can


---------00:57----------
imagine I mean oh this is what that's


---------01:00----------
what you expected on well I mean because


---------01:02----------
like you know so I you know I think the


---------01:04----------
irony here is we were talking about you


---------01:06----------
you know starting to date again or


---------01:08----------
interacting with other people and things


---------01:10----------
like that you know and so I was just


---------01:12----------
kind of thinking about you know


---------01:14----------
irrespective of whether you were


---------01:15----------
transformed and had become a new person


---------01:17----------
it's like basically impossible for you


---------01:19----------
to have a girlfriend today not because


---------01:20----------
you haven't been transformed but because


---------01:22----------
of the coronavirus and probably


---------01:24----------
everything is like here in the UK things


---------01:26----------
have been pretty active there but I


---------01:28----------
don't think that that's really been the


---------01:31----------
main reason I haven't got a girlfriend


---------01:33----------
I'm perfectly honest it might certainly


---------01:36----------
slow things down


---------01:38----------
maybe but I don't think I was on that


---------01:41----------
like fast track anyway but I don't think


---------01:45----------
you were either I think it's an


---------01:46----------
unreasonable expectation yeah yeah so


---------01:51----------
tell me about tell me about last time we


---------01:54----------
talked like what how was that for you


---------01:56----------
[Music]


---------02:00----------
I did I did reflecting right so good you


---------02:05----------
know it's definitely there's definitely


---------02:06----------
advantages to the fact that it's


---------02:07----------
recorded because I was you can watch it


---------02:08----------
as much as you want I don't I think I


---------02:10----------
did that more than like once maybe twice


---------02:12----------
probably once and then like with busy


---------02:14----------
clips thrown in there but um one thing


---------02:19----------
that occurred to me is that I was a bad


---------02:20----------
patient the last time why so let me


---------02:25----------
explain this a little bit so I honestly


---------02:27----------
coming on a second time my anxiety about


---------02:29----------
it is not anywhere near as bad as it was


---------02:31----------
the first time the last time I had a


---------02:33----------
double anxiety I had the anxiety about


---------02:36----------
coming on and publicly exposing my four


---------02:38----------
balls and potentially saying something I


---------02:40----------
guess I still have that to a lesser


---------02:43----------
degree because I mean I could say


---------02:44----------
something and I might forever regret who


---------02:46----------
knows hopefully not so that's well


---------02:49----------
lesser degree and then the thing that I


---------02:51----------
still have this time as well is like the


---------02:53----------
anxiety of getting the most out of our


---------02:56----------
limited time together because the first


---------03:00----------
time I came on I I didn't know there'd


---------03:01----------
be a second time and this is the second


---------03:03----------
time I'm coming out I don't know there's


---------03:04----------
gonna be a third time so it there's a


---------03:08----------
huge anxiety about like wanting to make


---------03:10----------
the most of every moment right because


---------03:12----------
you don't know how many of these moments


---------03:14----------
you're gonna get and it feels like very


---------03:15----------
precious time and that was part of what


---------03:18----------
[ __ ] me up so much last time coz and


---------03:20----------
someone in twitch chat actually said it


---------03:22----------
someone someone was really switched on


---------03:23----------
he said this didn't go the way this got


---------03:25----------
that that guy expected it to at all and


---------03:27----------
he's absolutely right


---------03:29----------
so part of that anxiety manifests itself


---------03:31----------
in me having like a bunch of


---------03:33----------
conversations with you before I ever met


---------03:34----------
you which is incredibly


---------03:37----------
counterproductive but it's sort of just


---------03:39----------
a product of the anxiety like I can't I


---------03:40----------
can't stop it it just hurts so in what


---------03:44----------
I'm trying to say is in my effort to try


---------03:46----------
and keep things on track I actually


---------03:47----------
ended up doing the opposite because I


---------03:49----------
didn't know what the right track even


---------03:50----------
looks like you did but I didn't and I


---------03:53----------
was trying to keep us on track and in so


---------03:55----------
doing was [ __ ] it all up so I just


---------03:57----------
hope that this time I can be a better


---------03:58----------
like patient what makes you think I have


---------04:03----------
any idea what track were supposed to go


---------04:05----------
on and what if you done then we're both


---------04:08----------
lost together yeah no but if your claim


---------04:12----------
is that you can


---------04:13----------
fix me then where am I going with that


---------04:17----------
well it was it figs I guess I was just


---------04:20----------
to help me I guess it wasn't a fix


---------04:21----------
necessarily but then then but


---------04:24----------
let's say your claim is that you can


---------04:27----------
help me I would think that you would


---------04:29----------
then house my claim isn't even that I


---------04:30----------
can't help you


---------04:33----------
wasn't it not I thought it was my claim


---------04:38----------
was that that I I think I can help you


---------04:40----------
ok the claim is also that I'm gonna try


---------04:43----------
to help you but there's a big difference


---------04:45----------
between I think I can do something I can


---------04:47----------
do something and I'm gonna try to do


---------04:49----------
something and I can do something alright


---------04:51----------
I guess the Devils in the details in no


---------04:54----------
it's it's it I mean that's not the devil


---------04:56----------
that's the essence of it right so like


---------04:58----------
there's a big difference between having


---------05:03----------
an expectation of what I'm capable of


---------05:05----------
and trying like there's a big difference


---------05:08----------
between trying and having an expectation


---------05:12----------
all right so just so that I'm clear I


---------05:15----------
think you did fine last time for that


---------05:17----------
what it's worth yeah well divided


---------05:21----------
opinion on that one I guess but in any


---------05:24----------
case I'm still gonna try to do better


---------05:25----------
this time by not trying to like


---------05:28----------
oversteer things okay I mean you


---------05:34----------
expressed frustration in in being in a


---------05:36----------
loop last time or something sure though


---------05:37----------
is it okay for me to be frustrated Carly


---------05:43----------
with the philosophical question it's not


---------05:44----------
a philosophical question I'm not asking


---------05:48----------
you frustrated intuitively you imagine


---------05:51----------
the frustration as a negative thing an


---------05:52----------
exact one that's how ask me because I


---------05:56----------
don't want to just start with our


---------05:57----------
intuitive conclusions I want us to


---------05:59----------
understand whether we want to accept


---------06:02----------
what our intuition tells us beautifully


---------06:04----------
point at all I would like us to have a


---------06:06----------
wonderful time together without the


---------06:08----------
frustration okay


---------06:11----------
that's not what I'm looking for here


---------06:13----------
okay so I don't think that I'm I do this


---------06:16----------
to have a wonderful time if I wanted to


---------06:18----------
have a wonderful time I'd make myself a


---------06:19----------
cup of tea and I'd play Jedi Knight or


---------06:22----------
Jedi fallen order that's what I do what


---------06:24----------
I want to have a wonderful time where


---------06:26----------
I'd take a bath


---------06:27----------
some eucalyptus and something else AB


---------06:30----------
some salts that I purchased at the


---------06:32----------
grocery store today and I would just


---------06:34----------
chill


---------06:35----------
so amendable time to figure it out yeah


---------06:38----------
absolutely


---------06:40----------
and so let's just think a little bit is


---------06:42----------
it okay for me to get frustrated in a


---------06:44----------
conversation with you since you're


---------06:48----------
asking me I guess it is you know the


---------06:51----------
average person doesn't doesn't even ask


---------06:52----------
that I I just assumed that if they're


---------06:54----------
frustrated and I tend to be an Imagine


---------06:55----------
I'm probably right most the time that if


---------06:58----------
someone is frustrated while talking to


---------06:59----------
me I've done a bad job of conversing


---------07:01----------
with that person or at least you know


---------07:03----------
especially if I didn't defuse it or


---------07:06----------
especially if I continue to exacerbate


---------07:08----------
it I don't know III I envy the


---------07:11----------
conversations you have with like some of


---------07:13----------
the other guests that have been on where


---------07:14----------
you tell them how much you enjoy the


---------07:15----------
conversation and I didn't get that from


---------07:17----------
you I got from you was that you were


---------07:18----------
frustrated with me at one point and that


---------07:19----------
feels bad that feels like I didn't do as


---------07:22----------
well as they did or something okay good


---------07:25----------
so let's let's understand this okay so I


---------07:28----------
mean I wish I had another screen so I


---------07:30----------
could ask to a chat some questions right


---------07:31----------
so twitch at you guys see what we're


---------07:33----------
running across right this is Paul st.


---------07:35----------
Paul we met last week right so Paul is


---------07:38----------
self judgmental Paul compares himself to


---------07:41----------
others so like let's just pay attention


---------07:42----------
to that okay let's also talk a little


---------07:45----------
bit about frustration because I think


---------07:47----------
actually this is this is fantastic man


---------07:48----------
so I think that um Paul it is part of


---------07:54----------
what I think is holding you back is your


---------07:57----------
desire to create and control the


---------08:01----------
responses of people around you okay


---------08:09----------
right so you looked at our laughs and by


---------08:12----------
the way I loved our conversation last


---------08:14----------
time okay I think I think our


---------08:18----------
conversation last time was I frustrated


---------08:20----------
for chunks of it absolutely but let's


---------08:24----------
just we're gonna talk a little bit about


---------08:26----------
what it means to be frustrated and and


---------08:28----------
why I think that that's perfectly


---------08:29----------
acceptable and in fact and we're gonna


---------08:33----------
talk so let me just make a note about


---------08:34----------
that okay we're going to talk about


---------08:35----------
frustration but I just want to point out


---------08:38----------
to you that I think that you said that


---------08:41----------
you


---------08:41----------
a thousand conversations in your head


---------08:43----------
with me before so that gets me Paul what


---------08:50----------
we're in those conversations what were


---------08:51----------
we wearing were we in your living room


---------08:59----------
or the locality this sort of nebulous I


---------09:05----------
don't exactly recall I'm trolling you


---------09:08----------
man so but I think so we should talk


---------09:12----------
about frustration but I just want to


---------09:13----------
point out to you that already as you


---------09:15----------
enter this conversation you have this


---------09:17----------
idea that you want me to react a certain


---------09:20----------
way and you're looking for a certain


---------09:22----------
response no no no no I wouldn't ever go


---------09:26----------
that far okay I guess I just had some


---------09:29----------
presuppositions about the kinds of


---------09:31----------
things we would talk about or need to


---------09:33----------
talk about in order to figure out how do


---------09:41----------
i well I guess I'm honestly fixed me


---------09:44----------
again I like that term


---------09:45----------
sure okay so what do we talk about


---------09:48----------
probably wrong I don't know but you said


---------09:51----------
you had some preset positions oh well


---------09:53----------
yeah but actually so actually that was


---------09:55----------
quite a if we don't have to talk about


---------09:58----------
that sort of thing I'd rather not


---------09:59----------
because some of those things are quite


---------10:00----------
actually quite difficult to talk about


---------10:02----------
so it seemed like we didn't really need


---------10:04----------
to the last time was actually quite


---------10:06----------
light despite the fact that I ended up


---------10:08----------
doing a joke or impression towards the


---------10:10----------
end of it the majority of the discussion


---------10:14----------
was quite light and easy yeah so what


---------10:16----------
makes okay so now I'm a little bit well


---------10:21----------
you can I just think for a second yeah


---------10:26----------
now you have me curious about the things


---------10:30----------
that are difficult to talk about well


---------10:33----------
maybe I should never have mentioned and


---------10:35----------
I'm also wondering a little I mean so


---------10:38----------
this is so when let me just figure out


---------10:43----------
how to say this and make sense


---------10:46----------
so frustration and difficulty is part of


---------10:51----------
the process of growth


---------10:52----------
and I think one of the biggest problem


---------10:54----------
that problems that people fall into is


---------10:57----------
that they try to avoid those things


---------11:00----------
right so like generally speaking human


---------11:02----------
beings try to avoid negative emotions


---------11:05----------
but it's my hypothesis and sincere


---------11:08----------
belief that like negative emotions are a


---------11:11----------
part of life and also a part of the


---------11:14----------
process of like growth and being like a


---------11:17----------
normal human being so just because you


---------11:21----------
were frustrating to me the last time we


---------11:22----------
talked doesn't mean that I wasn't happy


---------11:25----------
with the conversation like I get


---------11:27----------
frustrated with my kids all the time it


---------11:29----------
doesn't mean that I don't love them and


---------11:30----------
that I don't interact with them and that


---------11:32----------
I don't value our time together


---------11:33----------
I actually don't wish for a


---------11:36----------
frustration-free life with them as


---------11:39----------
bizarre as that sounds


---------11:40----------
because it's something strange like like


---------11:42----------
with my kids I find that the more


---------11:44----------
frustrated I get with them the more I


---------11:46----------
love them after they fall asleep it's


---------11:51----------
kind of a weird sensation but I think


---------11:52----------
that there's like you know there's


---------11:53----------
there's light and there's darkness and


---------11:55----------
there's like you know there are two


---------11:57----------
sides of a coin it is completely fine I


---------11:59----------
mean the people who I know who live


---------12:02----------
lives that are relatively pain free are


---------12:04----------
not the happiest people I know so I


---------12:13----------
think it's perfectly fine for me to get


---------12:15----------
frustrated I think the question is did


---------12:17----------
we accomplish what we set out to do and


---------12:19----------
if frustration is part of the price we


---------12:22----------
pay so be it okay well yeah so I mean we


---------12:25----------
got the actually done if you can see


---------12:29----------
this but I I put a pearl on my wall can


---------12:33----------
you see that what does it say oh they


---------12:35----------
gonna get it the pearl


---------12:42----------
what's which pearl so did we did we set


---------12:46----------
out to become what we set out to do well


---------12:49----------
I got I got the pearl to put on my wall


---------12:52----------
right mm-hmm


---------12:53----------
you can you read that now yeah I have a


---------12:55----------
very protective hopelessness absolutely


---------12:57----------
there it is there it is so we got that


---------13:00----------
out of it yeah


---------13:03----------
right and then there was also the you


---------13:06----------
know the catharsis or whatever at the


---------13:08----------
end which I still don't understand what


---------13:09----------
what that was you are giving me both so


---------13:15----------
I guess where we left up where we left


---------13:17----------
it is you told me to notice it and


---------13:19----------
awareness precedes control so you know


---------13:22----------
I'm sort of trying to keep in mind that


---------13:23----------
that have this protective hopelessness


---------13:26----------
as you call it and actually try to


---------13:28----------
notice it so that I'm you know so I went


---------13:30----------
to the speed-dating that the following


---------13:32----------
week and I well even before that even so


---------13:36----------
even the day after we just when I went


---------13:39----------
to the market to get some bread like


---------13:42----------
some girl is serving me and I'm not


---------13:44----------
trying to date her or anything I'm not


---------13:45----------
trying anything at all but ordinarily I


---------13:48----------
would tend to approach it with a sort of


---------13:50----------
very sort of glum look but actually for


---------13:56----------
some reason I just thought of something


---------13:57----------
before I even opened my mouth and I


---------13:59----------
smiled at her instead and I don't know I


---------14:01----------
just feel like I mean she Tom so this


---------14:05----------
it's kind of stupid but I just feel like


---------14:07----------
maybe that made the interaction a little


---------14:08----------
better certainly then obviously I mean


---------14:12----------
she you know she gave me the option to


---------14:13----------
have like a half bread instead of buying


---------14:15----------
buying the whole one if I just which was


---------14:18----------
actually I took her up on that offer cuz


---------14:20----------
actually I'm a bachelor I don't need a


---------14:21----------
whole hyung get through the whole damn


---------14:23----------
thing so I save a bit of money I feel


---------14:25----------
like she might have not even given me


---------14:26----------
the up that option if you thought she


---------14:27----------
was dealing with someone like you know


---------14:29----------
who was withdrawn and already wanna have


---------14:32----------
a conversation about anything yeah so


---------14:34----------
who knows you know you can't rewind time


---------14:38----------
and try it again but I just feel like in


---------14:40----------
general and and but the way that the


---------14:42----------
weird thing about is like why do I do


---------14:44----------
that why did I what I definitely didn't


---------14:48----------
something came over me and that in that


---------14:50----------
moment but I think feel like it's kind


---------14:51----------
of one-off now though it was something


---------14:53----------
that was with me like right after our


---------14:55----------
conversation that's faded to them


---------14:57----------
probably because of the speed dating


---------14:58----------
though so I had the positivity for like


---------15:01----------
the next four or five days but then I


---------15:03----------
had the speed dating and what before we


---------15:08----------
get to the speed dating tell me about


---------15:09----------
the positivity we got to talk about


---------15:11----------
smiling by the way do you smile when you


---------15:13----------
talk to people


---------15:13----------
yeah no normally no yeah so you got to


---------15:16----------
start


---------15:18----------
smiley smiling his [ __ ] Opie


---------15:21----------
like smiling is like so when I was I


---------15:24----------
read this book by Dale Carnegie called


---------15:26----------
how to win friends and influence people


---------15:27----------
it's a fantastic book and one of the


---------15:30----------
rules that he says is smile and so I


---------15:34----------
actually practiced smiling and I know it


---------15:36----------
sounds kind of silly but then I found


---------15:38----------
that you know practicing smiling is


---------15:40----------
super awkward but what I could do is


---------15:43----------
like think about something that made me


---------15:45----------
happy and then I would just let myself


---------15:47----------
smile even though it felt a little bit


---------15:49----------
weird that's really what I practiced and


---------15:51----------
then it becomes a genuine smile and I


---------15:53----------
found that ever since I started smiling


---------15:55----------
I actually do get better everything


---------15:58----------
everywhere yeah I go that I go that


---------16:01----------
sense that it would be but the thing is


---------16:04----------
I mean intuitively makes sense to but


---------16:06----------
the thing is is getting the genuine


---------16:08----------
smile is the hard part


---------16:09----------
yeah because forcing it forcing it


---------16:11----------
doesn't really it's not really


---------16:13----------
maintainable right so let's practice see


---------16:21----------
there you go good job hoping I'll be


---------16:24----------
honest meeting the quality on this court


---------16:26----------
today is not the best like I can't make


---------16:28----------
out your mouth but your eyes are just


---------16:29----------
pixels for me I don't know if it's like


---------16:31----------
that on the street but maybe maybe it's


---------16:33----------
really oh really low quality interests


---------16:37----------
like almost like oh yeah that's like a


---------16:39----------
million times better okay there we go


---------16:41----------
see dr. K it's not a Boomer after all I


---------16:43----------
learned thanks I'm glad I mentioned it


---------16:45----------
cuz I thought it'd be awkward if I


---------16:46----------
brought it up but no you fixed in that


---------16:47----------
ah see so what were you doing you


---------16:50----------
thought it would be awkward if you


---------16:51----------
brought it up what were you trying to


---------16:53----------
avoid there well a couple of things one


---------16:55----------
of those wasting time on in technical


---------16:57----------
issues when we need to be getting on


---------16:58----------
with the fixing me part yeah let's just


---------17:00----------
stay focused no no but but see see this


---------17:03----------
is the thing there's there's you know we


---------17:05----------
don't need to stay focused because


---------17:06----------
you're avoidance of the awkwardness


---------17:08----------
would have worsened your experience over


---------17:12----------
the next hour it's actually doing it


---------17:14----------
again anyway now I don't know why it's


---------17:15----------
it's reverting so okay let's try again


---------17:18----------
you feel like this is a waste of time


---------17:20----------
right well unless you know unless it


---------17:23----------
improves for the long term yeah yes like


---------17:27----------
right now yeah I'm so right now it's


---------17:29----------
crystal clear and I have


---------17:30----------
okay so let's see what yeah if it does


---------17:33----------
what it did again degrades over the next


---------17:35----------
60 seconds okay then how do you feel is


---------17:38----------
it mine is it fine the other way that's


---------17:41----------
why I'm I can see you fine okay yeah


---------17:45----------
okay


---------17:46----------
so they saw something so yeah I think


---------17:49----------
you should smile so try smiling


---------17:53----------
don't you feel embarrassed


---------17:58----------
smile come on


---------17:59----------
let's see alright so think about


---------18:02----------
something that's something genuine


---------18:04----------
specify yeah like let's let's see if


---------18:07----------
like you guys I want you guys to pay


---------18:08----------
attention so like I want you to think


---------18:09----------
about something happy what's happy okay


---------18:17----------
then just look at my face ready your


---------18:25----------
face is a good face so I like your face


---------18:27----------
I like your face too man see that's all


---------18:33----------
it takes just just okay now close your


---------18:36----------
eyes close your eyes just think about my


---------18:40----------
[ __ ] face let's see there that's


---------18:46----------
think about how silly and crazy I am oh


---------18:52----------
those are good adjectives okay what can


---------18:57----------
you think of like you have a pet not


---------19:01----------
anymore


---------19:01----------
okay well that's the sad sad face see


---------19:05----------
there's a there you go


---------19:07----------
okay good so it's beautiful right so


---------19:11----------
those are real smiles now open your eyes


---------19:13----------
so you can play around with it I know it


---------19:16----------
sounds weird but but the the key to


---------19:18----------
making a genuine smile and by the way


---------19:20----------
human beings are very good at detecting


---------19:21----------
fake smiles and so this is like what's


---------19:24----------
really hard about when you tell people


---------19:25----------
to smile in interactions is they try to


---------19:28----------
they try to force themselves to smile


---------19:30----------
which becomes a vague smile and then the


---------19:32----------
feedback that you got from other people


---------19:34----------
is weird because they like look at your


---------19:35----------
weird-ass smile and it creeps them out


---------19:37----------
and then it makes you feel even more


---------19:39----------
awkward which in turn makes it harder


---------19:41----------
for you to smile and then you have to


---------19:42----------
force your smile more


---------19:43----------
and it creeps people out of them even


---------19:45----------
more so the the key to offering a


---------19:48----------
genuine smile is to like try to find


---------19:50----------
something that you find warm or positive


---------19:53----------
and think about that for a second and


---------19:55----------
let it bubble up and let it show in your


---------19:58----------
face and if you start smiling more of


---------20:00----------
people that are gonna start smiling at


---------20:01----------
you back and then you're you know


---------20:03----------
service will improve but you'll also


---------20:04----------
feel better about yourself because we


---------20:06----------
have these tiny little circuits in our


---------20:08----------
brain that when people smile at us we


---------20:10----------
feel better about ourselves because like


---------20:13----------
when I smile at you like an idiot ready


---------20:15----------
yeah no yeah yeah it works how do you


---------20:20----------
feel at this point is getting a bit


---------20:24----------
creepy


---------20:25----------
okay I don't know we like delay at the


---------20:27----------
point a little bit okay analyzing over


---------20:30----------
analyzing it's kind of the end of it all


---------20:32----------
right it works the first few times


---------20:33----------
though okay good how do you feel when


---------20:38----------
you laugh and smile a little bit what do


---------20:40----------
you notice about yourself anything it's


---------20:43----------
kind of hard really no okay okay maybe


---------20:47----------
we can we can shift off of smiling for a


---------20:50----------
second so tell me about the positivity


---------20:54----------
the positivity of you were saying that


---------20:57----------
the positivity lasts four or five days


---------20:58----------
what what do you mean by that how do we


---------21:00----------
understand what that what that is


---------21:02----------
oh it's optimism I guess I don't know


---------21:08----------
it's just it's just I've been searching


---------21:11----------
for like the answer for some years now


---------21:13----------
at least like at least a decade yeah and


---------21:16----------
you gave me something new to try so


---------21:18----------
that's optimism because most people I


---------21:20----------
asked about it you know friends want to


---------21:21----------
help you but friends can only help you


---------21:23----------
so much they can only you know help you


---------21:25----------
based on what they know and what their


---------21:26----------
experience is like and often that's not


---------21:28----------
as helpful as they wish it was yep and


---------21:31----------
but you gave me something genuinely new


---------21:33----------
to try you didn't really give me a lot


---------21:36----------
of direction it was just like catch the


---------21:38----------
hope I mean when you say catch normally


---------21:40----------
I cup my hands like this right but


---------21:42----------
that's not what the kind that's not what


---------21:43----------
you mean by cash yeah but I don't know


---------21:45----------
how to do what you're asking me to do


---------21:47----------
you didn't really give a lot of


---------21:48----------
direction on that we kind of wrapped up


---------21:50----------
right as you as you concluded yeah with


---------21:53----------
that though it's even though I'm


---------21:56----------
optimistic about it it's kind of hard to


---------21:57----------
run with it okay so let's see if we can


---------22:00----------
correct that deficiency from last time


---------22:02----------
so when I say catch the the optimism I


---------22:06----------
remember watching some martial arts


---------22:08----------
movie where a guy would catch a fly with


---------22:11----------
chopsticks so it's like a fly buzzing


---------22:14----------
around like he's like with his his ninja


---------22:16----------
speed he would catch it with chopsticks


---------22:18----------
that's kind of what I mean so what I


---------22:20----------
want you to do is notice within yourself


---------22:22----------
when the hopelessness arises and if I


---------22:26----------
catch it what I mean is there gonna be


---------22:27----------
times where you're going to interact


---------22:29----------
like let's take the case of smiling get


---------22:31----------
the person at the checkout counter when


---------22:33----------
you bought the bread you're gonna have a


---------22:36----------
thought that like oh let me try smiling


---------22:38----------
and then there's gonna be another part


---------22:40----------
of you that says no that's just dumb


---------22:41----------
it's not gonna do anything you know what


---------22:43----------
I'm talking about


---------22:44----------
well I never thought about smiling it


---------22:46----------
just happened


---------22:47----------
I don't really know why okay no but


---------22:51----------
don't get me right off like oh I should


---------22:53----------
smile here I wasn't trying to do I just


---------22:55----------
caught that I just thought about how


---------22:57----------
hopeless something is I don't know so so


---------23:03----------
I I know I didn't even think about it


---------23:05----------
made me smile yes so I don't know what


---------23:07----------
you did but you did it you did what I


---------23:10----------
asked you to do and it's a little bit


---------23:12----------
different for every person well twist


---------23:14----------
not exactly because actually you ask me


---------23:17----------
more literally you ask me to laugh


---------23:19----------
alright I never got quite that far like


---------23:21----------
smiling is about as far as I go okay


---------23:23----------
fine I know that I necessarily know that


---------23:25----------
I would necessarily want to be walking


---------23:27----------
around laughing people why not maybe


---------23:32----------
come on don't ask me such rhetorical


---------23:34----------
questions what it's not rhetorical


---------23:38----------
because you okay come on because you'd


---------23:41----------
look insane wouldn't you so what's the


---------23:46----------
damn is not not insane


---------23:48----------
well presumably that's the adverse


---------23:49----------
effect you want people to receive you


---------23:51----------
well not like as a crazy person


---------23:53----------
whoa see there and I think lies the crux


---------23:56----------
of your problem you want people to


---------23:58----------
receive you a particular way


---------24:05----------
well so I think it's very common but


---------24:09----------
like so this goes back to like you were


---------24:10----------
you were a little bit upset I don't know


---------24:12----------
what word to use that you felt like you


---------24:16----------
frustrated me because I did get


---------24:18----------
frustrated and you wanted me to not be


---------24:21----------
frustrated right you wanted me to say


---------24:23----------
Paul I've really enjoyed this


---------24:24----------
conversation but instead I said Paul


---------24:27----------
this conversation has been frustrating


---------24:28----------
so in your mind you are trying to


---------24:31----------
control my reaction well not even that


---------24:35----------
it was even worse because it's not like


---------24:36----------
you concluded with that it's just you


---------24:38----------
were so frustrated that you just said


---------24:39----------
that you were frustrated it's it's like


---------24:40----------
it's even worse


---------24:42----------
but what's bad about me being frustrated


---------24:45----------
yeah okay no no so we sort of talked


---------24:49----------
about it but let's let's just play the


---------24:50----------
tape through to the end right so this is


---------24:52----------
exactly what we need to do I think your


---------24:53----------
problem Paul is that you have some


---------24:55----------
beliefs that you think are common-sense


---------24:57----------
or rhetorical which actually need to be


---------24:59----------
challenged because if you challenge


---------25:02----------
because that's the default programming


---------25:03----------
you have in your mind so what's wrong


---------25:06----------
with frustrating me well that what's


---------25:14----------
wrong with it is you might end up having


---------25:15----------
more sympathy for cbt guy than for me by


---------25:17----------
the end of it it did that happen no yeah


---------25:23----------
but who knows by the end of this session


---------25:26----------
right so so your fear of frustration is


---------25:29----------
that I will like us yeah look at my face


---------25:34----------
for a minute do I dislike you Paul this


---------25:40----------
moment in time I would think not okay do


---------25:44----------
you think I mean but why not you


---------25:47----------
frustrated me last time yeah so


---------25:53----------
obviously it's not excessive for you but


---------25:58----------
if I'm on the wrong path and I keep


---------26:01----------
doing the same miss making the same


---------26:03----------
mistake then I know then what is gonna


---------26:05----------
happen what do you think is gonna happen


---------26:09----------
and she'll not want to know me we're


---------26:13----------
okay where do you get that idea


---------26:16----------
I mean and and I mean this is just in


---------26:18----------
general but it's just like with people


---------26:20----------
in general and on someone away from


---------26:22----------
through your behavior I think I Drive


---------26:26----------
most people away through my behavior do


---------26:28----------
you remember like a particular a


---------26:30----------
particular time where no sort of really


---------26:33----------
really like like so we touched on this


---------26:35----------
briefly like last time like I told you


---------26:37----------
like I had a rough start in my


---------26:38----------
professional career I lost so I never


---------26:42----------
worked anywhere for like a whole year I


---------26:45----------
could I could maybe hold down a few


---------26:47----------
months at a time and then people would


---------26:49----------
just get sick of me and I would I'd be


---------26:52----------
like go what why would they get sick of


---------26:55----------
you just because they thought I had very


---------26:59----------
poor social skills is what how they


---------27:02----------
would term it they didn't usually get


---------27:04----------
very specific in ways that would


---------27:06----------
actually be genuinely useful to me as a


---------27:08----------
self development tool but that's the


---------27:10----------
gist of it and that's all I got was the


---------27:12----------
gist of it hmm so it sounds like you had


---------27:15----------
good reason to believe that your actions


---------27:19----------
and your words and your mannerisms will


---------27:21----------
drive people away yeah the only reason


---------27:24----------
that I can string more than a few months


---------27:26----------
together now is because I really tried


---------27:28----------
harder to do better at that and all must


---------27:33----------
be working yeah oh yeah I'm cognizant of


---------27:36----------
it so a lot as you guideline so I think


---------27:40----------
that you know Paul I think you have been


---------27:42----------
working at it and I think the


---------27:43----------
unfortunate thing is that people don't


---------27:45----------
teach us social skills so I've been like


---------27:49----------
I've been sort of tossing around so I've


---------27:51----------
been writing a couple of books and I was


---------27:53----------
thinking about I had this crazy idea and


---------27:55----------
started jotting some notes that I want


---------27:57----------
to write a small manual about


---------27:59----------
conversation and just how to talk to


---------28:02----------
other people you know I get a lot of


---------28:05----------
people call it common sense but a common


---------28:07----------
sense is not always know it's not common


---------28:09----------
sense right so I think no one actually


---------28:12----------
teaches us I mean I don't think it's


---------28:14----------
common sense at all


---------28:15----------
so the way that I talk to people is


---------28:17----------
actually unlearning


---------28:18----------
common sense so I think being good at


---------28:21----------
conversation is not actually doing what


---------28:24----------
most people do conversation is a skill


---------28:26----------
that you can learn and you can practice


---------28:28----------
social skills can be


---------28:30----------
and practiced and leveled up and it


---------28:31----------
sounds like you've been a little bit


---------28:32----------
more thoughtful about your social


---------28:35----------
interactions and you're noticing a


---------28:36----------
difference yeah and and yeah yeah and


---------28:40----------
despite that I still do worse than the


---------28:41----------
average person at it but yeah yeah we


---------28:43----------
can progress


---------28:45----------
so let me ask you this award there


---------28:47----------
people before you started working that


---------28:49----------
you kind of drove away through your


---------28:51----------
behavior


---------29:01----------
yeah I guess so


---------29:03----------
Mike ooh that's a tough one


---------29:10----------
like I guess even my friends to be


---------29:12----------
honest like I can you sure do you mind


---------29:15----------
sharing that with us yeah there's not


---------29:18----------
much to say about it like so in high


---------29:22----------
school I had friends but but after high


---------29:27----------
school was over we all went our separate


---------29:30----------
ways wouldn't really keep in touch so


---------29:31----------
it's kind of like kind of it's kind of


---------29:32----------
like the same in work you know you're


---------29:35----------
all colleagues but the and they'll


---------29:37----------
celebrate your arrival and they'll


---------29:39----------
celebrate your leaving but as soon as


---------29:41----------
you leave you won't hear from them mo


---------29:42----------
and again it's all just it's all just


---------29:47----------
it's almost like it's just fake you know


---------29:49----------
yeah I mean it's it it's fine well it's


---------29:53----------
what is convenient while you're just you


---------29:55----------
put in the same vicinity as each other


---------29:57----------
but it's not very real sounds like they


---------30:01----------
don't really care about you as a human


---------30:02----------
being they care about you as like the


---------30:05----------
mantle worker right yeah yeah at work


---------30:08----------
for sure but there's a big difference


---------30:10----------
though between like so I do think that


---------30:12----------
the high school friends I had were


---------30:14----------
fairly all though I don't know why that


---------30:17----------
is because obviously the end effect is


---------30:18----------
the same it's like well as soon as we're


---------30:19----------
no longer together I think they're their


---------30:23----------
differences right so in high school we


---------30:26----------
don't no one teaches us how to stay in


---------30:28----------
touch with people that we care about


---------30:30----------
while we're in high school that too is a


---------30:33----------
skill that's learned how to stay in


---------30:35----------
touch with someone that you care about


---------30:37----------
were you were you attracted to any girls


---------30:41----------
or anything like that


---------30:42----------
oh the world that weren't any so in the


---------30:47----------
area that in the area that in the area


---------30:49----------
that I grew up we have comprehensive and


---------30:54----------
grammar schools and all that means it's


---------30:56----------
like they easy to get into schools in


---------30:59----------
the heart to get in schools like so so


---------31:00----------
the grammar schools you usually have to


---------31:02----------
like pass it a bunch of extra tests and


---------31:05----------
stuff to get into and they're generally


---------31:06----------
regarded as like the better place to be


---------31:08----------
if you're like above if you're


---------31:11----------
intelligent I guess but


---------31:13----------
also single-sex schools mmm because I


---------31:15----------
guess the thinking is that you know you


---------31:18----------
can focus better on your work if you're


---------31:19----------
not distracted by the opposite sex so


---------31:22----------
it's the same for the so there was an


---------31:24----------
old guy school as an all-girls school


---------31:25----------
and their grammar schools and that miles


---------31:27----------
apart and I sometimes wonder I sometimes


---------31:33----------
wonder if that's something I should


---------31:34----------
regret because my sister didn't go to


---------31:37----------
the grammar schools my sister went to


---------31:38----------
the to the comprehensive and she grew up


---------31:40----------
with guys and girls like normal and


---------31:42----------
she's she's doing it well she's got to


---------31:48----------
she's got a second kid and she's two


---------31:50----------
years younger than me she's on a normal


---------31:52----------
track right he says she's not an insult


---------31:54----------
so you feel bad


---------31:57----------
oh that's things I mean that's exactly


---------32:03----------
it


---------32:03----------
I feel like it's a weird really weird


---------32:08----------
place it's like it's almost like I would


---------32:10----------
I regret not being able to just do it


---------32:15----------
all again or or you just like I almost


---------32:18----------
feel like I want to start from that


---------32:19----------
point like from the high school point


---------32:20----------
which is which is which is very a very


---------32:23----------
dangerous thing to say when you're 35


---------32:25----------
years old but but but you know I I don't


---------32:30----------
exactly mean it that way it's just that


---------32:33----------
when I get I regret I regret that you


---------32:35----------
can't make up for lost time like that's


---------32:37----------
not something you can do because so


---------32:39----------
everyone in everyone in my age range now


---------32:41----------
like if you're looking at people I


---------32:44----------
actually can date girls are like in


---------32:46----------
their 30s are looking to settle down


---------32:48----------
they're not looking for like someone


---------32:50----------
who's got no experience that's that's a


---------32:52----------
turn-off for them they don't it's not


---------32:54----------
how do you know that how do I know it


---------33:06----------
I guess I just picked up I don't know


---------33:09----------
exactly I guess I'm I just picked it up


---------33:11----------
from here and there so so I'm gonna say


---------33:16----------
something that is gonna be you know


---------33:18----------
could be hurtful it's not intended to be


---------33:20----------
hurtful but it is intended to be


---------33:21----------
challenging you know if you haven't


---------33:24----------
really dated much how do you know what


---------33:26----------
girls want I mean does anyone know what


---------33:33----------
girls wanna know that's that's what I've


---------33:35----------
been trying to figure out for a long


---------33:36----------
time well all I know is that it is


---------33:39----------
whatever it is it's not me that - how do


---------33:44----------
you know that


---------33:45----------
well that's evident how no one wants me


---------33:52----------
it's really evident with I feel like I


---------33:56----------
have been over a bunch of things already


---------33:59----------
like I did like a dozen speed-dating


---------34:00----------
things that did a bunch of talking about


---------34:05----------
hanging out in bars and going clubbing


---------34:06----------
and doing this and that yeah so so so I


---------34:11----------
don't know Paul they ever actually meet


---------34:13----------
you


---------34:14----------
I think they meet the person that you


---------34:17----------
think you should be I think I think I


---------34:21----------
think they meet the person that you


---------34:23----------
think that they're looking for and I


---------34:28----------
think I don't I don't know what they're


---------34:29----------
looking for though but sure you do you


---------34:31----------
just said you just told us what they're


---------34:33----------
looking for right so you have an idea of


---------34:35----------
what they're looking for and I think you


---------34:37----------
try to be that person and I think what


---------34:40----------
they're seeing is essentially fake smile


---------34:41----------
Paul instead of real smile Paul and they


---------34:45----------
find that creepy which I I mean great


---------34:51----------
fake smile Paul creeps me out even when


---------34:53----------
I smile excessively at you it creeps you


---------34:56----------
out I think this goes back to what I was


---------34:59----------
saying earlier about like you try to


---------35:02----------
avoid so much to like evoke any kind of


---------35:05----------
negative emotion and another human being


---------35:07----------
that you're like that's not you can't be


---------35:09----------
relaxed and authentic like if you walk


---------35:13----------
into this conversation you're like oh I


---------35:14----------
can't frustrate dr. K because I want him


---------35:16----------
to like me I understand why you feel


---------35:19----------
that way


---------35:20----------
and you can't make me like you and even


---------35:26----------
if you frustrate me like that's not


---------35:27----------
gonna stop me from liking you what's


---------35:31----------
gonna stop me from liking you is if you


---------35:33----------
become if you stop giving a [ __ ] and


---------35:35----------
stop trying like you can piss me off


---------35:36----------
that's okay you can make me sad you can


---------35:39----------
make me disappoint it you can you can


---------35:41----------
even make me angry with you and all of


---------35:45----------
those things I know this sounds


---------35:46----------
absolutely crazy but like just think


---------35:49----------
about this for a second like who do you


---------35:50----------
think are the people that you get the


---------35:52----------
most angry with in life who do you think


---------35:54----------
I get the most angry with in life like


---------35:58----------
you have this assumption that if people


---------36:02----------
get angry with you they're no longer


---------36:04----------
going to like you right I think you


---------36:08----------
diminish your chances yeah yeah so who


---------36:11----------
do you think I get the most angry with


---------36:13----------
in life if I had to guess I'd probably


---------36:19----------
say the people here around the most like


---------36:21----------
maybe your kids or your wife I'm


---------36:22----------
absolutely absolutely correct


---------36:25----------
the people who pissed me off to no end


---------36:27----------
are number one my wife top of the list


---------36:30----------
number two arguably higher than my wife


---------36:33----------
is my younger child older child has just


---------36:37----------
really really awesome


---------36:39----------
like sweet little child is really sweet


---------36:41----------
too she's just super hard-headed and is


---------36:43----------
defiant and doesn't accept that I am the


---------36:46----------
parent and she is the child and it


---------36:47----------
pisses me off to know it but if I guess


---------36:50----------
on my part though because I don't have


---------36:52----------
any experience of yes very good you


---------36:55----------
don't have any experience about what


---------36:57----------
people want what people don't want my


---------36:58----------
point is that if you actually look at


---------37:01----------
relationships and you think about you


---------37:02----------
ask a hundred people who pisses you off


---------37:04----------
the most I don't know what they're gonna


---------37:06----------
say but if you actually observe who they


---------37:08----------
express their anger to it's usually a


---------37:11----------
people that are closest to that


---------37:14----------
sometimes it's kind of sad because we


---------37:16----------
give the worst versions of ourselves to


---------37:18----------
the people that were closest to and we


---------37:20----------
give the best versions of ourselves to


---------37:22----------
strangers right you're going to be the


---------37:24----------
most polite to the the person at the


---------37:26----------
checkout counter whereas you'll be you


---------37:29----------
know more demanding of like people that


---------37:32----------
you live with


---------37:33----------
which is weird like shouldn't it be the


---------37:34----------
opposite but it's not so I think you've


---------37:39----------
really got to take a step back and think


---------37:41----------
a little bit about you know I think fake


---------37:44----------
smile and real smile is really a good


---------37:46----------
analogy of the way that you try it so I


---------37:49----------
the way that you interact with other


---------37:52----------
people seems to me to be based on an


---------37:55----------
impression that you have of what they


---------37:57----------
want and I think the way to find a good


---------38:02----------
partner in life is to be you and let


---------38:05----------
them pick like it's not you picking them


---------38:09----------
it's them picking you but like be


---------38:10----------
authentic about who you are I don't know


---------38:14----------
if that's true it may be if you're


---------38:17----------
trying to if you're trying to convince


---------38:18----------
me of that on a subconscious level then


---------38:19----------
I would probably find it hard to deny


---------38:21----------
but if you think I go around trying to


---------38:22----------
be a model of someone I have in my head


---------38:25----------
that's definitely case I don't think it


---------38:28----------
is quite as conscious as that but I do


---------38:30----------
think that you are very normal you are


---------38:32----------
very very concerned about the opinions


---------38:34----------
of others in your interactions you know


---------38:36----------
that's that's correct yeah and the more


---------38:38----------
concerned you are about the opinions of


---------38:40----------
others the less authentic you become


---------38:42----------
though by also be treated yeah so I and


---------38:47----------
I think this comes from this core belief


---------38:48----------
that you have that you are not likeable


---------38:51----------
by others right so like this comes back


---------38:54----------
to this decentralize you know well not


---------38:56----------
not without putting a lot of effort into


---------38:57----------
yeah yeah okay and the thing is I don't


---------39:03----------
I don't disagree that you have evidence


---------39:05----------
to support that view I think you do have


---------39:09----------
evidence to support that view I don't


---------39:10----------
think you're a dumb guy I think you're a


---------39:11----------
smart guy so I think your conclusions


---------39:13----------
that you come to have a lot of evidence


---------39:15----------
behind them and I'm telling you to run a


---------39:18----------
different experiment right I'm telling


---------39:21----------
you that whatever you did that day at


---------39:23----------
the checkout counter where you were able


---------39:24----------
to smile at someone and somehow that was


---------39:26----------
related to hopelessness you don't really


---------39:28----------
know how it works but that you decided


---------39:31----------
to just in that moment be a slightly


---------39:33----------
different person and the world received


---------39:35----------
you in a slightly different way yeah


---------39:43----------
well what's the experiment we're running


---------39:45----------
though I think I think you should try to


---------39:48----------
be you if if I'm honest has never really


---------39:54----------
been a moment it and we prior to this


---------39:56----------
where I thought I wasn't being me okay


---------39:59----------
excellent observation right so now the


---------40:04----------
case is quite a revelation so so now


---------40:07----------
yeah I mean that's why I think you're


---------40:08----------
stuck so now we want you to just so now


---------40:11----------
we come to a little bit of observation


---------40:13----------
we can talk about a couple of other


---------40:14----------
things okay so like I've got to ask you


---------40:16----------
so I don't know if this is I've got to


---------40:20----------
ask you Paul and also we should you know


---------40:23----------
ask twitch chat to like if you want to


---------40:26----------
have another kind of cathartic moment we


---------40:28----------
this is not the direction to go do you


---------40:32----------
want one of those I don't know what's up


---------40:35----------
in the script this time do we have to


---------40:36----------
climax with nope I mean I don't know how


---------40:40----------
to I don't know I don't know how to


---------40:42----------
bring those on but I'm guessing that the


---------40:44----------
more cerebral things are people don't


---------40:46----------
get to that but if you want to talk


---------40:48----------
about practicalities we can talk about


---------40:50----------
that but it's gonna be dry and it's


---------40:52----------
gonna be less entertaining and it's


---------40:54----------
gonna be more helpful so the real


---------40:56----------
challenge about twitch streaming is that


---------40:58----------
there are things that are helpful and


---------40:59----------
there are things that are entertaining


---------41:00----------
and there's some that are both and


---------41:02----------
there's some that are neither so if you


---------41:07----------
want to talk about you know the function


---------41:08----------
of your mind which is what I really


---------41:10----------
think would be helpful and then we can


---------41:12----------
do that if you want to explore like your


---------41:13----------
difficulties and stuff like that if you


---------41:15----------
want to attack those core beliefs and


---------41:17----------
try to dismantle them that's gonna be a


---------41:19----------
little bit more emotionally of a roller


---------41:20----------
coaster so we can attack your core


---------41:23----------
beliefs about like you know how you view


---------41:25----------
yourself or what we can do is give you


---------41:28----------
like we don't have to do one or the


---------41:30----------
other it's just which one we're gonna


---------41:31----------
focus on we can talk to you about how to


---------41:32----------
be more of yourself I love both to be


---------41:38----------
honest but you said you have an opinion


---------41:40----------
on which won't be more helpful which is


---------41:41----------
the first so let's do that


---------41:43----------
okay so are you your mind


---------41:57----------
I want I want to say yes even though I


---------41:59----------
presume you're coming at it from a


---------42:01----------
perspective of no okay so say what you


---------42:03----------
believe don't don't give me the right


---------42:05----------
answer give me your answer right answer


---------42:07----------
doesn't help anyone give me your answer


---------42:09----------
yeah yeah I am my mind yeah okay so like


---------42:14----------
let me ask you something um let me just


---------42:20----------
think about this for a second so if


---------42:27----------
someone has so so if someone is kind of


---------42:29----------
relaxed and enjoying themselves at a


---------42:31----------
party and if another person is super


---------42:33----------
socially anxious and thinking and


---------42:36----------
worrying and thinking lots of thoughts


---------42:38----------
about what other people think which one


---------42:40----------
of them do you think both of them are


---------42:44----------
equally themselves yes if that's that if


---------42:51----------
that's the way they are okay and let's


---------42:54----------
take the socially anxious persons for a


---------42:56----------
second and let's put them in an


---------42:58----------
environment where they're not socially


---------42:59----------
anxious so let's say that they're


---------43:00----------
playing like D and D with their friends


---------43:02----------
so in both cases they're like eight


---------43:04----------
people around but in one case it's like


---------43:06----------
close friends of theirs in another case


---------43:08----------
it's strangers so let's say eight


---------43:10----------
strangers versus eight friends and in


---------43:12----------
one case one person has a lot of social


---------43:14----------
anxiety and their their mind is thinking


---------43:16----------
lots of thoughts and in the other one


---------43:18----------
their mind is kind of just participating


---------43:20----------
in the engaging with other people in


---------43:22----------
kind of like a more simple way do you


---------43:25----------
think that both of those people are


---------43:26----------
equally the same person or do you think


---------43:29----------
that it is a leading question so do you


---------43:32----------
think that the the anxious thoughts kind


---------43:34----------
of interfere with like the them being


---------43:37----------
themselves right so I'm actually


---------43:44----------
offering a hypothesis as opposed to a


---------43:46----------
question with that statement so in both


---------43:52----------
scenarios it's the same person know that


---------43:54----------
I'm asking if like the person s is the


---------43:57----------
same in both scenarios I mean but it is


---------44:03----------
the same guy it's the same guy just two


---------44:05----------
different scenarios


---------44:10----------
are they this your ask me is the same


---------44:13----------
person this yep like let me put it this


---------44:18----------
way if you were to observe the the DND


---------44:23----------
interaction from behind like a two-way


---------44:25----------
mirror and if you were to observe the


---------44:27----------
party at interaction from behind a


---------44:28----------
two-way mirror do you think you would


---------44:30----------
get the same sense of who that person is


---------44:33----------
or would you say that one observer would


---------44:36----------
get to know one liked that person better


---------44:38----------
in one scenario as opposed to the other


---------44:40----------
I would say that you wouldn't really get


---------44:46----------
to know them fully until you observe


---------44:47----------
both okay because they're both facets of


---------44:51----------
that person okay their anxiety and also


---------44:54----------
that comes their comfort


---------44:56----------
I completely agree that you would learn


---------44:58----------
you would get a more complete picture so


---------45:02----------
but do you think that one is worth more


---------45:05----------
than the other in terms of like


---------45:06----------
understanding who that person is I mean


---------45:13----------
I can see where you're leading me you're


---------45:14----------
trying to I guess you're trying to say


---------45:15----------
that the person who's comfortable and is


---------45:18----------
open is more being themselves and you


---------45:22----------
know is is out of their shell whereas


---------45:24----------
either guy is closed up and and hiding


---------45:26----------
that but yeah do you I mean you can see


---------45:30----------
where I'm leading you absolutely but do


---------45:31----------
you do you want to go there like do you


---------45:34----------
agree with that you know this yeah sure


---------45:39----------
okay so I think part of the the reason


---------45:42----------
it's hard to agree with that is because


---------45:43----------
it implies that the anxiety is kind of


---------45:46----------
false the anxiety is very real and is a


---------45:49----------
part of that person's life but that's


---------45:50----------
not really who they are right the


---------45:54----------
anxiety kind of like anxiety is


---------45:56----------
something that layers on top of you and


---------45:57----------
keeps you from being who you are that's


---------46:00----------
my experience in my hypothesis okay


---------46:03----------
right in the same way that depressions


---------46:05----------
is not who a person is it layers on top


---------46:10----------
of them and keeps them from being


---------46:11----------
themselves anxiety layers on top of you


---------46:15----------
and keeps you from being yourself yeah


---------46:17----------
okay that makes sense right so like


---------46:22----------
I guess the bit that just doesn't isn't


---------46:25----------
so clear it's like what is yourself then


---------46:29----------
exactly so so that's the question and


---------46:33----------
that's the question we have to answer so


---------46:36----------
the first thing to understand is that we


---------46:37----------
are not our mind so our mind is just a


---------46:41----------
thinking machine and so in the same way


---------46:44----------
like Paul are you your hand I'm willing


---------46:49----------
to it I'm willing to take the whole it


---------46:51----------
didn't really occur to me until I was in


---------46:52----------
my late teens but I'm willing to admit


---------46:56----------
that my body is maybe not me I mean it's


---------46:58----------
kind of weird because like a I don't


---------46:59----------
think I'm gonna exist a very long if I


---------47:01----------
don't have my body put sure but your


---------47:05----------
body is not you right there's there's a


---------47:07----------
Eunice that transcends your body like if


---------47:12----------
you lose a hand do you stop being Paul


---------47:18----------
no right


---------47:21----------
I mean sure like that's a reality like


---------47:23----------
yours life has changed and you may


---------47:25----------
change as a result of it but Paul does


---------47:27----------
not it's not like if you lose an arm you


---------47:29----------
lose 20% to Paul like your so Paul and


---------47:34----------
in the same way it's not like if your if


---------47:36----------
your mind is if your anxiety goes away


---------47:40----------
you're still you if your anxiety is


---------47:42----------
there you're still you you're just


---------47:44----------
buried under the anxiety there's a


---------47:46----------
thought yeah this is all the brains in a


---------47:47----------
jar are also still the person right I


---------47:49----------
mean sure you know maybe right so the


---------47:53----------
point the point though is that we have


---------47:54----------
some amount of being or eunice that


---------47:59----------
transcends certainly the body and I am


---------48:02----------
hypothesizing and I'm putting forth to


---------48:05----------
you also the mind and if you want to


---------48:07----------
understand that the best thing that you


---------48:09----------
can do is meditate and and notice parts


---------48:14----------
of the mind of the whole mind all of the


---------48:15----------
mind right so this is where where


---------48:17----------
there's this idea Yogi's say that we


---------48:19----------
what we really are is consciousness and


---------48:21----------
that mind is just like the hand it's


---------48:24----------
like a piece of us but that there is


---------48:26----------
something that exists that is outside of


---------48:28----------
mental activity and if you've watched


---------48:30----------
stream or if you've meditated before you


---------48:33----------
know sometimes people get to this state


---------48:34----------
of mind actually we had a great


---------48:36----------
on Monday with someone who has tried a


---------48:39----------
lot of meditation and like just didn't


---------48:41----------
[ __ ] get it because they never


---------48:43----------
achieved and no mind state right who's


---------48:47----------
dumb oh yeah


---------48:48----------
so like if you just look at Dom's face


---------48:50----------
like he got there because he's like oh


---------48:51----------
this is really awesome I loved it


---------48:54----------
because that's what meditation is and


---------48:56----------
it's an experience of self outside of


---------48:59----------
your mind and the problem is that we


---------49:01----------
don't understand that because we don't


---------49:03----------
spend a whole lot of time outside of our


---------49:05----------
mind


---------49:06----------
in fact we spend most of our time inside


---------49:08----------
our mind and so we think that that's who


---------49:11----------
we are and so it's kind of like you know


---------49:14----------
we've spent all our life in the water so


---------49:16----------
we don't know what it is to like walk on


---------49:18----------
land and it's just we just spend things


---------49:22----------
in a particular state so then this goes


---------49:24----------
back to you and how are we gonna help


---------49:26----------
you and it's this idea that when you're


---------49:28----------
with someone you have all of these


---------49:31----------
thoughts about being a particular person


---------49:35----------
right so you don't want to make them


---------49:37----------
dislike you so you're careful with what


---------49:38----------
you say you don't want to make them this


---------49:40----------
you don't want to make them that and in


---------49:41----------
some ways that helps you right so it


---------49:43----------
improves some of your social


---------49:44----------
interactions you're more intentional and


---------49:46----------
things like that but it also is not like


---------49:49----------
truly the relaxed and real you and


---------49:51----------
sometimes through effort what we


---------49:53----------
actually get better at is being the


---------49:55----------
relaxed and real loss so I don't know


---------49:59----------
which one you're doing but so I think


---------50:02----------
the basic no not right now just I mean


---------50:04----------
when you're at work for example you said


---------50:06----------
that you've gotten battle with your


---------50:07----------
social interactions right yeah I I don't


---------50:11----------
I don't feel like I've ever been able to


---------50:14----------
I used to I used to criticize other


---------50:17----------
people for doing it because it seemed


---------50:18----------
like other people like acts at work


---------50:21----------
especially so outside of London yeah


---------50:24----------
right before I came you were about to


---------50:25----------
say you you said I used to criticize


---------50:28----------
other people for what yeah so like a lot


---------50:32----------
of people have like work personas I


---------50:33----------
remember like once jumping in the car


---------50:35----------
with the guy used to work with I used to


---------50:39----------
sit next to you and his fiancee who also


---------50:41----------
worked there at the moment they were


---------50:43----------
when we left work and go into that car


---------50:46----------
like


---------50:47----------
for that completely I've never even seen


---------50:49----------
him like this they suddenly became


---------50:51----------
themselves for the first time I even


---------50:55----------
when he hung around with me at work and


---------50:57----------
it was just him and me he still wasn't


---------50:58----------
like that it just he just became


---------51:00----------
completely not completely completely but


---------51:03----------
quite completely different person it was


---------51:04----------
shocking to me I was kind of aware it


---------51:07----------
was so it was so thick


---------51:09----------
not just from him but from everyone it


---------51:12----------
was still I could still accept it even


---------51:14----------
without being able to see the contrast


---------51:15----------
cuz I only got to see the contrast in


---------51:17----------
the people who I really obviously got


---------51:19----------
close the question is who are you at


---------51:21----------
work but I thought I was not like them


---------51:23----------
and now you can't like telling me that I


---------51:25----------
am absolutely but but not only at work


---------51:28----------
but just all the time or something like


---------51:29----------
that yeah I think you were a different


---------51:33----------
person whether you were alone or whether


---------51:35----------
you were with someone that you're you


---------51:37----------
know like speed-dating speed-dating


---------51:38----------
sounds [ __ ] awful to me I haven't


---------51:41----------
like never done it but it sounds like


---------51:42----------
there's some of the most artificial


---------51:44----------
contrived inauthentic trash that you can


---------51:47----------
possibly do and like right now Paul our


---------51:50----------
biggest problem our biggest and we have


---------51:52----------
lots of biggest problems one of the


---------51:54----------
biggest problems that I see in society


---------51:56----------
is that we're breeding a culture of


---------51:58----------
inauthenticity we're breeding into this


---------52:02----------
full of fake people yep people are


---------52:04----------
becoming more and more fake in social


---------52:06----------
medias making us more and more and more


---------52:08----------
fake social media is about showing just


---------52:11----------
one slice of the pie to the rest of the


---------52:13----------
world and so what happens is the rest of


---------52:15----------
the world looks at one the best slice of


---------52:19----------
pie that everyone else has and we see


---------52:21----------
our whole pie both the beautiful parts


---------52:23----------
and the kind of undercooked parts and


---------52:25----------
the parts that sort of collapsed in the


---------52:27----------
oven and we see everyone else's perfect


---------52:30----------
pieces of pie and we're breeding a


---------52:33----------
culture of inauthenticity we're getting


---------52:36----------
disconnected from who we really are


---------52:39----------
and I think that you your interactions


---------52:43----------
and social situations are so hell-bent


---------52:45----------
on controlling because you're afraid of


---------52:48----------
people like leaving that you try really


---------52:52----------
hard to not make them leave and then


---------52:53----------
like the the unfortunate thing is like


---------52:55----------
that's a vicious cycle I think the


---------52:57----------
reason you feel so stuck is let's just


---------52:59----------
play this through a couple of


---------53:00----------
Michael's okay so you're concerned that


---------53:02----------
people are gonna leave so you try really


---------53:04----------
hard and the harder you try what happens


---------53:08----------
to the quality of your smile the harder


---------53:10----------
you try to smile smile do it so that's


---------53:14----------
actually a real one is it yeah well if I


---------53:18----------
told you it's not no it's not okay I


---------53:20----------
thought I know I'm curious yeah I was


---------53:24----------
you know I mean this is how I get


---------53:26----------
through the job interview innit that


---------53:27----------
looked real to me do it again that


---------53:33----------
actually looks pretty real but hey this


---------53:35----------
is those pixels man okay see there's a


---------53:39----------
good one right and and and so I think I


---------53:44----------
think the more the harder you try the


---------53:45----------
generally speaking the worse the smile


---------53:48----------
looks and then what happens is it


---------53:50----------
reinforces it becomes a self-fulfilling


---------53:52----------
prophecy so the harder you try the


---------53:54----------
creepier your smile looks and the more


---------53:57----------
that you drive people away which


---------53:58----------
reinforces the idea that you drive


---------54:01----------
people away which makes you try to smile


---------54:04----------
twice as hard yeah most of the most yeah


---------54:07----------
right and if you smile twice I mean I


---------54:09----------
did tell you I don't usually try to


---------54:11----------
smile I guess I do with the speed I'm


---------54:13----------
using that as an analogy right so I


---------54:16----------
think you you you be inauthentic you try


---------54:20----------
to be the person that they want you to


---------54:21----------
be or that you think they want you to be


---------54:23----------
in that in authenticity people detect


---------54:26----------
because we're good at that and they're


---------54:29----------
not actually interested in you because


---------54:31----------
they don't know you're not a real person


---------54:32----------
your fake smiling them like with your


---------54:34----------
whole being and then what happens is


---------54:37----------
like the more you drive them away the


---------54:39----------
more you double down and the harder you


---------54:41----------
have to try to fake smile the harder you


---------54:42----------
try to fake smile the worse off you you


---------54:44----------
the creepier it becomes and the more you


---------54:46----------
drive people away so this cycle happens


---------54:48----------
over and over and over again until it


---------54:51----------
becomes truth in your mind and the truth


---------54:53----------
in your mind is that no matter how hard


---------54:55----------
you try people don't like you right and


---------54:59----------
in that thing is that that truth is like


---------55:01----------
we're supported by data because you try


---------55:03----------
it a little bit and then you tried a lot


---------55:05----------
and then you tried like Hercules and


---------55:06----------
then you tried like ten Hercules --is


---------55:09----------
and no matter how hard you try the


---------55:10----------
response is always the same people do


---------55:12----------
not like you you know you know you're


---------55:14----------
probably


---------55:15----------
hundred-percent right on that because


---------55:17----------
one part so I mentioned I went to be


---------55:19----------
dating like a dozen times actually got a


---------55:21----------
date out of them


---------55:23----------
Wendy which which which so out of those


---------55:27----------
twelve of it they were kind of like


---------55:28----------
roughly in the same sort of time period


---------55:30----------
but we which if you had to number them 1


---------55:33----------
through 12 which one do you think I got


---------55:34----------
the data of one yeah it was either one


---------55:37----------
or two I don't remember but it was it


---------55:39----------
was towards the start they seemed to get


---------55:40----------
harder and harder and I think you're


---------55:42----------
that's why I say you're in the center


---------55:43----------
right yeah quite possibly true yeah


---------55:51----------
quite possibly true I'll take it so now


---------55:55----------
the question is what do we do about it


---------55:56----------
right if you try really really hard to


---------55:58----------
get people to like you and and it gets


---------56:02----------
them to not like you what I need you to


---------56:04----------
do is catch that effort catch the effort


---------56:08----------
catch yourself thinking oh if I don't do


---------56:11----------
this they will not confess and instead


---------56:14----------
ask yourself what do I want to talk to


---------56:16----------
this person about like don't try to talk


---------56:20----------
so actually did do that I actually did


---------56:22----------
do that I love speed dating I think some


---------56:25----------
of the smiles might have been a little


---------56:27----------
fake I don't know okay so tell me about


---------56:29----------
the dating let's talk about that it's


---------56:34----------
not a lot to say but can you tell me


---------56:37----------
about dating in general I mean until


---------56:42----------
until the last cover the months I hadn't


---------56:44----------
done it for like seven years I put it on


---------56:46----------
hold but so I'm not an honoree and I can


---------56:49----------
expert or anything but you just the


---------56:54----------
girls will sit down and you pick a table


---------56:57----------
around him and then every four minutes


---------56:58----------
you rotate is that what you're asking


---------57:00----------
about yeah sure and so what was it like


---------57:03----------
to go speed dating well this time I took


---------57:09----------
care of the external like you said I'd I


---------57:11----------
really dressed up like what I well I


---------57:13----------
guess in this case I was trying to be


---------57:15----------
like what I assumed they want to be like


---------57:17----------
so I you know I I don't even like


---------57:18----------
wearing like not normally I wear stupid


---------57:22----------
fancy colored shirts and stuff I mean


---------57:25----------
yeah but I wore plain because that's


---------57:27----------
what I was advised to do


---------57:28----------
you know the Blazer I just it's been 80


---------57:30----------
quid on some new shoes and nothing like


---------57:34----------
I would ever normally buy which also


---------57:35----------
recommended by a girl at work so you


---------57:37----------
know they they they I got that took some


---------57:39----------
advice and I dressed myself up in a way


---------57:42----------
that I wouldn't I was comfortable with


---------57:43----------
but would never look like before at all


---------57:45----------
sure how did you feel wearing that stuff


---------57:56----------
actually felt pretty cool I actually in


---------58:01----------
a bit also I kind of hated myself as


---------58:03----------
well because I don't because it's not


---------58:10----------
really what I wanted to look like it's


---------58:11----------
just what do you want to say and end up


---------58:16----------
looking like everyone else I like to


---------58:18----------
[ __ ] I like to look like a clown to


---------58:19----------
be honest I usually wear like ridiculous


---------58:24----------
like allowed colors like they call it


---------58:27----------
like peacocking in like but that's not


---------58:29----------
really what I'm that's not why I don't


---------58:32----------
really know why I just like clothes okay


---------58:34----------
just like standing out but also not so


---------58:38----------
that's weird like I mean I like I'm not


---------58:41----------
I'm not I'm kind of an introvert


---------58:43----------
obviously and I don't have I'm also


---------58:44----------
isolated a lot of the time really really


---------58:48----------
come into my own with his Korona things


---------58:49----------
I'm already an expert in self isolation


---------58:51----------
um well what do you mean by you liked


---------58:55----------
yeah but I mean but it's not like just


---------58:58----------
wearing bright colors just makes you it


---------58:59----------
like people could want to come and talk


---------59:01----------
to you anything it doesn't really change


---------59:02----------
anything it just changes how you


---------59:03----------
perceive probably but it doesn't why do


---------59:05----------
you like wearing bright colors I don't


---------59:07----------
know probably cause I just like bright


---------59:09----------
colors on yeah right so I think I think


---------59:11----------
right there is a difference one is you


---------59:13----------
doing what you think the world wants and


---------59:15----------
one is doing what you want yeah of


---------59:19----------
course but I but I you know so I do


---------59:23----------
think it's worth exploring I'm not


---------59:26----------
saying that just be you know don't


---------59:27----------
change as a human being and don't


---------59:29----------
explore other wardrobes like I think if


---------59:30----------
you're in the dating scene it makes


---------59:32----------
sense to like try to present your best


---------59:34----------
self right so I don't think you should


---------59:37----------
be inauthentic but I think that you


---------59:39----------
should be as polished as you can


---------59:40----------
possibly be


---------59:41----------
yeah I was I was looking pretty polished


---------59:43----------
yeah so I think that like a nice blazer


---------59:46----------
and a nice pair of shoes is great but if


---------59:48----------
you want to wear like a more flamboyant


---------59:51----------
shirt then by all means go for it


---------59:53----------
you know I don't know if you tell me to


---------59:57----------
be myself then I guess I would do but I


---------59:59----------
don't know that it wouldn't net me any


---------60:01----------
okay so hold on for a second real goons


---------60:04----------
because now can we can we acknowledge


---------60:06----------
that you're not actually being yourself


---------60:10----------
when like do you acknowledge that or do


---------60:14----------
you still think that you're being


---------60:15----------
yourself when you go out and date I


---------60:20----------
think I am I thought I was okay but at


---------60:25----------
least in when it comes to clothing it


---------60:26----------
sounds like you're not I don't even like


---------60:29----------
I don't know I don't even know the whole


---------60:33----------
reason I even wear the stupid stuff I


---------60:35----------
wear now is because it was originally a


---------60:36----------
recommendation from the very first girl


---------60:38----------
at work who actually got me fired we


---------60:39----------
talked about last night


---------60:41----------
I don't even know like if I don't have a


---------60:45----------
style I just I don't care about clothing


---------60:48----------
I don't care I wear anything I mean did


---------60:51----------
you dress up for this interview or


---------60:53----------
session or whatever we're doing did you


---------60:56----------
think about what you were wearing when


---------60:57----------
you came on here


---------60:58----------
it kind of cuz I mean it's record it


---------61:02----------
isn't it so so like I mean how do you


---------61:04----------
how comfortable do you feel with what


---------61:05----------
you're wearing I mean this this is my


---------61:08----------
dating outfit without the blazer I mean


---------61:10----------
you know I'm pretty comfortable with it


---------61:11----------
okay


---------61:11----------
I think you look sharp man I can't see


---------61:15----------
the rest of me but yeah that's all right


---------61:17----------
yeah I mean you're right I can't see the


---------61:20----------
rest of you are you are you like an


---------61:22----------
octopus from below the belt a couple of


---------61:24----------
people who commented but this guy


---------61:25----------
doesn't seem that mean if I if I start I


---------61:27----------
mean I you probably did see when I went


---------61:29----------
together the picture so you may be fat


---------61:31----------
that's okay like most like 40% of the


---------61:33----------
world is overweight a lot of them find


---------61:36----------
love like you can do some things to lose


---------61:38----------
weight and you can be more confident in


---------61:40----------
yourself absolutely but it also doesn't


---------61:41----------
make you unlovable right like people who


---------61:45----------
I do wonder whenever when it it's not so


---------61:50----------
much the case out in the suburbs but


---------61:51----------
especially in London like all the


---------61:53----------
couples you see on the street


---------61:54----------
they're all


---------61:55----------
- good-looking couples like it makes


---------61:58----------
sense you don't see a lot of fatties


---------61:59----------
with a girl of any size I mean I think


---------62:03----------
you should look closer I'm looking all


---------62:06----------
the time I think that you have a


---------62:08----------
cognitive bias that filters what you see


---------62:11----------
no because when I do see I'm like wow


---------62:13----------
that's rare okay


---------62:15----------
could be wrong yeah could be wrong I


---------62:20----------
think I think most of the most of the


---------62:22----------
couples in the worlds and in the world


---------62:23----------
are fives they're not eights they're not


---------62:26----------
not yet in the world I'm just saying I


---------62:27----------
spent specifically in London though I


---------62:30----------
feel like there's a lot of very


---------62:32----------
beautiful people here and that that's


---------62:33----------
kind of what the city attracts sure and


---------62:38----------
uh Paul how do you think or how do you


---------62:41----------
think this conversation is going is this


---------62:43----------
how is this opera news a train wreck


---------62:45----------
like last time not as bad as last time


---------62:47----------
there what do you mean by train wreck I


---------62:52----------
mean maybe maybe it like comes I don't


---------62:56----------
know maybe I mean a train right because


---------63:01----------
there's no there's no focus I don't know


---------63:06----------
what should we focus on I thought it was


---------63:14----------
terrible last time but they when I went


---------63:16----------
back and watched it again I realized


---------63:17----------
that it was it was fine like if I would


---------63:21----------
just let go a little bit more it was


---------63:23----------
because I was trying to oversteer it I


---------63:24----------
told you at the start right so I'm not


---------63:27----------
gonna be as bad as I think it is right


---------63:28----------
now so I'm kind of do you think so you


---------63:32----------
Youth her you said there were some


---------63:34----------
things that we're gonna be difficult to


---------63:36----------
talk about but that you felt like they


---------63:37----------
were important or something can you just


---------63:39----------
help me understand what you said earlier


---------63:41----------
like you would you had planned on


---------63:43----------
talking about some stuff but you thought


---------63:45----------
it was gonna be oh no I had no I don't


---------63:50----------
remember quite what you had said yeah no


---------63:52----------
is that what I said was that my anxiety


---------63:55----------
drove me to visit some darker places in


---------63:57----------
my past that I thought I would have


---------63:59----------
would be obligated to talk about in


---------64:00----------
order to fix me but obviously that's not


---------64:02----------
the case why is that not obviously the


---------64:05----------
case


---------64:07----------
no I'm saying it's not the case I know


---------64:09----------
why do you why do you say that well


---------64:12----------
because we've never had to approach


---------64:13----------
those topics and are you fixed hello you


---------64:16----------
know well this is it this is this is the


---------64:19----------
anxiety is I feel like I'm pretty like a


---------64:21----------
hundred sessions away from being fixed


---------64:23----------
and we don't have I know I don't know


---------64:24----------
how many sessions we have but I know we


---------64:25----------
don't have a hundred so do you think


---------64:27----------
that those those dark parts of your past


---------64:30----------
or part of what's holding you back


---------64:40----------
I don't yet they hold me back


---------64:45----------
it may be I never got closure on some


---------64:48----------
some things I don't like I I just don't


---------64:54----------
know what like am I like was I in the


---------65:00----------
wrong I like I'm I have fundamentally a


---------65:02----------
bad person and is that why I can't


---------65:04----------
connect with anyone yeah so I think if


---------65:09----------
that thought is floating around in your


---------65:10----------
head it's gonna interfere with your


---------65:12----------
ability to present your best self right


---------65:15----------
so the hypothesis we came up with last


---------65:17----------
time was that it's not actually that the


---------65:20----------
world doesn't I mean I don't believe


---------65:22----------
that you can't find love I've I I


---------65:24----------
believe that what's holding you back is


---------65:26----------
yourself and I I think that going


---------65:29----------
forward we've got a choice we can


---------65:32----------
continue to meander as we have been or


---------65:35----------
we can talk about that like whatever the


---------65:39----------
dark stuff is and where you got the idea


---------65:41----------
that you're you're destined to be this


---------65:44----------
way


---------65:44----------
because that sounds relevant to me but


---------65:56----------
last week you you seemed pretty


---------65:57----------
confidently that we were on the right


---------66:00----------
track and we didn't need to talk I mean


---------66:02----------
you seem pretty sure you like with you


---------66:06----------
in your convictions you seem pretty


---------66:08----------
confident that we were going in the


---------66:10----------
right you know you were handing out


---------66:12----------
pearls left and right and I thought we


---------66:15----------
were going to end up this week talking


---------66:16----------
about how to catch hopelessness and hone


---------66:18----------
that the only reason you're even aware


---------66:21----------
that there's something else that we're


---------66:23----------
not talking about is cuz I mentioned it


---------66:24----------
briefly in the in the preamble yep which


---------66:28----------
I maybe shouldn't have done I mean


---------66:30----------
because if it's important to talk about


---------66:31----------
that wouldn't you discovered it


---------66:33----------
organically like without me just


---------66:34----------
presenting it to you I got no no let me


---------66:48----------
explain something organic discovery is


---------66:51----------
based on little preambles


---------66:55----------
right that's what that is


---------66:57----------
I can't I can't I'm not a mind-reader I


---------67:00----------
can only work with what you give me yeah


---------67:09----------
it's just the last week every time I


---------67:11----------
tried to give you something you kept


---------67:12----------
shutting me down with it see you better


---------67:13----------
that you're mind doing that thing again


---------67:14----------
it seems like I was just giving you the


---------67:15----------
same [ __ ] I wasn't wasn't really helping


---------67:17----------
when I was giving you more stuff I'm


---------67:21----------
sorry for shutting you down


---------67:23----------
no I don't know it just seemed like you


---------67:26----------
all are you absolutely sure about where


---------67:28----------
this was all headed and everything that


---------67:30----------
was last foot you had yeah I know okay I


---------67:32----------
don't know what this week is I'm trying


---------67:37----------
to tell you it this week is it just


---------67:38----------
seems like you're not listening don't


---------67:42----------
tell me you own the plan I think we got


---------67:43----------
to talk about the dark stuff Oh only one


---------67:51----------
way to find out right we have why do we


---------67:56----------
have to talk about it because we tried


---------67:59----------
to not talk about it


---------68:00----------
I tried to respect your feelings and


---------68:02----------
we've made meandering for the last


---------68:04----------
half-hour to 45 minutes is it not useful


---------68:07----------
me wondering would you sure does it feel


---------68:11----------
useful to you


---------68:38----------
I mean you said you said it wouldn't


---------68:40----------
feel transformative though so I don't I


---------68:43----------
guess I'd waylaid the expect little care


---------68:45----------
so much about what I said before well if


---------68:51----------
I didn't care what you said if I'm not


---------68:53----------
taking on board the things you say was


---------68:54----------
the point in fair point okay the dirac


---------69:01----------
do you want to renege on any of those


---------69:03----------
things is uh what I think we should do


---------69:15----------
is let the last conversation be the last


---------69:19----------
conversation and for this conversation


---------69:21----------
to be this conversation right should you


---------69:25----------
learn from the last conversation


---------69:27----------
absolutely but I don't think that we


---------69:29----------
should let I mean honestly this this


---------69:34----------
feels very avoidant to me and I think


---------69:36----------
that one sign of avoidance is meandering


---------69:39----------
conversations right so so it seems like


---------69:47----------
there's something that you really do not


---------69:49----------
want to talk about and it's not my place


---------69:51----------
to bully you into talking sweetie


---------69:53----------
daddy's a little bit busy honey the


---------70:01----------
ultimate of wait it's darling can you


---------70:04----------
please can you please go outside and


---------70:06----------
close the toy


---------70:14----------
your pants are falling down


---------70:18----------
okay go put your babies to sleep in the


---------70:20----------
other bedroom they can't sleep in here


---------70:21----------
there are too many lights on so you've


---------70:24----------
got a 30-second break to figure out what


---------70:26----------
we're talking about Paul baby please go


---------70:29----------
outside daddy's working


---------70:37----------
okay can you put your babies to sleep


---------70:39----------
and then get going okay thank you what


---------70:47----------
do you think man about I mean you want


---------70:51----------
to talk about what you need to talk


---------70:52----------
about I I don't know what I need to talk


---------70:58----------
about what did you said there were some


---------71:01----------
difficult things to talk about what are


---------71:02----------
you referring to can you help close the


---------71:04----------
door honey thank you it's difficult to


---------71:12----------
talk about the few relationships I have


---------71:13----------
had with women in my life if you can


---------71:17----------
even call them that tell me about them I


---------71:20----------
mean one wee word he touched on it's


---------71:22----------
like it was getting fired from my first


---------71:24----------
job mm-hmm that was probably the start


---------71:27----------
because there's not much before that


---------71:28----------
because like I said I went to an


---------71:30----------
all-male high school mm-hmm so then yeah


---------71:39----------
that whole thing was just so it was so


---------71:44----------
ridiculously you it's almost hard to


---------71:46----------
even believe it how ridiculous so I well


---------71:50----------
I only work there for like six months


---------71:55----------
maybe seven or eight actually but but


---------71:58----------
one day my boss comes to me and he says


---------72:00----------
that don't go for lunch today you did


---------72:05----------
only did you just stay here he didn't


---------72:07----------
say anything more than that maybe you


---------72:11----------
have to rewind a little bit more than


---------72:12----------
that so obviously I met this girl at


---------72:15----------
work and we still we started going out


---------72:21----------
to lunch together like every day just it


---------72:24----------
just her and me were you attracted to


---------72:27----------
her no not at first and no and from the


---------72:30----------
outset she made it clear like she's got


---------72:31----------
a boyfriend that is just we're just


---------72:32----------
we're just friends that's fine but I


---------72:36----------
guess the long story short is like after


---------72:37----------
a month of doing this then yes I started


---------72:39----------
to become a little bit attracted to her


---------72:40----------
like after like a month which was which


---------72:43----------
was awkward for me because I already


---------72:45----------
knew that that's like that's not more


---------72:47----------
not acceptable


---------72:48----------
but I told her directly that that's how


---------72:51----------
I was how I was feeling and that I hoped


---------72:54----------
that she would push back but she didn't


---------72:57----------
and I just made it really awkward for me


---------72:58----------
so I kind of just tried to break it off


---------73:00----------
like just let's let's just stop which


---------73:03----------
she didn't want to do either so I


---------73:06----------
remember I sent her an email which so


---------73:10----------
like I say we're going out to lunch all


---------73:12----------
the time but like even when I'm supposed


---------73:14----------
to be working like half the time I'm


---------73:15----------
emailing which is emailing each other


---------73:16----------
back and forth so it like we're in in


---------73:20----------
each other's heads like a lot of the


---------73:21----------
time what do you mean by all the way huh


---------73:28----------
you said you said it made it awkward for


---------73:31----------
me because I started to have feelings


---------73:33----------
for her and and she had a boyfriend


---------73:35----------
yeah well so obviously and that's not


---------73:37----------
gonna work is it right so so I sent her


---------73:40----------
something there's a little bit what is


---------73:42----------
the feeling of awkward so it's it's not


---------73:46----------
going to work is an analytical


---------73:48----------
conclusion yeah what what is what is


---------73:53----------
awkward mean like what was your


---------73:56----------
experience of awkward


---------74:05----------
I mean I don't know what you're asking


---------74:08----------
cuz it's nothing more than I already


---------74:09----------
told you the experience is so I'm


---------74:12----------
lagging I'm literally walking out to


---------74:16----------
lunch with her one day and I'm actually


---------74:18----------
just like a few paces behind and I find


---------74:20----------
myself I find myself just gazing at her


---------74:24----------
figure like you know like on a minute


---------74:29----------
this is no good you know I wish do you


---------74:34----------
know up until that point that was not


---------74:35----------
really a problem I was just like it was


---------74:37----------
just she was just a friend like 100%


---------74:39----------
genuinely and at some point I realized


---------74:41----------
that that doesn't seem to still be the


---------74:44----------
case like in my head and so when I told


---------74:46----------
her this I expected to get a bit upset


---------74:47----------
be like oh yeah


---------74:48----------
to conclude the same thing that I didn't


---------74:50----------
look like oh well where did you say her


---------74:52----------
I pretty much just what I told you I


---------74:56----------
just I don't know actually I don't


---------74:58----------
[ __ ] remember it was fifteen years


---------75:00----------
twelve years ago something I don't


---------75:04----------
remember what I told her but I told her


---------75:05----------
something along the lines of I feel like


---------75:07----------
I'm getting like a bit attracted to


---------75:12----------
something I don't know [ __ ] knows what I


---------75:13----------
said but she the thing is she didn't


---------75:16----------
react the way I expected you just seemed


---------75:18----------
okay with that which which I didn't so I


---------75:26----------
sent it so I sent her an email which is


---------75:28----------
a little bit rude and uh in the hopes


---------75:31----------
that that would like force her to like


---------75:34----------
want to break it off so then it'll be


---------75:36----------
mutually be easier and it did work but


---------75:42----------
why did you want her to break it off I


---------75:47----------
don't know I guess because so that it


---------75:49----------
wouldn't be awkward


---------75:49----------
cuz she's got a boyfriend that's why who


---------75:53----------
she lives with who she came to this


---------75:55----------
country to be with because they met


---------75:57----------
online and so like it doesn't mean well


---------75:59----------
so yeah I didn't want to be any part of


---------76:05----------
like something weird and she was saying


---------76:09----------
stuff like she wanted to bake cakes for


---------76:12----------
me at the weekend and all this stuff I


---------76:13----------
was like wow this is a bit too far in it


---------76:15----------
cuz I mean you he's mm-hmm he's probably


---------76:18----------
asked like what are they


---------76:19----------
what are you gonna like say what the


---------76:20----------
[ __ ] is all this like out of it so well


---------76:24----------
I wanted I wanted to I wanted to be


---------76:29----------
grounded and and they seemed like things


---------76:31----------
were getting a little bit carried away


---------76:33----------
so I don't know what was getting carried


---------76:35----------
away we were or she was or something I


---------76:42----------
don't know so yeah okay


---------76:46----------
but look I don't wanna get because it's


---------76:48----------
a long story at this pace so in any case


---------76:53----------
I we've managed them what are you trying


---------76:56----------
to fast forward past why are you trying


---------77:00----------
to fast forward nothing particularly


---------77:06----------
that I'm not leaving anything out I'm


---------77:09----------
just I'm just conscientious that you


---------77:11----------
could digress forever and I wouldn't


---------77:12----------
wouldn't add anything to the story so


---------77:15----------
I'm not so concerned about the story


---------77:17----------
what I'm concerned about is how your


---------77:19----------
experience of the story right and that


---------77:22----------
that I mean you keep on using the word


---------77:24----------
awkward but like awkward is awkward is


---------77:28----------
kind of a description it's not really


---------77:29----------
awkward usually means like a conflict of


---------77:32----------
feelings sure there was a conflict of


---------77:35----------
feelings what were those feelings I


---------77:39----------
don't know man but who's getting


---------77:42----------
frustrated now it's like it's like I


---------77:46----------
like her but also I don't like the way


---------77:48----------
she's I don't know I like her that's


---------77:53----------
like and dislike I guess I don't know


---------77:54----------
what do you like


---------78:09----------
I like that she was a girl who was into


---------78:13----------
me because that's not happened really


---------78:16----------
ever since


---------78:24----------
and what do you dislike I just like that


---------78:29----------
it's fake like that it that it that is


---------78:33----------
old doesn't sound fake to me I'm sure


---------78:39----------
you dislike something about it but what


---------78:42----------
is what is fake to you about it well


---------78:49----------
they they call it leading out lead


---------78:50----------
leading you on right cuz it's not cuz


---------78:52----------
she's already she's already comfortable


---------78:53----------
she's old he's like so whatever happens


---------79:00----------
she goes home to her to a boyfriend


---------79:01----------
every evening so like that's what I


---------79:05----------
don't like about it how does that make


---------79:07----------
you feel like a [ __ ] pawn yeah like


---------79:18----------
I'm just being


---------79:18----------
I'm just being played you know how she


---------79:24----------
playing you cuz she's just using me the


---------79:30----------
stroke her ego I guess I don't [ __ ]


---------79:31----------
know yeah I don't know if it's quite


---------79:34----------
like that but I mean I what sounds


---------79:38----------
really you know Paul I think though


---------79:44----------
I'm trying to think about how to say


---------79:46----------
this


---------79:52----------
I think one of the hardest things to


---------79:54----------
deal with is when you want something


---------79:56----------
your entire life you've always wanted


---------79:58----------
something and that thing comes along but


---------80:00----------
it's like conditional so you but you you


---------80:02----------
start off from there so I think one of


---------80:04----------
the hardest things is when you want


---------80:05----------
something in life and then it comes


---------80:07----------
along but it's conditional or there's a


---------80:12----------
piece of it that you you know it's it's


---------80:14----------
kind of like window shopping like you


---------80:17----------
can see it and she's right there but


---------80:20----------
there's something in the way and that


---------80:25----------
sounds to me to be almost more painful


---------80:28----------
it seems like almost like it's kind of


---------80:31----------
weird because here's a girl who's


---------80:32----------
clearly into you you tell her she has


---------80:35----------
you have feelings for her but she never


---------80:37----------
she never said that though she made it


---------80:38----------
like I said very clear from the start


---------80:41----------
world the ground we would we're just


---------80:45----------
friends um so she she may have said what


---------80:47----------
the ground rules are but I think she


---------80:49----------
made it very clear that those are not


---------80:51----------
the ground rules because after you


---------80:53----------
confess that you were attracted to her


---------80:54----------
how did she respond yeah I know you


---------80:59----------
could you know you could interpret it


---------81:00----------
that way I mean do you think that that's


---------81:03----------
an honor I mean you're the you're the


---------81:05----------
one who interpreted you but it comes


---------81:06----------
back to this colleagues thing right like


---------81:07----------
she's so she's never so she is spending


---------81:09----------
quite a certain amount of time with me


---------81:11----------
at work pretty much all the time she can


---------81:15----------
given that our desks are apart it were


---------81:18----------
out to lunch which is the time we can be


---------81:21----------
together and in the interns yes with but


---------81:23----------
at the same time she doesn't want to


---------81:26----------
substitute any of her time with her


---------81:27----------
boyfriend to eat with me when it's no


---------81:29----------
longer convenient like she there was no


---------81:31----------
after work or anything like that and


---------81:34----------
neither of us was seeking that but I'm


---------81:37----------
just just I'm just pointing out like


---------81:39----------
yeah how does that really clear now of


---------81:43----------
course the feel of [ __ ] I mean I


---------81:45----------
actually I don't know that it does no


---------81:46----------
because I neither has wanted that you


---------81:50----------
just know it just occurred to me really


---------81:54----------
one like a month know at the time I


---------81:56----------
genuinely didn't as far as I can recall


---------82:02----------
because that that's the thing I want as


---------82:04----------
soon as I'd noticed that I was starting


---------82:06----------
to feel attracted I wanted to break it


---------82:07----------
off that was my reaction


---------82:09----------
why because I didn't see it working any


---------82:12----------
I didn't see it working any other way


---------82:14----------
I thought it I thought it'd be more like


---------82:16----------
I thought I was being a I guess because


---------82:18----------
I genuinely believed in the in the story


---------82:20----------
that we were friends


---------82:21----------
and that I was being a bad friend if I'm


---------82:24----------
attracted to it that doesn't work that's


---------82:27----------
that's what I believed mm-hmm yeah I I


---------82:33----------
think that that makes sense to me I


---------82:34----------
think that there was conflict because


---------82:36----------
you clearly had feelings for her you


---------82:38----------
were attracted to her and you also felt


---------82:42----------
like she was using you yeah


---------82:51----------
what is that what you said yes but you


---------82:55----------
were very dismissive yeah no I'm just


---------82:58----------
frustrated because I thought I thought


---------82:59----------
we were gonna get I thought I don't know


---------83:00----------
I just thought we were gonna I was gonna


---------83:02----------
lay out the story and this is like so


---------83:04----------
much more of it to tell that takes place


---------83:06----------
after all this yeah frustrating that I'm


---------83:09----------
asking you questions instead of letting


---------83:11----------
you continue to tell the story yeah a


---------83:13----------
little bit okay I apologize please


---------83:15----------
continue cuz I I'm not keeping track of


---------83:17----------
time but neither am i yeah so okay so I


---------83:25----------
successfully managed to break it off by


---------83:27----------
spice kind of like slightly insulting


---------83:30----------
her a little bit and and we stopped


---------83:34----------
seeing each other but we stopped going


---------83:35----------
out to lunch was sure away yeah yeah


---------83:38----------
exactly


---------83:39----------
and that was fine that was it was a bit


---------83:41----------
abrupt but you know for the for the


---------83:45----------
weeks that followed though it seemed to


---------83:47----------
be fine until so then we come back to


---------83:51----------
where it where I was so my boss comes to


---------83:53----------
me says don't go to lunch today and for


---------84:00----------
some reason I felt really nervous about


---------84:02----------
that and I started drinking like a lot


---------84:04----------
of water like too much water like I was


---------84:05----------
getting buzzed off it turns out my


---------84:09----------
paranoia was not misplaced though


---------84:11----------
because it was it was I couldn't even I


---------84:13----------
couldn't have imagined what's about to


---------84:15----------
happen so somewhere during the lunch


---------84:19----------
time when I would have been having lunch


---------84:21----------
he says okay


---------84:23----------
it's like it's like a multi-story


---------84:24----------
building he says like we're gonna go


---------84:26----------
down to the second floor no I have it


---------84:29----------
goes to the second floor I mean whether


---------84:30----------
it's just like a bunch of meeting rooms


---------84:31----------
right there's no it's not even a company


---------84:33----------
on that floor so we go into one of the


---------84:37----------
rooms there and they just asked me to


---------84:39----------
wait there and then this guy I've never


---------84:44----------
seen before


---------84:45----------
enters the room


---------84:52----------
I would later learned that he was from a


---------84:55----------
consulting company from so this is


---------84:56----------
before I went to London he was from a


---------84:58----------
consulting company in London so he


---------85:00----------
travelled like two hours up the country


---------85:03----------
just to be there and uh for some reason


---------85:12----------
in that moment I broke down like I just


---------85:14----------
didn't know what was going on and no one


---------85:15----------
was telling me anything and I just felt


---------85:17----------
really upset or just really nervous and


---------85:21----------
I just I almost blacked out like I was


---------85:23----------
just started crying and then and this


---------85:25----------
guy he was like he was he was excited by


---------85:27----------
that he was he was on it immediately and


---------85:29----------
he was like well what are you crying you


---------85:31----------
know what you know you know tell me what


---------85:34----------
you're feeling in this moment that kind


---------85:35----------
of like almost like it was like you do


---------85:38----------
in this situation and that that that


---------85:45----------
really that angered me even in that even


---------85:48----------
in that moment when I'm like in a really


---------85:50----------
bizarre spot just this that he would he


---------85:53----------
would like because because the people


---------85:56----------
that I actually know were not present so


---------85:58----------
the people from my company were supposed


---------85:59----------
to be there but were out of the room at


---------86:01----------
this mount it was just him and me and he


---------86:02----------
seemed like he just took advantage of


---------86:04----------
the situation to maybe do something that


---------86:05----------
he was wasn't really supposed to do you


---------86:07----------
just like poke at me a bit and that that


---------86:10----------
sort of frustrated me do you feel like


---------86:12----------
any way it can get you now no no no


---------86:14----------
there's nothing to do with that he's not


---------86:18----------
a licensed psychiatrist or anything he


---------86:20----------
was just some I don't even really know


---------86:24----------
but anyway it turned out that they were


---------86:27----------
they were putting me on suspended they


---------86:31----------
wanted to suspend me pending


---------86:33----------
investigation because they had heard


---------86:35----------
complaints from this girl that third I


---------86:43----------
think what was the allegation that was


---------86:46----------
harassing her was was what they will eat


---------86:48----------
how they termed it


---------86:53----------
and they lumped it and because that


---------86:56----------
didn't seem sufficiently lumped in some


---------86:57----------
other stuff as well so they also they


---------86:59----------
also tried to pin on me that I was


---------87:00----------
suicidal which is absolutely nonsense


---------87:04----------
but that thing barrette blew out of


---------87:06----------
proportion anymore followed where did


---------87:09----------
they get that idea and so they got that


---------87:11----------
so a couple weeks prior one of the new


---------87:14----------
HR was the only one and she was very


---------87:17----------
young


---------87:17----------
not much older than me some fresh HR


---------87:20----------
girl III did this this thing you know as


---------87:26----------
a joke I comment what the conversation


---------87:28----------
around it was but I did this motion like


---------87:30----------
attended to shoot myself in the head at


---------87:32----------
one point and she'd mentioned this to


---------87:35----------
them prior to this guy meeting me and at


---------87:40----------
the time she had no concern whatsoever


---------87:41----------
but but weeks later she mentions it to


---------87:43----------
them and they take it's super serious


---------87:45----------
like they think all these guys like


---------87:46----------
office this guy's like a you know a bit


---------87:49----------
of a nutcase so how does it feel to be


---------87:53----------
on the other end of that scrutiny to be


---------87:56----------
treated like that you you you have


---------88:00----------
nowhere to run like so let's say that I


---------88:02----------
actually was like if you're if you're in


---------88:04----------
if you're in a mental asylum it's no


---------88:06----------
good it's no good pleading your case


---------88:07----------
right it's like oh you know of course


---------88:09----------
you're or you're the one that's not


---------88:10----------
crazy right you know it's like oh no I'm


---------88:13----------
honestly I'm not mental you know if


---------88:15----------
everyone's perception of you is that


---------88:17----------
you're crazy you need to be locked up


---------88:18----------
you have no plea there's nothing you can


---------88:21----------
say to get out of that and it's very


---------88:23----------
much the same situation that I was in


---------88:25----------
it's like well if they if they all


---------88:26----------
believe the euro you're a suicide case


---------88:29----------
then it doesn't leave nothing you can


---------88:33----------
say but but they weren't sure they


---------88:35----------
weren't sure that's they just had this


---------88:37----------
one girl's word so what they ended up


---------88:39----------
doing was sending me to so they


---------88:42----------
suspended me but with pay pending this


---------88:44----------
investigation part of that investigation


---------88:46----------
was to send me to a psychiatrist for a


---------88:50----------
number of sessions I don't remember how


---------88:52----------
many it off somewhere in the country


---------88:54----------
like some miles away in the middle of


---------88:56----------
nowhere just this guy who lived in a


---------88:59----------
little cottage doing psychiatry I guess


---------89:03----------
[Music]


---------89:04----------
and his main purpose was to figure out


---------89:07----------
whether or not I was actually suicidal I


---------89:09----------
think that's although I used those


---------89:12----------
sessions to try and gain some


---------89:14----------
understanding and like some perspective


---------89:16----------
and good for you but I didn't get


---------89:19----------
anywhere I don't think I got anywhere


---------89:20----------
with it because I'm still here today


---------89:21----------
wondering about it like did I [ __ ] up


---------89:23----------
did she [ __ ] up is it my fault is it her


---------89:25----------
fault is it nobody's fault is the


---------89:26----------
company's fault who's to blame for all


---------89:30----------
this [ __ ] I still don't know it's like


---------89:36----------
this many years later I still don't know


---------89:41----------
so in in the it took two months before


---------89:45----------
they finally finally let me go and


---------89:47----------
finally gave me some [ __ ] clothes at


---------89:48----------
least tell me that there's no longer a


---------89:51----------
job for me here up until that point I


---------89:53----------
would come in occasionally to meet with


---------89:57----------
these guys again they would come up from


---------89:58----------
London then they would ask me questions


---------89:59----------
and they would try to learn stuff about


---------90:02----------
what had happened and I couldn't make


---------90:05----------
sense of it like what is this what is


---------90:06----------
this all like why make such a fuss what


---------90:09----------
was it like - do you remember what it


---------90:10----------
felt like walking into the building -


---------90:12----------
like a meet with those guys every now


---------90:14----------
and then as they kind of need another


---------90:16----------
one quote and proddin I keep in mind


---------90:23----------
that it's my first job out of university


---------90:23----------
I'm pinning everything I still feel like


---------90:26----------
if I lose my job here I'm never gonna


---------90:27----------
get I'm never gonna work again like I'm


---------90:30----------
I don't know what my future looks like


---------90:33----------
if I can't if I can't get my job back so


---------90:35----------
I go into these sessions I prepare for


---------90:37----------
them I try and prepare all the evidence


---------90:39----------
I can to answer whatever questions they


---------90:41----------
might have I would do of timelines and I


---------90:45----------
mean I don't have access to any the


---------90:47----------
information I would have had but it -


---------90:48----------
her access to my own memory but I would


---------90:50----------
try to prepare stuff to try and placate


---------90:53----------
whatever concerns they had ultimately it


---------90:56----------
didn't matter at all and I only kind of


---------90:58----------
gauged in the very last session what


---------91:00----------
actually might have been going on so I


---------91:03----------
think they did they they were just


---------91:05----------
concerned whether or not there was any


---------91:06----------
legal ramifications for - firing one or


---------91:08----------
both of us I think that's what was


---------91:09----------
actually going on it wasn't really the


---------91:11----------
case that they gave a [ __ ] about whether


---------91:13----------
they kept me on or her on or whatever it


---------91:16----------
was it was just whether


---------91:18----------
and they eventually concluded that


---------91:19----------
legislation at that time was that if you


---------91:21----------
haven't worked anywhere for a full two


---------91:23----------
years no for one year at that time it's


---------91:25----------
now two years but other time was only 12


---------91:27----------
months then you could you could like


---------91:29----------
take a court their company to tribunal


---------91:31----------
over unfair dismissal this and I hadn't


---------91:33----------
I hadn't quite made it to 12 but she had


---------91:37----------
she was just in by like a month or two


---------91:40----------
and I think so I would say they never


---------91:43----------
told it to me in those terms they let


---------91:44----------
they let a few points around that slip


---------91:47----------
during the final meeting which kind of


---------91:48----------
clued me into what was going on but I


---------91:52----------
believe that's what it was but you know


---------91:55----------
maybe that's just the story I tell


---------91:56----------
myself maybe I really did [ __ ] off


---------91:58----------
horrendously anything but it just is


---------92:00----------
it's so bizarre like I've not had an


---------92:02----------
experience like it since and I can't


---------92:03----------
even imagine like why go through that


---------92:05----------
that much [ __ ] I'm a junior so she she's


---------92:08----------
just a translator


---------92:09----------
the tenor penny the clock in a machine


---------92:12----------
just go and get another one like why go


---------92:13----------
to that much first why keep me on


---------92:16----------
payroll for two months why bring up


---------92:17----------
these people from London I still don't


---------92:19----------
know now it's insane to me that this


---------92:21----------
happened


---------92:23----------
did they really feel like they had a


---------92:25----------
moral responsibility to me and to


---------92:27----------
themselves into the company to make sure


---------92:29----------
that I wasn't actually suicidal before


---------92:31----------
letting me go because that's kind of how


---------92:32----------
they painted it but I don't I don't know


---------92:34----------
if I can really build if I can really


---------92:36----------
buy it it's just it's just insane the


---------92:42----------
whole thing I know we're not even going


---------92:44----------
into details that's just a sort of like


---------92:46----------
the high level but it is can you give me


---------92:50----------
an example of what details you're you're


---------92:52----------
not going into probably not actually


---------92:55----------
most of it's a haze now okay there's


---------92:57----------
probably nothing important so it sounds


---------93:00----------
like okay but but I really wish I really


---------93:05----------
wish I knew like whose fault everything


---------93:08----------
all of this was what would change for


---------93:11----------
you if you knew whose fault it was


---------93:15----------
if it's not my fault then I don't have


---------93:17----------
to feel bad about it do you feel bad


---------93:31----------
about it


---------93:40----------
I don't know it sounds like this is


---------93:46----------
something you've been carrying for a


---------93:50----------
long time yeah I don't know if I'm


---------93:54----------
supposed to feel bad about it because I


---------93:55----------
don't even know that we broke it like so


---------93:57----------
I broke it off for this girl and the


---------93:59----------
next thing I know I'm being hauled into


---------94:01----------
a room to try and defend my actions


---------94:03----------
which was what exactly no waiting yeah


---------94:08----------
is that how it feels it's not assuming


---------94:14----------
it's just bizarre and like the


---------94:22----------
frustrating thing is so they were


---------94:24----------
speaking to me but they were also


---------94:25----------
speaking to her but I mean I never saw


---------94:27----------
her again right they wouldn't they


---------94:28----------
obviously wouldn't let us go near each


---------94:30----------
other so I don't really know if I'm


---------94:31----------
supposed to feel bad like what if what


---------94:33----------
if I was just being played from them


---------94:35----------
from day one to day 32 day 60 like but


---------94:38----------
what if what if she was totally happy


---------94:40----------
with it how everything turned out it


---------94:42----------
seems unlikely but then I wouldn't have


---------94:45----------
to feel bad because I mean I'm the


---------94:47----------
victim in that case but what if what if


---------94:49----------
she actually genuinely so so the other


---------94:51----------
thing is sort of the way the reason they


---------94:53----------
were actually more on her side than mine


---------94:54----------
from the get-go is because of the way


---------94:56----------
the in the way the look the problem was


---------95:03----------
reported was that she didn't go to the


---------95:04----------
company and say look I don't like this


---------95:06----------
guy he's been making me feel bad or he's


---------95:08----------
harassing me or whatever the claim was


---------95:09----------
it's because she was just crying at her


---------95:11----------
desk and then someone quiet oh why are


---------95:13----------
you why are you sad and they said oh and


---------95:15----------
then she told him about it and and they


---------95:17----------
they drilled that point home to me a few


---------95:19----------
times which is why they're kind of like


---------95:23----------
on her side and it kind of does it


---------95:27----------
fending to neglect to mention that


---------95:30----------
actually was a common occurrence for she


---------95:31----------
she was very emotional and frequently


---------95:33----------
got upset about things that I have no


---------95:34----------
idea what they would be at her desk and


---------95:37----------
it just turned out that one of those


---------95:38----------
times it was my fault apparently sounds


---------95:44----------
pretty unfair to me what's unfair who


---------95:48----------
what's what's unfair to you sounds like


---------95:53----------
you got railroaded I don't know did I


---------95:55----------
feel I did I genuinely do something bad


---------95:57----------
I don't know sure I think you did


---------96:01----------
something bad it sounds like you sent a


---------96:04----------
hurtful email


---------96:13----------
rest of it I you know seems like you


---------96:15----------
didn't really do anything wrong you know


---------96:18----------
I don't know I looking back at it


---------96:21----------
probably that it is would it be it would


---------96:23----------
be just out at most but at the time I


---------96:25----------
was also wondering like probably other


---------96:29----------
things I don't know like I've been a bad


---------96:33----------
friend had been a bad person


---------96:35----------
fundamentally like it well I don't I


---------96:39----------
don't know like probably now I don't


---------96:41----------
probably now it doesn't sit with me like


---------96:42----------
that so with that with that level of


---------96:47----------
calm how does it sit with you now I


---------96:55----------
guess I guess it's just water under the


---------96:57----------
bridge on now but but also not I could


---------97:00----------
think so man I just I just want I guess


---------97:04----------
it's like I told you but I just want


---------97:05----------
closure it's like someone tell me please


---------97:07----------
someone tell me who the [ __ ] is at fault


---------97:11----------
yeah so at least I know where I you


---------97:16----------
think do you think this influences your


---------97:18----------
relationships with women now I don't


---------97:23----------
know I don't know I think it does I


---------97:26----------
think I think you've been tiring this


---------97:29----------
around for a long long time yet thought


---------97:33----------
that and the rest said that there was


---------97:38----------
like at least one other relationship


---------97:40----------
which we never we don't have time to


---------97:43----------
talk about but but yeah that was the


---------97:45----------
first one can I tell you what I see and


---------97:49----------
what I heard please


---------97:57----------
so you talk about closure you talk about


---------97:59----------
just wanting to know right you just want


---------98:02----------
to know I mean it sounds like you're


---------98:03----------
actually if you made a mistake and if


---------98:05----------
you [ __ ] up and if you're bad you can


---------98:07----------
live with that it sounds like no known


---------98:09----------
well I know I don't know how I would


---------98:11----------
take it but if I'd learned that well if


---------98:13----------
I'd if I learned that if I learned that


---------98:15----------
that is my fault I don't know what I


---------98:18----------
would do then I guess I want to hear


---------98:20----------
that it's not yeah so you're looking for


---------98:23----------
absolution and it sounds like the


---------98:24----------
uncertainty is just really tearing you


---------98:27----------
up


---------98:27----------
it sounds like torture it yeah not so


---------98:31----------
much I mean that's the thing like I


---------98:33----------
rarely think about it now thank God but


---------98:35----------
if I have to think about it then yeah it


---------98:38----------
is like that yeah so that doesn't sound


---------98:40----------
like something that you've let go so


---------98:43----------
generally speaking when we have


---------98:45----------
experiences like this we carry them with


---------98:47----------
us and they occupy a space on in our


---------98:51----------
mind and they tend to influence or


---------98:54----------
burden what we do and what I hear from


---------99:00----------
you is is that you had a relationship


---------99:02----------
where someone was very clearly


---------99:04----------
interested in you and that you felt used


---------99:07----------
you felt icky by y'all's relationship


---------99:12----------
you expressed your feelings you also


---------99:15----------
cared about her and were attracted to


---------99:16----------
her and you were hoping that she would


---------99:19----------
make it easy on you you were hoping that


---------99:21----------
sharing your feelings with her she would


---------99:24----------
say she would be kind of like she would


---------99:25----------
give you closure right she wouldn't


---------99:27----------
leave things ambiguous that she would


---------99:28----------
say yeah we have to stop but she did


---------99:31----------
this yeah and so here comes Paul who's


---------99:36----------
lonely and has never been appreciated by


---------99:39----------
a woman in his life and here comes a


---------99:40----------
woman who's in a relationship and


---------99:42----------
despite being in a relationship and


---------99:44----------
despite having all of these these


---------99:46----------
reasons for her to say no Paul she's not


---------99:49----------
saying no that makes it even doubly


---------99:53----------
difficult and now and then you don't


---------99:58----------
know I mean you keep on using the word


---------99:59----------
awkward but you don't know what to think


---------100:01----------
you don't know what to feel it feels


---------100:03----------
wrong to you but you want it you want


---------100:05----------
her


---------100:05----------
wanted to continue you want her to bring


---------100:07----------
I didn't what it's yeah I wanted to


---------100:10----------
break up Ian yeah I think there's a part


---------100:13----------
of you that wanted it to continue I


---------100:15----------
don't believe that's the case okay not


---------100:21----------
at that time I don't know that it's


---------100:28----------
worth to go down that tangent but I'll


---------100:30----------
just say this when you have a connection


---------100:32----------
with someone who you go out to lunch


---------100:34----------
with every day and you guys are emailing


---------100:36----------
back and forth every day and you find


---------100:39----------
yourself attracted to them I find it


---------100:41----------
hard to believe that there is not some


---------100:43----------
corner of your mind or your heart that


---------100:45----------
does not want that to continue or want


---------100:47----------
more from that I just find that hard to


---------100:51----------
believe


---------100:51----------
no but it reached a point where I


---------100:54----------
generally told you


---------100:57----------
it generally felt this comfortable with


---------100:58----------
it and I wanted to cut it off and I did


---------101:00----------
yeah I was just after that yeah so Paul


---------101:03----------
I think that I agree with all of those


---------101:05----------
things as well but I want you to


---------101:07----------
understand that your mind is not


---------101:08----------
black-and-white I think on balance you


---------101:10----------
decided that the relationship was not


---------101:12----------
good for you and it made you too


---------101:13----------
uncomfortable but just because it made


---------101:15----------
you too uncomfortable doesn't mean that


---------101:17----------
there isn't a part of you that enjoyed


---------101:18----------
spending time with her right yeah oops


---------101:22----------
until that point yes you're providing


---------101:28----------
okay so you're presupposing that I


---------101:30----------
genuinely wanted to come part of me


---------101:32----------
genuinely whether subconscious or


---------101:33----------
otherwise part of me genuinely wanted to


---------101:35----------
continue in spite of that and I don't


---------101:36----------
think that's the case okay without


---------101:39----------
regret I ended it okay so you decided


---------101:45----------
that you didn't want to be a part of


---------101:47----------
this relationship because of kind of


---------101:48----------
that right unclear boundaries that you


---------101:50----------
were content with friendship and that


---------101:52----------
bit of feelings but that yes I heard yes


---------101:55----------
the second one that I haven't told you


---------101:58----------
about went more the way that you're


---------101:59----------
implying which is like so there was a


---------102:02----------
second girl and it was exactly the same


---------102:03----------
[ __ ] set up she has a boyfriend but


---------102:06----------
she's talking to me every day all day


---------102:07----------
every day and this was not at work this


---------102:10----------
is slightly different and and yes I knew


---------102:13----------
she had a boyfriend from the start but I


---------102:14----------
kind of I wanted to play that [ __ ]


---------102:16----------
game this this time around I wanted to


---------102:18----------
play that [ __ ] game and I wanted


---------102:19----------
I wanted to beat him and long story


---------102:22----------
short I didn't but if you've got time to


---------102:25----------
go into all of that


---------102:26----------
I don't even even know it it's


---------102:28----------
beneficial to do so but I'm telling you


---------102:31----------
the first time I did no fine I yeah


---------102:35----------
thank you for clarifying you're more


---------102:38----------
than welcome and and but I think also


---------102:42----------
there's there's a sense of powerlessness


---------102:43----------
about this there's a sense of confusion


---------102:46----------
and bewilderment there's a sense of


---------102:48----------
getting handled process there's anger


---------102:53----------
there's frustration there's confusion


---------102:58----------
and I think the the biggest part I mean


---------103:00----------
the thing that seems to be weighing on


---------103:01----------
either most is you don't know who to


---------103:03----------
blame yeah you tell me what would it


---------103:10----------
help yeah I don't think Paul I don't


---------103:17----------
think you did anything wrong


---------103:18----------
I think but not really I think


---------103:22----------
everything that you lo put it this way I


---------103:23----------
think everything you did is forgivable I


---------103:26----------
think that you had feelings you there


---------103:29----------
was I think you had a relationship with


---------103:30----------
a woman where you guys had decided that


---------103:32----------
you were gonna be friends and that as


---------103:35----------
that relationship huh


---------103:36----------
breaking up again oh sorry I said I


---------103:40----------
think you you did everything you did


---------103:44----------
what I think was reasonable and also


---------103:46----------
forgivable so I think let me just let me


---------103:48----------
tell you the story as I heard it okay


---------103:50----------
and I'm pretty good at sniffing out when


---------103:53----------
there are cognitive biases and [ __ ]


---------103:54----------
and stories so you know take that let me


---------103:57----------
take that for what you had you have a


---------103:59----------
bias because you only hear my side but


---------104:00----------
yes no no but I mean I hear bias I hear


---------104:03----------
only one side of stories all the time


---------104:04----------
from people and I still can sniff out


---------104:06----------
[ __ ] pretty well that's my pocket


---------104:08----------
right so when an alcoholic comes into my


---------104:10----------
office and says I haven't been drinking


---------104:12----------
I'm pretty good at sniffing that out so


---------104:17----------
here's what I hear you went to work you


---------104:21----------
had a friend you guys had a connection


---------104:22----------
it was purely platonic and you guys


---------104:24----------
really enjoyed spending time with each


---------104:25----------
other you guys spent time with each


---------104:27----------
other she had made it very clear to you


---------104:29----------
that she was only interested in


---------104:31----------
friendship


---------104:32----------
and then something happened between the


---------104:34----------
two of you which is that you started to


---------104:36----------
get attracted to her and chances are she


---------104:37----------
got attracted to you too otherwise you


---------104:40----------
know things would not have perceived


---------104:41----------
can't comment on her end yeah well but


---------104:45----------
yeah but I think we can write so I think


---------104:48----------
that that those kinds of feelings and


---------104:50----------
stuff evolve all the time when people


---------104:52----------
spend a lot of time together you guys


---------104:53----------
really it sounds like you guys had a


---------104:54----------
connection and then you noticed that you


---------104:59----------
were starting to feel attracted to her


---------105:00----------
and out of out of actually your duty


---------105:02----------
towards your friendship you shared that


---------105:05----------
with her because you felt like your


---------105:07----------
relationship which was changing and


---------105:08----------
almost out of respect I mean I think


---------105:10----------
it's a reasonable thing for friends to


---------105:12----------
do if they start to have feelings of


---------105:13----------
attraction because it gives you a chance


---------105:15----------
to sort of figure out how you guys are


---------105:17----------
gonna move forward as friends and and


---------105:20----------
whether there's something worth


---------105:21----------
exploring or not exploring and you were


---------105:23----------
expecting her to pull back and she did


---------105:25----------
it and then it also sounds like she kind


---------105:30----------
of was was sending you mixed signals


---------105:32----------
because on the one hand she's you guys


---------105:34----------
are going to lunch everyday on the other


---------105:35----------
hand you're emailing back and forth and


---------105:37----------
then she tells you she wants to start


---------105:39----------
baking cakes and then I think you


---------105:41----------
started to feel guilty you started to


---------105:43----------
feel like this isn't right and I'm not


---------105:45----------
so sure what you wanted or you didn't


---------105:47----------
want but it just didn't feel good to you


---------105:50----------
anymore so you've tried to push her away


---------105:51----------
and lo and behold she's actually pretty


---------105:54----------
into you and values your relationship


---------105:57----------
and unclear of what how she feels about


---------106:00----------
you


---------106:00----------
but there are also a lot of questionable


---------106:02----------
things about her background too so a lot


---------106:04----------
of times people who meet online and move


---------106:06----------
countries are not actually that


---------106:08----------
emotionally invested in the person that


---------106:10----------
they move in with or when they move it


---------106:12----------
turns out to be like a different kind of


---------106:14----------
relationship than being like a thousand


---------106:16----------
miles away so I know a lot of online


---------106:18----------
relationships that fall apart because


---------106:20----------
they meet someone else who's local I've


---------106:23----------
heard that story a thousand times coming


---------106:25----------
back to you and what you're at fault for


---------106:27----------
and then I think you start to feel


---------106:29----------
uncomfortable and you don't really know


---------106:31----------
how to handle it and you want the


---------106:32----------
relationship to end and you've tried to


---------106:33----------
tell her things that would drive her


---------106:35----------
away and she doesn't get driven away she


---------106:37----------
doesn't get driven away and she doesn't


---------106:38----------
get driven away and so then you send her


---------106:40----------
a mean email because that's sometimes


---------106:42----------
what you have to do to push people away


---------106:43----------
now I do I think you could have done


---------106:46----------
a better job with communicating things


---------106:48----------
or setting limits with her absolutely do


---------106:50----------
I think that you should have sent an


---------106:52----------
email absolutely not do I think it's


---------106:53----------
forgivable given the circumstances


---------106:55----------
absolutely right so life is not about


---------106:59----------
not making mistakes it's about you know


---------107:04----------
like making mistakes that are reasonable


---------107:06----------
given the circumstances because we're


---------107:07----------
not all perfect human beings and then


---------107:10----------
the real [ __ ] show starts you get


---------107:13----------
railroaded you get called into room it's


---------107:15----------
not even your boss it's some guy who's


---------107:16----------
driven two hours up I don't even know


---------107:18----------
how you feel I I mean it sounds like you


---------107:20----------
feel powerless you feel confused you


---------107:22----------
feel persecuted you feel like it's


---------107:24----------
unfair I mean that's what I heard I


---------107:27----------
heard venom in your voice I heard anger


---------107:29----------
I heard I heard a sense of injustice


---------107:32----------
about the way that you were treated yeah


---------107:36----------
it didn't matter what at the time I


---------107:38----------
believed that but all this work in


---------107:40----------
preparation I might do to vindicate


---------107:42----------
myself would actually have approached


---------107:45----------
like I like I felt like I felt like it


---------107:48----------
was a fair trial but it wasn't yeah I


---------107:50----------
also I also hear futility I also hear


---------107:53----------
hopelessness right that you had hope and


---------107:58----------
that hope was was smashed and I think


---------108:03----------
you carry this with you I think you


---------108:05----------
carry it with you today have you learned


---------108:07----------
how to suppress it absolutely but


---------108:10----------
there's just I mean you know I could see


---------108:14----------
the emotion in your face I'm sure


---------108:15----------
everyone who's watching could see the


---------108:16----------
emotion in your face I think we can see


---------108:19----------
the dejection and despair in your face


---------108:21----------
now and you just want to be free of it


---------108:25----------
you want to know whose fault it was I


---------108:27----------
don't think it was your fault I think


---------108:29----------
actually your conception of it was


---------108:30----------
pretty good I think sometimes women who


---------108:33----------
were hurt say things I think not just


---------108:36----------
women people who were hurt to say things


---------108:38----------
and I think that you know she someone


---------108:42----------
caught her at a time where she said some


---------108:44----------
stuff and then this HR person noticed


---------108:46----------
like this whole thing and so like like


---------108:50----------
the pieces of the puzzle start got put


---------108:52----------
together and it's not even that those


---------108:54----------
pieces of the puzzle it's not even the


---------108:56----------
likelihood that those pieces connect in


---------108:58----------
a certain way


---------108:59----------
the corporation doesn't care about what


---------109:02----------
happened they cared about how things


---------109:04----------
could look because that's how


---------109:06----------
corporations think right then don't


---------109:08----------
actually care about the truth they think


---------109:10----------
about you know can we get sued for this


---------109:12----------
could someone make an argument for


---------109:14----------
getting sued and the answer is


---------109:17----------
absolutely yes in their case and I think


---------109:19----------
they played their game which is that


---------109:22----------
they protect themselves and they don't


---------109:23----------
want to get sued and they'll railroad an


---------109:25----------
employer to in the process if they need


---------109:27----------
to I think if anyone is to blame it's


---------109:31----------
actually your boss and your company for


---------109:33----------
the way that they handled it I would


---------109:35----------
like to think so


---------109:37----------
I've never seen anything like it since


---------109:39----------
it seems absolutely bizarre yeah and and


---------109:42----------
I think the challenge here Paul is that


---------109:44----------
I think a piece of this lingers with you


---------109:46----------
and I think a piece of it swims around


---------109:48----------
in the back of your mind and changes the


---------109:52----------
way that you view relationships like not


---------109:56----------
in such a grain like I don't think it's


---------109:57----------
as simple as like that's the reason you


---------109:58----------
don't have a girlfriend now I think


---------109:59----------
these kinds of experiences happen all


---------110:01----------
the time but is it related though I


---------110:03----------
think so I think it's incredibly hurtful


---------110:06----------
was this was this was this whole


---------110:09----------
exposition setting the grounds for


---------110:13----------
becoming an NSL fifteen years later


---------110:15----------
mm-hmm


---------110:16----------
setting the grounds I don't think it's


---------110:18----------
quite as that tied together and cause


---------110:19----------
and effect but I think it could account


---------110:21----------
for 20% of it right when I think about


---------110:25----------
Ruth when I think about like the person


---------110:27----------
who would have walked out of that door I


---------110:29----------
can think about that person would have


---------110:31----------
difficulty engaging with other women and


---------110:33----------
that's not because you're an insole that


---------110:36----------
speak us the human brain is designed to


---------110:39----------
be pain averse so if we look at the


---------110:42----------
circuits of our brain that are the


---------110:44----------
strongest at learning they're very close


---------110:46----------
to pain so if you touch a hot stove once


---------110:50----------
it's very very hard to touch it again so


---------110:53----------
the biggest teacher that we have is pain


---------110:55----------
and this sounds like an incredibly


---------110:56----------
painful experience to you and you've


---------110:59----------
been [ __ ] avoiding it ever since and


---------111:01----------
I can't imagine what kind of other


---------111:03----------
things you've avoided in terms of


---------111:04----------
opportunities relationship stuff like


---------111:06----------
that because of your fear of getting


---------111:08----------
hurt


---------111:11----------
well it's not like I'm just slapping


---------111:14----------
them in the way left and right I can


---------111:16----------
tell you that yeah and I think that's


---------111:19----------
that's exactly what you want I think


---------111:21----------
that you you try to create situations


---------111:23----------
where you don't want you don't want to


---------111:25----------
risk having to slap a woman away and you


---------111:28----------
don't want to risk having a woman like


---------111:30----------
in engage in a relationship with you


---------111:33----------
that could fall apart or end like this


---------111:35----------
again


---------111:35----------
so is that true it was definitely true


---------111:38----------
closer to the time I don't even know


---------111:39----------
where I sit with it now yeah so like I'm


---------111:41----------
trying to get back in there despite


---------111:44----------
everything that's happened and yet


---------111:45----------
somehow it doesn't so so I think I think


---------111:48----------
last time our pearl was that


---------111:50----------
hopelessness is a protective mechanism


---------111:52----------
and I think hopelessness is the defense


---------111:56----------
against something like this because if


---------112:01----------
there's no possibility of a relationship


---------112:03----------
there's no rodeo that you just went


---------112:05----------
through yeah but but you're making it


---------112:09----------
sound like again like I'm just turning


---------112:12----------
away opportunities though I mean oh but


---------112:14----------
actually don't come anymore yeah I don't


---------112:18----------
I don't mean to say that you're turning


---------112:19----------
away opportunities what I mean to say is


---------112:22----------
that I find it hard to believe that this


---------112:28----------
could not have influenced the next five


---------112:31----------
years which in turn oh it definitely did


---------112:33----------
yeah definitely which in the turn is


---------112:35----------
going to have its own impact on the five


---------112:37----------
years after that which in turn is going


---------112:39----------
to have its own impact on the five years


---------112:41----------
after that but how is it in fact if it


---------112:43----------
affected me today I don't know well so


---------112:45----------
what I see is a lot of suppressed


---------112:47----------
emotion and my my experience as a


---------112:50----------
clinician is that when there's


---------112:52----------
suppressed emotion that emotion leaks


---------112:54----------
and it affects people in unexpected ways


---------112:59----------
and that most of the time they're not


---------113:02----------
aware of it but if it's leaking you


---------113:04----------
should be able to see it right yeah so I


---------113:07----------
think your hopelessness is a sign of the


---------113:10----------
leaking because that hopelessness is a


---------113:12----------
protective mechanism comes from


---------113:13----------
somewhere right and I think it's


---------113:17----------
reinforced by all kinds of other logical


---------113:19----------
things like the fact that you've tried


---------113:21----------
to date people over and over and over


---------113:22----------
again and it hasn't worked


---------113:26----------
but I do think so let me put it this way


---------113:29----------
Paul how does it affect you today I


---------113:31----------
think you still carry the burden and I


---------113:34----------
think it's hard to feel free when you


---------113:37----------
carry that burden and I think it's hard


---------113:40----------
to fully engage in a relationship when


---------113:43----------
you carry a burden and that the purest


---------113:45----------
and happiest relationships happen with


---------113:48----------
people who feel unburdened or share


---------113:50----------
those burdens it weighs on you so how do


---------113:56----------
I take it off I mean I guess it helps to


---------114:00----------
know that you don't think it I mean I


---------114:03----------
think Norman tells me that you don't


---------114:05----------
have to you still are guilty but you


---------114:07----------
started to take it off by expressing


---------114:09----------
some of these emotions so you've opened


---------114:10----------
up that bottle and you're venting some


---------114:12----------
of that emotion and so the weight of it


---------114:15----------
becomes less I think it's not the first


---------114:18----------
time I've told this story though but I'd


---------114:20----------
never really makes me feel better cuz


---------114:21----------
the person I tell it to never gives me


---------114:25----------
closure either you're the first person


---------114:27----------
to say that I don't have to feel guilty


---------114:29----------
about it yeah I don't I don't think you


---------114:31----------
need to and I think I think it's the


---------114:34----------
difference I think I well let me let me


---------114:36----------
clarify okay Paul I think that it's fine


---------114:41----------
to feel guilty I think you have you have


---------114:45----------
put in the time that you need to with


---------114:47----------
that guilt and I think it's time to let


---------114:49----------
that guilt go okay can I just do that


---------114:55----------
yeah just like I mean it's hard but just


---------114:58----------
let it go I mean I I think I think you


---------115:01----------
you tell yourself at this point of your


---------115:03----------
life that like you know chances are you


---------115:05----------
didn't [ __ ] up as I mean I don't think


---------115:06----------
you [ __ ] up that bad I think really


---------115:08----------
the only thing that you did was push her


---------115:10----------
in a way that was immature which i think


---------115:12----------
is forgivable and I think that if you


---------115:16----------
felt guilty so be it because maybe you


---------115:18----------
did something wrong but then you also


---------115:20----------
have to forgive yourself like the way


---------115:22----------
that you let guilt go is by forgiving


---------115:24----------
yourself and and you kind of think a


---------115:27----------
little bit about the person that you


---------115:28----------
were and you think about how experienced


---------115:30----------
in experience you were and you think


---------115:31----------
about you know this is your first job


---------115:33----------
out of college and you had been to an


---------115:35----------
all-boys school and you


---------115:37----------
and had a lot of experience with women


---------115:38----------
and so you're bound to make mistakes and


---------115:41----------
then you kind of you know it does feel a


---------115:44----------
little bit hollow to have someone else


---------115:46----------
that you know yeah you know what I just


---------115:47----------
realized and I don't know maybe you're


---------115:49----------
gonna like do a Freudian clap or


---------115:52----------
something but like [ __ ] I probably


---------115:53----------
never gonna be like satisfied unless


---------115:55----------
sheathing is me right and that that can


---------115:57----------
never happen


---------115:59----------
yep


---------116:14----------
I think what you've been looking for is


---------116:16----------
forgiveness from her what you're really


---------116:22----------
looking for is closure from her because


---------116:25----------
I think it's incredibly painful to have


---------116:27----------
a relationship like that and then like


---------116:29----------
not like get taken down to the second


---------116:31----------
floor with some guy from London drives


---------116:33----------
up two hours to see you and you never


---------116:34----------
get a chance to see her yeah I mean I


---------116:38----------
can't even I can't even say I'm I'm


---------116:40----------
sorry it doesn't like it's just you just


---------116:42----------
go and of course they're not gonna give


---------116:44----------
you that opportunity because they think


---------116:45----------
you're [ __ ] crazy


---------116:47----------
but putting that aside she put didn't


---------116:50----------
want to anyway it's just that it just


---------116:51----------
sucks you can't just have it you can't


---------116:53----------
just you kind of reconcile your


---------117:00----------
differences and didn't say goodbye you


---------117:03----------
know it sounds stupid but like why does


---------117:04----------
it even matter especially now like after


---------117:06----------
all this time but don't invalidate your


---------117:09----------
feelings it does suck


---------117:20----------
right so there is there is sorrow and


---------117:22----------
sadness and unfairness in the world and


---------117:25----------
we can't there are some things that we


---------117:27----------
can't fix and and that's unfortunately


---------117:34----------
that the way the world is and just


---------117:39----------
because the world is that way I think it


---------117:40----------
it we carry that burden for a time and


---------117:42----------
then it's time to let it go you need to


---------117:45----------
forgive yourself all you need to cut


---------117:49----------
yourself some slack and also let


---------117:55----------
yourself hope again that something very


---------118:01----------
bad happened to you and it is unfair you


---------118:03----------
didn't get closure and the last thing


---------118:07----------
that you need to have is compassion


---------118:09----------
towards yourself for the circumstances


---------118:11----------
that you've been given even if you can't


---------118:15----------
get forgiveness from from her I'm not


---------118:17----------
sure that you get compassion from


---------118:18----------
yourself


---------118:22----------
you were what in your 20s at that time


---------118:27----------
so they're in the early 20s


---------118:29----------
yeah so like what you need is compassion


---------118:32----------
from 35 year old Paul towards early 20s


---------118:35----------
fall you're older you're wiser and go


---------118:42----------
back and tell that dude that it's not


---------118:43----------
his fault


---------118:44----------
he did the best that he could and now


---------118:47----------
it's time to pick yourself up them up


---------118:49----------
off the mat and give yourself a shot


---------118:54----------
again there you go good


---------119:36----------
Sony's quite hard to breathe let it out


---------119:56----------
just wanted to come out for a long time


---------119:59----------
you've been holding it for a long time


---------120:01----------
so just let it out man it's almost like


---------121:04----------
I'm back in the [ __ ] room again


---------121:07----------
absent arrogation room this is the some


---------121:11----------
scar you know some scars yeah it is I


---------121:15----------
wouldn't know when I first read you


---------121:17----------
explain to reckful what some scar was


---------121:24----------
and I was on the other side of the


---------121:26----------
screen I immediately realized that that


---------121:29----------
was the perfect term to describe exactly


---------121:31----------
this and now you know what it is


---------121:35----------
for me too


---------121:38----------
I laughed at the start though because


---------121:48----------
you said something like yeah 35 grope


---------121:52----------
but we'll go back and figure I actually


---------121:54----------
thought about what I would actually say


---------121:58----------
what would you say well I don't know I


---------122:06----------
would probably it it's in my nature to


---------122:10----------
be a bit of a troll okay like I've been


---------122:17----------
I've been trolling since before the term


---------122:19----------
was even coined like it wasn't even


---------122:21----------
called anything before so you're the


---------122:24----------
oats the OG the OT okay [ __ ] yeah I'm


---------122:31----------
the oats


---------122:32----------
so I part of me would like be like so so


---------122:36----------
the thing is like so I wanted to break


---------122:38----------
it off right well I would probably like


---------122:40----------
troll myself a little bit and say well


---------122:42----------
like no don't do that like go and kick


---------122:45----------
this other guy's ass or something I like


---------122:47----------
but also not so the reason I laughed is


---------122:50----------
because it was a conflict I didn't


---------122:53----------
actually laugh at that laughter the fact


---------122:55----------
that actually that I realized that


---------122:56----------
actually this girl isn't even that


---------122:57----------
[ __ ] good anyway but she was no she


---------123:00----------
was probably no good for me like it was


---------123:02----------
it was it was fine it was fun when we


---------123:05----------
were young but like like touching the


---------123:10----------
beef like she's a [ __ ] nut job anyway


---------123:13----------
like she like I told you she was crying


---------123:14----------
that that's well I don't even know what


---------123:16----------
the [ __ ] about that just like random


---------123:17----------
stuff from what I heard I didn't know


---------123:19----------
her that well to even know what it was


---------123:21----------
but but she had some problems whatever


---------123:23----------
the [ __ ] they were it was I'm sure she


---------123:27----------
doing fine now


---------123:28----------
it's mr. hopes over like I know if she


---------123:33----------
was really that good for me anyway


---------123:34----------
so I would probably be like no just get


---------123:36----------
the [ __ ] out of there so it's kind of


---------123:39----------
weird to be even hung up about it at all


---------123:43----------
now


---------123:46----------
but I definitely was so two things


---------123:51----------
follow man we're probably gonna have to


---------123:53----------
wrap up I'll give you the last word the


---------123:54----------
first is last time we talked about


---------123:59----------
laughing in its face remember that yeah


---------124:04----------
so I'd say if you can learn how to laugh


---------124:07----------
in its face so be it sometimes humor is


---------124:11----------
all we have left when the world becomes


---------124:13----------
a terrible terrible place and medical


---------124:16----------
humor is some of the most morbid humor


---------124:18----------
that you can get because we deal with a


---------124:20----------
lot of terrible things and so there's a


---------124:24----------
part of me that says that when we're


---------124:25----------
talking about authenticity and all that


---------124:27----------
other [ __ ] that we were talking about


---------124:29----------
for the first half hour 45 minutes I


---------124:30----------
think I think Paul if you want to find a


---------124:35----------
good relationship it needs to be you


---------124:38----------
with a colored shirt who also shows your


---------124:42----------
inner troll just a little bit and it's


---------124:45----------
gonna be the girl who can appreciate


---------124:46----------
that it was gonna be the right one for


---------124:48----------
you and I think instead of trying to be


---------124:54----------
what they want you to be be that person


---------124:57----------
the last thing I know you can disagree


---------125:01----------
with that or they're all kinds of no I


---------125:02----------
thought I disagree it's just it's like


---------125:04----------
not really practical well so like so so


---------125:08----------
what women are in my life right now was


---------125:10----------
the colleagues at work who were just


---------125:12----------
colleagues at work and this is speed


---------125:13----------
dates and you can really I mean it's


---------125:16----------
pretty hard to engineer like a natural


---------125:17----------
controlling situation informal yeah but


---------125:20----------
I mean so that what I'm saying is like


---------125:22----------
you know when you if it feels right and


---------125:24----------
it feels natural then do it and if it


---------125:26----------
doesn't you can't force it right that's


---------125:27----------
the forcible smile I'm just saying that


---------125:30----------
when it comes to the authentic you let


---------125:33----------
you know that's a part of it and then


---------125:36----------
the last thing is you keep on asking


---------125:37----------
what do I do about it and it's kind of


---------125:39----------
silly that I've been holding on to it


---------125:40----------
you do whatever you just did because


---------125:42----------
whatever you just did is exactly what


---------125:43----------
you need to do right you've been holding


---------125:46----------
on to this for such a long time and when


---------125:48----------
you think about thirty five-year-old


---------125:49----------
you're going back and it's kind of like


---------125:51----------
saying hey man just let it go man she's


---------125:52----------
not even like she's not worth holding


---------125:54----------
onto that hurt for and something about


---------125:57----------
that alchemical process is


---------126:00----------
how you get unburdened and how you move


---------126:02----------
forward mm-hmm I almost feel like I'm


---------126:09----------
already over it I don't know if I


---------126:10----------
actually am because there's a little bit


---------126:12----------
too much in one go - probably process


---------126:16----------
like that but yep so it's how it works


---------126:20----------
so I think I think the reason that you


---------126:22----------
so my experience has been that some


---------126:24----------
scars are like dominoes so one injury


---------126:27----------
get baguettes another injury baguettes


---------126:29----------
another injury and they kind of build up


---------126:31----------
but then also once you knock the first


---------126:33----------
one down something has fundamentally


---------126:35----------
changed but I still don't know that I'm


---------126:38----------
like over the second one there's more


---------126:43----------
work to be done


---------126:44----------
maybe maybe no but it's good that you're


---------126:48----------
able to laugh and also that you're able


---------126:50----------
to notice that you're not over the


---------126:51----------
second I would trust your instinct in


---------126:53----------
that moment that you're over something


---------126:56----------
here but there's more work to be done


---------126:57----------
and that's also how it works man any


---------127:04----------
thoughts or questions before we wrap up


---------127:06----------
so that's the folks are crying every


---------127:09----------
stream then hopefully not but you know I


---------127:18----------
I wouldn't I don't really care about no


---------127:22----------
crying but I do care about you facing


---------127:26----------
the things that you need to face and


---------127:28----------
growing past them and it just so happens


---------127:31----------
that most of the things most of the


---------127:33----------
growth that people need to do has


---------127:34----------
involves like- some scars like if you


---------127:37----------
come on and you're an insult like I


---------127:38----------
think there may be tears somewhere in


---------127:40----------
there right you know how do you feel


---------127:47----------
physically


---------127:48----------
[Music]


---------127:52----------
all right just know I'm all right hmm


---------127:58----------
impressive it's the master of


---------128:04----------
suppressing emotions young


---------128:08----------
there's the Ooty no that's for real


---------128:12----------
I think okay I thought it was funny I


---------128:15----------
mean it's probably true too but also


---------128:18----------
funny obviously my emotions would not


---------128:25----------
suppress a moment ago but like you you


---------128:27----------
also learned quick recovery I guess I


---------128:29----------
don't know morphing yeah


---------128:31----------
but also I see I was kind of trying to


---------128:33----------
suppress him in the moment it's just a


---------128:35----------
bit embarrassing I guess but maybe if we


---------128:42----------
were just in a room you and me and it


---------128:43----------
wasn't like a small fraction of the


---------128:46----------
internet watching as well and then I


---------128:47----------
would feel I just [ __ ] go for it hit


---------128:51----------
the wall I don't know Billy and I don't


---------128:52----------
really want to do that


---------128:53----------
I'm cameras I think you did that anyway


---------128:55----------
I don't I don't think I I don't think no


---------128:59----------
I was really trying to I was really


---------129:00----------
trying to stop myself yeah people do


---------129:02----------
that when I mean so what would happen in


---------129:06----------
different circumstances I think is


---------129:08----------
irrelevant so Paul I think I think we


---------129:10----------
did a good job today


---------129:11----------
