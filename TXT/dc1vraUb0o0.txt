---------00:00----------
which is really what you should


---------00:02----------
acknowledge is that sometimes just bad


---------00:04----------
[ __ ] happens and you don't deserve it


---------00:07----------
but your inability to like experience


---------00:09----------
that means that you've got this weird


---------00:11----------
like you're like a septic tank that's


---------00:13----------
just full and like never drains because


---------00:17----------
like bad [ __ ] happens to you and happens


---------00:19----------
to you and happens to you and no one and


---------00:21----------
you just blame yourself and so like no


---------00:23----------
like the blame just sits within you


---------00:25----------
you're like just just the cesspool of


---------00:27----------
you know stuff


---------00:36----------
so welcome and what am I welcome LS is


---------00:40----------
that what we're calling you yeah okay


---------00:42----------
yeah I guess okay and everyone is trying


---------00:45----------
to confuse me what is trying to tell me


---------00:48----------
I don't know what that means is that


---------00:49----------
short for something so it meant last


---------00:53----------
shadow up until 2012 but the reason that


---------00:56----------
everyone means it is


---------00:58----------
I don't know they've changed the Ellen


---------01:00----------
the s2 whatever is needed to fit I mean


---------01:02----------
got it nice so it's a very dynamic yeah


---------01:07----------
yeah so if I dr k is dr k or dr.


---------01:12----------
kangaroo or the democratic republic of


---------01:14----------
korea yeah exactly exactly


---------01:16----------
okay okay so tell me um tell me a little


---------01:20----------
bit about what we're talking about today


---------01:23----------
and how so yeah so initially I didn't


---------01:29----------
want to come on the stream but then more


---------01:31----------
and more requests and I just figured


---------01:32----------
I've talked about my life story a few


---------01:35----------
times on stream in the past and so I


---------01:38----------
figured it would be no different than


---------01:40----------
just talking about it with you and so I


---------01:43----------
guess we'll just talk about that um I


---------01:46----------
went through III I had tweeted out jump


---------01:51----------
in for a second yeah God so why can you


---------01:56----------
help me understand the feelings of not


---------01:58----------
wanting to come on stream because those


---------01:59----------
are like very reasonable feelings I'm


---------02:01----------
sure so okay so every single time I've


---------02:09----------
talked about the life short story I've


---------02:10----------
always downloaded the bottom then


---------02:12----------
deleted it and the the reason being is


---------02:16----------
because I didn't want anyone to twist


---------02:19----------
anything but I would say and then if


---------02:20----------
anyone ever attempted to I had the bog


---------02:22----------
downloaded in case someone tried saying


---------02:25----------
that I said something I didn't but also


---------02:28----------
it was always something that I just did


---------02:30----------
to try to help people relate or try to


---------02:32----------
help people understand that depression


---------02:35----------
is a really weird thing and that anxiety


---------02:39----------
is a demon as well and that there's ways


---------02:43----------
to


---------02:46----------
get through it alright see I don't know


---------02:49----------
how to like word this basically III


---------02:52----------
struggle every single day ever every


---------02:55----------
single day is a complete nightmare and


---------02:58----------
yet I'm here and I've been dealing with


---------03:00----------
this now for the last 17 years of my


---------03:03----------
life though yeah pretty pretty much that


---------03:08----------
I don't want to have this stuff that I


---------03:11----------
talk about used against me and it has


---------03:13----------
been in this industry specifically


---------03:16----------
several times even even within the last


---------03:19----------
couple of years I've had my diagnosis


---------03:23----------
actually brought up in reference to my


---------03:26----------
stability or my ability to do certain


---------03:28----------
things and that always has just struck


---------03:30----------
me as odd because it's clearly never


---------03:32----------
impeded me up to this point and then I


---------03:35----------
never intend to let it do as such so


---------03:39----------
that's impressive that you know you've


---------03:43----------
done such a good job with these


---------03:46----------
diagnoses and also really sucks that


---------03:50----------
people have used that against you like


---------03:51----------
very just like discreetly like


---------03:53----------
explicitly used it against you yeah but


---------03:57----------
I think it's I think it's standard I I


---------03:59----------
think mental illness is just taboo and


---------04:01----------
then especially out here in Korea mental


---------04:03----------
illness is really really taboo I can


---------04:06----------
imagine so it's that compact yeah that


---------04:08----------
compounded with a lot of things is


---------04:10----------
definitely interesting you know


---------04:12----------
interesting thing about mental illness


---------04:14----------
in Korea and taboo apparently what's not


---------04:16----------
taboo there is video game addiction or


---------04:18----------
at least not as taboo as it is here in


---------04:20----------
the sense that I've heard that they're


---------04:22----------
actually like brick and mortar buildings


---------04:25----------
that treat video game addiction like


---------04:27----------
they're they have like video game


---------04:28----------
addiction clinics in South Korea


---------04:32----------
right okay I don't I don't know about


---------04:34----------
that I don't have video game Academy is


---------04:36----------
the best school the best research about


---------04:40----------
so okay we got a level 4 hype train ok I


---------04:45----------
don't know what that means I still don't


---------04:46----------
understand the stuff but so so the best


---------04:49----------
research on video game addiction


---------04:50----------
actually comes out of Korea and that's


---------04:52----------
because they treat it the most seriously


---------04:53----------
and they've been treating him for a


---------04:55----------
while but okay so I'm sorry that people


---------04:58----------
have used it against you I really hope


---------05:00----------
that that doesn't happen here and I'm


---------05:02----------
really grateful that you're coming on


---------05:04----------
and actually the mission that you've


---------05:05----------
been adopting which is sort of like


---------05:06----------
showing people that you can struggle


---------05:09----------
with depression or anxiety or whatnot


---------05:10----------
and still have you know hopefully a


---------05:13----------
healthy I'm clear to me if you're happy


---------05:15----------
but I wouldn't call it a fake no yeah so


---------05:20----------
that is unfortunate let's see if we can


---------05:23----------
do something about that


---------05:24----------
okay I I to think that you know mental


---------05:27----------
illness is stigmatized and a lot of what


---------05:30----------
I do here is is to D stigmatize it and I


---------05:32----------
guess it's good that a lot of people who


---------05:33----------
after watching the stream or giving


---------05:35----------
therapy a shot which i think is


---------05:36----------
fantastic just any clear though you know


---------05:40----------
this is not therapy and you understand


---------05:41----------
that right yeah okay so tell me a little


---------05:44----------
bit about what what you mean by


---------05:46----------
depression or anxiety


---------05:51----------
I guess my depression is nothing nothing


---------05:58----------
really matters to me it's it's like a


---------06:02----------
it's like a form of summit syndrome what


---------06:05----------
does that mean I remember summit


---------06:07----------
syndrome being that every single time


---------06:09----------
you hit what you set as the highest goal


---------06:12----------
it's not enough there's just an


---------06:14----------
emptiness there's a void there's nothing


---------06:18----------
that satisfactory I remember because I


---------06:22----------
was actually homeless twice even in


---------06:25----------
Korea and I remember one time in 2013 I


---------06:30----------
was I was living in Busan with my


---------06:33----------
boyfriend at the time and I only had a


---------06:36----------
couple hundred dollars to my name and I


---------06:38----------
remember thinking that I was supposed to


---------06:41----------
potentially get a job casting


---------06:45----------
potentially for StarCraft actually and


---------06:49----------
if I got that I had envisioned like you


---------06:54----------
know I would be making more money and I


---------06:57----------
thought that that money would be like


---------06:59----------
very glorious or very enjoyable and


---------07:04----------
about a year and a half later in


---------07:07----------
entirely different circumstances I ended


---------07:09----------
up having that amount of income and more


---------07:11----------
and I just felt empty and it wasn't


---------07:14----------
enough and then I look back on it and


---------07:16----------
I'm like but I I'm somewhere now where I


---------07:19----------
dreamed of being before and then I had


---------07:22----------
another milestone and it didn't do


---------07:25----------
anything and then I had another


---------07:26----------
milestone and it did nothing and nothing


---------07:30----------
would really I mean still nothing really


---------07:32----------
brings me happiness it brings me to


---------07:35----------
neutrality and the neutrality is a


---------07:38----------
calmness it's like someone's sitting on


---------07:40----------
you and when they eventually get up it


---------07:42----------
just feels like a lot of relief


---------07:44----------
I have glimpses of that very rarely


---------07:48----------
nowadays but I would I would probably


---------07:53----------
say that's what my happiness is because


---------07:55----------
it feels like there's no wait there's no


---------07:57----------
pressure


---------07:57----------
there's no


---------08:00----------
noise III refer to as noise when all the


---------08:03----------
images just keep raising peaceful


---------08:06----------
no not peaceful okay just feels like I


---------08:09----------
can breathe or it feels like I can I can


---------08:12----------
hear my own thoughts without the images


---------08:15----------
racing in my mind's and I can


---------08:18----------
I don't feel the tension all across my


---------08:21----------
body


---------08:22----------
I don't feel the sensation of like did


---------08:26----------
you drop your wallet in your back pocket


---------08:27----------
you know and did you just forget it on a


---------08:30----------
train or something you just have someone


---------08:32----------
steal something from you I feel that


---------08:34----------
never ending all the time and some


---------08:38----------
mornings it's really hard to obviously


---------08:39----------
get out of bed and other mornings or


---------08:42----------
nights or something I just don't want to


---------08:43----------
do anything sometimes in front of the


---------08:45----------
stream I'll sit there with the stream


---------08:46----------
labs open for 30 minutes 45 minutes and


---------08:48----------
I just can't hit play and people don't


---------08:51----------
realize it but anytime there's a


---------08:53----------
necessity to do something fear always


---------08:56----------
motivates me and so I would say that


---------08:59----------
fear is my number one motivator in my


---------09:03----------
entire life fear of ever going back to


---------09:05----------
what I was at before and obviously the


---------09:07----------
poverty the homelessness


---------09:09----------
Travie lack of security the pre Korea so


---------09:17----------
I don't think look so do you think fear


---------09:22----------
in your life is a good thing or a bad


---------09:23----------
thing


---------09:24----------
I guess kept me alive


---------09:28----------
so III III would it's weird to say that


---------09:33----------
obviously it's it's not good that this


---------09:37----------
is what's necessary to keep me walking


---------09:40----------
or something but there's nothing else


---------09:45----------
yes I'll ask you again is is fear in


---------09:48----------
your life a good thing or a bad thing I


---------09:51----------
realize I'm oversimplifying the question


---------09:53----------
but I'm doing it no I know I identify


---------09:57----------
that inherently it's bad but as it


---------10:00----------
stands right now it's good it's very


---------10:02----------
good so it's important for you to


---------10:04----------
understand that right so I wouldn't even


---------10:06----------
say inherently it's bad I'd say


---------10:08----------
theoretically it's bad is that a better


---------10:10----------
way to throat it yeah right so like


---------10:13----------
we've heard that fear is bad and to live


---------10:17----------
a life based on fear as your primary


---------10:19----------
emotion sounds like it sucks but for you


---------10:22----------
it's actually very very important yeah


---------10:26----------
and so the dangerous thing here is that


---------10:28----------
you're living a life where there's


---------10:31----------
probably a very large part of you that


---------10:33----------
doesn't want the fear to leave


---------10:36----------
yeah but III don't chase it though I


---------10:40----------
don't put myself in circumstances where


---------10:42----------
I would feel more fair than I would have


---------10:44----------
to yeah I don't seek it I I never want


---------10:48----------
to induce more fear yes but I do notice


---------10:53----------
that if I if I tend to get lazy or if I


---------10:56----------
tend to get complacent for too long yet


---------11:00----------
it enhances a lot and then I go into


---------11:03----------
overdrive and then the cycle begins so I


---------11:06----------
think this is yeah go ahead sorry keep


---------11:08----------
going oh sorry


---------11:09----------
oh my monitors just went out because no


---------11:12----------
mouse activity sorry okay go ahead no


---------11:14----------
you were saying something


---------11:15----------
no it tends to operate and in cycles and


---------11:20----------
I have identified that it's in cycles


---------11:22----------
and I've in recent years tried to become


---------11:28----------
more cognizant of the cycles and habits


---------11:30----------
and patterns that exist and I've tried


---------11:32----------
to manage them time them identify


---------11:37----------
triggers all this other stuff and


---------11:40----------
obviously compounding off all the stuff


---------11:42----------
that I've learned from all the years of


---------11:44----------
therapy all the clinicians all the


---------11:46----------
psychologists psychiatrists everything


---------11:47----------
I've ever read and it's all just about


---------11:51----------
managing it and trying to identify it


---------11:53----------
but it honestly it feels really [ __ ]


---------11:55----------
hopeless and again there's no purpose


---------11:59----------
but


---------12:01----------
uh I don't know how I would phrase this


---------12:03----------
I must do what I'm doing now


---------12:07----------
in case there is eventually a purpose


---------12:10----------
yeah absolutely that's that I don't have


---------12:14----------
a choice yeah I mean what are you


---------12:17----------
feeling right now


---------12:19----------
I just don't have a choice everything I


---------12:22----------
do I don't have a choice how does I mean


---------12:24----------
I have I have a choice in regards to do


---------12:28----------
I want to string today do I not want to


---------12:30----------
string today I have a choice of do I


---------12:32----------
want to sign this contract do I not want


---------12:34----------
to sign this contract but the fear


---------12:37----------
ultimately decides through whatever type


---------12:42----------
of rationale used what is most optimal


---------12:45----------
or what is what is most logical in order


---------12:48----------
to further separate me from what is


---------12:51----------
causing the fear and so then I always


---------12:54----------
just keep what is it like


---------12:58----------
I don't know but I'm thankful that I


---------13:01----------
didn't have a choice because I think if


---------13:03----------
I had choices I wouldn't have ended up


---------13:05----------
here or maybe it maybe I would have


---------13:08----------
because of the the thing I mentioned to


---------13:10----------
you prior to coming on the stream in


---------13:11----------
regards to one of my last psychiatrists


---------13:15----------
gave me the choice to go on disability


---------13:16----------
insurance and I didn't want to what do


---------13:19----------
you mean by that if you had a choice you


---------13:21----------
wouldn't be here what does that mean if


---------13:26----------
I could if there was alternative ways


---------13:31----------
for me to have just functioned without


---------13:34----------
being thrown by the wayside because I


---------13:36----------
was facing homelessness in the United


---------13:38----------
States and I didn't have really any way


---------13:41----------
to return to so what was the option end


---------13:44----------
up on the streets or end up doing


---------13:48----------
god-knows-what I I don't really know can


---------13:51----------
you hold on a second yeah yeah just


---------13:54----------
problem I'm gonna just think for a


---------14:08----------
second mm-hmm sorry I didn't mean to


---------14:13----------
disrupt your flow but no that's okay


---------14:19----------
there's a lot that you're saying that I


---------14:21----------
think is very important the thing is


---------14:23----------
it's coming out at such a pace that I'm


---------14:25----------
feeling hard it's it's hard for me to


---------14:27----------
keep track of some of the things you're


---------14:28----------
saying sorry I looked at Twitter shot


---------14:34----------
they're very funny


---------14:36----------
I won't I'll keep chat yeah a PM is way


---------14:39----------
too high it's like a manner pause when


---------14:42----------
I'm getting xored rushed yeah five pull


---------14:48----------
LSS five pulled me oh five blast birdboy


---------14:51----------
yeah man


---------14:53----------
old school that is that's boomer


---------14:55----------
technology that is five full I pledge no


---------14:58----------
cool yeah there you go


---------15:17----------
okay can you tell me what your


---------15:20----------
experience was like with with treaters


---------15:24----------
treaters like clinicians inside I


---------15:28----------
remember the first one I was ever that I


---------15:31----------
ever went to my mom told me that I had


---------15:33----------
to go see someone


---------15:34----------
and I didn't know why was and when mom


---------15:38----------
said you had to go see someone


---------15:40----------
so I I had a lot of doctors growing up


---------15:42----------
because I was always really sick I had


---------15:45----------
three nebulizer treatments a day I had


---------15:48----------
an allergen allergen an asthma doctor


---------15:50----------
that I would see a couple of times a


---------15:52----------
week I was on benadryl twice a day or as


---------15:57----------
needed albuterol as needed I was always


---------16:01----------
really sick and so I had my usual


---------16:04----------
stalkers and then my mom told me that I


---------16:06----------
had to go see another doctor and I


---------16:08----------
didn't know why and I arrived at this


---------16:12----------
doctor's office and I started talking to


---------16:14----------
him and he just told me that there was a


---------16:16----------
lot of weird stuff with me like socially


---------16:19----------
and apparently it's because I didn't get


---------16:23----------
along with my little league teammates or


---------16:28----------
something because my mom had signed me


---------16:30----------
up for baseball and I didn't get along


---------16:32----------
with them and I didn't socialize with


---------16:36----------
them I wouldn't talk to them and


---------16:37----------
whatever and she found the behavior very


---------16:39----------
avoidin or very antisocial and she


---------16:43----------
thought that it was very alarming


---------16:44----------
because my mom is in psychiatry as well


---------16:47----------
and so then she had sent me to a doctor


---------16:51----------
for you know she's identifying the signs


---------16:55----------
or patterns or whatever so that that's


---------17:02----------
what uh that's what was going on there I


---------17:04----------
got to him and he was telling me that


---------17:06----------
there was concerning behaviors and I I


---------17:10----------
didn't know what the hell he was talking


---------17:10----------
about the reality in my eyes what it was


---------17:14----------
is


---------17:15----------
my uncle's had started me on everything


---------17:18----------
way earlier than my peers and so what I


---------17:22----------
mean by that is like age four or five


---------17:25----------
they were teaching me like math or stuff


---------17:30----------
about like riddles or puzzles and stuff


---------17:32----------
way before you know first grade second


---------17:35----------
grade third graders is supposed to know


---------17:36----------
about this stuff but also anything that


---------17:40----------
I did with sports my uncle's would drill


---------17:43----------
me on quite literally so Wells you


---------17:45----------
question II would be yeah I got do you


---------17:49----------
get to be who you are uh no well it


---------17:57----------
depends what you mean everyone that ever


---------18:01----------
meets me offline says I'm I'm always


---------18:03----------
different than what they believe me to


---------18:05----------
be from my stream persona or that


---------18:08----------
there's a lot of different modes of me


---------18:09----------
and I would agree well I wouldn't agree


---------18:13----------
I I would agree that there's different


---------18:14----------
modes depending on what people around me


---------18:20----------
are doing and what that means in terms


---------18:24----------
of yeah believe so


---------18:32----------
can you tell me about that person um I


---------18:40----------
know I know I'm very bitter and I know


---------18:43----------
I'm very angry at time lost and I


---------18:49----------
displaced blame a lot on other things


---------18:53----------
that I felt like was outside of my


---------18:55----------
control or that was unjust and I've


---------19:00----------
tried to find ways to forgive it


---------19:04----------
or let it go if that makes sense


---------19:10----------
but then wait I care about you displace


---------19:14----------
blame on things that are outside of your


---------19:16----------
control


---------19:20----------
yeah like I was between placing blame on


---------19:25----------
things that are outside of your control


---------19:26----------
in displacing things that are outside of


---------19:28----------
your control like that there's there's


---------19:32----------
dual purpose in the sense that maybe


---------19:36----------
there was alternatives so there was


---------19:37----------
different options that I could have


---------19:39----------
taken that maybe I wasn't aware of at


---------19:40----------
the time and so maybe my belief that was


---------19:43----------
outside of my control isn't totally just


---------19:47----------
so you blame ourselves for things that


---------19:52----------
are outside of your control I ponder if


---------19:54----------
if it if I should blame myself


---------19:57----------
I I perceive it to be outside of my


---------20:01----------
control


---------20:01----------
but then when I go through and I do the


---------20:03----------
rodeo with myself from my younger years


---------20:06----------
or even current years I try to think was


---------20:10----------
it my fault so let me tell you what I'm


---------20:12----------
hearing okay yeah so I think you're a


---------20:16----------
smart guy and I think sometimes that


---------20:17----------
makes life hard because you're able to


---------20:19----------
think through things and understand


---------20:21----------
things but there's this is a subtle


---------20:23----------
subtle point and maybe I'm making a


---------20:24----------
mountain out of a molehill


---------20:25----------
you said you displace things you


---------20:28----------
displace blame on things that are


---------20:30----------
outside of your control so when I think


---------20:32----------
about displaced blame I think about


---------20:35----------
someone who's like not attributing blame


---------20:39----------
to where it belongs


---------20:40----------
right so if you displace blame onto me


---------20:44----------
for something that is your fault that is


---------20:47----------
like it's not really my fault it's


---------20:48----------
actually your fault and that you


---------20:51----------
displace that blame onto external things


---------20:55----------
that are outside of your control that


---------20:58----------
implies to me that you actually blame


---------21:02----------
yourself for things that outside of your


---------21:05----------
control yes because I I think that there


---------21:10----------
I know that sounds really weird but I


---------21:13----------
because of the rodeo that I've been


---------21:15----------
through I sort of do blame myself for


---------21:18----------
these things yes yeah


---------21:21----------
yeah okay but we're gonna put a pin in


---------21:25----------
that we're gonna come back to it okay


---------21:27----------
okay tell me about your uncle's my


---------21:31----------
uncle's got me into gaming really early


---------21:32----------
on started with Zelda Link to the Past


---------21:35----------
and Final Fantasy 3 when I was like two


---------21:38----------
and three years old and then three


---------21:42----------
shadow it's actually what my ID is from


---------21:45----------
flash shadow and so did you save an


---------21:52----------
absolutely yeah you know and it gotta


---------21:55----------
get gogo and amaru and all of them so


---------21:59----------
you know III love Final Fantasy 3 it's


---------22:02----------
best FF yeah okay all right so then


---------22:12----------
Tekken killer instincts


---------22:16----------
Saturday night slam masters combats my


---------22:22----------
uncles were really competitive at games


---------22:26----------
yeah their sister your sisters brothers


---------22:30----------
my mother yes sir others brothers yeah


---------22:35----------
my mother is 15 years nine months older


---------22:37----------
than me my uncle


---------22:40----------
one of my uncle's is 14 years older than


---------22:42----------
me and my other uncle is seven years


---------22:44----------
nine months older than me and so they


---------22:47----------
were sort of just like big brothers and


---------22:50----------
so they got me into gaming really early


---------22:55----------
on they got me into a lot of stuff


---------22:57----------
really early on they got me thinking


---------22:59----------
critically because my you know they


---------23:02----------
would do different stuff they used to


---------23:05----------
play like Mortal Kombat they would take


---------23:07----------
it really serious they travel or on to


---------23:09----------
arcades and stuff they would they would


---------23:13----------
write down combos they would write down


---------23:15----------
HP percentages you know were you it was


---------23:19----------
fun it was exciting I remember because


---------23:23----------
they used well sometimes they'd have


---------23:26----------
their high school friends come over and


---------23:27----------
they would have them play against me


---------23:29----------
like for fun and their friends would


---------23:31----------
think it's a joke or something and then


---------23:33----------
they would lose to a four-year-old yeah


---------23:35----------
so I I used to think it was so fun put


---------23:38----------
those noobs in their place exactly


---------23:41----------
so I'm gonna do man listen yeah if you


---------23:47----------
guys take nothing else away from the


---------23:49----------
stream you got to understand that your


---------23:51----------
mission of life is to put noobs in their


---------23:53----------
place you got to do no one else is gonna


---------23:56----------
do it unless you rise to the challenge


---------23:59----------
so that's that's how it started and then


---------24:02----------
there was a time attack mode and


---------24:04----------
punch-out and super punch-out on Super


---------24:08----------
Nintendo and then sometimes they do like


---------24:12----------
how fast they could complete Mario


---------24:13----------
levels and so I was always thinking like


---------24:15----------
about stuff like puzzles and speed okay


---------24:20----------
and then I had a very early headstart on


---------24:25----------
like math English everything I mean how


---------24:31----------
did you do you remember how you felt


---------24:33----------
during that time um I felt really good


---------24:38----------
to be included or not I felt really cool


---------24:42----------
to be hanging out with my uncles and I


---------24:44----------
felt really cool that I was getting to


---------24:45----------
learn stuff that my friends didn't but


---------24:47----------
then it also made me feel detached from


---------24:49----------
my friends okay did you like being


---------24:54----------
yourself I liked learning and I was


---------25:02----------
course I was actually bullied for it uh


---------25:05----------
well I was I was bullied a lot all my


---------25:08----------
life up until high school mostly because


---------25:11----------
I was a kid laughs again I was the sick


---------25:15----------
kid so I always went to the nurse's


---------25:16----------
office I had super super pale skin my


---------25:21----------
hair was like bleach blond white and so


---------25:23----------
I looked kind of like gross and my


---------25:27----------
clothes weren't like the best and stuff


---------25:29----------
so the fact that I was like very nerdy


---------25:31----------
and into games and like math and


---------25:33----------
learning stuff and reading books and it


---------25:37----------
wasn't very good and in kindergarten


---------25:40----------
elementary school junior high I'm gonna


---------25:44----------
ask questions that are just all over the


---------25:46----------
place so hey allergies so you said that


---------25:49----------
you had some problems with like


---------25:50----------
allergies and asthma and stuff like that


---------25:52----------
and you were taking AB you Lizer


---------25:54----------
treatments


---------25:56----------
are you still in treatment for like a


---------25:58----------
topic stuff like asthma or


---------26:02----------
so I actually have my ad bear behind me


---------26:06----------
I've had to use it more this year than I


---------26:08----------
have in the last ten which i think is


---------26:11----------
just sort of coincidence but I've


---------26:13----------
actually had to ask my attacks this year


---------26:15----------
which is pretty scary it's pretty weird


---------26:16----------
because I haven't I haven't struggled


---------26:18----------
with my asthma since I was a teenager


---------26:20----------
once puberty hit my asthma sort of just


---------26:23----------
went away but my my allergies was


---------26:28----------
because I had a dog growing up her name


---------26:30----------
was Sasha and after she passed for some


---------26:34----------
reason I was allergic to every cat and


---------26:36----------
every dog like really really really


---------26:38----------
about allergies I was allergic to dust


---------26:43----------
pollen grass everything um yeah I was


---------26:51----------
also tested I had to go to Mass General


---------26:53----------
because they tested me for cystic


---------26:55----------
fibrosis because my husband was so bad


---------26:57----------
yep makes sense


---------26:59----------
yeah give me a second I'm gonna think


---------27:04----------
you


---------27:09----------
you


---------27:17----------
you


---------27:24----------
I'm gonna need another minute okay


---------27:31----------
you


---------27:58----------
okay okay so I'm gonna ask you like a


---------28:09----------
couple of one-off questions and then I'm


---------28:11----------
gonna ask you stuff that's a little bit


---------28:12----------
more like well like you know you can


---------28:14----------
talk more


---------28:15----------
are you are you angry with yourself


---------28:18----------
Alice I mean yes I'm with myself and at


---------28:27----------
myself


---------28:28----------
how long have you is a with myself is


---------28:31----------
obviously an internal and then out


---------28:33----------
myself as external yeah how long have


---------28:35----------
you been feeling that way since I can


---------28:38----------
remember okay


---------28:39----------
I know kind of a random question right


---------28:44----------
no it makes sense why does it make sense


---------28:49----------
identifying internal self-worth as well


---------28:53----------
as external perception of oneself I mean


---------28:56----------
I have audio how I then how I view


---------29:03----------
myself from an external standpoint as


---------29:07----------
well as how do I feel internally about


---------29:10----------
maybe how I perceive myself so it's sort


---------29:13----------
of both ways like you can feel that your


---------29:16----------
outward appearance or how your


---------29:18----------
perception of you is or you can


---------29:21----------
acknowledge it as such and then


---------29:22----------
internally feel something totally


---------29:24----------
different but you I'm okay I still don't


---------29:28----------
understand it both yeah what is that


---------29:31----------
angry at both what are you angry at


---------29:34----------
um I'm angry my inability to obviously


---------29:41----------
solve this problem right oh that has


---------29:45----------
plagued me the entire time


---------29:47----------
and I'm angry at a lot of it who's a


---------29:49----------
problem well I I think that that's a


---------29:55----------
really loaded question right I I don't


---------29:56----------
know how to answer that


---------29:57----------
I I mean if it why is it a load of


---------30:01----------
defecation


---------30:03----------
[Music]


---------30:04----------
well it's no one's problem right but my


---------30:07----------
I mean it's it's no one thing or person


---------30:10----------
in particular it would be a it would be


---------30:12----------
a culmination of things potentially


---------30:16----------
right environment or whatever else or it


---------30:18----------
could be chemical imbalance I have no


---------30:20----------
idea it's so many things yeah


---------30:23----------
so it's hard for me pinpoint okay yeah


---------30:25----------
you're absolutely correct it could be a


---------30:27----------
lot of different things um okay so but


---------30:32----------
you're angry with yourself for not being


---------30:35----------
able to fix this thing yeah and despite


---------30:39----------
a lot of efforts despite a lot of


---------30:42----------
efforts right so what is that so it


---------30:47----------
ultimately feels like failure because


---------30:49----------
one of the things I strive to do and


---------30:52----------
anything that I do analytically or


---------30:55----------
creatively is try to identify problems


---------31:00----------
understand how they work how they


---------31:03----------
operate their foundation why they are


---------31:06----------
the way that they are and then try to


---------31:07----------
break them down like that but yeah


---------31:10----------
obviously with myself can't


---------31:14----------
so is it it when you say you can't


---------31:18----------
you're saying that you've tried and it


---------31:20----------
hasn't worked trying trying trying and


---------31:24----------
failing yeah okay


---------31:28----------
you are incredibly resilient yeah yeah I


---------31:33----------
guess yeah do you but it's sort of like


---------31:36----------
what I yeah I I'm cognizant of that but


---------31:42----------
again it goes back to the original thing


---------31:44----------
that we talked about earlier it's do in


---------31:50----------
case there is in the sense of there's no


---------31:54----------
purpose yet but in the event there is


---------31:56----------
one I must do now okay there's no time


---------32:01----------
for breaks can you can you tell me a


---------32:04----------
little bit about your experiences with


---------32:06----------
clinicians what's that what's that been


---------32:08----------
like there was only three of them that


---------32:12----------
were really good and the three of them


---------32:16----------
that were really good they were they


---------32:21----------
were all female if that matters because


---------32:26----------
maybe there's something about that


---------32:27----------
although I don't tend to have a


---------32:29----------
preference anymore I guess a male to


---------32:31----------
female but I remember when I was younger


---------32:32----------
female was my preference for people to


---------32:35----------
talk to and who I felt comfortable with


---------32:37----------
mm-hmm


---------32:39----------
one of them I had three different times


---------32:42----------
because of the health insurance program


---------32:44----------
allowed me to have them and because I


---------32:47----------
was double covered I could basically


---------32:49----------
have them for one block on one health


---------32:51----------
insurance card and then another block


---------32:53----------
and another health insurance card and


---------32:54----------
then I had them one more time per week


---------32:58----------
you need no no block I think a block was


---------33:01----------
six months okay these were like programs


---------33:05----------
and all three of these women crossed


---------33:10----------
lines and what I mean by cross lines is


---------33:14----------
I felt like they they went to bat for me


---------33:20----------
in ways that other therapists or


---------33:23----------
psychologists didn't and I know that


---------33:27----------
they definitely did things that I think


---------33:29----------
could have lost them their job and in


---------33:31----------
regards to things that they said to my


---------33:33----------
parents


---------33:36----------
in defense of me or even even my school


---------33:39----------
board one of them outright basically


---------33:47----------
made the direct statement that the the


---------33:48----------
the environment in my household was to


---------33:51----------
blame for everything that was going on


---------33:53----------
and that the constant deflection and


---------33:57----------
looking to constantly pull me and put me


---------33:59----------
in new doctors or clinicians in order to


---------34:03----------
get one that agreed with what they


---------34:06----------
thought was part of the problem and that


---------34:08----------
that was the toxicity in itself sounds I


---------34:13----------
remember the various I remember the the


---------34:17----------
last night the last psychiatrist that I


---------34:20----------
didn't go to I had an evaluation with


---------34:25----------
one of my parents just walked out on the


---------34:28----------
session a due to something that was said


---------34:33----------
which I don't want to go into I'm sure I


---------34:36----------
dream but it was definitely it was it


---------34:41----------
was a holy [ __ ] that just happened


---------34:43----------
moment for me because I never up there


---------34:48----------
to me something I felt like


---------34:53----------
[ __ ] cheering or something like I


---------34:56----------
felt like crying because this guy just I


---------35:02----------
don't know like snapped his fingers


---------35:03----------
within an hour and just said I know


---------35:05----------
what's going on here and said it


---------35:08----------
point-blank I had to walk home that day


---------35:12----------
it was it was a six mile walk home so I


---------35:16----------
got like to hug his office um I was I


---------35:21----------
was alone when I got home I was alone a


---------35:23----------
lot from 13 to 17 I was alone a lot


---------35:34----------
the other two therapists that you said


---------35:37----------
were really good were not this


---------35:38----------
psychiatrist these are other women who


---------35:40----------
went nowhere yeah


---------35:42----------
they were in the same program as whereas


---------35:46----------
that sounds so basically once the


---------35:49----------
program would cut one of the clinicians


---------35:51----------
I would move on to another one


---------35:53----------
mm-hm and so there were just cycles and


---------35:57----------
cover yeah what so what did they do that


---------36:01----------
from the appointments the appointments


---------36:04----------
were only supposed to be like one hour


---------36:06----------
but they would go over by a lot just to


---------36:09----------
talk about random stuff I know that the


---------36:12----------
expenses were only supposed to cover


---------36:14----------
like $10 per visit because we would we


---------36:16----------
would drive somewhere like a coffee shop


---------36:18----------
or a cafe but they would pay


---------36:21----------
out-of-pocket so we could go nicer


---------36:22----------
places and to my knowledge


---------36:25----------
III don't know if they did this with


---------36:27----------
other clients or something but it felt


---------36:29----------
nice but we talked about like a lot of


---------36:34----------
yeah it sort of felt like a mom I know


---------36:41----------
that sound and it sounds really weird


---------36:43----------
but that's how it it's it really I


---------36:45----------
looked forward to the the therapy


---------36:48----------
appointments because they were common it


---------36:50----------
felt like I could talk to someone that


---------36:51----------
wasn't judging me about anything and


---------36:54----------
that actually cared about what I was


---------36:56----------
saying to them okay


---------37:06----------
so we've got a couple of options LS yeah


---------37:10----------
the first is there are some things that


---------37:14----------
I can just I can just start talking and


---------37:17----------
sort of share what I think with you at


---------37:19----------
this point the chances that I'm wrong or


---------37:21----------
way higher them the chances that I'm


---------37:23----------
right because I'm gonna make a lot of


---------37:25----------
really bold claims I don't know I think


---------37:30----------
a piece of that is gonna be almost like


---------37:32----------
ego gratifying because I feel like I


---------37:35----------
understand you and I understand a lot of


---------37:39----------
your problems I don't know that that


---------37:41----------
actually helps you though because that's


---------37:43----------
I think that's really more for my


---------37:44----------
benefit and showmanship than actually


---------37:47----------
trying to help you so


---------37:55----------
or but but I also sort of do recognize


---------37:58----------
that sometimes when people talk to me


---------38:01----------
and you know they're they're not looking


---------38:03----------
to necessarily be asked a thousand


---------38:05----------
questions they're really looking more


---------38:07----------
for answers so I'll kind of leave it up


---------38:10----------
to you what would you rather have me do


---------38:13----------
because I still have a lot of questions


---------38:14----------
that I want to ask and I can try to walk


---------38:16----------
you to things in a little bit probably


---------38:19----------
more productive way although it'll be


---------38:21----------
slower or we can kind of jump to the


---------38:23----------
punch line of the joke but chances are


---------38:24----------
that it's not going to be as funny


---------38:26----------
because I haven't said the whole joke


---------38:28----------
like the punchline is only funny if you


---------38:29----------
like hear the whole joke right yeah so


---------38:39----------
what what do you want to do should I ask


---------38:41----------
you more questions or should I share


---------38:43----------
some thoughts you can ask more if you


---------38:47----------
want because I mean we're barely


---------38:48----------
touching on age 13 it gets really bad


---------38:52----------
the next few years that's when that's


---------38:55----------
when the therapy kicked up to 25 30


---------38:57----------
hours that's the hospitalizations that's


---------38:59----------
the the suicide stuff that's the yeah


---------39:06----------
that'sthat's the dark period that's the


---------39:10----------
not going to school the truancy the


---------39:11----------
courts the wayward petitions the judges


---------39:15----------
juvenile detention center yeah that's


---------39:20----------
all of that stuff I know this is gonna


---------39:22----------
sound strange but I'm not so interested


---------39:24----------
in that okay I know it's weird but I


---------39:27----------
know I think I think that's sort of the


---------39:38----------
I don't know how to put this beyond I


---------39:41----------
think that the setup for all that stuff


---------39:43----------
has already happened okay


---------39:47----------
but if you'd like me to ask you more


---------39:48----------
questions I have questions kind of not


---------39:50----------
so much about the details because I mean


---------39:52----------
kind of I know you've watched dreams


---------39:54----------
before so sometimes people will talk


---------39:55----------
like you know they'll start talking


---------39:57----------
about for example bipolar disorder


---------39:58----------
anxiety


---------39:59----------
we don't necessarily go into that stuff


---------40:01----------
I think a lot of that stuff is


---------40:02----------
clinically very relevant but I I don't


---------40:04----------
know that what I'm doing I mean what I'm


---------40:06----------
doing here is not clinical so in a sense


---------40:08----------
a lot of those very important details


---------40:10----------
like don't get me wrong incredibly


---------40:11----------
important I have no doubt that that's


---------40:13----------
actually vitally important stuff but


---------40:15----------
what I'm sensing from you is like like


---------40:17----------
something that's a little bit more


---------40:19----------
fundamental in terms of the way that you


---------40:22----------
look at yourself the way that you formed


---------40:24----------
in an opinion about yourself the way


---------40:26----------
that you were treated and what has


---------40:28----------
worked in therapy so like


---------40:36----------
so what what I mean we can talk more


---------40:40----------
about your history if you'd like but


---------40:41----------
that's not the direction of questions


---------40:43----------
that I have although we may get there


---------40:45----------
I'm not so interested in details I'm


---------40:48----------
interested in sort of your sense of how


---------40:51----------
you experience certain things and how


---------40:53----------
you view certain model so more questions


---------40:59----------
as you think best to proceed I've gone


---------41:03----------
down so many different lines if that's


---------41:06----------
what you want to call them with


---------41:07----------
different therapy sessions all right you


---------41:09----------
know what I mean let's ask let's ask


---------41:11----------
twitch chat then twitch chat what should


---------41:13----------
we do should we do questions or share


---------41:16----------
our thoughts


---------41:20----------
questions okay ask more okay so tinny


---------41:25----------
tell me a little bit about you said your


---------41:27----------
mom was a is in psychiatry she works on


---------41:33----------
the psychiatric unit okay and is it okay


---------41:38----------
if I ask in what capacity


---------41:45----------
mmm I don't want to give away too much


---------41:48----------
okay sure


---------41:49----------
I'm not run yeah no I mean there's a


---------41:52----------
reason why I asked is it okay if I ask


---------41:53----------
yeah yeah I'm curious cuz um okay and


---------41:57----------
you haven't mentioned anything about


---------41:58----------
your dad um my dad uh so he was autumn I


---------42:05----------
he was in my life until like four or


---------42:09----------
five and then he disappeared until I was


---------42:12----------
like nine or ten and then he was in and


---------42:15----------
out my stepmother


---------42:17----------
however is active she's actively still


---------42:21----------
in my life along with my grandmother


---------42:24----------
I've talked to my mother I've seen my


---------42:31----------
mother once in the last decade and I've


---------42:35----------
talked to her less than a handful of


---------42:37----------
times but I haven't talked to her now in


---------42:39----------
four years he life father it's by my


---------42:44----------
choice I tried to make I tried to make


---------42:50----------
stuff hat or work or something the last


---------42:53----------
time I was there or in Rhode Island that


---------42:58----------
was worlds 2016 and it didn't seem like


---------43:05----------
there was anything I could say or do


---------43:07----------
that would allow us to not be stuck in


---------43:12----------
2008 or 2009 or anything like that are


---------43:17----------
you guys stuck in 2008 and 2004 we get


---------43:20----------
there let me ask you something yeah in


---------43:22----------
your professional career yeah when


---------43:25----------
people talk about depression and it


---------43:29----------
impacts you negatively does it feel like


---------43:33----------
people are using a part of you against


---------43:36----------
you


---------43:41----------
it feels like a cop-out because anyone


---------43:45----------
who's willing to use something like that


---------43:47----------
against me doesn't possess enough


---------43:49----------
knowledge of it in the first off to even


---------43:53----------
talk about it second off to make that


---------43:55----------
assertion and then third off it I think


---------43:59----------
it shows on a pretty surface level that


---------44:05----------
they're they're ignorant and they're not


---------44:07----------
willing to go deeper because there's so


---------44:09----------
many questions that can branch out from


---------44:11----------
mmm-hmm depression that's so far more


---------44:16----------
rational and collected answer than I was


---------44:18----------
expecting


---------44:19----------
it's a far more forgiving answer than I


---------44:21----------
was expecting


---------44:24----------
okay how are you with forgiveness I tend


---------44:31----------
not to hold grudges and with other


---------44:35----------
played yeah with other people and I can


---------44:40----------
I can feel a lot of vindictive feelings


---------44:43----------
in in very brief moments but if I know


---------44:48----------
them to be wrong or unjust or something


---------44:53----------
else it doesn't really matter to me all


---------44:57----------
that much so you're I've had like a


---------45:01----------
vindictiveness or anger towards others


---------45:03----------
don't matter they don't matter because I


---------45:07----------
I realized that it doesn't do anything


---------45:11----------
like I don't I don't know how to explain


---------45:15----------
this but like nothing good comes of it I


---------45:19----------
I've had I've had a lot of money stolen


---------45:22----------
from me for instance in recent years by


---------45:26----------
people that were close to me or people


---------45:28----------
that had access to my like PayPal Gmail


---------45:33----------
etc right people that I had trusted or


---------45:36----------
confided him and at the end of the day


---------45:40----------
um it wasn't enough to make me lose


---------45:43----------
sleep and there was reasons that they


---------45:46----------
were in that spot that they felt like


---------45:49----------
they had to do that and so I tried to


---------45:52----------
you know recover or get back as much as


---------45:55----------
I possibly could and for what I couldn't


---------45:57----------
it's my fault


---------46:00----------
and even if they made a bad choice in a


---------46:03----------
bad action I could have done more


---------46:05----------
preventive measures which I do now but I


---------46:09----------
don't [ __ ] here because it's not


---------46:12----------
something that caused me harm I think


---------46:14----------
the only things that I would ever hold


---------46:16----------
severe grudges over is maybe something


---------46:20----------
that attempted to seriously harm me but


---------46:22----------
I haven't encountered something like


---------46:24----------
that I'm lying I'm sorry I'm not like


---------46:30----------
I'm not intentionally lying there's one


---------46:31----------
thing but I won't talk about it under


---------46:33----------
stream that happened two and a half ago


---------46:36----------
let me just let me see if I understand


---------46:38----------
you when someone steals money from you


---------46:42----------
whose fault is it ultimately it's mine


---------46:52----------
because I I gave the person the ability


---------46:56----------
to do that


---------46:57----------
okay and there's ways that I could have


---------47:01----------
prevented it which I know now so even


---------47:05----------
though they made the choice I made


---------47:08----------
myself vulnerable so there's definitely


---------47:13----------
a way where we can say that it's not my


---------47:14----------
fault but because I know now what I


---------47:17----------
didn't know then it just wouldn't happen


---------47:20----------
now compared to before how long is your


---------47:23----------
fault


---------47:24----------
I think most things are I think most bad


---------47:29----------
things that end up happening to me I end


---------47:32----------
up looking back at it and being like


---------47:33----------
yeah I could have made a different play


---------47:34----------
or I took the I took how long have


---------47:37----------
things been your fault anything bad


---------47:41----------
since I can remember of course okay now


---------47:49----------
I'm gonna share some thoughts hmm hold


---------47:55----------
on a second


---------48:07----------
do you blame your mom for y'all's


---------48:09----------
relationship I try to understand her


---------48:16----------
point of view which I was I I think now


---------48:20----------
you try to hide your point of view both


---------48:25----------
I try to empathize with her


---------48:29----------
do you like if I had yes I try to do


---------48:35----------
both and then I get stuck in this this


---------48:38----------
weird limbo where I don't know what to


---------48:41----------
think like I try to imagine if I had an


---------48:43----------
11 year old right now holy [ __ ] I don't


---------48:48----------
[ __ ] know what I would do but also


---------48:51----------
what would that have done to me at 17 18


---------48:54----------
19 20 21 I can't how do you empathize


---------48:58----------
with yourself what what that was that


---------49:01----------
was very helpful by the way when you


---------49:02----------
sort of said like if I had an 11 year


---------49:04----------
old right now I don't know what I would


---------49:06----------
do so you try to put yourself in her


---------49:07----------
shoes you try to be understanding even


---------49:09----------
when it sounds like people are like


---------49:12----------
steal money from you you sort of try to


---------49:14----------
understand that they were in a desperate


---------49:15----------
of desperation a lot a lot of people see


---------49:19----------
people with problems and they don't care


---------49:21----------
about


---------49:22----------
well what made them that way there's


---------49:27----------
always a story doesn't just happen


---------49:29----------
unless we're talking about psychopathy


---------49:31----------
or something but that's a different


---------49:33----------
demon you don't look at people who are


---------49:36----------
actively stealing or they're doing


---------49:39----------
things and think that's just who they


---------49:41----------
are


---------49:41----------
no that's who they became as a byproduct


---------49:45----------
of so Alice how did you become the way


---------49:47----------
that you are what is a story


---------49:52----------
what made you into the person that you


---------49:54----------
are so I think the way that I perceive


---------50:00----------
things I think is obviously a byproduct


---------50:02----------
of the way that my uncle's race or


---------50:05----------
raised me in terms of like how I think


---------50:08----------
like structured or puzzles and whatnot


---------50:10----------
but I think that the lack of Russian


---------50:13----------
affection okay sorry yeah the the lack


---------50:17----------
of affection and emotional stuff stems


---------50:21----------
from I think no one ever really


---------50:23----------
understood me from my family


---------50:25----------
due to an accelerated childhood leading


---------50:29----------
to me feeling detached from my peers


---------50:31----------
around me to to feeling intellectually


---------50:35----------
accelerated than them thus creating a


---------50:38----------
disconnect okay okay stop cetera et


---------50:41----------
cetera well I mean this that was my yeah


---------50:44----------
all right okay LS so there's one thing


---------50:47----------
right so one is that no one asks the


---------50:51----------
question of why they became why they're


---------50:54----------
doing the things that they're doing and


---------50:55----------
how they got to be that way right and


---------50:57----------
then I asked you the question which is


---------50:58----------
actually the first question how did you


---------51:01----------
become the way that you are but I think


---------51:03----------
the real question is who didn't ask why


---------51:09----------
you are the way you are who didn't give


---------51:12----------
you the benefit of the doubt that you


---------51:14----------
give everyone who hurts you that that's


---------51:19----------
that's that's the very question for


---------51:22----------
therapists that meant the most to me


---------51:24----------
asked the school board the same way that


---------51:26----------
you just phrased it almost


---------51:29----------
and I remember I remember the room that


---------51:34----------
day I just remember the look on


---------51:35----------
everyone's face


---------51:38----------
because obviously it no one does ask


---------51:40----------
that


---------51:46----------
can you hear me yeah okay what was the


---------51:49----------
question that they added that she asked


---------51:51----------
the school board she asked the school


---------51:53----------
board all of you got all of you were


---------51:56----------
talking about the things that he's doing


---------51:58----------
or why he's behaving this way but none


---------52:00----------
of you are asking why or what's causing


---------52:03----------
him to act like this and the look on


---------52:05----------
everyone's face including my mother's


---------52:07----------
was just they were stupefied


---------52:10----------
as if they obviously don't have an


---------52:12----------
explanation because they're ignoring


---------52:13----------
mrs. so it that felt really good


---------52:20----------
because I knew obviously there's reasons


---------52:24----------
I'm doing the things that I'm doing and


---------52:26----------
it just felt like no one cared about


---------52:29----------
what I felt or how I was feeling because


---------52:34----------
I I felt so out of place growing up


---------52:36----------
constantly


---------52:39----------
yeah I mean I've always thought alone


---------52:43----------
I still feel alone which maybe is I mean


---------52:47----------
we can get into this maybe later on but


---------52:49----------
like there's lots of people around me


---------52:52----------
and I I try to allow my house to be open


---------52:56----------
to like pros that want to come out here


---------52:58----------
in bootcamp or I try to help boot


---------53:00----------
campers get set up and stuff cuz it's


---------53:02----------
stuff that I would have been Droid when


---------53:04----------
I was younger or that I needed when I


---------53:06----------
was younger but also I realized that


---------53:09----------
maybe there's like a there's a there's a


---------53:11----------
compound there where I'm extremely


---------53:13----------
lonely and so it's a way of feeling like


---------53:17----------
there's family okay yeah I'm gonna share


---------53:21----------
some thoughts and I think we had we were


---------53:24----------
skirting on the surface of some stuff


---------53:25----------
that I thought was pretty significant


---------53:27----------
but I I'm not quite sure why so first


---------53:35----------
thing Ellis is I think I think you can


---------53:37----------
get better and I think you can feel


---------53:41----------
better let me put it that way I don't


---------53:44----------
think you have to continue feeling the


---------53:46----------
way that you are and I don't think that


---------53:49----------
it is your fault that you feel the way


---------53:51----------
that you do and I think that the


---------53:55----------
challenge here is that


---------53:59----------
no one showed you how to cut yourself a


---------54:04----------
break for your behavior


---------54:08----------
and you don't cut yourself a break you


---------54:10----------
write you you sort of ask the question


---------54:11----------
you come up with a beautiful intelligent


---------54:14----------
highly accurate theory about why you are


---------54:17----------
the way that you are but you don't


---------54:21----------
you don't let that take the bite out of


---------54:25----------
your self-hatred


---------54:28----------
the goal of saying that there like this


---------54:30----------
kid is not so like the goal of asking


---------54:33----------
why is this kid acting out is to explain


---------54:36----------
to everyone and for everyone to be on


---------54:37----------
the same page that it's not this kids


---------54:39----------
fault that he's not succeeding


---------54:43----------
and so I think that you you're able to


---------54:46----------
construct a theory of like why you're


---------54:49----------
the way that you are but I don't think


---------54:52----------
you let that theory absolve you of


---------54:54----------
responsibility


---------54:56----------
that make sense yeah no my sons and our


---------55:01----------
that's a fancy ass way of saying


---------55:04----------
forgiveness which is something that I


---------55:07----------
think is very alien to you when it comes


---------55:08----------
to you so you blame yourself for all


---------55:13----------
kinds of things even when it's not your


---------55:16----------
fault and this starts with the


---------55:17----------
displacing blame and then ends up with


---------55:19----------
this frankly really [ __ ] weirdly


---------55:21----------
cognitively distorted thing about when


---------55:23----------
people steal from you it's their fault


---------55:25----------
and like I get that if your Buddha or


---------55:28----------
Jesus fine but you're not and neither am


---------55:32----------
i so there's something weird going on


---------55:35----------
there and so then we get to all kinds of


---------55:40----------
judge this is just weird I mean this is


---------55:41----------
[ __ ] weird so first of all very very


---------55:44----------
severe asthma allergy benadryl three


---------55:48----------
nebulizers a day that resolves around


---------55:51----------
teenagers so asthma gets better and


---------55:54----------
teenagers people tend to grow out of it


---------55:55----------
but we're talking about a very very


---------55:58----------
severe illness that basically disappears


---------56:03----------
and then is gone for a decade what


---------56:04----------
happens people grow out of it absolutely


---------56:06----------
happens allergies that get to cats and


---------56:13----------
dogs that get worse after a cat dies dog


---------56:18----------
dog yeah it's kind of weird


---------56:22----------
thousands of hours of therapy shunting


---------56:26----------
you off to treat er after treat her


---------56:28----------
after treat her because you're sick and


---------56:30----------
you're broken


---------56:34----------
who thought you were sick and broken my


---------56:40----------
entire mother's side of the family my


---------56:42----------
dad didn't know what to think and my


---------56:44----------
stepmother thought that I was fine okay


---------56:47----------
so this sounds like some I mean I'm


---------56:50----------
gonna toss out a word that is that is


---------56:52----------
sort of a diagnostic thing which I I'm


---------56:53----------
not trying to be irresponsible because I


---------56:55----------
have no way of diagnosing this I don't


---------56:56----------
know I don't have one percent of the


---------56:59----------
information that I should have before


---------57:02----------
using these words this is some


---------57:04----------
Munchausen's by proxy level [ __ ] man do


---------57:07----------
you know what that is


---------57:08----------
yeah that's so


---------57:12----------
yeah Munchausen is when the the the


---------57:15----------
parent over medicates the child and


---------57:17----------
actually makes them sick


---------57:19----------
I know all about it it was looked into


---------57:21----------
during my adolescence and stuff it was a


---------57:23----------
very big argument during custody so so


---------57:26----------
like I don't know that this actually is


---------57:28----------
what happened but like I'm getting the


---------57:30----------
sense because I've seen this before


---------57:31----------
where like it's like someone has the


---------57:35----------
perception that the child is just sick


---------57:37----------
and needs to be fixed and needs to be


---------57:39----------
fixed and needs to be fixed and since


---------57:41----------
it's get sense to treat her and treat


---------57:43----------
her and treat her and treat her and


---------57:44----------
treat her and I have no doubt that you


---------57:47----------
know you actually had symptoms and stuff


---------57:48----------
like that because a lot of these have


---------57:49----------
like objective tests and it's not that


---------57:51----------
it's all psychological I mean so like


---------57:53----------
your your physical health seems very


---------57:55----------
psychosomatic to me which means that


---------57:58----------
there's an influence of mind and body


---------58:00----------
which is sort of like what I am


---------58:01----------
interested in and so it sort of makes


---------58:04----------
sense like you know I'd be wondering if


---------58:06----------
you if you've had two asthma attacks


---------58:07----------
over the last year like what's been


---------58:08----------
going on so there's like good evidence


---------58:10----------
that stress makes atopic disease worse


---------58:13----------
so you have atopic disease asthma


---------58:15----------
allergies things like that eczema is


---------58:17----------
another thing that you may have so like


---------58:20----------
these are all atopic diseases that are


---------58:22----------
reduced to stress chronic inflammatory


---------58:23----------
diseases that relate to stress this is


---------58:27----------
weird the other thing is that there is


---------58:29----------
one reason there's one common factor


---------58:33----------
that I've seen time and time and time


---------58:35----------
again as to why everyone blames


---------58:38----------
themselves


---------58:39----------
and it's actually like the most


---------58:42----------
devastating lesson I learned in


---------58:43----------
psychiatry so and it comes down to


---------58:45----------
theory of mind so when you're a young


---------58:49----------
child and before you have conceptions of


---------58:53----------
other people's theory like like other


---------58:56----------
people's existence so like like if I do


---------59:01----------
something to you that lasts like let's


---------59:02----------
say I smack you across the face whose


---------59:08----------
fault is that


---------59:09----------
I assume you're an [ __ ] yes that is


---------59:14----------
the correct answer I was shaking my head


---------59:16----------
for a second because I think of all the


---------59:17----------
people that are gonna bend over


---------59:18----------
backwards and say that it's it's not my


---------59:21----------
fault in that it's your fault you're


---------59:22----------
gonna say that because that's what you


---------59:24----------
say about most things which would kind


---------59:25----------
of prove my point and that gets to the


---------59:26----------
punchline but anyway so it's my fault


---------59:28----------
right if I punch you across the face


---------59:30----------
it's my fault now if you do not have a


---------59:34----------
conception that other human beings exist


---------59:37----------
and you get hurt


---------59:38----------
whose fault is that


---------59:44----------
mine absolutely because you're the only


---------59:47----------
thing that exists right yeah if you're


---------59:50----------
like if you're sitting in a room by


---------59:51----------
yourself and like no one is there and


---------59:53----------
you like feel pain like whose fault is


---------59:56----------
that


---------59:57----------
then yeah it's mine so this is what's so


---------60:02----------
devastating about abuse of very very


---------60:05----------
young children so when children are


---------60:08----------
super super young they don't have theory


---------60:11----------
of mind and so when they get abused and


---------60:14----------
they get hurt they don't understand that


---------60:17----------
like it's an adult that's hurting them


---------60:19----------
they think it's their fault and they


---------60:22----------
develop this sense that like when people


---------60:25----------
hurt me it's my fault because that's


---------60:28----------
what they were


---------60:30----------
in the one thread that I hear from you


---------60:33----------
time and time and time again is first of


---------60:35----------
all you get blamed for being who you are


---------60:38----------
people don't cut you slack you don't get


---------60:41----------
to be yourself whether it's pushing you


---------60:44----------
to do riddles or being judged for being


---------60:46----------
depressed and professional impacts I


---------60:49----------
don't even know we talked a little bit


---------60:51----------
about wayward and stuff like that you


---------60:53----------
know before you came on stream but like


---------60:55----------
I can imagine that that you know your


---------60:58----------
mom didn't treat you like a son like she


---------61:01----------
treated you like a problem like she


---------61:03----------
didn't let you be you and you know your


---------61:06----------
words not mine in terms of the three


---------61:08----------
therapists that helped you like how did


---------61:11----------
they help you they didn't help you


---------61:12----------
through therapy they helped you through


---------61:15----------
caring because like you can have


---------61:19----------
thousands of hours of therapy and if you


---------61:21----------
don't have like a clinical problem like


---------61:23----------
if it's not like like no wonder nothing


---------61:25----------
is working because it's not like and


---------61:28----------
this I shared with you before stream as


---------61:30----------
well like I I once had a very wise


---------61:33----------
psychiatrist tell me and blew my mind


---------61:35----------
because I've been testing this ever


---------61:36----------
since he told me this if you ever see a


---------61:38----------
patient who has three diagnoses they're


---------61:40----------
all wrong because that's just not I mean


---------61:44----------
I don't know that that's absolutely true


---------61:46----------
but I think a lot of times people get


---------61:48----------
labeled with diagnoses and they get put


---------61:50----------
into treatment and like everyone is


---------61:52----------
missing the point because they're trying


---------61:55----------
to treat like this thing over here but


---------61:57----------
that's not the problem so in your case I


---------61:59----------
think first of all somewhere along the


---------62:01----------
way you and my hype I'm telling you like


---------62:06----------
I mean I've I don't know if I've talked


---------62:07----------
about this before publicly but I talked


---------62:09----------
about this a fair amount it's just it


---------62:11----------
when you have young children who were


---------62:13----------
abused this is the this is the way they


---------62:16----------
think and trauma is the thing that


---------62:18----------
masquerades is every other like


---------62:22----------
psychiatric diagnosis


---------62:25----------
and what what I'm seeing in you is just


---------62:27----------
like that that you know somewhere along


---------62:29----------
the way I don't know why but it's like


---------62:31----------
your mom just didn't let you be you and


---------62:34----------
she she took the person that you were


---------62:37----------
and she in her mind or in your own


---------62:41----------
taught you that that is wrong that like


---------62:47----------
what you are is pathological and that


---------62:52----------
you're just like fundamentally like


---------62:53----------
you're busted in some way and I I think


---------62:57----------
that you have a lot of these feelings


---------62:59----------
and I think some of the stuff that


---------63:00----------
you're doing I mean not say that this is


---------63:01----------
your fault but you know you talk about


---------63:03----------
these brief feelings of vindictiveness


---------63:05----------
and anger and other people like and then


---------63:08----------
you say to yourself


---------63:09----------
those are unproductive so you dismiss


---------63:11----------
them but those are the feelings that you


---------63:13----------
need to feel to move out this because


---------63:16----------
those are the feelings that you actually


---------63:17----------
deserve to feel like that's you know the


---------63:20----------
process of grieving like involves anger


---------63:22----------
right like getting pissed at someone


---------63:24----------
like you don't actually forgive them


---------63:26----------
because you you can't forgive anyone


---------63:29----------
unless they hurt you but you don't think


---------63:31----------
that people hurt you you blame yourself


---------63:33----------
so you're incapable of forgiving anyone


---------63:35----------
else like forgiveness requires someone


---------63:39----------
hurt you and somewhere in there I don't


---------63:42----------
know if you know how to forgive yourself


---------63:44----------
but I think I think that's something you


---------63:46----------
should learn too and we can talk about


---------63:48----------
more and I mean just as this thread of


---------63:54----------
like not being allowed to be yourself


---------63:56----------
right being bullied being given riddles


---------63:58----------
being pathologized at a young age your


---------64:01----------
mom trying to get rid of you and you're


---------64:03----------
apparently teenage years something like


---------64:06----------
that I mean I don't know if I fully


---------64:07----------
understand that but you know and and


---------64:10----------
then there are people who actually like


---------64:12----------
treat you like what are the therapists


---------64:13----------
that have helped it's like the people


---------64:15----------
who have treated you like a person they


---------64:16----------
let you be like who you are and have


---------64:19----------
introduced you to a diagnosis have


---------64:21----------
introduced you to a behavior have


---------64:23----------
introduced you to a particular thing and


---------64:26----------
they've said like hey this is a full and


---------64:28----------
complete person and it's not his fault


---------64:31----------
and none of you all have the wherewithal


---------64:34----------
all you guys are doing is you're blaming


---------64:36----------
LS you're blaming LS you're blaming


---------64:38----------
Alice and no one is bothering to ask a


---------64:40----------
lie and then poor thing LS that's what


---------64:46----------
was modeled for you so that's what you


---------64:48----------
learned how to do blame yourself blame


---------64:52----------
yourself blame yourself and there's a


---------64:55----------
part of you that struggles


---------64:56----------
intellectually you understand that there


---------64:58----------
are reasons you are this way and so you


---------65:01----------
come up with these theories that I think


---------65:02----------
are really good but that's all up here


---------65:05----------
it's not in here


---------65:08----------
that's got to change


---------65:17----------
you


---------65:22----------
yeah


---------65:23----------
[Music]


---------65:25----------
that's questions


---------65:28----------
I know that it has to change


---------65:31----------
it's


---------65:33----------
the inability because it's aware of


---------65:37----------
itself and I know it sounds really weird


---------65:39----------
to talk about it like that but it is


---------65:41----------
good no it's my one of my therapists


---------65:45----------
used to call it I remember I got memed


---------65:49----------
about this or not me and it got joked


---------65:52----------
about the the therapist called it


---------65:54----------
something like a I don't remember the


---------65:58----------
exact phrasing like a chronic chaos


---------66:00----------
syndrome or something the the need to


---------66:04----------
cause chaos or chronic or problems in


---------66:08----------
order to feel normal because it's all


---------66:11----------
that i-i've known and that it was very


---------66:14----------
present in my household and so I'm aware


---------66:19----------
of that what you're saying is accurate


---------66:21----------
I'm wearing that I'm aware that it's


---------66:23----------
necessary my brain the way that I think


---------66:26----------
the way that I construct things the way


---------66:30----------
that I compartmentalize things won't


---------66:33----------
allow it to happen


---------66:36----------
what I said to my my last two shrinks


---------66:39----------
was I told them both I've done this


---------66:44----------
rodeo hundreds of hours I'm aware of


---------66:48----------
this but I think the only way that it's


---------66:52----------
gonna happen is if somehow it happens


---------66:55----------
through like trickery okay what I mean


---------66:58----------
is that in excellent it's happening


---------67:01----------
without my conscious awareness


---------67:03----------
absolutely because my conscious will


---------67:05----------
fight you or not you but no whoever the


---------67:09----------
doctor or the clinician is right right


---------67:11----------
so it there's two entities


---------67:12----------
there's the illness which we'll just


---------67:16----------
refer to as a monster right I don't want


---------67:19----------
to use demon case anyone with religious


---------67:21----------
backgrounds think that's like really


---------67:23----------
[ __ ] weird


---------67:24----------
the monster is aware of what's trying to


---------67:27----------
happen likes to live it likes to thrive


---------67:30----------
yeah and so when it becomes aware that


---------67:33----------
it's getting attacked or that there's a


---------67:35----------
need to remove it it will start doing


---------67:38----------
things to not allow that to happen


---------67:41----------
whether through thought processes


---------67:43----------
creating problems etc


---------67:46----------
and obviously my conscious mind will


---------67:49----------
resist and so I've theorized and what I


---------67:53----------
said to the last two doctors the only


---------67:54----------
way to break this is to bypass the


---------67:57----------
conscious mind somehow with some


---------68:00----------
epiphanies or something great I am


---------68:02----------
I haven't [ __ ] found a way good so so


---------68:06----------
yeah you know yeah so you remember


---------68:08----------
earlier when I said I think you can get


---------68:10----------
better I don't think so I thought I


---------68:15----------
never do I think so yeah I guess so


---------68:18----------
I often times do what you're saying


---------68:21----------
that's that's a lot of how I work so I'm


---------68:25----------
all about bypassing the conscious mind


---------68:26----------
and that's why often times you want to


---------68:29----------
say things to me and that I just could


---------68:31----------
you know I just don't care right like


---------68:35----------
you'll be talking about like something


---------68:36----------
that seems like super important because


---------68:38----------
it's all coming from up here and I could


---------68:39----------
give two shits about that that's not


---------68:41----------
where the money is and I think if I'd


---------68:45----------
let you talk and I had asked you lots of


---------68:48----------
questions about your very rich history


---------68:50----------
we would be nowhere but I think we're


---------68:55----------
somewhere so all we got to do is bypass


---------68:56----------
your conscious mind that can be done do


---------68:58----------
you know how to meditate


---------68:59----------
I've tried meditation in the past one of


---------69:04----------
the clinicians used to do meditation but


---------69:09----------
that gives me a ton of hope do you know


---------69:10----------
why why because if you had said yes I


---------69:14----------
know how to meditate and I've meditated


---------69:16----------
for a long time and I've spent a lot of


---------69:18----------
time studying meditation and learning


---------69:20----------
how to meditate then I would be Sol


---------69:23----------
because the basic thing that I think is


---------69:25----------
gonna help you is gonna be meditation


---------69:27----------
but if you don't know how to do it and


---------69:28----------
you've only dabbled in you haven't


---------69:30----------
really done it then there's a good


---------69:31----------
chance there's still hope for you the


---------69:33----------
other thing that I think we need to


---------69:34----------
teach you how to do is feel your


---------69:35----------
emotions so depression is anger turned


---------69:38----------
against the self this is what one of the


---------69:40----------
psychoanalyst it's believed that


---------69:42----------
essentially like what we call depression


---------69:43----------
is just anger that's directed inwardly


---------69:46----------
as opposed to outwardly and I think that


---------69:48----------
makes sense for you so I think you just


---------69:49----------
have a lot of anger your problem is not


---------69:51----------
I mean so once again oversimplifying etc


---------69:54----------
so I'm glad you're actually seeing real


---------69:56----------
you know treat treaters and stuff


---------69:58----------
because


---------69:59----------
they're gonna know better than I do


---------70:01----------
because they've spent the time to learn


---------70:02----------
all about you whereas I have not at the


---------70:06----------
same time I think it starts by letting


---------70:08----------
yourself feel anger right it starts by


---------70:12----------
you saying and this is a hard thing to


---------70:14----------
say that this happened to me and it


---------70:17----------
really shouldn't have in it's shitty and


---------70:19----------
there's no explaining it and it sucks


---------70:21----------
and I did not deserve it but it happened


---------70:24----------
anyway because your mind is so good at


---------70:27----------
creating meaning and so good at creating


---------70:30----------
logic and so good at creating


---------70:31----------
explanations that just random acts of


---------70:35----------
violence and awfulness just have no


---------70:37----------
place in your head which is really what


---------70:40----------
you should acknowledge is that sometimes


---------70:42----------
just bad [ __ ] happens and you don't


---------70:45----------
deserve it but your inability to like


---------70:47----------
experience that means that you've got


---------70:49----------
this weird like you're like a septic


---------70:52----------
tank that's just full and like never


---------70:54----------
drains because like bad [ __ ] happens to


---------70:57----------
you and happens to you and happens to


---------70:58----------
you and no one and you just blame


---------71:00----------
yourself and so like no like the blame


---------71:03----------
just sits within you you're like just


---------71:04----------
just a cesspool of you know stuff and so


---------71:09----------
I think it's actually oddly enough I


---------71:11----------
mean the first thing that I try to do is


---------71:12----------
feel anger just start there and just


---------71:16----------
feel it and learn how to meditate and


---------71:19----------
then we can talk further but I mean I


---------71:23----------
think I think there's hope for you


---------71:24----------
because I think if you're generally


---------71:26----------
speaking I tend to be hopeful when I


---------71:30----------
understand people because I think if I


---------71:32----------
understand them that means that there's


---------71:33----------
some sort of like logic or rhythm to it


---------71:35----------
and there's like a system and if you


---------71:37----------
understand the system then you can


---------71:39----------
improve the system now I'm not saying


---------71:40----------
it's easy I'm not saying it's gonna


---------71:42----------
happen anytime soon but at the end of


---------71:45----------
the day LSU just have some I mean I


---------71:48----------
think some really like low-hanging fruit


---------71:50----------
in terms of the way that you look at


---------71:51----------
yourself the lack of things that you do


---------71:53----------
your tendency to over intellectualize


---------71:55----------
and like push away your feelings because


---------71:57----------
they don't matter to you I think it's


---------71:59----------
also very hopeful to me because you


---------72:01----------
understand this so like I don't know if


---------72:04----------
you remembered let me just see


---------72:07----------
can I hold on is it okay if I show


---------72:22----------
people the last few DMS starting


---------72:28----------
starting starting like this can I share


---------72:34----------
that with people yeah sure so like this


---------72:40----------
is what we're talking about chat so


---------72:46----------
these last DMS that I sent you because


---------72:49----------
I'm glad you recognized it as an is its


---------72:52----------
own thing yeah so like it's its own


---------72:57----------
voice I've referred to it as another me


---------73:01----------
yes oh good I know it sounds really


---------73:04----------
weird to say it's no but the easiest


---------73:06----------
analogy is to compare it to like a


---------73:09----------
religious possession right it's an at


---------73:11----------
its another entity it's another person


---------73:14----------
that is aware of itself and that will


---------73:18----------
stop it no means to defend itself yes


---------73:22----------
and this comes back as my original


---------73:24----------
question which is do you want to let go


---------73:27----------
of fear no the answer is no no right so


---------73:32----------
this thing that I call the badness like


---------73:35----------
there's a thing inside you that we


---------73:36----------
absolutely have to bypass because this


---------73:38----------
thing is a protective mechanism it's a


---------73:40----------
survival mechanism and it's not going to


---------73:43----------
abandon you because it's afraid that if


---------73:46----------
it abandons you then you've got nothing


---------73:49----------
it's fear it's blame it's agency its


---------73:53----------
power because if everything is your


---------73:55----------
fault then you have a road forward so


---------74:00----------
it's subtle and it's it's dangerous and


---------74:03----------
this is the really important thing to


---------74:05----------
understand about it it's not bad or evil


---------74:08----------
it's something that you needed for a


---------74:10----------
long time to keep you alive in this


---------74:14----------
situation and now it's time to move past


---------74:19----------
which is not destroy it which is not


---------74:21----------
make it go away which is actually to


---------74:23----------
like help it calm down because it's


---------74:27----------
trying to protect you so the way it's


---------74:29----------
kind of like getting a guard dog that's


---------74:31----------
like super agitated like how do you get


---------74:32----------
it to calm down you got to get it to


---------74:34----------
calm down yeah and it's gonna be with


---------74:35----------
you for the rest of your life but it


---------74:36----------
doesn't have to control you thoughts


---------74:42----------
questions yeah well I mean I I agree


---------74:48----------
with everything you're saying I just


---------74:50----------
don't know how I have never yeah I've


---------74:53----------
never I've never found it in fact one of


---------74:57----------
the really sad things a few shrinks past


---------75:04----------
my case along sure which is that that


---------75:09----------
that's some of the work that that's one


---------75:13----------
of the worst feelings yeah but that's I


---------75:15----------
mean that's something you must be very


---------75:17----------
coastal with because people um


---------75:20----------
passing it made me it eventually made me


---------75:26----------
get to a point where I just thought it


---------75:38----------
almost made me feel special in a weird


---------75:41----------
way like my case was so [ __ ] up


---------75:45----------
because I didn't have violent tendencies


---------75:48----------
didn't have drug abuse


---------75:50----------
I was always straightedge I've never


---------75:51----------
even dabbled and stuff etc I was just


---------75:53----------
this depressed anxious kid and for some


---------75:56----------
reason shrinks and therapists were


---------75:58----------
giving up and so it made me think there


---------76:02----------
was just no end game because we always


---------76:06----------
tried to hit it with so many different


---------76:08----------
things


---------76:10----------
CBT different medication different


---------76:13----------
styles different approaches and nothing


---------76:15----------
ever worked so it always just comes full


---------76:19----------
circle to doesn't matter how I'm feeling


---------76:23----------
I'm gonna get up every day because I


---------76:24----------
must yeah because you know so that's


---------76:30----------
that's the thing right so like that's


---------76:32----------
what we need to change is that like it


---------76:34----------
does matter what you're feeling that's


---------76:38----------
what's got to change because like right


---------76:41----------
now you have all of this just emotion


---------76:43----------
pent up within you and it has nowhere to


---------76:45----------
go


---------76:45----------
so it starts to cannibalize like that's


---------76:47----------
what the psychoanalysts I think I mean


---------76:49----------
I'm not an expert in this mean by like


---------76:51----------
depression is anger turned against the


---------76:53----------
self and you're not willing to give your


---------76:56----------
anger to others so it's just got like in


---------76:58----------
you know it's like it just doesn't


---------77:00----------
disappear like that's not how emotions


---------77:03----------
work and so there may be a lot of stuff


---------77:06----------
around gaming and things in terms of


---------77:07----------
like coping mechanisms and things like


---------77:09----------
that um but yeah I mean I'm hopeful for


---------77:13----------
you in the sense that or let me put it


---------77:16----------
this way I'm not willing to give up hope


---------77:18----------
on you yet because I think that you have


---------77:20----------
a very good understanding of what is


---------77:23----------
going on inside you I think it's good


---------77:25----------
that you understand that this thing has


---------77:27----------
a vested interest in staying alive and


---------77:28----------
staying strong and that you do have to


---------77:31----------
bypass it completely agree you're not


---------77:34----------
there are there ways to do that I mean


---------77:35----------
literally meditation is the process of


---------77:37----------
shutting off your mind and you if you


---------77:39----------
shut off your mind this thing will turn


---------77:40----------
off too so anyway I think there are a


---------77:44----------
lot of things that we're gonna I'm gonna


---------77:45----------
talk about a little bit later in terms


---------77:48----------
of Karma which is like how to find


---------77:50----------
purpose and meaning in life cuz I think


---------77:51----------
you've got a lot of other stuff too like


---------77:53----------
sort of the the what would you call like


---------77:55----------
the reaching the plateau and it feeling


---------77:56----------
empty summit syndrome yes the actual


---------78:00----------
term for it yeah we're gonna actually


---------78:02----------
talk about I mean that that's so so I


---------78:04----------
prepared something like a lecture which


---------78:07----------
I think is the first step to solving


---------78:09----------
that problem there are other things that


---------78:12----------
that you know I'm hopeful for you I mean


---------78:15----------
I I've worked with some people who


---------78:17----------
really are treatment refractory and


---------78:18----------
sometimes I'm not able to help them but


---------78:22----------
I've also had a fair number of people


---------78:23----------
whose other psychiatrists turn away and


---------78:26----------
and like have seen person after person


---------78:28----------
after person after person and end up


---------78:30----------
trying some of these things and then


---------78:32----------
they get better


---------78:33----------
and so I'm foolishly optimistic no okay


---------78:43----------
what are you feeling


---------78:48----------
so bite my initial thought right is what


---------78:53----------
type of people were the ones that you


---------78:55----------
couldn't help now it's my initial


---------78:57----------
thought


---------78:57----------
and then what kind of demographic would


---------79:00----------
that be and based on the language that


---------79:04----------
you've used with me in the short time


---------79:06----------
that we've interacted with each other


---------79:08----------
things that you've talked about and the


---------79:09----------
questions what type of personality would


---------79:12----------
not be receptive to such stuff and then


---------79:16----------
I try to match it to mine and I look for


---------79:19----------
the mirrors and the Cascades and try to


---------79:21----------
think what that could mean for yesterday


---------79:24----------
and puzzle yeah so you know what we're


---------79:27----------
gonna do okay well not answer your


---------79:30----------
question okay


---------79:32----------
nice right so what where is that


---------79:35----------
question operating no I'm just I'm


---------79:38----------
relaying it to you that that's my


---------79:41----------
initial thought X that's all so now I'm


---------79:43----------
gonna ask you where is that question


---------79:44----------
operating what part of you does it


---------79:45----------
operate them


---------79:48----------
it's kind of a weird question um the be


---------79:52----------
hope part yes so even simply it operates


---------79:56----------
within your MO so basically right but


---------79:58----------
the light and will refer to it as the


---------80:00----------
light in the darkness


---------80:01----------
right so the light wants to ask


---------80:04----------
something and the darkness drives it out


---------80:06----------
not only that but sometimes the light


---------80:09----------
gets answers in the darkness co-op's the


---------80:11----------
answers and reinforces its beliefs about


---------80:13----------
you correct yes yes that's why I'm not


---------80:17----------
gonna answer I'm not gonna play that


---------80:18----------
[ __ ] game because no matter what I


---------80:20----------
say right right the darkness is gonna


---------80:21----------
win you're right if I play the game the


---------80:24----------
darkness is gonna win because it it


---------80:27----------
takes all of the beautiful questions


---------80:28----------
that the light asks and then warps them


---------80:30----------
and turns it into this weird zombie


---------80:32----------
salami


---------80:34----------
right so right now I feel like that's


---------80:37----------
like it's like it's it's it's a one


---------80:40----------
battle right but then it's perceiving


---------80:43----------
the it it's a war right yeah so I know


---------80:48----------
that's really [ __ ] up today or maybe


---------80:50----------
it maybe it's just not to say that I


---------80:52----------
know I'm okay


---------80:54----------
just you could think whatever like


---------80:56----------
you're conceptualizing abstracting


---------80:58----------
understanding understanding and we're


---------81:01----------
just not gonna indulge and it looks like


---------81:04----------
okay I should say something because


---------81:05----------
we've had a couple people Sears up his


---------81:07----------
gifted us like a thousand subs so thank


---------81:10----------
you sir so what I can't actually count


---------81:14----------
how many there are


---------81:16----------
but I probably should have I don't know


---------81:18----------
people have been sometimes people are


---------81:20----------
like gifting and donating a lot and then


---------81:22----------
just get lost in here yeah so people


---------81:26----------
thank you all for the subs I I mean I


---------81:30----------
don't know there's just too many on the


---------81:32----------
screen so maybe it's less people are


---------81:35----------
saying it's 40 or to 50 40 I don't know


---------81:38----------
I can't count I'm a psychiatrist because


---------81:40----------
I can't do math if I could do math I


---------81:44----------
would have been engineer mathematician


---------81:47----------
economist finance okay last questions LS


---------81:53----------
for you huh any questions you have no no


---------81:58----------
yeah okay let me see there are a couple


---------82:00----------
of questions


---------82:05----------
okay so here's a question question anger


---------82:09----------
turned against yourself any backstory or


---------82:11----------
a book whatever to indulge into it


---------82:13----------
because it seems crucial I don't know


---------82:15----------
what that means but anger turned against


---------82:17----------
yourself yes so I mean I don't know how


---------82:19----------
else to explain it but I don't know if


---------82:21----------
you guys are getting this but ls has a


---------82:25----------
really pathologic absence of anger


---------82:30----------
right unless like you should be angry at


---------82:34----------
all comics well this is interesting


---------82:37----------
I never felt anger until this year I


---------82:41----------
what I mean by anger is I never fell


---------82:45----------
urges to lash out or anything okay but


---------82:53----------
I've had instances of it this year but


---------82:56----------
it was I attributed it to certain


---------82:58----------
triggers which I've identified and then


---------83:01----------
managed okay so it yeah everyone is


---------83:06----------
talking about you playing league and how


---------83:08----------
that's clearly BS so let me just okay so


---------83:12----------
what they're referring to there's a rate


---------83:14----------
there's rage compilation clips and


---------83:16----------
basically what's happening is when you


---------83:18----------
stream for ten twelve hours a day


---------83:19----------
and you have people tell you things that


---------83:25----------
aren't true or ask you things repeatedly


---------83:27----------
over and over there's breaking points


---------83:29----------
when you have so much other noise going


---------83:31----------
on and so I lash out because it feels


---------83:35----------
like any answers I give or say is


---------83:37----------
irrelevant anyway and I already don't


---------83:39----------
want to be doing what I'm doing but I'm


---------83:41----------
doing it out of fear and they can't see


---------83:43----------
it as such and so I lash out that I


---------83:46----------
can't actually convey to them what is


---------83:48----------
truly happening and so I don't I


---------83:50----------
wouldn't call that anger in the way that


---------83:52----------
someone else would call it anger I don't


---------83:55----------
know what you just said but once again


---------83:57----------
that's a very beautiful intellectual you


---------84:00----------
know like analytical I mean I don't know


---------84:03----------
I thought I thought that much is clear


---------84:06----------
to my mind you don't blame them I'm not


---------84:08----------
trying to I'm not trying to like say


---------84:10----------
that what you're saying I'm not trying


---------84:11----------
to dismiss what you're saying I really


---------84:14----------
do think I'm not being sarcastic I think


---------84:15----------
it's like very well thought out and very


---------84:16----------
well analyzed I'm just saying that like


---------84:18----------
that's not that's not what's gonna get


---------84:21----------
you better I also think that like rage


---------84:23----------
rage in gaming is it so it's it's whole


---------84:25----------
separate thing right like that's yeah


---------84:28----------
it's just manifests itself through


---------84:30----------
gaming you start getting angry not at


---------84:33----------
the game it's you're thinking about what


---------84:35----------
someone else is doing to you you start


---------84:37----------
taking it personal or you start thinking


---------84:38----------
their life problems and struggles that


---------84:41----------
you're being made aware of duty


---------84:43----------
things that are happening like maybe you


---------84:46----------
committed 20 20 minutes or 30 minutes to


---------84:48----------
a game the game didn't go your way


---------84:49----------
because the game didn't go your way you


---------84:51----------
only had one hour free time that day you


---------84:52----------
think about all the time that was wasted


---------84:53----------
you really got to learn how to just shut


---------84:55----------
that off man I can't it's always going I


---------84:59----------
know times the that's why I'm saying you


---------85:01----------
got to learn how to shut it off just


---------85:09----------
Jesus okay I'm gonna give you another


---------85:11----------
question we're gonna ask him other


---------85:12----------
question okay no the only time it shuts


---------85:17----------
off is when I'm eating if that's


---------85:19----------
interesting for you okay so I actually


---------85:21----------
get very mad talk to me when I'm eating


---------85:23----------
it's peaceful okay so you're analyzing


---------85:27----------
again I'm always analyzing yes I know so


---------85:31----------
just just stop first I'm trying to catch


---------85:34----------
on okay yes I wanted twitch chat' saying


---------85:38----------
eat more feelings okay how do you know


---------85:41----------
when you should cut ties in a toxic


---------85:43----------
relationship or invest in trying to make


---------85:45----------
it better okay so that's kind of an


---------85:49----------
interesting question any thoughts about


---------85:50----------
that


---------85:50----------
tell us how how to I'm sorry how do you


---------85:55----------
know when to invest and cut ties in a


---------85:58----------
toxic relationship or invest in making


---------86:00----------
it better when both or what I guess when


---------86:13----------
one party is heading in another


---------86:16----------
direction than the other would be a


---------86:20----------
pretty good indicator of when ties need


---------86:22----------
to be cut because normally relationships


---------86:25----------
are founded upon mutual interests or


---------86:30----------
mutual direction right I think that's


---------86:33----------
actually how humans can originally


---------86:36----------
become attracted right is when they


---------86:37----------
realize that there's some sort of


---------86:40----------
direction that they can go with one


---------86:42----------
another sometimes there's really [ __ ]


---------86:44----------
up versions where people look for broken


---------86:46----------
people because they realized the


---------86:48----------
direction they want to go in is by


---------86:49----------
dragging someone and that's obviously a


---------86:51----------
dark path but toxic if there's ever a


---------86:56----------
separation of paths in either one party


---------87:00----------
I would imagine that would be best to


---------87:02----------
cut ties okay yeah I mean I think that


---------87:05----------
makes sense I think the challenge is


---------87:07----------
that a lot of people have trouble seeing


---------87:09----------
that and they have trouble seeing that


---------87:12----------
you guys let people aren't on the same


---------87:14----------
page so my answer to that question would


---------87:16----------
be a little bit different so I think


---------87:17----------
when it comes to a relationship this is


---------87:20----------
I guess we're


---------87:20----------
to the talk that we're gonna have which


---------87:22----------
a lot of these questions do so that


---------87:23----------
tells me it's a good talk so you should


---------87:27----------
do your daughter mine the relationship


---------87:28----------
and you shouldn't do more than what


---------87:30----------
you're autonomous so I think the what I


---------87:32----------
mean by that is your Dharma means your


---------87:33----------
duty or responsibility so you should do


---------87:35----------
what your part of the relationship is


---------87:37----------
and you should not do more so for


---------87:41----------
example I think a lot of when you talk


---------87:43----------
about invest in making it better a lot


---------87:45----------
of people invest in relationships trying


---------87:48----------
to fix them but you can't fix a


---------87:51----------
relationship it takes two people to fix


---------87:54----------
a relationship so how do you it's and


---------87:57----------
it's not about cutting ties or investing


---------87:59----------
it's about doing what you should do


---------88:02----------
doing your daughter more to the


---------88:03----------
relationship and then not doing any more


---------88:07----------
so another brilliant psychiatrist once


---------88:11----------
told me something that I think is just


---------88:13----------
amazing the doctor who goes at the extra


---------88:16----------
mile for the patient goes a mile too far


---------88:20----------
okay and so I think you should do what


---------88:25----------
you're supposed to do in a relationship


---------88:26----------
and then like that's it don't do more


---------88:30----------
because you can't do the other person's


---------88:33----------
portion right like you can take 50% of


---------88:36----------
the relationship on your shoulders but


---------88:38----------
if you cross over into 51% or 60% or 70%


---------88:40----------
you can't take that away from them it's


---------88:43----------
just not going to work it's not gonna be


---------88:45----------
a healthy relationship which doesn't


---------88:47----------
mean that all relationships are like


---------88:48----------
5050 like sometimes you know doing your


---------88:51----------
part of the relationship is temporarily


---------88:53----------
or even sustainably doing more than then


---------88:57----------
they are so it's not about 50/50 it's


---------88:59----------
like what's your tournament so you know


---------89:02----------
I I don't mean to say I think you should


---------89:04----------
be your part and sometimes your part is


---------89:06----------
50/50 if you've got like a younger


---------89:08----------
brother who's like disabled or


---------89:11----------
handicapped like your Dharma in that


---------89:13----------
relationship is gonna be greater than


---------89:15----------
his in terms of like bringing the


---------89:17----------
groceries in from the car so it's to do


---------89:19----------
your entire mind to do no more so I


---------89:22----------
think you should invest what you're


---------89:23----------
supposed to and then don't I and if they


---------89:26----------
don't reciprocate or they don't do what


---------89:28----------
they're supposed to do then then that


---------89:29----------
relationship is over not even then like


---------89:32----------
cut ties implies that you never


---------89:34----------
engage in that relationship again but I


---------89:36----------
think that that too so you may have like


---------89:37----------
let's say your your LS is estranged with


---------89:39----------
his mom so I think his Dharma is to do


---------89:42----------
you know it depends on the specifics of


---------89:44----------
the situation but generally speaking to


---------89:46----------
try to be a good son and if at some


---------89:47----------
point you know I I'm not saying that you


---------89:49----------
I'm not placing a judgment on you but in


---------89:52----------
my mind I think that if at some point


---------89:54----------
she comes around and and starts to


---------89:56----------
behave like normally and recognizes that


---------89:59----------
things have changed and she's really


---------90:01----------
trying to turn over a new leaf I think


---------90:03----------
yeah it is a dharma of a psychotic yeah


---------90:06----------
to like meeting the right way yeah yeah


---------90:08----------
but but that LS can't can't go 90


---------90:12----------
percent of the way like that's just not


---------90:13----------
gonna be healthy it's not gonna work so


---------90:18----------
that's that's okay so has anything with


---------90:21----------
your parents relationship affected you


---------90:23----------
in any way that would contribute to the


---------90:25----------
way your mental state works


---------90:28----------
not be intruding or anything but


---------90:30----------
wondering if it could be a route to such


---------90:32----------
a problem which it may not but in the


---------90:34----------
odd case if it is please please try to


---------90:36----------
reflect on this so do you think anything


---------90:39----------
with your parents relationship affected


---------90:40----------
you in any way that would contribute to


---------90:42----------
your the way your mental state works


---------90:46----------
everything yeah right my hand literally


---------90:49----------
everything hearing hearing my own name


---------90:53----------
is really weird like even right now


---------90:55----------
right we keep using LS hearing Nick is


---------91:00----------
or well hearing Nicholas is really weird


---------91:05----------
because that that's only what my mother


---------91:08----------
would call me sometimes but usually I


---------91:15----------
only heard Nick from like my uncle's my


---------91:18----------
cousins etc right and so if I didn't see


---------91:21----------
them that often where obviously there's


---------91:24----------
other ways to refer to someone in person


---------91:26----------
which is just to address them in a


---------91:27----------
generic sense like hey or just starts


---------91:31----------
talking in the direction and whatnot but


---------91:34----------
hearing derogatory words used to refer


---------91:38----------
to me it was very common growing up so


---------91:43----------
you know hearing bastard or


---------91:46----------
son-of-a-bitch


---------91:47----------
or [ __ ] you know anything uh different


---------91:54----------
different people like not all like yet


---------92:00----------
people that were yeah yeah family


---------92:02----------
members that I had eight people growing


---------92:07----------
up my Gretel my grandparents my uncle's


---------92:12----------
my sister


---------92:16----------
and aunts on yeah I don't know my stance


---------92:20----------
on yeah


---------92:21----------
so and then my mother ended up getting


---------92:24----------
her own house when I think I turned 12


---------92:29----------
she ended up getting her own house but I


---------92:31----------
didn't move in with her until after my


---------92:33----------
grandfather passed okay and then I lived


---------92:38----------
with my father and stepmother briefly


---------92:41----------
and then I went back to living with my


---------92:43----------
father and stepmother and then I ended


---------92:46----------
up living with my stepmother because my


---------92:48----------
stepmother and my father got a divorce


---------92:49----------
and my stepmother kept me unbeknownst to


---------92:55----------
my mother but refused to let my father


---------92:57----------
take me


---------93:00----------
hmm my stepmoms one of the closest


---------93:05----------
people in my life


---------93:06----------
still it's basically her and my


---------93:07----------
grandmother now yeah it sounds like


---------93:10----------
she's more like a real mom yeah I would


---------93:15----------
I would call her mom I don't but I mean


---------93:18----------
I I could for all intents and purposes I


---------93:22----------
have known her since I was two or


---------93:24----------
something


---------93:26----------
yeah so another question for you so for


---------93:29----------
LS does he realize that he has viewers


---------93:32----------
that care about him and respect him does


---------93:33----------
that affect him I've thought about this


---------93:40----------
a lot I get really mad when people


---------93:45----------
credit me with things that I don't


---------93:46----------
actually deserve or that I didn't do I


---------93:49----------
get really mad in general with false


---------93:51----------
credit or I get really angry when people


---------93:56----------
don't properly evaluate people in this


---------94:01----------
industry or just in general so sometimes


---------94:04----------
when I talk to people that are like fans


---------94:09----------
of me or acquaintances or something if


---------94:11----------
they falsely attributed me with me with


---------94:14----------
stuff due to like nepotism or something


---------94:16----------
else I actually get pretty angry not


---------94:19----------
angry in the way that we're talking


---------94:20----------
about anger I just get very very


---------94:22----------
frustrated and I want them to do better


---------94:24----------
or I want them to not credit me falsely


---------94:28----------
hurt or something like that and return


---------94:31----------
in regards to like people that care


---------94:34----------
that's


---------94:36----------
it's a really weird thing to say because


---------94:40----------
people always say that they they care


---------94:42----------
but only


---------94:46----------
if it benefits them in some way is how I


---------94:49----------
perceive that


---------94:52----------
because people always say they care no


---------94:55----------
they don't they care when it benefits


---------94:57----------
them in some way because altruism truism


---------95:00----------
am I saying this right [ __ ] genuine


---------95:04----------
care or one-sided I've never seen


---------95:08----------
instances of it there's always something


---------95:11----------
that is benefiting it sometimes maybe


---------95:14----------
someone will drop groceries you'll go


---------95:17----------
over a girl or a little smile is falling


---------95:22----------
apart


---------95:25----------
yeah it's clipping out the hole up all


---------95:28----------
the way freaking it


---------95:31----------
Oh hold on let me reconnect okay but we


---------95:38----------
don't need


---------95:42----------
so I think what we managed to do is when


---------95:45----------
we asked LS how do you feel about your


---------95:47----------
viewers caring about you we managed to


---------95:50----------
actually answer the previous question


---------95:51----------
which is where the was the way that you


---------95:54----------
raised by your parents does that affect


---------95:56----------
your mental state and here we see the


---------95:58----------
answer right this is the answer we're


---------96:00----------
seeing it so now you guys see


---------96:09----------
Hey can you hear me yep as your dream


---------96:11----------
live again okay yep my stream has been


---------96:13----------
live so the the grocery thing is


---------96:16----------
interesting


---------96:17----------
so I there's there's there's two points


---------96:20----------
of it one is observed by public and one


---------96:24----------
is not observed so Wendy I'm confused so


---------96:29----------
okay so if if someone is carrying


---------96:32----------
groceries and they drop their groceries


---------96:34----------
and someone goes over and if someone


---------96:39----------
goes over and picks up the groceries and


---------96:40----------
gives it to the how to keep the person


---------96:42----------
says thank you and smiles and there's


---------96:46----------
people that can perceive that as they


---------96:49----------
care for the other person but what they


---------96:52----------
care about in my eyes or most likely is


---------96:55----------
seeing the smile in the thank you so


---------96:58----------
that they can feel self gratitude or


---------97:00----------
something else it's not a hundred


---------97:03----------
percent nice or a hundred percent caring


---------97:06----------
there is something in it for them


---------97:10----------
and then the non observed one is the one


---------97:13----------
that I have to think more about when


---------97:15----------
there's no one else around to see the


---------97:17----------
groceries


---------97:18----------
what are they really doing that for but


---------97:21----------
then maybe it's because of a memory of


---------97:23----------
another relative or something else and


---------97:25----------
they imagine that that person would like


---------97:27----------
if someone did it for them and so


---------97:29----------
they're doing it to live vicariously


---------97:32----------
through a memory or something I don't


---------97:34----------
[ __ ] know anyways um I don't even


---------97:37----------
think most of the people living in my


---------97:39----------
house actually care about me


---------97:42----------
which is fine I think that they're aware


---------97:46----------
of Who I am in this industry and what it


---------97:51----------
means to potentially be around me and


---------97:54----------
that's fine I care about like setting


---------97:58----------
them up and making sure that they have


---------98:00----------
stuff that I didn't have in my early


---------98:02----------
years in Korea and as it's it's a really


---------98:05----------
weird feeling what do you get out of


---------98:08----------
that


---------98:10----------
uh well I the the loneliness thing sort


---------98:14----------
of covered right I've thought about that


---------98:15----------
angle that we talked about earlier


---------98:17----------
there's people around I obviously get


---------98:20----------
the yeah I do still feel lonely but


---------98:26----------
there's a difference between feeling


---------98:29----------
lonely and having my own thoughts echo


---------98:32----------
off itself versus there's other people


---------98:36----------
around it's something weird I don't know


---------98:39----------
maybe it has to do with something with


---------98:40----------
yeah I don't think you understand what


---------98:43----------
caring looks like I made okay to be


---------98:50----------
blunt


---------98:51----------
it sucks yeah I mean I think people


---------98:54----------
genuinely care about you and I don't


---------98:57----------
think you know getting back to your


---------98:59----------
wonderful question which is why are you


---------99:01----------
this way and I think it's because you


---------99:04----------
didn't have a whole lot of people


---------99:05----------
Express caring about you and goes back


---------99:09----------
to all the stuff about you know not


---------99:11----------
being able to be the person that you are


---------99:12----------
not being accepted for who you are being


---------99:15----------
shaped in one way being blamed at one


---------99:16----------
way there we go again there it is


---------99:18----------
fairness


---------99:19----------
so notice yeah notice it notice of


---------99:23----------
course I can notice it okay so so close


---------99:26----------
your eyes close your eyes okay close


---------99:33----------
your eyes


---------99:35----------
okay sure okay now nope keep it closed


---------99:40----------
okay close close your eyes okay okay


---------99:44----------
notice that thing within you that wants


---------99:46----------
to speak right what does it feel like I


---------99:52----------
feel like context I feel like every


---------99:58----------
piece of a puzzle matters and that it


---------100:02----------
can't truly be understood without every


---------100:04----------
piece okay so so and is it important to


---------100:08----------
understand a puzzle


---------100:09----------
I feel like we're making we're trying to


---------100:15----------
solve the wheel of fortune puzzle


---------100:17----------
without just having every letter when Z


---------100:19----------
you knock with more lines what do you


---------100:21----------
feel I feel like I want you to know


---------100:26----------
every letter what does that feel like


---------100:28----------
in your body it feels like a it feels


---------100:33----------
like an absence of a hundred percent


---------100:35----------
okay what does that feel like good now


---------100:37----------
we're getting somewhere


---------100:42----------
yeah it just doesn't feel complete it's


---------100:45----------
empty yes


---------100:46----------
ninety-nine percent is the same thing as


---------100:47----------
zero beautiful what does that feel like


---------100:51----------
describe the physical sensations yes


---------100:54----------
good frustration yeah frustration with


---------100:59----------
who uh everything now you're just people


---------101:06----------
huh frustrated with you yeah yeah myself


---------101:10----------
frustrated with me no not well yeah kind


---------101:15----------
of


---------101:15----------
there we go good job good job


---------101:20----------
yeah but everything yeah good yeah


---------101:25----------
what's your mind doing right now


---------101:29----------
compartmentalizing the conversation okay


---------101:32----------
right but for a moment it wasn't now


---------101:35----------
you're back we so we took that thing


---------101:37----------
whether we call the badness or the demon


---------101:40----------
or whatever and we knocked it off base


---------101:42----------
for a few seconds few seconds yeah yeah


---------101:45----------
and now it's back it righted itself


---------101:48----------
right it's an operating it yeah and the


---------101:51----------
goal is to keep trying to get small


---------101:53----------
victories there it is there it is you


---------101:57----------
see it it's back good so open your eyes


---------101:59----------
yeah good you've taken your first step


---------102:01----------
forward how does that feel I've done


---------102:07----------
this a few times good its yeah it's okay


---------102:10----------
in the moments


---------102:11----------
it feels relieving and then it sucks


---------102:14----------
right back in yes and okay let's


---------102:16----------
understand this okay cuz we should okay


---------102:19----------
we got to stop this interview soon but


---------102:20----------
let's understand this because I can't


---------102:22----------
let these go


---------102:23----------
okay yeah why do you get sucked back in


---------102:26----------
you feel relief right and you felt


---------102:29----------
relief because you were anger at who who


---------102:32----------
who were you angry at um I think that


---------102:39----------
you're respecting me to say me here


---------102:41----------
you're expecting me to say me but now


---------102:45----------
I'm starting to think about childhood


---------102:48----------
people right now [ __ ] no you're you're


---------102:52----------
angry at me right like you were like why


---------102:54----------
doesn't this [ __ ] guy let me talk I


---------102:56----------
just want to talk like no no I just


---------103:01----------
actually started giving angry childhood


---------103:03----------
people


---------103:03----------
oh okay weird all right so baby this is


---------103:09----------
gonna be way easier than I thought I


---------103:11----------
thought that we would have this time


---------103:13----------
where like me you get angry at me and


---------103:15----------
that would be displaced anger and it


---------103:16----------
would take you a while to be angry at


---------103:20----------
people in my childhood I played out all


---------103:23----------
the lines and I have Rove or I I arrived


---------103:26----------
at the end of the lines it must original


---------103:29----------
it must deduce down to that's not what


---------103:33----------
I'm talking about I'm not talking about


---------103:35----------
the end of the line so we're gonna have


---------103:36----------
to do this again so we're gonna train


---------103:37----------
your mind to meditate and notice what is


---------103:41----------
in the moment because I do I would be


---------103:44----------
very surprised if you were actually


---------103:45----------
angry at people in your childhood my


---------103:47----------
sense not genuinely I actually I'm


---------103:51----------
thinking about three in particular I


---------103:53----------
know that sounds weird but are you


---------103:55----------
normally angry with people in your


---------103:57----------
childhood or is this new for you


---------103:58----------
no this is this is this is kind of new


---------104:00----------
I'm thinking about it a lot right now


---------104:03----------
okay so then you keep going so I'm gonna


---------104:05----------
just leave you where you are and you


---------104:07----------
just sort that out I'm actually gonna


---------104:11----------
say normally rationalize it no yes you


---------104:14----------
just okay so let's go back to why do you


---------104:17----------
stop feeling relief do you understand


---------104:20----------
this


---------104:22----------
other thoughts start making more noise


---------104:24----------
and then exactly so your mind


---------104:26----------
reactivates and you start deducing again


---------104:30----------
and when you are deducing you don't feel


---------104:32----------
good because your deductions are full of


---------104:36----------
like cognitive biases so the machine


---------104:38----------
starts that's why it's temporary because


---------104:40----------
you can't restrain the machine the


---------104:43----------
machine of the mind is just going going


---------104:44----------
going and it's deducing deducing


---------104:46----------
deducing understanding understanding


---------104:47----------
understanding which is brilliant


---------104:48----------
brilliant brilliant and also away from


---------104:51----------
your feelings away from your feelings


---------104:53----------
away from your feelings yeah so we just


---------104:57----------
the less your machine is active the more


---------105:00----------
you can restrain yourself and the more


---------105:02----------
you can just be in the moment the more


---------105:05----------
you will start to feel better and like


---------105:09----------
understand things like people in your


---------105:10----------
childhood deserve hatred like that's


---------105:15----------
what you need right is to like if


---------105:18----------
someone did something shitty to you


---------105:19----------
instead of blaming yourself blame them


---------105:22----------
and it sounds like you just took a step


---------105:24----------
forward so yippee thanks good okay I


---------105:30----------
gotta take a break for a little bit okay


---------105:33----------
and then I'm gonna talk about in karma


---------105:35----------
you're welcome to tune in I think if you


---------105:37----------
want to reflect on this because it's


---------105:39----------
like you know sweet sweet high-grade


---------105:42----------
opium for a heroin addict for your mind


---------105:44----------
- like reflect on something new then by


---------105:46----------
all means do so but notice like you


---------105:49----------
notice how you feel now and notice how


---------105:50----------
you're gonna feel at the end of that


---------105:51----------
reflection I don't know exactly what to


---------105:54----------
predict there but good job today and


---------105:56----------
then after you finish cuz I don't want


---------106:00----------
you to I don't want to pull away I


---------106:01----------
already pulled your mind away from


---------106:03----------
things already so at the end and like


---------106:05----------
maybe 45 minutes or so I'm gonna teach


---------106:08----------
meditation if it's not if it's not super


---------106:11----------
late for you you can watch it later but


---------106:12----------

---------106:15----------
love it okay Ellis you will love it once


---------106:17----------

---------106:18----------

---------106:22----------

---------106:26----------

---------106:28----------

---------106:34----------

---------106:36----------
