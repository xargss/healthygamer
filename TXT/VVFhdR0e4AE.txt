full-time stand-up comedian well before


---------00:59----------

---------01:00----------

---------01:02----------
the gist of it really


---------01:04----------
that's cool so you just stand up and and


---------01:06----------
you you said you do


---------01:07----------
like commentary videos yeah so we'll


---------01:10----------
just uh


---------01:11----------
you know talk about things that may be


---------01:13----------
happening in the political sphere or


---------01:14----------
just


---------01:15----------
social commentary or sometimes we'll


---------01:16----------
just uh you know just talk about


---------01:18----------
anything really dating that's cool man


---------01:20----------
yeah yeah and um is there something can


---------01:22----------
you just tell us where people can find


---------01:24----------
you like what your youtube channel is


---------01:26----------
yeah if they just go on on youtube and


---------01:27----------
they put abba and


---------01:29----------
and preach like preaching and abbots


---------01:32----------
with one b so you don't have to make the


---------01:33----------
dancing queen references


---------01:34----------
but uh yeah yeah one b then you'll be


---------01:37----------
able to find this yeah


---------01:38----------
yeah um cool that's awesome man and so


---------01:42----------
is there something in particular you


---------01:43----------
wanted to talk about today or something


---------01:44----------
that i can help you with


---------01:46----------
yeah um essentially i guess the


---------01:50----------
focal points are like the two things i


---------01:52----------
really was hoping to cover was was


---------01:53----------
mentorship


---------01:54----------
and um loss of loved ones


---------01:58----------
and so wow those two things can overlap


---------02:00----------
a little bit but uh


---------02:01----------
but yeah oh that's actually sad if those


---------02:05----------
overlap


---------02:06----------
oh yeah um which one do you want to


---------02:10----------
start with uh we can start with lost


---------02:12----------
loved one um


---------02:14----------
i suppose my question centers around the


---------02:16----------
idea that


---------02:19----------
is the loss of you know how they they


---------02:22----------
often say like


---------02:23----------
time heals all wounds i i question


---------02:26----------
whether or not that's true for all


---------02:29----------
things and when is it


---------02:31----------
not true and so yeah that's my question


---------02:35----------
yeah so um i think you have an answer


---------02:37----------
that you suspect already so what's your


---------02:39----------
answer


---------02:41----------
um i guess it depends on


---------02:44----------
how you handle the wound i suppose well


---------02:46----------
spent


---------02:47----------
and i said i'd say the same thing so i i


---------02:50----------
think abby you know sometimes people


---------02:51----------
come on here with questions


---------02:53----------
and they expect me to give them answers


---------02:56----------
i think it's it's maybe not questions i


---------02:58----------
have so much as it is like i feel like


---------03:00----------
sometimes i'm too close to the problem


---------03:01----------
and as a result you know when you put


---------03:03----------
your hand right for your face it's


---------03:04----------
blurry


---------03:05----------
yep i feel like i can't find a way to


---------03:07----------
get enough distance to get some decent


---------03:09----------
perspective so i think it's just


---------03:11----------
um finding a space where i'm comfortable


---------03:12----------
enough to allow somebody else to be my


---------03:14----------
eyes


---------03:14----------
to to see the where i can i think that's


---------03:18----------
a beautiful way to put


---------03:19----------
what we do here um because just to kind


---------03:22----------
of clarify i think you're the one who


---------03:23----------
actually is going to have the answers


---------03:24----------
and


---------03:25----------
we're just going to try to help you see


---------03:27----------
what you already know and understand


---------03:29----------
and in short i'd agree with you that i


---------03:31----------
don't think time


---------03:32----------
in and of itself heals all wounds i


---------03:36----------
think that some things


---------03:38----------
the way that we treat the wound i think


---------03:39----------
is exactly what i'd say so some people


---------03:42----------
you know the reason that time doesn't


---------03:43----------
heal all wounds is because


---------03:45----------
they dwell in the past so it's never


---------03:47----------
they never really get time


---------03:49----------
right like the past becomes the present


---------03:52----------
and yesterday


---------03:53----------
you're living in yesterday today


---------03:56----------
and so you never really get time


---------04:00----------
and so learning how to do that can be


---------04:02----------
hard for some people it's not


---------04:03----------
you know some people it comes kind of


---------04:05----------
naturally but i think sometimes maybe


---------04:07----------
it'll help can you just tell us a little


---------04:08----------
bit about


---------04:09----------
what happened in your case and and maybe


---------04:11----------
who you lost


---------04:12----------
yeah yeah so i lost my father when i was


---------04:15----------
uh


---------04:16----------
21. so that's about nine years almost 10


---------04:18----------
years now


---------04:19----------
and um i suppose


---------04:24----------
the absence that was felt kind of never


---------04:26----------
stopped being felt


---------04:27----------
and i would have interactions with


---------04:28----------
people and i realized it was always


---------04:30----------
going to be a tender spot for me


---------04:31----------
which is why it's like a traditional


---------04:33----------
topic i avoid all together even with


---------04:34----------
people that are very close to me


---------04:36----------
um and i think just looking at that and


---------04:39----------
recognizing that it's so tender after so


---------04:40----------
long i just


---------04:42----------
kind of always had issues with it yeah


---------04:44----------
so let's start with this what's tender


---------04:45----------
about the subject for you


---------04:48----------
um just just knowing that the reality is


---------04:50----------
still there and there's nothing that be


---------04:52----------
that can be done to to to change that


---------04:55----------
and and the longing


---------04:58----------
that i have for that absence you know


---------05:01----------
being


---------05:02----------
filled or whatnot or the person in


---------05:04----------
question


---------05:05----------
is just not going to go away so i think


---------05:07----------
just kind of always knowing that and


---------05:09----------
and knowing that can't be fixed it's


---------05:10----------
just like well you know i accept that


---------05:11----------
it's gone but


---------05:13----------
or that that he's gone but um


---------05:19----------
but even though i accept it doesn't make


---------05:21----------
it any easier


---------05:23----------
yeah yeah sucks man


---------05:26----------
yeah yeah right you know i think it's


---------05:29----------
interesting because


---------05:30----------
we sort of i i nowadays everyone talks


---------05:33----------
about mindfulness


---------05:34----------
and acceptance and how acceptance is the


---------05:37----------
way forward


---------05:38----------
and and what i'm hearing you say abba is


---------05:40----------
that you know you've accepted that your


---------05:41----------
dad


---------05:42----------
is you know gone which is right but it


---------05:45----------
still hurts and that's not what you were


---------05:49----------
told


---------05:51----------
right that acceptance is supposed to


---------05:52----------
make it feel better


---------05:54----------
right and that time is supposed to feel


---------05:57----------
better but it's not


---------05:58----------
feeling better right


---------06:01----------
can you tell me about your dad yeah


---------06:05----------
um so me and my my father had a fairly


---------06:08----------
complicated relationship


---------06:09----------
uh when i was young enough my parents


---------06:11----------
ended up divorcing and then my


---------06:13----------
my father moved back to um ethiopia


---------06:17----------
and and so as a result it was like a


---------06:19----------
separation period where i didn't see him


---------06:21----------
much and then afterwards i was uh um


---------06:25----------
kind of i had to leave my mom's uh place


---------06:27----------
to go live with my dad for a number of


---------06:28----------
years in ethiopia so that's where i like


---------06:30----------
most of my child ended up happening and


---------06:31----------
then i got to


---------06:32----------
spend time with him there


---------06:36----------
and


---------06:39----------
me and my dad at the time still had a


---------06:40----------
fairly tumultuous relationship because i


---------06:42----------
think i had allegiances towards my mom


---------06:43----------
and so there was a bit of resentment


---------06:45----------
built there from some of the stuff that


---------06:46----------
she told me or


---------06:47----------
just wanting to support her was a form


---------06:49----------
of um


---------06:51----------
not supporting him so we had sure a lot


---------06:53----------
of friction over time


---------06:55----------
sounds like i'm caught in the middle


---------06:59----------
partially i think i also put myself


---------07:01----------
there to some degree well i mean


---------07:02----------
how much can a child put themselves in


---------07:04----------
that position but as much as i can


---------07:06----------
um and


---------07:10----------
looking back now as a grown-up i think


---------07:13----------
my dad did


---------07:14----------
um a commendable job to try to mend the


---------07:18----------
bridge despite all the


---------07:19----------
the friction that was there and to


---------07:22----------
be patient and to be tolerant which you


---------07:24----------
know most would say is his job so that's


---------07:26----------
fine


---------07:26----------
um but yeah i was able to live with him


---------07:30----------
for a time and he took care of things


---------07:32----------
and um


---------07:34----------
i ended up moving back to canada when i


---------07:37----------
was around


---------07:38----------
15 15 around that age my last two years


---------07:41----------
of high school


---------07:43----------
and um as a result i separated from my


---------07:45----------
dad i was back to live with my mom


---------07:47----------
and at the time i still harbored a lot


---------07:49----------
of resentment towards him obviously with


---------07:51----------
the situation


---------07:52----------
uh involving him my mother so um that


---------07:55----------
kind of built up


---------07:56----------
and kind of just remained about


---------08:00----------
four years went by turned around 1920


---------08:05----------
timeline's a little shoddy you have to


---------08:06----------
forgive me


---------08:09----------
and i got a call from my mom


---------08:12----------
saying my dad was in the hospital here


---------08:14----------
in canada which was quite a shock to me


---------08:16----------
because i hadn't heard from him in many


---------08:17----------
many years


---------08:19----------
and um and then yeah it turned out he


---------08:23----------
had like um


---------08:24----------
he had lung cancer so he had a month to


---------08:25----------
live i mean a month i think it might


---------08:27----------
have been two weeks really


---------08:29----------
and um yeah and he passed away


---------08:32----------
after those two weeks had elapsed


---------08:36----------
you'd asked me about my relationship


---------08:37----------
with them so i got a little bit lost


---------08:38----------
there you're gonna have to forgive me


---------08:39----------
yeah


---------08:42----------
okay can i digest for a moment


---------08:46----------
yeah feel free i'll take that time too


---------08:53----------
damn dude you are thoughtful was i


---------08:56----------
i was trying to just keep a straight


---------08:57----------
timeline so i kind of i feel like i


---------08:59----------
missed a lot of spots but i'll take it


---------09:00----------
no i'm blue i mean that's


---------09:02----------
no i i think you're you're thoughtful


---------09:05----------
um i also think uh we're gonna have to


---------09:08----------
so uh abba i don't i don't know how


---------09:11----------
familiar you are with kind of what we do


---------09:12----------
but so we're gonna do a couple of things


---------09:15----------
okay one is we're gonna talk a little


---------09:16----------
bit i want to help you understand a


---------09:18----------
little bit about how your mind works


---------09:21----------
and um i want you to pay attention to


---------09:23----------
this phrase that you've used a couple of


---------09:25----------
times


---------09:25----------
you'll have to forgive me


---------09:29----------
okay so help me understand


---------09:34----------
what you mean when you say that


---------09:37----------
oh i don't know if it's just a


---------09:38----------
politeness thing but uh normally when


---------09:40----------
someone asks you a question


---------09:41----------
and you kind of wander off uh if you


---------09:44----------
wander off the beaten path


---------09:46----------
uh it's just traditional to kind of ask


---------09:47----------
for forgiveness to get back on track if


---------09:49----------
you make a


---------09:50----------
i i completely agree that's normally


---------09:52----------
what it means


---------09:53----------
okay and and so what i'm kind of curious


---------09:57----------
about is


---------09:57----------
is you know there's a part of me that


---------09:59----------
just wants to fire something off which


---------10:00----------
is that i'm totally fine forgiving you


---------10:03----------
question is are you okay forgiving


---------10:04----------
yourself


---------10:06----------
um


---------10:10----------
i mean i feel like i am i don't think


---------10:12----------
i'm i'm harboring any uh


---------10:14----------
kind of resentment towards myself in


---------10:15----------
that regards okay so okay it could be


---------10:18----------
wrong


---------10:19----------
yeah well i'm just curious yeah so we'll


---------10:21----------
see so i just want you to pay attention


---------10:22----------
to that right so i want you to pay


---------10:23----------
attention


---------10:24----------
to the part of you that is apologetic


---------10:27----------
and pay attention to


---------10:28----------
whether that is just a function of


---------10:32----------
conversation and politeness because you


---------10:34----------
were raised to be a good little boy


---------10:37----------
or whether there's there's actually


---------10:40----------
something underneath that which i have


---------10:41----------
no idea because i met you like five


---------10:43----------
minutes ago so this is like where


---------10:45----------
so like like what i do is i don't i'm


---------10:46----------
not going to give you answers


---------10:48----------
about what i'm going to do is like i'm


---------10:49----------
going to we're going to you're going to


---------10:51----------
i'm going to give you maybe like a path


---------10:53----------
to go down and it's actually


---------10:54----------
your job to tell me whether you think


---------10:56----------
there's something there or not


---------10:58----------
all right um so on that note


---------11:04----------
i think if i couple that with the idea


---------11:06----------
that i'm super reluctant to discuss


---------11:07----------
whatever has happened to me with my dad


---------11:09----------
to other people


---------11:11----------
maybe there's a sense of shame that i


---------11:12----------
feel in regards to the tenderness i feel


---------11:15----------
and so when i'm talking about it and i


---------11:17----------
feel lost


---------11:18----------
i feel maybe a certain sense of shame or


---------11:22----------
um disappointing myself i guess for not


---------11:25----------
being able to manage it


---------11:27----------
better manage what um just the pain just


---------11:30----------
the just the


---------11:31----------
the


---------11:35----------
the abundance i guess of emotions that


---------11:39----------
that kind of surround the topic


---------11:41----------
you know so like if you ask me a


---------11:43----------
straight question and i feel like i'm


---------11:44----------
not able to do what i traditionally do


---------11:46----------
which is give you a straightforward


---------11:47----------
answer


---------11:47----------
i feel like it's probably maybe linked


---------11:49----------
to the problems i have with the topic


---------11:52----------
and so maybe that's why i'm apologizing


---------11:53----------
potentially yeah


---------11:54----------
yeah so so what i'm hearing there is


---------11:56----------
that you're asking for forgiveness


---------12:00----------
for not being what people expected you


---------12:02----------
to be


---------12:06----------
right you're saying i'm sorry i didn't


---------12:08----------
give you what you asked for


---------12:10----------
also what i expect to be but fair yeah


---------12:12----------
yeah okay


---------12:13----------
cool yeah i think like those two those


---------12:15----------
two tend to go together


---------12:17----------
okay right um


---------12:21----------
so can i ask a couple more questions so


---------12:25----------
that's


---------12:25----------
so i i may just point out like things to


---------12:27----------
you and we'll see if i think there may


---------12:28----------
be themes emerging here


---------12:30----------
about um let me just make a note of you


---------12:33----------
know


---------12:34----------
talking about pain when it comes up but


---------12:36----------
can i ask you a little bit more so


---------12:38----------
you said your parents got divorced when


---------12:39----------
you were young do you understand can you


---------12:41----------
help us understand by the way anything


---------12:42----------
that you don't want to answer is off


---------12:43----------
limits okay so totally cool


---------12:46----------
um and i know people say oh i'm an open


---------12:48----------
book but like you get to close the book


---------12:49----------
at any point you want


---------12:50----------
right you don't have to hold yourself to


---------12:52----------
you also don't have to apologize for


---------12:54----------
closing the book


---------12:56----------
yep um you just you get to pull the plug


---------12:58----------
at any point


---------13:00----------
so can you tell us a little bit about


---------13:01----------
what your understanding is of why your


---------13:03----------
parents got divorced


---------13:05----------
um


---------13:08----------
i don't think everything was you know of


---------13:11----------
my family uh a lot of stuff was shrouded


---------13:13----------
in mystery and


---------13:14----------
and secrecy surely um


---------13:17----------
but from what i've been able to infer in


---------13:18----------
the conversations i've had with siblings


---------13:19----------
essentially it's just um


---------13:22----------
my father was tremendously unhappy um


---------13:26----------
part of that was his own selfishness and


---------13:27----------
i think part of that was also my mom's


---------13:29----------
behavior


---------13:30----------
which uh you know hurts everyone as well


---------13:33----------
um


---------13:35----------
so i i surprised it's a mix of those two


---------13:37----------
things


---------13:38----------
and what why do you what's your


---------13:39----------
understanding of why your dad was


---------13:41----------
tremendously unhappy


---------13:44----------
um well i mean you know


---------13:48----------
my family is pretty well established uh


---------13:51----------
where we're live in ethiopia very very


---------13:53----------
well respected very well known


---------13:55----------
uh without going into too much detail


---------13:57----------
and um


---------13:58----------
obviously due to war and conflict they


---------14:01----------
left


---------14:02----------
had an arduous detour to get to canada


---------14:06----------
but you know despite being in a first


---------14:08----------
world country for a lot of people from


---------14:10----------
places like ethiopia or things like that


---------14:12----------
um it's a very


---------14:13----------
very different lifestyle they often miss


---------14:15----------
their homeland um


---------14:17----------
and so i think just the quality of life


---------14:19----------
wasn't great and then also


---------14:20----------
my mother's behavior which could be


---------14:23----------
very it could be a lot to handle at


---------14:26----------
times


---------14:27----------
and so what do you mean by that what was


---------14:30----------
a lot to handle


---------14:34----------
i think um i think due to my mom's past


---------14:38----------
i think she


---------14:39----------
has a very strong habit to project her


---------14:43----------
unhappiness


---------14:44----------
onto others and it comes out in bad ways


---------14:47----------
whether it be nagging whether it be


---------14:49----------
you know negative comments whether it be


---------14:52----------
you know just you know most forms of


---------14:54----------
toxic behavior that you can imagine


---------14:56----------
and so sometimes i can come out and it


---------14:59----------
can wear on people


---------15:01----------
around her you know i


---------15:04----------
i i for me there's a gap between nagging


---------15:06----------
and toxic


---------15:07----------
most forms of toxic behavior


---------15:10----------
yeah i i kind of think about one as like


---------15:14----------
you know like a little bit annoying and


---------15:17----------
and another is like


---------15:18----------
it depends on the frequency you know


---------15:20----------
when it's when it's a barrage


---------15:22----------
you know it's kind of like uh you know


---------15:25----------
doesn't do a lot of damage but it's


---------15:26----------
constantly hitting


---------15:27----------
what what should i sure what should what


---------15:30----------
would she say or do can you give us an


---------15:32----------
example


---------15:34----------
um i think it was just a constant


---------15:35----------
reminder that things weren't done that


---------15:37----------
things weren't done well enough that


---------15:38----------
things could be better that um unhappy


---------15:42----------
with this situation


---------15:43----------
constant complaints like it just seemed


---------15:45----------
like what was around her was never good


---------15:47----------
enough


---------15:48----------
um and i think everyone was partially to


---------15:50----------
blame


---------15:51----------
and so you just constantly heard it


---------15:56----------
what would she would she say that to you


---------15:58----------
too


---------15:59----------
she would say that to me or in front of


---------16:01----------
me or two of my siblings or


---------16:03----------
to my father so so yeah and would she


---------16:06----------
sometimes say


---------16:07----------
like would she think that you weren't


---------16:08----------
doing good enough


---------16:11----------
um well i had a weird experience so i'm


---------16:14----------
i'm i'm the


---------16:16----------
fourth child of seven so i'm right smack


---------16:19----------
dab in the middle so i kind of was able


---------16:21----------
to pass


---------16:22----------
unnoticed my life um


---------16:26----------
so i would i would hear it every now and


---------16:28----------
then but it was pretty rare i think i


---------16:29----------
heard it


---------16:30----------
at specific points in my life but not


---------16:32----------
throughout it consistently now


---------16:34----------
so it sounds like maybe your dad was


---------16:36----------
unhappy and your mom was also unhappy


---------16:38----------
and sort of blamed him for


---------16:39----------
her unhappiness yes yes


---------16:44----------
and um you said you had siblings can you


---------16:48----------
tell me a little bit about your siblings


---------16:50----------
um yeah um so


---------16:54----------
there's um three boys and


---------16:58----------
uh four girls i'm the second oldest boy


---------17:03----------
two of them are from a different wife


---------17:04----------
and so they're half siblings and uh the


---------17:06----------
rest are all from


---------17:07----------
my mom


---------17:10----------
what would you like to know about my


---------17:11----------
siblings um i'm not


---------17:14----------
it's a good question um i'm just you


---------17:16----------
know


---------17:17----------
just tell me you know sometimes people


---------17:19----------
things will pop


---------17:20----------
out about them i i guess like what yeah


---------17:23----------
what's your relationship with them like


---------17:24----------
yeah yeah um i'm not actually close to


---------17:27----------
most of my siblings


---------17:28----------
um except for my older brother the rest


---------17:30----------
of them i um


---------17:32----------
i don't speak too much at all okay


---------17:34----------
anything yeah


---------17:35----------
yeah so my older brother i'm i'm pretty


---------17:38----------
close with and we talk


---------17:39----------
you know fairly regularly and uh


---------17:42----------
the rest of my siblings not so much and


---------17:45----------
what was your older brother's


---------17:46----------
relationship with your dad like


---------17:49----------
um he also had a fairly tumultuous


---------17:51----------
relationship i think we all as children


---------17:53----------
kind of


---------17:53----------
internalize that towards her her dad


---------17:56----------
living with her mom


---------17:57----------
so yeah yeah he had a similar


---------17:59----------
relationship with him


---------18:00----------
when you say internalized what does that


---------18:03----------
mean oh just like uh


---------18:04----------
our mom's our mother's opinion of our


---------18:07----------
father


---------18:07----------
we'd internalized um and what was that


---------18:10----------
opinion


---------18:12----------
um but he was unreliable uh that he


---------18:16----------
was um selfish uh


---------18:19----------
and um yeah just generally just


---------18:24----------
just bad okay


---------18:29----------
okay and so you said they got divorced


---------18:32----------
when you were howled


---------18:35----------
probably around three four okay


---------18:38----------
and so you were in canada for how many


---------18:41----------
years before you moved to ethiopia


---------18:43----------
uh probably six seven okay and


---------18:47----------
so it sounds like your mom blamed your


---------18:49----------
dad for a lot when you were kind of


---------18:51----------
growing up


---------18:52----------
and can you help me understand um you


---------18:54----------
know once again


---------18:55----------
welcome to not answer anything why you


---------18:57----------
moved to ethiopia at the age of six or


---------18:59----------
seven


---------19:00----------
oh just uh financials i think my mom was


---------19:02----------
struggling a little bit with money


---------19:03----------
uh and so for her was easier to kind of


---------19:05----------
get her money together


---------19:07----------
and then you know instead of like


---------19:09----------
renting and being struggling with the


---------19:10----------
job she was able to buy a house and then


---------19:11----------
bring us back and have a legitimate home


---------19:14----------
okay okay so and then did you guys have


---------19:17----------
a relationship so it sounds like between


---------19:19----------
three and six or seven years for


---------19:21----------
for a period of three years you don't


---------19:22----------
really see your dad much


---------19:24----------
no and no no


---------19:27----------
and what did you what did you what


---------19:30----------
happened when you moved back to ethiopia


---------19:33----------
well i mean it was kind of weird yeah


---------19:34----------
you don't see someone and they're like


---------19:36----------
they're


---------19:37----------
oh that's your father but you don't you


---------19:38----------
don't really um


---------19:41----------
have any idea what they're like and so


---------19:43----------
you're kind of apprehensive at first


---------19:45----------
but as a child you you go where you're


---------19:46----------
told and um


---------19:49----------
yeah it was it was very like it was like


---------19:51----------
a weird transition where there was


---------19:52----------
always a lot of distance always like who


---------19:54----------
is this man


---------19:55----------
um and i think that kind of persisted


---------19:56----------
for a long time but over time


---------19:58----------
um i think i at least understood that he


---------20:01----------
was reliable


---------20:03----------
okay and so what were your interactions


---------20:06----------
with him like when you were like


---------20:07----------
you know seven eight nine


---------20:10----------
i mean they were the same that they were


---------20:12----------
like when i was like 15. i think


---------20:14----------
i think i just went from when i needed


---------20:15----------
things and um


---------20:17----------
i think he knew not to push topics


---------20:19----------
because i would probably shut down on


---------20:21----------
him


---------20:21----------
and he was just there if i absolutely


---------20:25----------
needed it


---------20:27----------
okay yeah


---------20:33----------
yeah um


---------20:40----------
okay


---------20:46----------
so i'm gonna ask you abba do you want


---------20:50----------
um do you want me to share with you some


---------20:52----------
thoughts or do you want me to ask you


---------20:54----------
more questions


---------20:55----------
i have a bunch of questions but i'm sort


---------20:57----------
of


---------20:58----------
picking out a little bit of a theme um


---------21:02----------
why don't we go with a couple more


---------21:03----------
questions and then if that theme starts


---------21:05----------
perfect


---------21:06----------
so you said that and then you started


---------21:08----------
living with him when you said you were


---------21:09----------
15.


---------21:10----------
or sorry like you lived with him or you


---------21:12----------
were just back in ethiopia at some point


---------21:14----------
i was back in ethiopia living with him


---------21:17----------
so you were living with him between like


---------21:18----------
seven and


---------21:20----------
fifteen okay and so


---------21:23----------
it sounds like if you wanted something


---------21:26----------
from him


---------21:26----------
or you needed something from him you


---------21:29----------
would


---------21:30----------
kind of you guys would sort of interact


---------21:32----------
but i'm i'm not getting a sense of


---------21:34----------
a lot of like free flowing and natural


---------21:37----------
father-son sort of interactions um


---------21:41----------
no i wouldn't say that was there


---------21:44----------
i wouldn't say that was there but there


---------21:46----------
were times where i may have needed him


---------21:48----------
to help me with something


---------21:49----------
and he would show up so i think that


---------21:51----------
would probably be the closest thing but


---------21:53----------
other than that he just provided


---------21:55----------
and made himself available when i needed


---------21:57----------
it i think i just never


---------21:59----------
grabbed the olive branch if you will how


---------22:01----------
do you feel about that


---------22:05----------
good question


---------22:11----------
i think looking back now i probably


---------22:14----------
don't feel that great about it just


---------22:15----------
knowing


---------22:20----------
yeah i think just knowing you don't get


---------22:22----------
that opportunity back


---------22:24----------
that part is unfortunate but i think i


---------22:26----------
forgive myself only because i understand


---------22:28----------
that i was a childhood


---------22:29----------
i made the decisions i did then


---------22:32----------
but yeah you know just because you


---------22:34----------
accept or you forgive yourself doesn't


---------22:35----------
make it


---------22:36----------
suck any less right so yeah sure


---------22:42----------
and what do you forgive yourself for


---------22:46----------
what i perceive to be the


---------22:50----------
i guess for for i imagine it must have


---------22:54----------
been hard for him


---------22:56----------
right um to want to be present in your


---------22:59----------
child's life and your child constantly


---------23:01----------
rejects you


---------23:02----------
in a roundabout way


---------23:05----------
i imagine that must be difficult


---------23:12----------
okay so you say


---------23:17----------
i mean that's a big pile of


---------23:20----------
self-forgiveness


---------23:23----------
and so i mean it's it's quite amazing if


---------23:26----------
you've really forgiven yourself for


---------23:28----------
constantly rejecting your dad


---------23:33----------
and causing him a lot of hurt


---------23:45----------
begs the question did i really forgive


---------23:46----------
myself


---------23:48----------
um yeah i don't know


---------23:52----------
it's a good question so let me ask you


---------23:54----------
what's painful


---------23:56----------
when you think or talk about your dad


---------24:00----------
okay well when i was


---------24:04----------
when i was 19 i ended up joining the


---------24:08----------
military


---------24:09----------
and it was at the height of like when


---------24:11----------
people were going to afghanistan and


---------24:12----------
whatnot so it was quite a lot of that


---------24:14----------
going on


---------24:15----------
and you know i come from a muslim family


---------24:17----------
and so obviously when i told my mom i


---------24:19----------
was joining she was quite disappointed


---------24:20----------
and angry


---------24:21----------
and


---------24:25----------
i think after that we hadn't spoken


---------24:27----------
almost two years but i remember going


---------24:29----------
through basic training


---------24:30----------
and even though basic training is not


---------24:31----------
the most difficult thing


---------24:33----------
um


---------24:36----------
it is a stressful thing it was very


---------24:39----------
stressful for me mostly because of the


---------24:40----------
fact that i was not used to this kind of


---------24:42----------
environment where there was discipline


---------24:43----------
and people looking over your shoulders


---------24:45----------
and all these orders that you have to


---------24:46----------
constantly file well


---------24:47----------
like you know all these different tasks


---------24:49----------
that i was just not competent at i i


---------24:51----------
struggled quite a lot to be honest with


---------24:53----------
you


---------24:54----------
i i i fixed i writed the wrongs you know


---------24:57----------
and then


---------24:57----------
and got it got it going eventually


---------24:59----------
probably by like my


---------25:01----------
second month into basic and and then i


---------25:03----------
was like really steady but


---------25:05----------
it was very difficult at first and i


---------25:06----------
remember when you're in basic you're


---------25:08----------
kind of locked into space


---------25:09----------
with with 60 other people who are


---------25:10----------
platoon mates and you go through these


---------25:12----------
rigorous training for for that period


---------25:14----------
and i think what made it extra hard for


---------25:16----------
me was during that period i had


---------25:19----------
nobody i could talk to when the day was


---------25:22----------
stressful right like people go to the


---------25:23----------
pay phones to talk and


---------25:25----------
i just didn't have any kind of support


---------25:27----------
system in that regards or people that


---------25:28----------
could be like hey man just keep pushing


---------25:30----------
and i managed to get through basic


---------25:33----------
and i did my i was in the middle of my


---------25:36----------
initial service when the


---------25:37----------
call but my father came in and i


---------25:40----------
remember going to the hospital


---------25:42----------
having not seen the man in many many


---------25:43----------
years and he was kind of frail looking


---------25:46----------
and


---------25:51----------
yeah i remember seeing him and


---------25:55----------
the first thing that he told me again


---------25:57----------
this is after i hadn't spoken to family


---------25:59----------
members in many years


---------26:00----------
the first thing he told me was that when


---------26:01----------
he heard i had joined


---------26:04----------
um


---------26:08----------
just give me a second all right


---------26:12----------
yeah the first thing he told me that is


---------26:14----------
that he was proud and i think


---------26:16----------
when i heard that um


---------26:21----------
it was hard because i immediately had to


---------26:36----------
uh


---------26:58----------
i um


---------27:03----------
i um i had to leave the room just to


---------27:11----------
just to find myself like a corn in the


---------27:13----------
hospital


---------27:16----------
i just remember um


---------27:23----------
i just remember crying a lot and i'd um


---------27:26----------
called my best friend at the time he'd


---------27:28----------
never heard me like that


---------27:32----------
i didn't know what i'd overcome me at


---------27:34----------
the time but i think looking back now i


---------27:36----------
realize that um


---------27:48----------
i think at the time i'd realized that


---------27:53----------
despite never realizing that i'd always


---------27:54----------
wanted to hear that


---------27:57----------
it's not even about the military i think


---------28:06----------
i think i always wanted to


---------28:10----------
have that and um


---------28:13----------
yeah i think that was the hard part


---------28:19----------
yeah it just hit me i guess it was like


---------28:20----------
a whole childhood i'm not having that


---------28:22----------
right so


---------28:23----------
i think that's hard about it


---------28:28----------
so so yeah that was tough for me


---------28:31----------
you know it's kind of interesting right


---------28:35----------
how tough it can be to get exactly what


---------28:38----------
you need


---------28:40----------
generally speaking when i ask people you


---------28:42----------
know if you get exactly what you need


---------28:44----------
would you consider that to be tough


---------28:47----------
generally speaking people wouldn't say


---------28:49----------
yes


---------28:51----------
i think it's because a lot of times


---------28:52----------
people don't even realize what it is


---------28:53----------
that they need


---------28:54----------
yeah i think i've just been functional


---------28:56----------
moving through life that way


---------28:58----------
and i think that moment kind of made me


---------29:01----------
realize


---------29:02----------
from the absence and it kind of showed a


---------29:05----------
light on


---------29:08----------
i think maybe just things that i didn't


---------29:10----------
know i i yearned for


---------29:12----------
you know or things i convinced myself i


---------29:14----------
didn't want


---------29:15----------
and uh yeah


---------29:19----------
so yeah


---------29:22----------
i should ask you more questions but i'm


---------29:23----------
going to give you an answer at this


---------29:25----------
point i think the reason


---------29:26----------
that you have trouble getting over the


---------29:27----------
loss of your dad is because


---------29:29----------
you lost you lost him a long time before


---------29:34----------
he passed away


---------29:43----------
right and he lost you a long time before


---------29:45----------
he passed away


---------29:48----------
and so if all you're grieving is his


---------29:49----------
death


---------29:51----------
you're missing out on a big part of of


---------29:53----------
what you need to mourn


---------30:12----------
another thing that's um


---------30:16----------
um maybe this ties in i think


---------30:20----------
over the last four or five years we've


---------30:22----------
had like a lot of success and um


---------30:24----------
it's been very humbling to be able to


---------30:26----------
connect with so many people whether it


---------30:27----------
be through stand-up or


---------30:29----------
um


---------30:33----------
through this youtube stuff and one of


---------30:36----------
the many joys that i have now is to be


---------30:37----------
able to like take care of the people


---------30:38----------
around me


---------30:39----------
you know there's something that's for me


---------30:42----------
extremely fulfilling about that aspect


---------30:43----------
of my life


---------30:46----------
but oftentimes people ask me if i'm


---------30:48----------
proud and


---------30:52----------
i always think back to the moments and i


---------30:54----------
feel like


---------30:56----------
the reason why i often feel like i'm not


---------30:58----------
proud


---------30:59----------
because i think the one person that i


---------31:01----------
wanted to showcase to


---------31:03----------
that i could do it isn't around


---------31:08----------
you know i felt like i was supposed to


---------31:09----------
support my mother and then kind of prove


---------31:11----------
to my dad that i could


---------31:13----------
and i think i just i lost that


---------31:15----------
opportunity


---------31:16----------
in a way i think that's the


---------31:22----------
that's the that's a bit of the hole that


---------31:25----------
i feel


---------31:26----------
sure and the morning that i think


---------31:29----------
doesn't stop i think it's just uh you're


---------31:32----------
right about


---------31:33----------
having not been able to mourn everything


---------31:35----------
else before that


---------31:37----------
yeah i think that's a good observation


---------31:39----------
so abba is your dad proud of you


---------31:47----------
i think he yeah i think i think he was


---------31:49----------
proud of me i think


---------31:52----------
i guess i just want to show more you


---------31:54----------
know


---------31:57----------
you know despite everything my parents


---------31:58----------
gave up a lot for us and


---------32:02----------
now there's a huge part of me that wants


---------32:03----------
to be able to repay that


---------32:06----------
partially for them but i think also


---------32:08----------
partially for myself


---------32:12----------
so that they'd have to worry


---------32:18----------
so i i this is gonna sound a little bit


---------32:20----------
weird but i take


---------32:21----------
i take issue with many of the words that


---------32:23----------
you choose


---------32:25----------
so you say he was proud of you that's


---------32:27----------
not the question i asked


---------32:30----------
i asked is he proud of you


---------32:35----------
i mean i think i used the word was just


---------32:36----------
because man is dead


---------32:39----------
yep i know and i'm sure for a lot of


---------32:42----------
people there's like the idea of


---------32:43----------
afterlife where people live on through


---------32:44----------
you


---------32:45----------
i personally don't subscribe to stuff


---------32:46----------
like that i mean maybe


---------32:48----------
in a way maybe their their lessons and


---------32:51----------
their influence


---------32:52----------
you know lives on to you but i think


---------32:55----------
other day i think there's


---------32:58----------
very few things like the material


---------32:59----------
presence for me personally i'd agree


---------33:02----------
so i'd say even if you i'm not talking


---------33:04----------
about the afterlife so i i think


---------33:06----------
what we need to do is really understand


---------33:10----------
what he was saying to you that day that


---------33:12----------
he saw you in the hospital like what do


---------33:13----------
you think he was proud


---------33:14----------
of


---------33:20----------
what i become


---------33:24----------
who i was standing before


---------33:28----------
so that's why i ask in the present tense


---------33:30----------
because i i don't think he was proud of


---------33:32----------
you


---------33:32----------
just in that moment he was proud of what


---------33:34----------
you had become and he was proud of


---------33:36----------
what he knew you would be


---------33:41----------
right i think i i think he's proud of


---------33:43----------
you i mean even he's dead i'm not


---------33:45----------
talking about an afterlife or a soul or


---------33:47----------
anything like that although those


---------33:48----------
thoughts can


---------33:48----------
feelings can certainly be comforting


---------33:50----------
don't get me wrong


---------33:52----------
what i'm talking about is i i think he


---------33:54----------
saw the person i mean the person that


---------33:56----------
you


---------33:56----------
are today was what he got a glimpse of


---------34:00----------
like nine years ago


---------34:04----------
right and like you know like i don't


---------34:05----------
know do you have kids


---------34:07----------
no no i don't know


---------34:10----------
this something that honestly you may


---------34:12----------
better understand if you


---------34:14----------
you know choose to or lucky or unlucky


---------34:18----------
to have


---------34:18----------
kids one day maybe you'll understand


---------34:20----------
that like you you know what they're


---------34:22----------
gonna be


---------34:24----------
right and and in that moment there's a


---------34:26----------
part of me that says that like


---------34:28----------
he wasn't talking about just that moment


---------34:30----------
he was talking about what had come


---------34:32----------
before that moment and what was going to


---------34:34----------
come after that moment


---------34:39----------
why do you think it is that i'm unable


---------34:41----------
to believe that


---------34:46----------
i don't know why am i am i rejecting it


---------34:48----------
i don't know


---------34:49----------
i don't know yeah so so that's a good


---------34:53----------
question


---------34:54----------
it's the right question


---------35:00----------
let me just think about whether i want


---------35:01----------
to ask you what do you reject about it


---------35:10----------
you know you say parents know what their


---------35:12----------
kids are going to become


---------35:15----------
i just never felt like anybody knew i


---------35:16----------
was gonna do any of this


---------35:18----------
and i'm not here to be like oh wow look


---------35:19----------
at everything but i just


---------35:26----------
i can honestly say i don't think i've


---------35:28----------
ever had anyone


---------35:30----------
um


---------35:34----------
believe it mean that way well bro


---------35:38----------
yeah yeah i i think that


---------35:42----------
i know i know my dad showed it in that


---------35:43----------
moment but i think prior to that i just


---------35:45----------
i think i i just had never seen it


---------35:46----------
and so maybe yeah yeah i think that's


---------35:50----------
that's your answer right so like let me


---------35:52----------
let me put some context around it so i i


---------35:55----------
think


---------35:56----------
the reason you can't believe it is


---------35:57----------
because


---------35:59----------
you know just


---------36:02----------
the tiniest amount did so much for you


---------36:04----------
and you just weren't


---------36:05----------
used to that you couldn't understand


---------36:08----------
what that meant


---------36:09----------
in that moment even now you're


---------36:10----------
struggling to understand it


---------36:13----------
why is it hard for you to accept it


---------36:15----------
because it's new it's like the first


---------36:17----------
time you eat like a chili


---------36:19----------
right it's like it takes some time to


---------36:21----------
get used to things that


---------36:23----------
are new to you and what i'm hearing from


---------36:26----------
you is that you were starved like i mean


---------36:27----------
like seriously bro you got to mourn way


---------36:29----------
more than his death


---------36:31----------
and we'll get to other reasons i mean if


---------36:33----------
you want really what's going i'll just


---------36:35----------
like tell you okay like this is a shot


---------36:36----------
in the dark but


---------36:37----------
i mean i think the reason that you have


---------36:39----------
trouble accepting it is because like


---------36:42----------
if you accept it it changes a lot


---------36:46----------
for you so like


---------36:51----------
you know i mean when you say things like


---------36:52----------
i went to him only when i needed him


---------36:55----------
i shut him down i say you were put in


---------36:58----------
the middle and then you respond with


---------37:00----------
because like a kid it's funny because


---------37:02----------
you even sort of noticed this


---------37:04----------
i said like so it sounds like you got


---------37:05----------
caught in in between your parents and


---------37:07----------
then your answer is i put myself there


---------37:11----------
right and then you even catch yourself


---------37:13----------
and then you like you say afterward well


---------37:14----------
i guess you can't


---------37:15----------
really put yourself there as a kid so


---------37:18----------
like how do you understand that


---------37:20----------
like why would you say those statements


---------37:22----------
back to back


---------37:24----------
and what i'm hearing from you is a lot


---------37:26----------
of a lot of responsibility for a lot of


---------37:29----------
these situations


---------37:31----------
i've forgiven myself for continuously


---------37:33----------
rejecting my dad


---------37:35----------
for not taking the olive branch


---------37:39----------
and and what i hear in uab is like a war


---------37:42----------
between what you


---------37:43----------
understand to be true and what you feel


---------37:47----------
which is that you can't really blame a


---------37:49----------
kid but i think you blame yourself


---------37:51----------
and i think when you talk about shame


---------37:52----------
like why do people feel shame like what


---------37:55----------
and where does shame come from i think


---------37:58----------
on some level like you also feel guilt


---------38:00----------
i guess and i think the real problem is


---------38:04----------
that like


---------38:05----------
you've gotten very very used to that


---------38:07----------
feeling you've sort of like built this


---------38:10----------
version of yourself that's like positive


---------38:12----------
in spite of that but it's still a big


---------38:13----------
part of who you are


---------38:15----------
and i think if you accept that your dad


---------38:17----------
was proud of you then like


---------38:20----------
it's hard to blame yourself


---------38:23----------
which feels weird and uncomfortable and


---------38:25----------
there i i fully admit i may lose you


---------38:29----------
but like there's something weird going


---------38:30----------
on where i think like if you accept that


---------38:32----------
your dad is proud of you you


---------38:33----------
have to let go of some of that pain and


---------38:35----------
i don't think you want to


---------38:37----------
i think you like blaming yourself


---------38:41----------
for rejecting your dad


---------38:50----------
i did i did uh it's like you deserve it


---------38:59----------
yeah i did partially come to the


---------39:01----------
conclusion that i was holding on to all


---------39:02----------
this stuff because i think it was part


---------39:04----------
of my identity


---------39:06----------
um or that


---------39:12----------
i deserve it


---------39:31----------
huh


---------39:35----------
so i'll ask in a different way okay it's


---------39:38----------
gonna be a stupid question and i expect


---------39:40----------
a stupid answer but an honest one give


---------39:42----------
me whatever's in your heart and


---------39:43----------
you don't have to answer give me the


---------39:45----------
right answer


---------39:46----------
for a guy who doesn't talk to his dad


---------39:49----------
for


---------39:50----------
four years or five years or six years


---------39:53----------
dad is dying of lung cancer you walk in


---------39:56----------
he says i'm proud of you


---------39:58----------
what does that guy deserve


---------40:03----------
do you deserve to be happy


---------40:07----------
the first word that came to mind was


---------40:08----------
everything


---------40:16----------
i don't know i feel like


---------40:25----------
and uh in a weird way i feel like that


---------40:28----------
moment kind of


---------40:29----------
saved me


---------40:44----------
what did it save you from


---------40:50----------
i think it made me realize what problems


---------40:52----------
i had going on on the inside


---------40:55----------
maybe not to what degree but i think i


---------40:58----------
realized that something was really wrong


---------41:00----------
something was really missing


---------41:04----------
and um i think i sought it out in a lot


---------41:08----------
of different places


---------41:09----------
unknowingly


---------41:13----------
and uh


---------41:17----------
i think that's why i said everything i


---------41:19----------
just


---------41:21----------
i feel oddly grateful i feel grateful


---------41:26----------
oh my dude because you know as terrible


---------41:28----------
as it is to lose them that way i think


---------41:29----------
like imagine if


---------41:30----------
i'd even have that


---------41:34----------
yeah abbott this is this is complicated


---------41:37----------
dude so listen


---------41:38----------
look so i'm with you i'm glad you feel


---------41:40----------
grateful i think everything's the right


---------41:41----------
answer blew me away


---------41:43----------
to be honest i was envisioning something


---------41:45----------
else but now i'm going to share


---------41:46----------
something else with you so like here's


---------41:48----------
here's what you have to mourn right like


---------41:50----------
here's what you have to mourn is that


---------41:51----------
you can be grateful


---------41:52----------
that you're lucky that you got what you


---------41:55----------
needed


---------41:56----------
and at the end of the day for a lot of


---------41:59----------
your life


---------42:00----------
you did deserve everything but you


---------42:02----------
didn't have anyone to call


---------42:04----------
in basic


---------42:07----------
you know i think a lot of this sadness


---------42:08----------
comes from like it really comes from


---------42:10----------
loss man it comes from that you deserved


---------42:15----------
everything but you didn't get everything


---------42:18----------
all you got was barely enough


---------42:30----------
yeah i think i just accepted


---------42:35----------
even though i know it it probably hurt


---------42:36----------
me and


---------42:38----------
you know


---------42:43----------
yeah but you know also shaped me i think


---------42:47----------
i've


---------42:47----------
kind of accepted the the lack with which


---------42:50----------
i was raised


---------42:51----------
you know i think i've had to learn to


---------42:53----------
forgive my mother for what she did


---------42:58----------
but yeah i think when you speak of like


---------42:59----------
um


---------43:01----------
i i just don't even i recognize the


---------43:05----------
absence of things that were in my


---------43:06----------
childhood


---------43:07----------
but i think what i think about them i'm


---------43:09----------
like it is what it is


---------43:10----------
rather than yeah that's that's the


---------43:12----------
problem


---------43:13----------
so this is gonna sound kind of weird


---------43:15----------
okay it's completely counter-intuitive


---------43:17----------
and probably wrong


---------43:18----------
but just hear me out here so mourning is


---------43:21----------
about loss


---------43:23----------
right right yeah and so here's the crazy


---------43:26----------
thing


---------43:26----------
i think abba you've got to accept less


---------43:31----------
and so like like there's a part of me


---------43:33----------
that says that like


---------43:35----------
when you accept that you weren't given


---------43:37----------
much when you accept that you grew up


---------43:39----------
without much


---------43:41----------
you're kind of like taking that loss


---------43:43----------
away


---------43:45----------
right so in a sense in theory what


---------43:46----------
you're doing is accepting that there was


---------43:47----------
a loss


---------43:48----------
but i think actually if you really want


---------43:49----------
to mourn what you've got to do is reject


---------43:52----------
it


---------43:53----------
because you deserved everything like


---------43:56----------
it's just


---------43:56----------
it's shining through just in little


---------43:59----------
little bits


---------44:00----------
so like if you deserved everything and


---------44:02----------
that's your first answer


---------44:04----------
why on earth aren't you pissed


---------44:09----------
earth aren't you screaming to the


---------44:11----------
heavens that this is unfair and this


---------44:12----------
shouldn't happen like this that like


---------44:14----------
my dad should have been proud of me for


---------44:16----------
years and i should have had a


---------44:17----------
relationship with him


---------44:18----------
and just when things were turning around


---------44:20----------
he was taken away from me


---------44:22----------
for i think for a few reasons i think


---------44:23----------
one i think holding on to resentment


---------44:25----------
anger often times uh for me is just not


---------44:27----------
led to good places


---------44:29----------
um violence in particular i was a


---------44:32----------
violent teenager


---------44:34----------
okay i think it wasn't for the military


---------44:36----------
i probably would have landed myself in


---------44:37----------
way more trouble


---------44:38----------
i think that's one reason why i don't


---------44:39----------
want to hold on to it two


---------44:41----------
um it's i don't know forgiveness is


---------44:44----------
possible


---------44:44----------
if you don't fully go through the path


---------44:47----------
that you mentioned but i think i can't


---------44:48----------
have any form of forgiveness


---------44:50----------
if i hold on to that and three i can't


---------44:53----------
change


---------44:53----------
um what has happened in the past and so


---------44:56----------
if i cannot change it


---------44:57----------
and it only leads to me potentially


---------45:00----------
engaging in destructive behavior


---------45:02----------
and the inability to forgive those


---------45:03----------
people around me it stands to reason


---------45:05----------
that i don't want to hold on


---------45:07----------
to that idea of like i reject


---------45:10----------
and i'm angry because you know i am to


---------45:13----------
be fair


---------45:14----------
i probably if i if i wanted to go back


---------45:17----------
there and really think back on it i


---------45:18----------
could probably resurface those


---------45:20----------
experiences and


---------45:20----------
find reasons to be angry and justified


---------45:23----------
reason


---------45:24----------
but i i ask what purpose does it serve


---------45:27----------
if i can't get forgiveness


---------45:28----------
and i can't get like a real sense of


---------45:30----------
catharsis at least not one that i can


---------45:31----------
imagine


---------45:35----------
yeah so this is okay now i'm more


---------45:38----------
confident


---------45:39----------
because here's the thing right like so


---------45:40----------
so like here's here's what i'm hearing


---------45:42----------
about is you're not


---------45:43----------
letting yourself feel what you feel


---------45:47----------
because it serves no point in your head


---------45:51----------
and you wonder why you're stuck i think


---------45:54----------
if i


---------45:54----------
if i do the cost analysis benefit i feel


---------45:56----------
like there's more downsides


---------45:58----------
than i could see potential upsides i


---------45:59----------
think i can't see you


---------46:01----------
i completely agree with your cost


---------46:02----------
analysis okay


---------46:05----------
and it's not how feelings work


---------46:08----------
okay if the reason that you can't stop


---------46:10----------
mourning is because you're doing a cost


---------46:12----------
analysis of the benefits


---------46:14----------
and costs of mourning and you choose not


---------46:16----------
to do it then no [ __ ] wonder you're


---------46:18----------
stuck


---------46:19----------
uh so my question my question is how do


---------46:23----------
you mourn


---------46:25----------
so like you familiar with this these


---------46:28----------
cubular


---------46:29----------
the kubler lost grief stages this is


---------46:31----------
like psychology 101


---------46:33----------
yeah yeah something about like denial


---------46:35----------
and then denial and anger at the top


---------46:39----------
yeah and what you did my dude is skip


---------46:41----------
right past those to like acceptance


---------46:44----------
and so like that's why you're stuck bro


---------46:48----------
right you're afraid of your anger but


---------46:50----------
it's a part of you it's a part of who


---------46:51----------
you are


---------46:54----------
like there's a big difference between


---------46:56----------
not telling yourself


---------46:57----------
that [ __ ] is unfair


---------47:01----------
and saying like okay like i i should be


---------47:03----------
grateful i should be grateful


---------47:05----------
that on his deathbed my dad told me once


---------47:08----------
in my life that he's proud of me


---------47:12----------
like what the [ __ ] bro


---------47:15----------
like i appreciate that as someone who


---------47:17----------
tries to


---------47:18----------
you know get people to engender


---------47:20----------
gratitude and feel like so much resent


---------47:22----------
like people are like you know burnt out


---------47:24----------
they're resentful about life i'm with


---------47:26----------
you


---------47:26----------
i don't think it's a good idea to hold


---------47:28----------
on to resentment but i think you you got


---------47:30----------
to pick it up from time to time so that


---------47:32----------
you can put it where it belongs


---------47:38----------
like i mean if you're the dalai lama


---------47:40----------
sure


---------47:42----------
like you know being grateful that your


---------47:43----------
dad was like i'm not i'm not saying you


---------47:45----------
shouldn't be grateful for that moment


---------47:47----------
i'm not saying it isn't a powerful


---------47:48----------
moment


---------47:48----------
i'm not saying it isn't a transformative


---------47:50----------
moment but i think


---------47:52----------
you you're allowed to be angry and


---------47:53----------
you're afraid of what's going to happen


---------47:55----------
if you let yourself be angry


---------47:56----------
and that's exactly why you can't let the


---------47:58----------
anger go


---------48:02----------
and i i think that there's a part of you


---------48:04----------
yeah


---------48:05----------
i just don't i wouldn't know how to


---------48:06----------
channel it yeah how do you how do you


---------48:08----------
channel that emotion in a constructive


---------48:10----------
way


---------48:11----------
you know like if you're a football


---------48:12----------
player and you're aggressive and you got


---------48:13----------
some aggression anger like


---------48:14----------
maybe you channel it on the field right


---------48:16----------
like how would i


---------48:17----------
channel those emotions and to i guess


---------48:20----------
something good


---------48:21----------
you know yeah so i think that's that's


---------48:23----------
that's the problem is you don't channel


---------48:25----------
it into something good


---------48:26----------
okay you don't channel it right you sit


---------48:30----------
with it


---------48:31----------
okay like abba what you need to say to


---------48:33----------
yourself is like first of all like i


---------48:35----------
think you got to get angry with yourself


---------48:37----------
because i think you are anger angry at


---------48:39----------
yourself


---------48:40----------
i think i think you you blame yourself


---------48:43----------
on some level like understandably so


---------48:45----------
so i think you're halfway there like


---------48:47----------
you're kind of saying like i was a kid


---------48:50----------
right like my mom like there are all


---------48:52----------
kinds of irrational thoughts and this is


---------48:54----------
the problem is your thoughtful guy


---------48:56----------
it's your [ __ ] problem so like like


---------48:59----------
let me just


---------49:00----------
toss out a random chain of thinking to


---------49:02----------
you


---------49:03----------
okay okay so like you know if you were


---------49:06----------
resentful towards your dad like you


---------49:08----------
don't blame yourself because you were a


---------49:10----------
kid right and what do kids know


---------49:12----------
right and so he extended the olive


---------49:14----------
branch and the only time you ever like


---------49:15----------
gave him the time of day is when you


---------49:17----------
needed something from him


---------49:18----------
like holy [ __ ] like that's a bad way to


---------49:21----------
interact with another human being


---------49:23----------
yeah and you're a good dude you're a


---------49:25----------
thoughtful dude so you're like you


---------49:26----------
you've learned to forgive yourself for


---------49:27----------
that but then like there's there are


---------49:28----------
other thoughts under there


---------49:30----------
like why was i this way towards my dad


---------49:32----------
why was i robbed of this opportunity


---------49:34----------
because of my mom because she taught me


---------49:36----------
this stuff because she brainwashed me


---------49:38----------
and if it weren't for my mom if my mom


---------49:39----------
was a different person maybe i would


---------49:41----------
have had


---------49:42----------
a different relationship with my dad


---------49:46----------
and i'm not saying that that's correct


---------49:48----------
but what i'm saying is that like it


---------49:50----------
feels


---------49:50----------
healthy to me to think those thoughts


---------49:54----------
and let yourself think those thoughts to


---------49:57----------
blame


---------49:57----------
yourself to blame your mom to blame your


---------50:00----------
dad to blame a god that you don't even


---------50:02----------
believe in blame everything under the


---------50:04----------
sun


---------50:07----------
and then accept and then forgive


---------50:15----------
right that's what you need to do like


---------50:16----------
you're missing like this piece of like


---------50:19----------
my god man you need to climb on top of a


---------50:21----------
mountain and you need to scream about


---------50:23----------
how


---------50:24----------
unlucky you are and then also


---------50:27----------
recognize that you're blessed


---------50:31----------
because this is what life is man life is


---------50:34----------
not either or


---------50:36----------
right like if you look at the yin yang


---------50:38----------
there's a tiny black dot in the whites


---------50:40----------
part and there's a tiny white dot in the


---------50:42----------
black part


---------50:46----------
and so like should you be grateful like


---------50:48----------
was your dad proud of you like


---------50:50----------
absolutely should you be


---------50:53----------
[ __ ] angry that you guys were just


---------50:56----------
starting to build something and that you


---------50:58----------
got robbed dude


---------51:02----------
and that's not fair and you shouldn't


---------51:06----------
like i respect you for accepting it but


---------51:09----------
there's a part of me that says


---------51:10----------
holy [ __ ] you shouldn't have to accept


---------51:12----------
it


---------51:14----------
no one deserves a life where they have


---------51:16----------
to accept what you have accepted


---------51:26----------
and that acknowledgement needs to be


---------51:28----------
there too and i don't know if you do


---------51:29----------
that part


---------51:33----------
no i don't so that's actually


---------51:37----------
a rejection


---------51:41----------
right like what you're not accepting is


---------51:43----------
that you shouldn't need to accept so


---------51:45----------
much


---------51:49----------
and like like i get that you're like


---------51:50----------
you're thoughtful and you're


---------51:52----------
clearly resilient and you're clearly


---------51:54----------
like


---------51:55----------
forward thinking and you're about growth


---------51:58----------
and moving forward so you the last thing


---------52:00----------
you want to do is throw yourself a


---------52:01----------
[ __ ] pity party


---------52:05----------
like i would guess that you're it's very


---------52:07----------
hard for you to throw yourself a pity


---------52:08----------
party if not impossible


---------52:11----------
i just think it's unproductive exactly


---------52:13----------
right


---------52:14----------
and so that like here's here's a quick


---------52:16----------
answer for you okay


---------52:18----------
if you're stuck with something just do


---------52:21----------
the thing that you don't do


---------52:25----------
that's fair right i think i i think the


---------52:28----------
big reason why i didn't do it i think


---------52:29----------
is part of what you hit on earlier which


---------52:30----------
i think kind of built my identity


---------52:33----------
around it in some way or shape or form i


---------52:35----------
think having that removed i just


---------52:37----------
couldn't imagine


---------52:38----------
what that would be like so


---------52:42----------
yeah yeah so i and i think that that's


---------52:44----------
that's fair right so i think this is


---------52:45----------
where like


---------52:46----------
what like what you need to do ab is


---------52:47----------
integrate


---------52:49----------
not separate and like that's what you're


---------52:50----------
doing is like you're you're figuring out


---------52:52----------
like what's adaptive


---------52:53----------
and i think that's why it's hard for you


---------52:55----------
because it's been like adaptive


---------52:58----------
to be this way like you're amazing dude


---------53:00----------
went through basic training


---------53:02----------
youtuber comedian you've made something


---------53:05----------
of yourself that your dad would be proud


---------53:07----------
of


---------53:07----------
and i'm not trying to get you to cry


---------53:09----------
again i'm just saying like objectively


---------53:10----------
no no don't worry


---------53:11----------
i think i got all the tears out left for


---------53:14----------
now


---------53:14----------
you know child of immigrants like you


---------53:17----------
kind of made something of yourself and


---------53:19----------
it's amazing


---------53:21----------
and but there are all kinds of other


---------53:23----------
things like you know like you don't want


---------53:24----------
to sound like an ungrateful little [ __ ]


---------53:26----------
but like you get to be an ungrateful


---------53:27----------
little [ __ ] from time to time


---------53:33----------
and so i think what you're doing is


---------53:34----------
rejecting that part of you


---------53:39----------
like in a weird way like you're like


---------53:40----------
you're not gonna be that kid


---------53:44----------
that you probably felt like like like


---------53:46----------
you you don't want to let yourself


---------53:48----------
and we see it poking through like how


---------53:50----------
did you feel when you had no one to call


---------53:52----------
it basic training


---------53:55----------
i think i took notice of it but i think


---------53:56----------
i just tried to shut it down


---------53:58----------
there it is right right right it is what


---------54:01----------
it is


---------54:03----------
yeah i think i think it's probably like


---------54:06----------
a survival tool that probably outlived


---------54:08----------
its um use you know because i think in


---------54:11----------
short periods and in times of like


---------54:12----------
difficulty i think it's important to


---------54:14----------
have those


---------54:15----------
but i think now and especially where i'm


---------54:16----------
at and i have time to spend with my


---------54:18----------
thoughts and my ideas that's like


---------54:20----------
oh i don't need that but i still operate


---------54:22----------
underneath that mode


---------54:23----------
and uh that's i mean you keep on going


---------54:27----------
on that


---------54:27----------
track and will be switching seats real


---------54:30----------
soon


---------54:31----------
i'm serious yeah


---------54:34----------
because abby you're spot on that like


---------54:37----------
that was adaptive


---------54:39----------
and now it's maladaptive


---------54:43----------
right which is exactly what you just


---------54:45----------
explained you've understood that


---------54:48----------
huh yeah it just reminds me of like


---------54:49----------
those like those stories about like


---------54:51----------
those old war robots


---------54:52----------
who are like commissioned for one


---------54:53----------
function and the war ends and like they


---------54:55----------
have to find meaning


---------54:56----------
right and maybe you think of that yeah


---------54:58----------
that's exactly where you are i think


---------55:00----------
it's a beautiful analogy


---------55:04----------
because your life has been a war bro


---------55:08----------
yeah i mean probably probably


---------55:11----------
wins on the inside trying to be that


---------55:13----------
dramatic but i get what you're saying i


---------55:15----------
also think the other part of it is like


---------55:16----------
there's a fear of not knowing


---------55:18----------
yeah like it's there's a fear of not


---------55:19----------
knowing who's going to be on that other


---------55:22----------
side or what they look like because you


---------55:23----------
know you're used to


---------55:24----------
you're comfortable in what you know so


---------55:25----------
if what you know is conflict or what you


---------55:27----------
know is just like this adapt


---------55:29----------
you know 100 just try to adapt every


---------55:31----------
situation irrespective of like


---------55:33----------
your inner state um then that the other


---------55:36----------
side of that it's like a


---------55:36----------
uh i guess a sense of new discovery so i


---------55:38----------
think that's frightening as well


---------55:40----------
because i'm comfortable with who i am


---------55:42----------
and maybe there's just certain aspects


---------55:43----------
of that that i need to shed


---------55:44----------
i suppose yeah


---------55:48----------
all right well done sir easy


---------55:51----------
making my job easy doing all the heavy


---------55:53----------
lifting


---------55:55----------
i mean you know i mean just a couple of


---------55:56----------
those nuggets information i'm like okay


---------55:58----------
now i could see the painting a little


---------55:59----------
bit


---------56:00----------
yeah like i said at the beginning you're


---------56:02----------
thoughtful


---------56:05----------
so you're right that what you need now


---------56:07----------
is courage


---------56:09----------
and the the the war robots just a


---------56:11----------
[ __ ] brilliant analogy


---------56:12----------
dude because what is what is the role


---------56:15----------
that you have


---------56:18----------
right and like i think it all is like


---------56:19----------
ties together because what you're saying


---------56:21----------
to


---------56:21----------
me is that you've built a life where


---------56:23----------
your anger is shoved into the basement


---------56:27----------
you've built a life where like these


---------56:28----------
feelings that have been destructive in


---------56:30----------
the past


---------56:31----------
you haven't really i mean you sort of


---------56:33----------
conquered them but you sealed it away


---------56:37----------
and now what i'm asking you to do is


---------56:38----------
like open it up again and you're like


---------56:40----------
[ __ ]


---------56:42----------
yeah what if everything come and so this


---------56:44----------
is where like you got to have faith in


---------56:45----------
yourself and you


---------56:46----------
got to have courage that like you can't


---------56:48----------
you're not going to be able to mourn as


---------56:50----------
long as you have


---------56:51----------
you know deep emotions about yourself


---------56:54----------
walled off


---------56:57----------
and very practically about your dad i


---------56:58----------
just revisit i think part of the reason


---------57:00----------
that you're not done mourning yet is


---------57:01----------
because you got to mourn


---------57:03----------
when he's alive i think you've probably


---------57:06----------
done enough about when he's passed away


---------57:09----------
yeah yeah


---------57:12----------
and you gotta you know think and like


---------57:14----------
talk to your brother and maybe see a


---------57:15----------
therapist or


---------57:16----------
or do a lot of soul searching or just


---------57:18----------
turn that noggin on on top of your


---------57:20----------
shoulders to


---------57:20----------
this problem and i think you'll get


---------57:23----------
really far really fast


---------57:25----------
okay


---------57:30----------
it's a lot to think about that's good


---------57:38----------
yeah


---------57:46----------
so just quickly about mentorship yes


---------57:49----------
sorry


---------57:50----------
nope i think it's i don't think if it's


---------57:52----------
okay with you i don't think we need to


---------57:54----------
dive into it i don't think mentorship is


---------57:56----------
like


---------57:56----------
i think it's like a sorry for being


---------57:58----------
judgmental here but i think it's like a


---------58:02----------
late manifestation of like a lot of the


---------58:04----------
stuff that we're talking about


---------58:07----------
i think as you start to explore i mean


---------58:10----------
just to put it


---------58:11----------
simply i don't know if this is gonna


---------58:12----------
make sense or not but like


---------58:15----------
you know i think it's good that you


---------58:16----------
already tied together mentorship with


---------58:18----------
like loss of a loved one but i i think


---------58:20----------
it goes back to


---------58:21----------
you know even before your dad passed


---------58:22----------
away i think it goes back to basic


---------58:23----------
training


---------58:24----------
that story is powerful and that that


---------58:26----------
story tells us a lot about your


---------58:28----------
experience of life


---------58:30----------
like when you don't have someone to call


---------58:32----------
right like you said to us


---------58:34----------
they had people to tell them to


---------58:36----------
encourage them to push through


---------58:39----------
right they had people like father


---------58:41----------
figures who were like you can do it bro


---------58:42----------
i have faith in you and so i think the


---------58:46----------
mentorship conversation is about like


---------58:48----------
you know finding someone who can


---------58:50----------
but i mean i i think you gotta first


---------58:52----------
sort of grapple with that loneliness you


---------58:53----------
gotta grapple with like


---------58:55----------
there's a lot of concrete stuff about


---------58:57----------
mentorship we could talk about but i


---------58:58----------
think at the end of the day


---------58:59----------
i mean what i'm getting abba is like


---------59:01----------
you're a dude who grew up alone


---------59:04----------
yeah that's very accurate


---------59:07----------
right and and that is hard


---------59:11----------
you want to be grateful for that


---------59:15----------
no right i'd say like do you feel alone


---------59:20----------
now


---------59:21----------
and don't don't don't answer with like


---------59:23----------
whether you have friends or not i'm


---------59:25----------
asking you do you feel alone


---------59:29----------
and also a be feeling alone doesn't have


---------59:31----------
to feel bad


---------59:33----------
do you feel alone


---------59:43----------
i don't feel alone but i do feel like


---------59:46----------
there's elements in my life that are


---------59:48----------
missing


---------59:50----------
that are really important yep


---------59:53----------
you know and and you don't again it's


---------59:55----------
like one of those things you don't know


---------59:56----------
you need it to


---------59:57----------
you see it right and i remember you know


---------60:00----------
i have a friend of mine she's a she's


---------60:04----------
a work colleague if you will she's a


---------60:06----------
comedian and she's older than i am in


---------60:08----------
her late 40s and we've worked together


---------60:10----------
on comedy shows and she invited me over


---------60:11----------
for a thanksgiving dinner


---------60:13----------
so i went to her place and i remember


---------60:15----------
just sitting


---------60:16----------
at this like long table and there was


---------60:19----------
like 20 people right like all extended


---------60:21----------
family everyone's sitting


---------60:22----------
everyone does a little prayer at the


---------60:24----------
beginning and then they pass along the


---------60:26----------
stuffing and


---------60:27----------
the meats and stuff like that and


---------60:29----------
they're all talking to each other you


---------60:30----------
know fairly cordially and not in a


---------60:31----------
manner that's like


---------60:33----------
we have to keep up appearances you can


---------60:34----------
tell there's a general likeness between


---------60:36----------
like


---------60:37----------
most of the people conversing with each


---------60:38----------
other and i just i remember it so


---------60:40----------
vividly


---------60:41----------
but i was just like oh this is how like


---------60:43----------
a family's supposed to function if it's


---------60:45----------
that it's like


---------60:46----------
optimal and i i was like i'm 27


---------60:49----------
and i'm just like realizing it like that


---------60:51----------
i never


---------60:52----------
we never had family dinners you know and


---------60:54----------
it's just like the absence of things


---------60:55----------
like


---------60:56----------
you don't i don't feel alone but i also


---------60:59----------
can't recognize the absence of something


---------61:03----------
that i never had and so it's hard to


---------61:05----------
understand the weight and the impact of


---------61:06----------
that so maybe i feel more


---------61:08----------
things than i realize it's just because


---------61:10----------
it's my default it just seems like


---------61:12----------
nothingness


---------61:13----------
does that make sense yeah it makes


---------61:14----------
perfect sense i love your robot analogy


---------61:19----------
you watch star trek


---------61:23----------
you know a little uh data is uh


---------61:26----------
does he work on board the starship


---------61:28----------
enterprise yeah so he's like an android


---------61:30----------
okay and like you remind me of data


---------61:33----------
because you're kind of like you're like


---------61:34----------
a robot that's sitting at a thanksgiving


---------61:36----------
table for the first time and you're like


---------61:38----------
oh this is what all humans are supposed


---------61:40----------
to be like


---------61:41----------
yeah right and the interesting thing


---------61:43----------
about data is that like he doesn't


---------61:45----------
wake up every day and like cry because


---------61:47----------
he feels alone he's just like this is


---------61:51----------
you know so i i think abba in a sense


---------61:53----------
like


---------61:54----------
look don't get me wrong you have a lot


---------61:56----------
to be grateful for


---------61:58----------
but i think you also like missed out on


---------62:01----------
a lot dude


---------62:03----------
yeah and i think you've got to


---------62:04----------
acknowledge that


---------62:06----------
and you've got to say like it wasn't


---------62:08----------
okay and then you've got to start moving


---------62:10----------
towards it


---------62:12----------
and i think some of that stuff is going


---------62:14----------
to be like re re-engaging with your


---------62:16----------
inner demons but like you're not the


---------62:17----------
teenager that you used to be


---------62:21----------
you know you're like you're like a man


---------62:22----------
grown now like you're you've gone


---------62:24----------
through basic training you're a comedian


---------62:26----------
you're a youtuber you have a successful


---------62:27----------
professional career


---------62:29----------
you have a better relationship with your


---------62:30----------
emotions you're a man that your dad


---------62:32----------
would be proud of


---------62:34----------
and i have faith in you that like you


---------62:36----------
can handle what's in that basement


---------62:39----------
like when you were 16 and living with


---------62:41----------
your dad and full of resentment and like


---------62:43----------
being a little [ __ ]


---------62:44----------
like of course anger got the best of you


---------62:46----------
but that's not the person


---------62:48----------
that you are right now


---------62:56----------
i guess it's yeah i guess it's the


---------62:58----------
moving forward towards it part that i


---------63:00----------
think was missing for so long


---------63:02----------
but i think you kind of gave me tips on


---------63:04----------
what that could look like for me so


---------63:05----------
yeah so here's the last tip don't do it


---------63:08----------
alone


---------63:11----------
i want you to stop being a pillar lean


---------63:14----------
on someone


---------63:17----------
let someone be there for you make that


---------63:19----------
phone call because this time someone's


---------63:21----------
going to answer now you have someone i


---------63:23----------
don't care who it is


---------63:25----------
i'm sure there are people in your life


---------63:27----------
yeah yeah look at people


---------63:29----------
teach yourself how to not solve all your


---------63:31----------
own problems


---------63:53----------
i'll do that thoughts questions


---------63:56----------
reflections


---------64:02----------
very insightful


---------64:06----------
it looks like your hand isn't i'm seeing


---------64:08----------
you focused


---------64:10----------
yeah i know i feel like i got a couple


---------64:12----------
steps back and you know these are all


---------64:13----------
like ways that were floating but now i


---------64:15----------
can like i could put them on the


---------64:16----------
the campus and so it's just that was


---------64:18----------
really good for me i think


---------64:20----------
in that regards let yourself be helped


---------64:22----------
to let yourself be angry


---------64:26----------
let yourself be all the things that


---------64:29----------
you've taught yourself to not be


---------64:31----------
yeah it's funny because just the thought


---------64:32----------
of doing that makes me uncomfortable


---------64:34----------
but yeah i think that's that's why i


---------64:36----------
have to move towards it so it's good yep


---------64:39----------
good man abby you're you're you're


---------64:42----------
special dude


---------64:43----------
really uh


---------64:46----------
thank you i appreciate that there you go


---------64:49----------
learning how to take compliments too


---------64:51----------
yup see look look at how thoughtful you


---------64:53----------
are how self-aware do you meditate


---------64:59----------
not in the traditional sense but i think


---------65:00----------
i do just sit there with my thoughts a


---------65:02----------
lot


---------65:02----------
okay you want to learn the traditional


---------65:05----------
sense


---------65:07----------
sure you were saying something sorry


---------65:12----------
i was just saying like often times i


---------65:13----------
like before i go to sleep i'll just lay


---------65:15----------
my bed


---------65:15----------
and just sit with my thoughts for hours


---------65:16----------
and uh like write down ideas sometimes


---------65:19----------
and


---------65:20----------
it's good so that's like that's my


---------65:21----------
version but i'd love to learn your


---------65:22----------
version


---------65:23----------
yeah so


---------65:27----------
let me just explain just very quickly so


---------65:29----------
i think it's awesome that you do that


---------65:30----------
but that's not meditation


---------65:32----------
okay so meditation is the opposite of


---------65:34----------
what you do


---------65:37----------
which is to sit with yourself without


---------65:38----------
thoughts


---------65:40----------
okay so when you say i sit with my


---------65:43----------
thoughts


---------65:45----------
there's the thoughts in the mind is the


---------65:49----------
object is the thing that you're sitting


---------65:50----------
with


---------65:51----------
it's not the sitter


---------65:55----------
does that make sense i always wondered


---------65:58----------
about that


---------65:59----------
because i felt like if you can observe


---------66:01----------
it there must be some separation


---------66:03----------
between you and it yep very good


---------66:07----------
and so that's why i just always assumed


---------66:09----------
that you're sitting with your thoughts


---------66:11----------
yep or your feelings perhaps sometimes


---------66:14----------
yep


---------66:14----------
yeah so that still means that you are


---------66:16----------
not your thoughts or your feelings


---------66:19----------
right so i think the reason that you


---------66:21----------
need to learn meditation


---------66:23----------
is because you need to learn what that


---------66:26----------
sitter is


---------66:29----------
and cultivate time with just the sitter


---------66:35----------
and the more that you cultivate time


---------66:37----------
with just the sitter


---------66:38----------
then you have no reason to fear a


---------66:40----------
particular emotion


---------66:44----------
right so so far your life it's good


---------66:46----------
you've learned this distance


---------66:48----------
on your own but you've learned that you


---------66:50----------
are not your thoughts or your feelings


---------66:54----------
and sometimes what happens is your


---------66:55----------
feelings become you


---------66:57----------
so there are times where anger takes


---------66:59----------
control and then the sitter disappears


---------67:01----------
you're not sitting with your anger


---------67:03----------
anymore


---------67:04----------
you're one with your anger


---------67:07----------
does that make sense


---------67:11----------
it's okay if it doesn't okay it makes


---------67:14----------
sense conceptually i think it's just in


---------67:15----------
practice but yeah yeah


---------67:17----------
yeah so so like practically what we're


---------67:19----------
gonna teach you how to do is


---------67:20----------
teach you how to be the sitter and then


---------67:23----------
we're gonna call up the anger and it


---------67:24----------
won't sweep you away because that's what


---------67:26----------
you're i get the sense what you're


---------67:27----------
afraid


---------67:28----------
of is that the anger is going to sweep


---------67:29----------
you away if you let it out


---------67:31----------
because that's what it's done in the


---------67:32----------
past like you mentioned you've been like


---------67:34----------
violet and stuff before


---------67:36----------
right so like in the same way as you


---------67:38----------
become a trained sitter you're gonna


---------67:40----------
learn how to like sit with that anger


---------67:41----------
and like it won't sweep you away


---------67:45----------
and you'll just it'll just be stuff that


---------67:47----------
you think about


---------67:49----------
or feel so


---------67:52----------
i i want to say i think you're going to


---------67:54----------
be gifted


---------67:55----------
meditation but i don't want to


---------68:00----------
set an expectation for you so let me say


---------68:02----------
rather than gifted


---------68:03----------
i think that you will really really


---------68:06----------
appreciate


---------68:07----------
what a meditative tradition has to offer


---------68:11----------
because some of the observations like i


---------68:14----------
don't know how to say this


---------68:15----------
abba and i don't know if this is going


---------68:16----------
to make sense but you know there aren't


---------68:18----------
many people like you


---------68:19----------
do you feel that way


---------68:24----------
uh yeah i do yeah so here's the thing


---------68:27----------
if you want to find people like you


---------68:29----------
learn to meditate


---------68:33----------
because there are going to be more


---------68:34----------
people who like kind of operate like


---------68:36----------
sort of like you do


---------68:42----------
but it's it's hard so let me just teach


---------68:44----------
you something any questions thoughts


---------68:45----------
that no no okay


---------68:50----------
let me think what am i going to teach


---------68:51----------
you


---------69:06----------
you have a drink you have a beverage


---------69:07----------
right yeah absolute water


---------69:10----------
do you have any other beverages that


---------69:11----------
you're not going to consume


---------69:14----------
i only drink water that's it okay i'm


---------69:16----------
pretty boring


---------69:17----------
no that's fine just thinking


---------69:32----------
okay


---------69:35----------
this is going to sound kind of weird


---------69:37----------
okay so i've got like a formal technique


---------69:38----------
that i'm going to teach you but


---------69:40----------
i don't feel like doing that so i'm


---------69:42----------
going to


---------69:43----------
we're going to try something it's


---------69:44----------
probably going to fail catastrophically


---------69:46----------
and then we'll resort to the formal


---------69:47----------
technique which is fine


---------69:48----------
okay because we gotta we gotta be okay


---------69:50----------
with failing catastrophically just


---------69:51----------
close your eyes


---------69:56----------
okay just like this is gonna sound weird


---------69:58----------
but just notice your existence


---------70:03----------
right so like how do you know that you


---------70:14----------
exist


---------70:23----------
you can answer it's a question it's not


---------70:26----------
rhetorical


---------70:26----------
you can take your time


---------70:33----------
my ability to observe okay


---------70:36----------
excellent see that's the right answer


---------70:38----------
okay so then what is what is it that


---------70:40----------
you're observing


---------70:43----------
um darkness


---------70:47----------
sound


---------70:51----------
okay so who is it that's that's doing


---------70:53----------
the observation


---------71:02----------
i feel like there's like a super


---------71:03----------
computer on the back and it's just


---------71:04----------
utilizing its tools


---------71:06----------
okay so the super computer


---------71:09----------
that's a good answer too so tell me


---------71:13----------
tell me about the super computer


---------71:16----------
what's the does the super computer have


---------71:18----------
a name


---------71:33----------
no good right again i haven't asked


---------71:37----------
its name okay so if you


---------71:40----------
if you ask it its name who is the you


---------71:43----------
and what is the it


---------71:50----------
i constantly feel like there's a super


---------71:52----------
computer utilizing all these tools and


---------71:53----------
then it relates the information to


---------71:55----------
yep very good so it's super computers


---------71:57----------
all the way back


---------71:59----------
okay does that make sense yes exactly


---------72:03----------
okay so then is the so is this a


---------72:05----------
supercomputer a man


---------72:14----------
it's gonna sound weird to me it's just


---------72:15----------
like it's just nothingness it's like


---------72:17----------
this darkness that's all


---------72:18----------
good good so now


---------72:22----------
we're going to teach you something right


---------72:23----------
so like will the super computer be


---------72:26----------
bothered by your anger


---------72:29----------
no will it be bothered by your


---------72:31----------
resentment


---------72:33----------
no does the super supercomputer miss


---------72:36----------
your dad


---------72:38----------
no when i ask you about your dad do you


---------72:42----------
lose the super computer


---------72:48----------
now i feel like


---------72:50----------
it its work is harder but good


---------72:54----------
excellent man yeah abby you got to do


---------72:57----------
the [ __ ] bro


---------72:59----------
so now all we're gonna do so this is the


---------73:02----------
so basically the point of meditation is


---------73:05----------
to like


---------73:05----------
sit with just the super computer so now


---------73:08----------
we're going to do something a little bit


---------73:10----------
different


---------73:13----------
so all we need to do is focus one of our


---------73:16----------
indriyas or sense organs on anything


---------73:19----------
and what we want to do so open your


---------73:23----------
eyes hold on one second


---------73:26----------
yep i can see it okay so this is what i


---------73:29----------
want you to do i just want you to look


---------73:30----------
at it


---------73:31----------
okay you can blink and stuff no big deal


---------73:33----------
just look at sort of the center


---------73:35----------
and i want you to notice now this is


---------73:37----------
where things get hard okay i want you to


---------73:39----------
look at it


---------73:39----------
and notice that you can see it but


---------73:41----------
seeing is a sense organ


---------73:45----------
okay so you can you can look


---------73:48----------
at the thing now what i want you to try


---------73:52----------
to do is have the super computer


---------73:56----------
look at the looking


---------74:07----------
so can you observe that you were looking


---------74:10----------
at something


---------74:11----------
that there is a capacity of looking


---------74:14----------
and make make the looking the object


---------74:18----------
of what you are seeing


---------74:27----------
and so in a sense you can even look at


---------74:29----------
something else so like you can look at


---------74:30----------
different parts


---------74:32----------
of the image and notice that like okay


---------74:35----------
there's a triangle in the middle so


---------74:36----------
right now i'm looking at the triangle


---------74:39----------
and then i'm looking at the petals but


---------74:42----------
irrespective of what i'm looking at


---------74:44----------
there is some kind of looking going on


---------74:46----------
and i can just watch the looking


---------74:48----------
does that make sense


---------74:51----------
is it possible that this kind of


---------74:52----------
exercise is harder with your eyes open


---------74:55----------
the reason the reason why yes


---------74:58----------
the only reason i ask is because when


---------75:00----------
you told me earlier to


---------75:03----------
focus on one thing and use the super


---------75:05----------
computer kind of observe


---------75:08----------
i try to focus on what i was feeling


---------75:11----------
and i don't know this is kind of weird


---------75:15----------
but i felt like the super computer was


---------75:16----------
just looking at fire


---------75:18----------
and the fly was building


---------75:21----------
and i felt like i was kind of observing


---------75:24----------
from outside


---------75:27----------
manifestation does that make sense yes


---------75:30----------
good so then do that


---------75:32----------
okay yeah so all you need to do is just


---------75:35----------
observe the fire do whatever the [ __ ]


---------75:37----------
you're doing whatever you're doing is


---------75:39----------
right at some point


---------75:40----------
you may want or need an alumna


---------75:43----------
alumni means support or objective


---------75:46----------
meditation but i think for now this is


---------75:48----------
fine


---------75:49----------
so here's the main takeaway so the


---------75:51----------
reason that you need to meditate is


---------75:53----------
because meditation is the


---------75:54----------
process through which the super compute


---------75:56----------
your understanding and relationship with


---------75:58----------
the super super computer grows over time


---------76:02----------
and then when you become enlightenment


---------76:03----------
all you are is the super computer 100


---------76:06----------
of the time that is what enlightenment


---------76:09----------
does


---------76:10----------
okay and so then like there is no


---------76:13----------
happiness or sadness and all things are


---------76:15----------
equal


---------76:18----------
hmm so very practically what i'd say is


---------76:22----------
if you see a therapist what i want you


---------76:24----------
to do is in the back your mind


---------76:26----------
watch the super computer and let the


---------76:28----------
super computer all these emotions and


---------76:30----------
regrets and things that you don't want


---------76:32----------
to feel


---------76:33----------
as long as you are secure in the chair


---------76:36----------
of the supercomputer


---------76:37----------
none of those things will touch you and


---------76:39----------
you can let it all out


---------76:44----------
it is when it becomes difficult to be


---------76:46----------
the supercomputer


---------76:48----------
that's what you need training for so the


---------76:50----------
closer you get to


---------76:51----------
this the greater the emotional energy


---------76:54----------
the


---------76:55----------
the more faded the super computer will


---------76:57----------
feel


---------76:59----------
and through training you can strengthen


---------77:01----------
that


---------77:05----------
okay and at some point i think you


---------77:09----------
should probably learn like formal


---------77:10----------
meditation like maybe when covet blows


---------77:12----------
over and stuff like that like go to a


---------77:13----------
class


---------77:15----------
but i think at the end of the day if you


---------77:16----------
sit with your super computer that's the


---------77:18----------
most important thing


---------77:20----------
okay yeah


---------77:24----------
thoughts questions um


---------77:30----------
i'm just grateful thank you


---------77:34----------
you're welcome you create a


---------77:37----------
created a great space for people to


---------77:40----------
um be brave and to


---------77:46----------
you know showcase that in front of other


---------77:50----------
folks and


---------77:51----------
um i think i mean i'm sure you're told


---------77:53----------
how conducive


---------77:54----------
and how how wonderful it is but for me


---------77:56----------
it's uh


---------77:58----------
even just having like witnessed some


---------77:59----------
other streams i thought it was


---------78:02----------
wonderful so thank you for that you're


---------78:05----------
very welcome


---------78:07----------
so


---------78:11----------
i have a weird response to that


---------78:29----------
let me think about how to say this


---------78:33----------
so i appreciate your appreciation


---------78:38----------
but i do not accept your gratitude


---------78:43----------
because what you need to really


---------78:44----------
understand abba


---------78:46----------
is that you were owed this


---------78:49----------
this is what you were entitled to this


---------78:53----------
is a part of the


---------78:54----------
everything that you deserve


---------79:01----------
so people come to me and they say oh


---------79:04----------
thank you for doing all this you guys


---------79:05----------
don't understand


---------79:08----------
i'm doing nothing for you that deserves


---------79:10----------
gratitude


---------79:13----------
like not towards me like this is part of


---------79:16----------
what you're owed bro


---------79:20----------
you draw short straws in life and you


---------79:22----------
get some long straws in life i'm one of


---------79:24----------
the long straws


---------79:26----------
i want you to as best as you can except


---------79:28----------
that this is just a part of what you're


---------79:30----------
given


---------79:31----------
and you can be grateful for that in a


---------79:33----------
general sense


---------79:35----------
but don't thank me


---------79:39----------
i understand the point about the long


---------79:41----------
straws but i i also have to respect the


---------79:43----------
fact that there's a manifestation of


---------79:45----------
choice


---------79:45----------
to be that long strong you know it's not


---------79:48----------
like in your absence


---------79:49----------
somebody else may have failed the void i


---------79:51----------
mean that's wishful thinking but it's


---------79:52----------
not it's not guaranteed and so


---------79:54----------
i think there has to be some measure of


---------79:55----------
gratitude for the idea that you chose to


---------79:57----------
be in that position to be able to help


---------79:59----------
folks


---------80:00----------
was i owed this i'll agree but uh well


---------80:04----------
well played sir that is the one piece of


---------80:06----------
gratitude i'm willing to accept


---------80:08----------
okay yeah yeah i agree that jesus


---------80:12----------
should be here i 100 agree with that and


---------80:14----------
i think everyone should know that


---------80:15----------
but i think there should be some idea of


---------80:17----------
like i commend you for being the person


---------80:19----------
who chooses to be that long straw for


---------80:21----------
people


---------80:21----------
yeah that i can that i that i can accept


---------80:24----------
that's what i have to accept


---------80:26----------
good i'm glad despite my desire not to


---------80:28----------
you found the one [ __ ] in my armor sir


---------80:31----------
i i commend you all right i'm flattered


---------80:34----------
