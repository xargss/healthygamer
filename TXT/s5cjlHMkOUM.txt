---------00:00----------
so can you tell us a little bit so what


---------00:02----------
are we calling you buddy


---------00:03----------
Miguel Miguel okay so Miguel tell me a


---------00:07----------
little bit about what's um what's what's


---------00:10----------
been going on with you recently and how


---------00:12----------
we can help okay so I guess to start I'm


---------00:17----------
a 19 year old student at university okay


---------00:19----------
you know I was living at living up in


---------00:23----------
the dorms and I was feeling like really


---------00:25----------
good I don't know I guess there's no


---------00:27----------
other way to put it I was in a good


---------00:29----------
routine I was doing what I wanted to do


---------00:30----------
on a day-to-day and then yeah my parents


---------00:34----------
kind of forced me back like I assume


---------00:35----------
like a lot of other people do to Cove it


---------00:36----------
and then I don't know I kind of just


---------00:38----------
went downhill from there okay yeah I


---------00:43----------
think this is kinda just a theory I


---------00:45----------
guess but I think it seems a lot for my


---------00:47----------
relationship with my parents just like


---------00:49----------
how it's preceded this is how I say it


---------00:52----------
okay okay yeah can you tell us can us oh


---------00:57----------
so what you you seem to be a little bit


---------00:59----------
of a unicorn


---------01:00----------
Miguel because you know most of us are


---------01:04----------
horses but here comes Miguel who


---------01:06----------
actually has a good routine at school


---------01:08----------
which sounds very very bizarre to me


---------01:11----------
can we actually start with that like how


---------01:13----------
do you develop a good routine at school


---------01:15----------
like that sounds a mythical I did


---------01:18----------
I don't know how maybe the other people


---------01:21----------
doesn't seem that good but for me it


---------01:23----------
worked really well I just like get up in


---------01:25----------
the morning you know like you food like


---------01:29----------
try to work out take a run or something


---------01:31----------
go to class then afterwards I might


---------01:34----------
actually like some kind of stupid but


---------01:37----------
inspiring pro-gamer


---------01:38----------
I guess for legal legends sure I guess


---------01:41----------
after class I would Matt do my


---------01:44----------
meditation then I just play for a while


---------01:46----------
you know eat somewhere in between and


---------01:48----------
then you know talk to my girlfriend


---------01:51----------
something like that and then so true a


---------01:54----------
true unicorn because not only are you


---------01:57----------
exercising but you are in or late oh


---------02:00----------
hold on a second yeah hello


---------02:04----------
turn them up got it


---------02:07----------
all right thank you all right


---------02:13----------
okay can you can you say something again


---------02:16----------
Miguel


---------02:16----------
oh I can't move my my closer to is that


---------02:20----------
better good turn it up so keep keep


---------02:28----------
talking Miguel whoa okay good


---------02:33----------
better fixed okay awesome thank you very


---------02:35----------
much cool yes so tell us a little bit


---------02:39----------
about you know so how mmm so interesting


---------02:42----------
so you wake up you eat something yeah


---------02:46----------
rightfully and then you try to exercise


---------02:51----------
what do you mean by try to exercise I'm


---------02:54----------
pretty inconsistent with it honestly


---------02:56----------
it's like there are weeks where it's


---------02:57----------
like you know five times a week or


---------02:59----------
something but there also works right


---------03:01----------
just like once or twice so okay I guess


---------03:04----------
it's kind of whenever I must have a


---------03:06----------
willpower to like get up with like Ron I


---------03:08----------
guess do you think it's willpower oh I


---------03:13----------
think getting into the habit of it is


---------03:14----------
but what's up at the habit not really


---------03:17----------
not really yeah okay makes sense and are


---------03:22----------
you interested in university honestly


---------03:28----------
not really I'm kind of just there


---------03:30----------
because my parents want me to be there


---------03:31----------
okay and yeah okay so we can talk a


---------03:36----------
little bit about that and how on earth


---------03:40----------
did you get a girlfriend how does that I


---------03:46----------
think I got really lucky honestly so


---------03:49----------
during my freshman year college I was a


---------03:51----------
lot more outgoing I suppose extroverted


---------03:54----------
and I was doing like a lot of party


---------03:57----------
stuff like that and I actually happen to


---------03:58----------
meet her like the Welcome Week of my


---------04:00----------
college experience so then really what


---------04:04----------
happened I accidentally asked her out on


---------04:07----------
a date I think when I was not completely


---------04:10----------
sober I kind of forgot about it and then


---------04:12----------
it just went from there oh how does one


---------04:14----------
accidentally ask someone out on a date


---------04:16----------
well I was very very not sober


---------04:21----------
and then I remember I guess I guess I


---------04:23----------
just messaged her and I woke up the next


---------04:24----------
morning and she talks to me like are we


---------04:26----------
still on for today I'm like what are you


---------04:27----------
talking about and that yeah that was


---------04:31----------
your reaction or that was what you


---------04:32----------
responded to her that was my reaction


---------04:35----------
okay awesome okay so you can you can


---------04:41----------
thank drunk Miguel for helping out sober


---------04:44----------
Miguel right yeah and so can you tell me


---------04:51----------
a little bit so how far are you from


---------04:53----------
your University how far is home away


---------04:54----------
from the University oh pretty close just


---------04:57----------
45 minutes give or take okay and where


---------04:59----------
is your girlfriend I feels the same


---------05:02----------
University she's like right now she's


---------05:04----------
she lives near the University like ten


---------05:07----------
minutes give or take so I'm also like


---------05:08----------
that's all right okay and are you guys


---------05:10----------
seeing each other physically no okay


---------05:14----------
okay


---------05:14----------
that's just like wanted stuff yeah I was


---------05:16----------
just curious you know alright so you're


---------05:20----------
you're back at home and how do you feel


---------05:22----------
being back at home um I guess I'm sorry


---------05:26----------
get used to it but at first it was not


---------05:29----------
great I guess the first day or two the


---------05:31----------
feeling I had described or how I


---------05:33----------
described at least was like homesick


---------05:35----------
almost which is kind of weird being


---------05:38----------
homesick for school nice in school just


---------05:42----------
like I guess yeah I guess school my


---------05:45----------
apartment like the life sure so um we're


---------05:48----------
gonna ask so I'm gonna try to think a


---------05:51----------
little bit about how to make this


---------05:52----------
productive for twitch at yeah so what I


---------05:55----------
want you guys to do is we're gonna use


---------05:58----------
Miguel is sort of a test case for how to


---------06:02----------
understand how his life has changed and


---------06:07----------
what's responsible for the change so I'm


---------06:09----------
making an assumption right so if we're


---------06:11----------
thinking about like collecting data


---------06:13----------
scientifically we want to start with a


---------06:15----------
hypothesis and our hypothesis is that


---------06:18----------
your life at university sounded like


---------06:21----------
pretty good actually yeah and then it I


---------06:24----------
mean since you're here today it sounds


---------06:26----------
like maybe your life at home is is not


---------06:27----------
so good in some ways yes and then for us


---------06:30----------
to try to figure out so when we look at


---------06:32----------
our lives and we think that our lives


---------06:34----------
are good


---------06:35----------
or not good we tend to attribute them to


---------06:38----------
certain causes so we say that like oh my


---------06:40----------
life at university sucks because I am


---------06:42----------
lazy right we'll say things like that or


---------06:45----------
because I'm undisciplined but what I


---------06:47----------
want you guys to really pay attention to


---------06:49----------
is that Miguel is in a sense the same


---------06:51----------
person that he was at home and at school


---------06:54----------
so it's not necessarily some kind of


---------06:56----------
intrinsic quality that leads to his life


---------07:00----------
being good or his life not being good


---------07:02----------
there are other factors at play and what


---------07:04----------
I want you guys to pay attention to is


---------07:06----------
what are the variables that have changed


---------07:09----------
in Miguel's life that have changed


---------07:12----------
what's on the other side of the equal


---------07:13----------
sign because it's not gonna be like I


---------07:16----------
mean I'm sure maybe you feel lazy but I


---------07:18----------
want you guys to just kind of pay


---------07:19----------
attention to how his Miguel's


---------07:21----------
circumstance changed how has his mind


---------07:23----------
changed and if his mind has changed if


---------07:26----------
his circumstance has changed then what


---------07:29----------
is that going to do to you know this


---------07:31----------
life that he is clearly crushing or was


---------07:34----------
clearly crushing yeah okay so that


---------07:37----------
that's what I want you all to pay


---------07:38----------
attention to okay and I can't really see


---------07:42----------
twitch chat because I'm you know in my


---------07:43----------
potato setup sorry I hope you guys got


---------07:45----------
that so Miguel tell us a little bit


---------07:47----------
about what it's like being at home


---------07:50----------
I guess I just feel a lot more it's


---------07:55----------
kinda stupid to say I guess but that's


---------07:58----------
not what's stupid to say about that I


---------08:07----------
just like where I grew up but I guess


---------08:15----------
it's it's like little things it's like


---------08:17----------
I'm just absolutely like ten hours


---------08:18----------
instead of like the usual way I'm like


---------08:20----------
just sitting doing nothing more just


---------08:22----------
like like a game or like watching


---------08:25----------
YouTube or something I thought like go


---------08:30----------
back to like the pro gamer type thing ah


---------08:33----------
I just not as motivated to play a


---------08:36----------
practice like get better I guess mmm I


---------08:39----------
talk to skills a lot more wasted time


---------08:40----------
feels wasted okay so I want you to


---------08:45----------
notice first Miguel two things okay


---------08:49----------
one is that you feel a particular way


---------08:51----------
and one is that you respond to your


---------08:54----------
feelings of feeling a particular way


---------08:58----------
yeah help us understand what the


---------09:01----------
difference is


---------09:04----------
I guess respond to my feelings of the


---------09:08----------
particular ways like acting on it more


---------09:10----------
so maybe like letting it go okay okay so


---------09:16----------
what what I've heard you say a couple of


---------09:19----------
things that I think are your responses


---------09:21----------
to how you feel so how you feel is that


---------09:23----------
you're unmotivated right you feel like


---------09:26----------
kind of sluggish the drive is not there


---------09:28----------
I mean you would wake up every day you


---------09:30----------
would eat something exercise go to class


---------09:33----------
get home like you know try to really get


---------09:36----------
better at Wow and that sort of spark or


---------09:38----------
that flame seems to be gone yeah what is


---------09:41----------
your response to that flame being gone I


---------09:46----------
guess I just let it go away almost like


---------09:51----------
up letting it be gone very good so what


---------09:55----------
I'm saying so I think your response


---------09:56----------
towards it is actually judgment what do


---------09:59----------
you think about that like I guess you're


---------10:05----------
judging yourself for being unmotivated


---------10:08----------
so you say I let it go away yeah right


---------10:12----------
that implies to me that you think you


---------10:14----------
[ __ ] up and that you said that you


---------10:18----------
should be different so should is a


---------10:23----------
judgmental statement does that make


---------10:25----------
sense I want you to keep an eye on that


---------10:28----------
because when people judge themselves


---------10:30----------
harshly what do you think it does to


---------10:32----------
their motivation possibly yeah okay so


---------10:37----------
let's think about this for a second why


---------10:39----------
do you think it kills it even more it's


---------10:42----------
kind of like dockwood spiral I guess


---------10:52----------
yeah so you beat yourself up and how


---------10:56----------
does but what is what's the effect of


---------10:58----------
beating yourself up you just feel worse


---------11:02----------
so but then then if you feel worse what


---------11:04----------
does that do to your motivation why is


---------11:11----------
that was that what you is that what your


---------11:13----------
experience has been yeah okay yeah okay


---------11:17----------
so let's let's go back to when you were


---------11:19----------
at college how much did you beat


---------11:21----------
yourself up I mean you're in there like


---------11:25----------
but not like constant I guess okay


---------11:29----------
so now we can make an observation so


---------11:31----------
we're gonna collect a data point we


---------11:33----------
don't really quite understand how this


---------11:34----------
works but it sounds like you felt


---------11:36----------
confident about yourself at university


---------11:38----------
that you and that that confidence meant


---------11:42----------
that you were less judgmental towards


---------11:44----------
yourself and that that that lack of


---------11:46----------
judgment every now and then maybe you


---------11:48----------
were judgmental but then the more


---------11:51----------
confident you felt about yourself you


---------11:53----------
sort of felt inspired or motivated to


---------11:56----------
like practice law go to class because


---------11:58----------
you know a lot of people want to go pro


---------11:59----------
in law and you know what they do at


---------12:01----------
university they wake up and they don't


---------12:04----------
go to class Yeah right


---------12:06----------
so like something so there's something


---------12:08----------
different here about the downward spiral


---------12:09----------
spiral and beating yourself up the


---------12:11----------
reason that I expressed some skepticism


---------12:13----------
about that I I agree with you that it


---------12:15----------
oftentimes leads to a downward spiral


---------12:16----------
but some people actually get a lot of


---------12:19----------
motivation from beating themselves up


---------12:21----------
yeah what do you think about that I


---------12:24----------
think I've experienced that sometimes


---------12:26----------
too how so I guess there were a couple


---------12:31----------
of days at university or it's just like


---------12:33----------
yeah I feel that like I I think I should


---------12:36----------
get up and go do something and I just


---------12:38----------
like force myself into the gym or


---------12:40----------
something or like go do something that


---------12:43----------
makes me feel better yeah so I know this


---------12:45----------
is gonna sound like a random example but


---------12:48----------
sometimes I work with especially women


---------12:52----------
with anorexia who are very successful


---------12:55----------
and the really interesting thing is that


---------12:57----------
like so a lot of times people with


---------12:58----------
anorexia are just incredibly successful


---------13:00----------
so it correlates with actually a lot of


---------13:02----------
worldly success and most people who have


---------13:04----------
anorexia are women and the really


---------13:07----------
interesting thing is that they really


---------13:08----------
beat themselves up for their appearance


---------13:10----------
and they think that they do a really bad


---------13:11----------
job and they suck at life and then their


---------13:14----------
sense that they suck it


---------13:16----------
life actually drives them really hard


---------13:18----------
they almost like whip themselves to go


---------13:21----------
the extra mile and they they never feel


---------13:23----------
like it's good enough and they're always


---------13:24----------
striving to do better it's kind of a


---------13:26----------
torturous and suffering way to live but


---------13:28----------
it actually causes them to crush it in


---------13:30----------
school and their jobs and things like


---------13:33----------
that what do you think about that does


---------13:34----------
that make sense at all or a while ago I


---------13:41----------
guess this time just different for


---------13:44----------
whatever reason it's just I guess back


---------13:48----------
that azz looking at my life it's just


---------13:50----------
I'm not doing anything I'm just like


---------13:52----------
playing games to play games I guess that


---------13:59----------
was the beginning of the pushing towards


---------14:00----------
like interesting so it sounds like you


---------14:03----------
started to maybe beat yourself up and


---------14:05----------
that motivated you to get started but


---------14:09----------
somehow when you got started and you


---------14:11----------
started feeling good about yourself that


---------14:14----------
was its own kind of motivation


---------14:15----------
confidence positivity all that kind of


---------14:17----------
crap yeah okay that's so so let's


---------14:20----------
understand that motivation actually


---------14:22----------
comes from a couple of different places


---------14:23----------
and we'll kind of come back to that if


---------14:25----------
it is relevant okay okay so next thing


---------14:28----------
is I want you to notice Miguel when and


---------14:32----------
I want twitch chat to watch out for when


---------14:34----------
you make a judgmental especially self


---------14:36----------
judgmental statement or the the word


---------14:38----------
that we're looking for is should okay


---------14:42----------
because I think should is really like a


---------14:43----------
great way like does that make sense like


---------14:45----------
how is should a sign of judgment because


---------14:49----------
it's like if I were a different person I


---------14:52----------
would have done this or like so in


---------14:54----------
business I should have done this yep and


---------14:56----------
and so like the opposite what's the


---------14:59----------
opposite of judgment huh compassionate


---------15:05----------
mmm sort of yeah I can see how it has a


---------15:10----------
layer of compassion so let's just well


---------15:13----------
we'll ask twitch chat will kind of come


---------15:14----------
back to that and what's the opposite of


---------15:16----------
judgment if it comes to you then by all


---------15:18----------
means go for it but um so let's kind of


---------15:20----------
come back sorry for that it was that


---------15:21----------
tangent okay Miguel oh yeah okay you


---------15:26----------
know so I'm gonna try to okay so now


---------15:29----------
let's talk about you


---------15:30----------
so tell me a little bit about what's it


---------15:31----------
like to be back at home is the biggest


---------15:37----------
thing is is just like the relationship I


---------15:39----------
have with my family's kind of weird I


---------15:43----------
guess my brother you're just preface it


---------15:48----------
well I have four brothers they're all


---------15:52----------
have siblings


---------15:53----------
okay my father is my mother's second


---------15:59----------
husband okay so it's not really that


---------16:03----------
like impacts much just like I think so


---------16:06----------
I'm pretty tight with them still I think


---------16:09----------
the biggest thing that's like different


---------16:11----------
at home is like how I interact with my


---------16:14----------
dad's like not good there's like a lot


---------16:19----------
of resentment I suppose so it makes


---------16:21----------
interacting hard I would say it's kind


---------16:23----------
of taxing what do you resent or does


---------16:28----------
heroes enter you resent I do I think


---------16:31----------
what do you resent that's a hard


---------16:37----------
question to answer


---------16:39----------
a lot of things I suppose just like was


---------16:46----------
the greatest probably that's like


---------16:49----------
without you know what a good upbringing


---------16:51----------
against I guess but can you tell us yeah


---------16:54----------
your upbringing so that's an oncologist


---------17:00----------
my mom stay at home she's like always


---------17:03----------
taken care of like before kids with me


---------17:05----------
I'm a dog too and yeah I feel like my


---------17:10----------
braid talk with my dad it was whenever I


---------17:14----------
interact with my dad it's because I did


---------17:15----------
something wrong or something like that


---------17:17----------
so we always end up with like a shouting


---------17:20----------
match basically interesting can you do


---------17:26----------
this a particular example come to mind


---------17:28----------
ah yeah I was like think about what I'd


---------17:32----------
say to you like there was one example


---------17:37----------
where he just like all right I don't


---------17:39----------
even remember what I did so I was like


---------17:40----------
10 or something maybe give or take


---------17:43----------
I did something wrong and then I [ __ ]


---------17:45----------
like I don't know man like I boarded up


---------17:48----------
my door like I threw like a chair in


---------17:49----------
front of it like scared of what he'd


---------17:51----------
like come say to me he like open the


---------17:55----------
door and you start yelling at me and


---------17:56----------
it's just stuff like that just not good


---------18:00----------
huh


---------18:02----------
not good yeah


---------18:06----------
so let's try to understand what's not


---------18:08----------
good about that like that I feel like


---------18:15----------
whenever stuff like that came up which


---------18:16----------
wasn't necessary you know just like sure


---------18:21----------
discipline me but relax I guess I don't


---------18:24----------
know what was he doing oh well yeah


---------18:31----------
hello oh oh my my body just went out


---------18:33----------
sorry what was he doing you say you said


---------18:36----------
sure discipline me but relax a little


---------18:38----------
bit so what was he doing disciplining


---------18:42----------
you I guess it was a pointers to side


---------18:47----------
with discipline he just like letting


---------18:49----------
anger out I guess okay yeah letting


---------18:53----------
anger out yeah sounds kind of passive


---------18:58----------
yeah it's that's like I like something I


---------19:03----------
know for sure but I suppose Miguel let


---------19:07----------
me ask you something what is someone


---------19:09----------
feeling when they close the door and


---------19:13----------
stick a chair in front of it fear why


---------19:18----------
are they putting a chair in front of it


---------19:20----------
what is the purpose of that chair


---------19:21----------
I guess distance like hoping it doesn't


---------19:26----------
come I guess they're like hoping it


---------19:28----------
stops it I got stops it so I that makes


---------19:33----------
a lot of sense to me I guess I'm looking


---------19:35----------
for a particular word and I'm gonna


---------19:36----------
continue fishing for it a little bit


---------19:38----------
right what is what is that chair doing


---------19:41----------
what what purpose so when you're a


---------19:42----------
ten-year-old like and you think about


---------19:45----------
when you watch TV and people stick


---------19:49----------
furniture in front of doors what's


---------19:51----------
usually on the other side Dave


---------19:55----------
yeah so what is the purpose of that door


---------19:58----------
I mean what's the purpose of the the


---------19:59----------
furniture in front of the door


---------20:02----------
protection absolutely right and like


---------20:06----------
what do we usually barricade ourselves


---------20:08----------
against because that's what you were


---------20:09----------
doing yeah I guess I guess I guess that


---------20:14----------
danger yeah but like what kinds of


---------20:17----------
things do you see on TV


---------20:20----------
sponsors zombies and stuff like that


---------20:22----------
absolutely so I want you to just think


---------20:25----------
about this for a second right so I want


---------20:27----------
you to imagine a 10 year old and how


---------20:30----------
much that 10 year old be feeling for him


---------20:34----------
to do something like barricade his


---------20:37----------
doorway really scared really scared


---------20:41----------
because what's on the other side is


---------20:45----------
danger yeah in a monster yeah I mean is


---------20:49----------
that how it felt to you yeah definitely


---------20:54----------
what was that like


---------21:02----------
I don't know just scared I guess I don't


---------21:07----------
know how else to put it


---------21:09----------
what's it like growing up with a monster


---------21:11----------
at home not good in what way just I just


---------21:21----------
don't feel safe I guess mm-hmm is that


---------21:24----------
how you feel now maybe the song stop not


---------21:31----------
the exact same way as a kid it's it's


---------21:36----------
got better here and there Walt


---------21:38----------
it's like I intentionally put a lot of


---------21:40----------
distance myself mm-hmm right so you've


---------21:45----------
you've learned how to put up other kinds


---------21:47----------
of barricades


---------21:48----------
yeah because chairs behind doors don't


---------21:51----------
work so what are the barricades that you


---------21:54----------
put up oh I don't think my girlfriend


---------21:58----------
notice is it's like I interact with them


---------22:02----------
it's just like oh I just turned off I


---------22:05----------
don't know it's like an emotional wall I


---------22:06----------
guess go monotone it's like try not to


---------22:10----------
interact like as little as possible


---------22:12----------
stuff like that okay so generally


---------22:15----------
speaking when we do things like that


---------22:17----------
those are adaptive so what when you when


---------22:22----------
you so you've learned how to not


---------22:25----------
interact with him right yeah so what


---------22:28----------
happens when you do interact with him


---------22:36----------
pretty good yeah I don't I don't know if


---------22:44----------
you really are interacting with him over


---------22:46----------
the past couple of years does that make


---------22:47----------
sense yeah there's exactly one time I


---------22:52----------
remember like really interacting with


---------22:53----------
them tell me about that


---------22:56----------
so around Christmastime my parents like


---------23:01----------
filed for a divorce they didn't end up


---------23:03----------
going through with it but I was like a


---------23:05----------
lot of certainty my mom kind of like set


---------23:11----------
my dad away so


---------23:13----------
well I was a lot of us for another


---------23:15----------
pressure he's gonna like set Christmas a


---------23:17----------
while I guess I just felt really bad so


---------23:20----------
one got dinner with them I kinda just


---------23:23----------
like you know it's like hunker down feel


---------23:27----------
like okay I'm gonna have a real


---------23:27----------
conversation you know I try my best


---------23:30----------
it was pretty good hunkering down to


---------23:35----------
have a real conversation sounds pretty


---------23:39----------
bad huh yeah what sounds bad about it


---------23:41----------
you should heed to hunker down a real


---------23:44----------
conversation why did you have to hunker


---------23:47----------
down my relationship with them which is


---------23:52----------
what like I have to protect myself again


---------23:56----------
still I suppose absolutely right I mean


---------24:00----------
I might like I sort of are you feeling


---------24:01----------
like I'm spoon feeding you don't get it


---------24:04----------
but I mean do what how much does this


---------24:07----------
resonate with you Oh resonates for sure


---------24:09----------
it's like yeah right so like we need to


---------24:12----------
be because it's so easy I guess yeah so


---------24:14----------
I think I think what I'm hearing from


---------24:16----------
you Miguel is that you have a lot of


---------24:18----------
feelings and you don't know how to put


---------24:20----------
words to the feelings and so what I'm


---------24:22----------
really spoon feeding you is the language


---------24:24----------
by asking you leading questions but I


---------24:26----------
think to me


---------24:27----------
you know like basically and I I imagine


---------24:30----------
people watching like when I think about


---------24:32----------
a 10 year old who literally has to


---------24:34----------
barricade in himself inside his room


---------24:36----------
from his father yeah that's like that


---------24:41----------
tells us everything that we need to know


---------24:42----------
you know the rest of it is just defining


---------24:44----------
terms but that image I think was


---------24:46----------
beautiful and I mean it was a terrifying


---------24:48----------
image but it was a well-crafted image in


---------24:50----------
terms of it captures a lot about the way


---------24:52----------
that you felt and like what you know


---------24:54----------
what your home situation was like can I


---------24:56----------
ask a little bit about the you know


---------24:58----------
possible divorce yeah why do you think


---------25:02----------
they were getting divorced


---------25:03----------
well I was at the time but apparently


---------25:08----------
he's had like a massive argument about I


---------25:11----------
don't really know honey maybe but yeah


---------25:15----------
there's you want like more details like


---------25:18----------
around the relationship or their


---------25:20----------
relationship rather if you're


---------25:21----------
comfortable sharing them ah I give what


---------25:25----------
I can honestly I


---------25:26----------
I never really knew how they were


---------25:31----------
together it's like always felt like


---------25:33----------
outward appearances you know and then


---------25:34----------
they would always like yellow each other


---------25:37----------
like dad would like threatened with


---------25:39----------
divorce or something when I was like


---------25:41----------
right here about that was like 14 or


---------25:43----------
something like that


---------25:46----------
yeah I don't have too much else to say I


---------25:51----------
always do it was like kind of unstable


---------25:52----------
but never to back huh okay what what


---------25:57----------
would they fight about


---------26:01----------
there's always start with like really


---------26:03----------
stupid small stuff and then both of them


---------26:07----------
are like pretty stubborn so they're just


---------26:11----------
escalating escalating never giving it up


---------26:13----------
and that yeah it'd reach points where


---------26:15----------
it's like I guess what's good for ya


---------26:18----------
blah blah blah blah it's like yeah hmm


---------26:22----------
like it wasn't even real stuff they're


---------26:23----------
arguing about and you said that you said


---------26:26----------
something along the lines if you don't


---------26:28----------
know how they ended up together


---------26:29----------
oh I'm not sure I quite I didn't say


---------26:33----------
that but okay so maybe interpreting so


---------26:39----------
help me understand that a little bit why


---------26:40----------
are you but what you know for a child of


---------26:43----------
parents who thinks that there's got to


---------26:46----------
be some reason that you believe that so


---------26:47----------
can you help me understand a little bit


---------26:49----------
about you know what you think about them


---------26:51----------
is so incompatible peppers I guess


---------27:00----------
I mean I've asked like both of them


---------27:02----------
about how it happens they both gave me


---------27:06----------
pretty different answers but I think


---------27:12----------
yeah was not like their temperaments are


---------27:14----------
both like pretty short they're both like


---------27:16----------
just different people I guess how did


---------27:19----------
they how did they tell you about what


---------27:21----------
were their answers in terms of why they


---------27:24----------
got together well my mom said something


---------27:28----------
one of the lines of like so she said


---------27:31----------
like my dad also like didn't really have


---------27:34----------
parents growing up like his dad died at


---------27:38----------
an early age he was at an early age


---------27:40----------
and his mom was like always is working


---------27:42----------
working okay so she said that it was so


---------27:46----------
he could finally have a family that he


---------27:47----------
could like cuz my mom where he had the


---------27:49----------
kids at this point and my dad said that


---------27:57----------
they accidentally had me so they just


---------28:01----------
got married so Wow yeah huh


---------28:08----------
what do you think about that I mean I'd


---------28:17----------
like to believe my mom's interpretation


---------28:18----------
more but I guess it's the realistic part


---------28:20----------
of me I guess it maybe knows is a harsh


---------28:24----------
word but like those my dad's probably is


---------28:28----------
the real version mm-hmm you know


---------28:32----------
sometimes I think it's interesting which


---------28:34----------
version we define is realistic yeah so


---------28:41----------
it's it's you know Miguel I see you


---------28:44----------
smiling a lot but I'm wondering if


---------28:46----------
you're feeling some kind of heart


---------28:48----------
talking about these things yeah it's


---------28:52----------
kind of weird to revisit all this what


---------28:56----------
hurts


---------29:03----------
family situation just passed but the


---------29:06----------
best I guess I just always overlooked it


---------29:13----------
that sounds a little bit unperson 'el to


---------29:17----------
me Miguel I mean you know pardon me for


---------29:22----------
once again hypothesizing but you know


---------29:25----------
the struggle that I have is in terms of


---------29:27----------
like I don't want to bias you but at the


---------29:29----------
same time you know I think it's hard to


---------29:34----------
do this kind of exploration at your age


---------29:37----------
so I mean I'm just gonna just say this


---------29:40----------
for a second like you know how how would


---------29:43----------
someone feel if they learned from their


---------29:45----------
dad that the reason their parents got


---------29:47----------
married is because they were an accident


---------29:52----------
definitely not good in what way what


---------29:54----------
would they feel squatchin everything I


---------30:01----------
guess like what you know like my parents


---------30:07----------
really loved me yes absolutely yeah how


---------30:13----------
does it feel to say that I was pretty


---------30:16----------
hard to say I think I've kind of thought


---------30:21----------
about that like you know passier I guess


---------30:27----------
my dad my parents were like talking


---------30:31----------
about divorce and stuff my dad actually


---------30:33----------
said something I like really caught me


---------30:35----------
off guard um we always used to say like


---------30:38----------
I like you to each other


---------30:39----------
I've been getting my dad and I was just


---------30:41----------
thought of as a joke it was like yeah I


---------30:43----------
never wanted to say I love you to be you


---------30:46----------
to me and I just had no idea to process


---------30:50----------
that and I still know mm-hmm does it


---------30:58----------
hurt when he says that to you


---------31:02----------
would witnesses what like when he said


---------31:05----------
that to you I guess maybe I was like


---------31:10----------
distance at the time so it didn't really


---------31:12----------
but yeah so when thinking about it I was


---------31:16----------
distanced right that's the barricade and


---------31:21----------
so that's why we put up the barricade


---------31:23----------
because as long as the barricade is


---------31:25----------
there the monster doesn't get to come


---------31:26----------
into the room when did he say that to


---------31:29----------
you he said that like probably a year


---------31:35----------
ago a couple months like March now so I


---------31:40----------
think probably wrong to summer around


---------31:43----------
the time that they had the divorce and


---------31:45----------
also around the time that you guys had


---------31:47----------
that real conversation yeah and and can


---------31:51----------
you tell us about the conversation well


---------31:56----------
that was like the Coxon that I suppose


---------31:59----------
but that's what he was also like you


---------32:03----------
know I wanna start right worth like our


---------32:05----------
relationship he said like wanted to


---------32:07----------
start trying more yeah yeah and like


---------32:09----------
give you love I suppose like he's


---------32:12----------
followed that with I love you all so how


---------32:16----------
did that make you feel


---------32:17----------
I was just also got so I guess it's


---------32:24----------
nothing so me go I'm gonna ask you


---------32:26----------
another question okay when someone says


---------32:29----------
I never wanted to say I love you that's


---------32:32----------
what your dad's words were right


---------32:36----------
along those lines so let's just let's


---------32:38----------
actually like examine that statement for


---------32:40----------
a moment what does that statement mean


---------32:47----------
probably didn't love me I guess


---------32:49----------
interesting so I'm gonna ask you to


---------32:53----------
re-examine that right yeah okay so can I


---------32:59----------
just think for a second Miguel yeah


---------33:05----------
so we've come a far away from motivation


---------33:08----------
schedules waking up in the morning and


---------33:10----------
eating meals haven't we yeah


---------33:14----------
[Music]


---------33:27----------
so I'm gonna I wanted to ask you a


---------33:30----------
couple of questions but instead I think


---------33:31----------
I'm gonna make a few statements and then


---------33:34----------
I'm gonna give you a choice because I


---------33:36----------
don't want to lead you somewhere that


---------33:37----------
you don't want to go yeah so I think


---------33:42----------
that you don't know whether your father


---------33:45----------
loves you or not and and I don't know if


---------33:52----------
you want to know the answer to that


---------33:54----------
question I don't know if you're prepared


---------33:57----------
to know the answer to that question yeah


---------34:04----------
so now we have we have an interesting


---------34:07----------
choice right so like the problem is that


---------34:10----------
you don't know what's on the other side


---------34:12----------
of the door it could be a monster it may


---------34:14----------
not be a monster


---------34:15----------
yeah the challenge is that in order for


---------34:17----------
you to know the answer to that question


---------34:20----------
you have to take the chair away from the


---------34:21----------
door and you have to unlock it and you


---------34:23----------
have to open it the real scary thing is


---------34:26----------
that you don't know what's gonna walk


---------34:27----------
through yeah so we're not going to


---------34:31----------
assume that it isn't in a monster and


---------34:32----------
we're not going to assume that your dad


---------34:34----------
does love you although I do believe he


---------34:35----------
does but in order for you to let him


---------34:39----------
love you you also have to let him not


---------34:41----------
love you and I don't know if you're


---------34:43----------
ready for that so it means that you have


---------34:48----------
to let him in and then like like right


---------34:51----------
now you have walls up which is why when


---------34:53----------
he says certain things to you you're


---------34:54----------
protected from them yeah but in order to


---------34:58----------
like really you know you don't know if


---------35:00----------
it's a fluffy teddy bear on the other


---------35:02----------
side or if it's a monster but like


---------35:05----------
opening yourself up to one is opening


---------35:08----------
yourself up to the other does that make


---------35:10----------
sense like you've got a being vulnerable


---------35:13----------
because right now when he tells you he


---------35:15----------
loves you like what what are those words


---------35:17----------
like do to you


---------35:21----------
honestly they either make you feel


---------35:24----------
hotter they're like exactly right so if


---------35:28----------
we think about they do nothing to you


---------35:31----------
that's because your walls are up like


---------35:32----------
and you know they can't you know in law


---------35:36----------
there's that area where you you know the


---------35:38----------
enemies can't walk into


---------35:41----------
so like you know your walls are up so


---------35:43----------
they can't enter the thing is you don't


---------35:46----------
so in order for those words in order for


---------35:48----------
you to feel do you want to feel loved by


---------35:51----------
your dad just feels like I don't care


---------35:58----------
like either way excellent insight right


---------36:02----------
so this is exactly what I'm saying this


---------36:03----------
is why I'm instead of asking you a


---------36:04----------
thousand questions I'm just telling you


---------36:06----------
it's the first thing that I'm


---------36:07----------
hypothesizing to you is that you know in


---------36:09----------
order to feel loved by your dad you have


---------36:12----------
to care about what he feels and I want


---------36:15----------
you to just notice this because this is


---------36:16----------
important sometimes we choose not to


---------36:18----------
care about stuff because if I don't care


---------36:20----------
about something then it can't hurt me


---------36:22----------
but the other problem is that like if I


---------36:25----------
don't care about it I can't feel joy


---------36:27----------
from it either yeah so right now you


---------36:30----------
have this barricade which is that you


---------36:32----------
don't care whether he loves you or not


---------36:34----------
because and that protects you from him


---------36:37----------
not loving you but it also prevents you


---------36:39----------
from feeling loved by him and as a


---------36:44----------
result of not caring I think you sort of


---------36:46----------
end up with something down the road that


---------36:48----------
mutates over time into resentment does


---------36:52----------
that make sense so now we have kind of a


---------36:55----------
choice Miguel do you want to and you


---------36:59----------
really don't have to say one thing or


---------37:00----------
another it's not like forget about like


---------37:01----------
this is actually your choice okay I


---------37:03----------
don't want you to say something I don't


---------37:04----------
want you to do something because we're


---------37:05----------
talking twitch or whatever do you want


---------37:08----------
to try to explore what bringing the


---------37:10----------
walls down is like or not exactly I'm


---------37:19----------
with you


---------37:27----------
honestly part of me doesn't part of me


---------37:31----------
doesn't there part of me doesn't part of


---------37:32----------
you doesn't good so I tell me about


---------37:33----------
those two parts this is one part that


---------37:36----------
like knows he's trying to be better and


---------37:38----------
like wants to encourage that I guess but


---------37:43----------
there's also the other part that's


---------37:47----------
there's just a lot too I don't know how


---------37:50----------
to explain it


---------37:51----------
yeah tell me what that part is saying


---------37:54----------
he's hurt you so much just like it's


---------37:57----------
better you just like try to work on the


---------37:59----------
other parts of being at home try to like


---------38:03----------
get back to where you were


---------38:05----------
just ignore it mm-hmm which way which


---------38:09----------
part do you want to listen to today


---------38:20----------
honestly the the part that doesn't want


---------38:22----------
to good for you yeah good for you I want


---------38:29----------
to come out for a while just what


---------38:36----------
decisions were those do I want a lot of


---------38:39----------
that yeah yeah like I said then hi part


---------38:43----------
of me wants to but it's just so hard


---------38:46----------
what do you resent him for haha a whole


---------38:55----------
hot I guess it's hard to pinpoint mm-hmm


---------39:00----------
can I can I give it a shot sure do you


---------39:05----------
resent him for putting you in in this


---------39:07----------
situation in the first place I never


---------39:12----------
thought of that but yeah definitely I


---------39:14----------
couldn't have to think like this yep how


---------39:18----------
does it feel to have to think like this


---------39:22----------
yeah my apartment doing what I want to


---------39:32----------
do I have to deal with this garbage it's


---------39:39----------
hard right do you do you hate him for


---------39:44----------
making you feel this way really hard


---------39:52----------
like I definitely did hard for a lot of


---------39:56----------
like hatred towards them especially I


---------39:57----------
was like a bit you up here and maybe


---------40:01----------
it's not for putting me in this


---------40:02----------
situation but it's there what did you


---------40:05----------
hate him for just like oh my god and


---------40:15----------
what is he


---------40:22----------
my dad I don't know I'm gonna think for


---------40:29----------
another second okay yeah I get water


---------40:32----------
yeah of course


---------40:41----------
oh twitch chat what are we gonna do with


---------40:43----------
Miguel what are we gonna do


---------40:57----------
just got to make sure the door is locked


---------41:07----------
curious what did you do with the door uh


---------41:11----------
I'm speaking outside see you fan yeah


---------41:15----------
there is a rear last time I like a


---------41:19----------
serious talk like if the house was with


---------41:21----------
like my dad we're talking about like the


---------41:23----------
divorce mom was just like around the


---------41:27----------
corner listen again no I guess I saw on


---------41:30----------
have you heard by them right now yeah


---------41:33----------
what do you think would happen if you


---------41:35----------
were heard by them have to deal with it


---------41:39----------
I guess


---------41:39----------
without what would you have to deal with


---------41:42----------
what do you think would happen what are


---------41:44----------
you afraid of why don't we you why don't


---------41:47----------
you want them to know what you're saying


---------41:48----------
right now cuz like I don't even know


---------41:53----------
like precisely how to feel so how am I


---------41:55----------
gonna like vocalizes of that what I'm


---------41:58----------
feeling


---------41:59----------
why do you have to vocalize to them and


---------42:02----------
in a clear way what you're feeling just


---------42:07----------
like help with what I'm saying I guess


---------42:10----------
like how Ponder's that what do you want


---------42:13----------
them to understand


---------42:18----------
I feel this way that it's like tearing


---------42:21----------
me up almost what are you feeling


---------42:35----------
that's hard to say from a physical size


---------42:37----------
just like something in my chest


---------42:39----------
what's in your chest happiness I suppose


---------42:44----------
tightness or heaviness yeah tightness


---------42:48----------
tightness yeah


---------43:06----------
okay so Miguel I'm gonna go ahead and


---------43:10----------
ask you a couple of questions okay


---------43:12----------
okay so I want to come back to the


---------43:17----------
statement that your dad said that I


---------43:21----------
didn't want to tell you that I loved you


---------43:24----------
right yeah so and you're interpreting


---------43:34----------
that as he doesn't love you not exactly


---------43:43----------
I think yeah so earlier I think when I


---------43:50----------
asked you about that you said yeah sort


---------43:52----------
of the way that you felt is that he


---------43:54----------
didn't love you when I was I think when


---------43:59----------
I was younger like and he would say like


---------44:02----------
stuff like I like you stuff like that


---------44:04----------
he didn't that maybe that's like I'm


---------44:07----------
sure but now like I think he does that


---------44:11----------
makes it a lot harder to what makes it


---------44:14----------
why does that make it harder how does


---------44:15----------
that make it hurt to have the


---------44:19----------
relationship I know he's like trying I


---------44:21----------
know that he like you know he wants to


---------44:26----------
change I'm just like not helping that I


---------44:28----------
guess hmm should you be doing something


---------44:32----------
different


---------44:36----------
I don't know there's the [ __ ] that I


---------44:38----------
guess very good is that how you feel


---------44:42----------
cuz when you say I'm not helping yet


---------44:45----------
that sounds pretty judgmental to me yeah


---------44:49----------
there's stuff yeah I think about this


---------44:52----------
too it's like part of me that definitely


---------44:54----------
wants to like you know help partner also


---------44:58----------
change the relationship it's part of the


---------44:59----------
reason why I'm here you then but at the


---------45:02----------
same time just like why do I even need


---------45:05----------
to try what's the point


---------45:11----------
so you don't need to try I don't need to


---------45:17----------
now let's let's understand that very


---------45:19----------
clearly right so yeah a lot of times the


---------45:23----------
decisions that we make in life the ways


---------45:24----------
that we approach life are based on this


---------45:28----------
part of us that is like pissed off like


---------45:37----------
have you have you read or seen Twilight


---------45:42----------
the first movie as I read it though okay


---------45:46----------
so I too have not read it I think I've


---------45:50----------
seen maybe movies one three and four


---------45:53----------
okay


---------45:54----------
and in those movies that I think at one


---------45:58----------
point there's like you know there's the


---------46:00----------
we're wolf versus vampire thing in the


---------46:02----------
log but at some point I think she has a


---------46:04----------
kid and then does okay yeah sorry for


---------46:08----------
spoilers I guess and and then I think


---------46:12----------
something weird happens I don't know


---------46:13----------
exactly what happens but then you know


---------46:15----------
so if you guys need to tune out you know


---------46:17----------
y'all shouldn't do now but at some point


---------46:20----------
you know the the we're wolf dude


---------46:22----------
actually becomes like sort of this


---------46:24----------
protector for her kid okay and and this


---------46:29----------
part of you that that wants to that


---------46:32----------
wants you to stay away from your dad and


---------46:34----------
doesn't want you to try and doesn't


---------46:37----------
think that you need to try I kind of


---------46:38----------
almost view as a protective we're wolf


---------46:40----------
does that sort of make sense like it's


---------46:43----------
like strong and angry and terrifying but


---------46:47----------
also is like really looking out for you


---------46:49----------
and you can count on it yeah like it's


---------46:51----------
you've got this like psychological like


---------46:53----------
we're wolf Guardian who just kind of


---------46:55----------
follows you around is gonna just [ __ ]


---------46:57----------
[ __ ] up if it tries to hurt you sounds


---------46:59----------
pretty cool and but thing is it's kind


---------47:02----------
of stupid like it's kind of stupid right


---------47:04----------
it just knows it's like it's gonna it's


---------47:06----------
like reactionary it's not nuanced it


---------47:09----------
doesn't you know sip tea with its pinky


---------47:11----------
up it you know it I don't know how else


---------47:14----------
to describe it like it's not very


---------47:15----------
psychologically minded it's it's it's a


---------47:17----------
beast


---------47:18----------
it's beast eale and so I think you don't


---------47:22----------
have to you can listen to that thing


---------47:24----------
because


---------47:25----------
this is what you've had to do so I want


---------47:27----------
you to kind of think a little bit about


---------47:29----------
this and let me know if this sort of


---------47:30----------
makes sense or doesn't make sense but


---------47:31----------
I'm envisioning you as a kid in a couple


---------47:35----------
of experiences happened that that we're


---------47:37----------
wolf in your mind starts to grow and


---------47:40----------
over time huh 100 percent there's like


---------47:44----------
one that comes divine tell us about it I


---------47:47----------
forget is it start from something stupid


---------47:50----------
again but like yeah my dad started


---------47:53----------
yelling at me like puff my chest up to


---------47:55----------
me or something I was so angry and like


---------47:57----------
yeah I puff tit back like I squared off


---------47:59----------
like about to fight him or something


---------48:00----------
like that


---------48:00----------
of course I back down because I'm like


---------48:03----------
not about to hit my dad but yeah how old


---------48:07----------
were you this was 16 maybe give or take


---------48:12----------
a year mm-hmm you said you weren't about


---------48:15----------
to hit your dad was he about to hit you


---------48:17----------
I don't think so he was definitely


---------48:19----------
poised like it though he had the thought


---------48:22----------
in his mind to him sounds kind of scary


---------48:25----------
huh yeah and so you had to learn how to


---------48:28----------
protect yourself so part of your your


---------48:30----------
psyche sort of developed to this like


---------48:32----------
protective mechanism and it sort of came


---------48:33----------
out it sounds like it was actually


---------48:35----------
pretty well developed at that point yeah


---------48:37----------
when do you think do you remember when


---------48:39----------
do you remember times when you were


---------48:41----------
younger where it started where you


---------48:43----------
started off being scared and then you


---------48:45----------
sort of found this like core or nugget


---------48:49----------
of like hatred and anger yeah tell me


---------48:53----------
about it I mean so specific time I could


---------48:57----------
think of but remember like after


---------48:59----------
argument or something with them


---------49:00----------
you're like he yelled at me I'd like sit


---------49:03----------
in my room just like hitting a pillow or


---------49:04----------
something like that just like really


---------49:05----------
angry yeah and how did you were you


---------49:08----------
angry while he was yelling at you it was


---------49:12----------
like boiling over I guess boiling over


---------49:14----------
when like toward the middle towards the


---------49:18----------
end like his but like some points like I


---------49:21----------
don't need to take this you know yep so


---------49:24----------
I just want you to notice that like


---------49:25----------
anger is born out of hatred I mean sorry


---------49:29----------
born out of hurt right and and so that


---------49:32----------
anger kind of arises and it protects you


---------49:35----------
so anger is also a protective mechanism


---------49:38----------
that we use


---------49:39----------
to Purdue to shield us from other more


---------49:42----------
hurtful emotions yeah so when I get


---------49:44----------
rejected by a girl it hurts and then I'm


---------49:48----------
like she's a [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------49:50----------
Yeah right so I think you know Miguel we


---------49:54----------
have a choice here so I think it still


---------49:57----------
kind of comes down to I mean first of


---------49:59----------
all it's like a no-brainer to me why


---------50:01----------
you're homesick for being away from home


---------50:04----------
yeah you know cuz when you come back


---------50:07----------
into this house all of these things


---------50:09----------
which you've managed to barricade away


---------50:10----------
or like more difficult to barricade


---------50:12----------
because you have a somatic memory you


---------50:15----------
have a memory within your body of these


---------50:18----------
times and these feelings you basically


---------50:20----------
like you know you may get diagnosed with


---------50:22----------
PTSD if you go and see enough


---------50:24----------
psychiatrists because what you're I mean


---------50:27----------
I I don't know if it's PTSD actually


---------50:28----------
isn't the right you may not get


---------50:29----------
diagnosed with that but you're it's


---------50:31----------
clearly been traumatic you know like the


---------50:33----------
other way you know we kind of think


---------50:34----------
about triggers or flashbacks so now that


---------50:37----------
you're at home all of these emotions are


---------50:39----------
arising and your mind is not clean and


---------50:42----------
focused the way that it used to because


---------50:44----------
all this [ __ ] is floating around now I


---------50:46----------
do have a belief I think your dad does


---------50:49----------
love you and I interpret the I wanted to


---------50:53----------
tell you I love you in a different way


---------50:55----------
yeah what I interpret so I for example


---------50:59----------
Miguel if I like someone and I say I I


---------51:02----------
wanted to tell you how pretty you are


---------51:04----------
yeah what does that mean about what I


---------51:07----------
think about their attractiveness you


---------51:10----------
definitely think they're pretty yep yeah


---------51:13----------
why didn't they say it scared I guess


---------51:18----------
something gets in the way yeah right


---------51:21----------
and what I'm hearing from your dad's


---------51:23----------
statement is your dad doesn't say I


---------51:25----------
don't love you he says I wanted to say


---------51:30----------
something to you but I didn't know how


---------51:32----------
or it was too hard yeah


---------51:34----------
what do you think about that definitely


---------51:38----------
make sense


---------51:40----------
I think like really thinking back to the


---------51:43----------
conversation it's like he's still saying


---------51:46----------
like you know well instead of saying I


---------51:50----------
love you saying I like I like you just


---------51:51----------
feel like a positive emotion it's so


---------51:53----------
like probably more there yeah so there's


---------51:57----------
a huge difference between I love you and


---------52:00----------
I like you though right right so you


---------52:03----------
love where I mean I don't know why I


---------52:04----------
keep on using romantic analogies but I


---------52:06----------
think they're more accessible yeah so


---------52:08----------
you know if if your girlfriend tells you


---------52:10----------
she loves you and then you respond with


---------52:12----------
I like you boy are you [ __ ] right I'm


---------52:22----------
sorry


---------52:23----------
you can say I'll be like to the is like


---------52:27----------
contrary you can all I get you know


---------52:29----------
false to say like I like you you know as


---------52:31----------
a thing also absolutely my point is that


---------52:34----------
those mean different things


---------52:35----------
yeah yeah right and it's like it's


---------52:38----------
apples and oranges it's not like you


---------52:40----------
know and and for you to hear I like you


---------52:43----------
is also a very important absence of you


---------52:48----------
hearing I love you yeah like I mean I


---------52:52----------
like all kinds of things yeah you know


---------52:56----------
but I I also love all kinds of things


---------53:00----------
too but there's a it's night and day


---------53:02----------
yeah and so Miguel in in your case you


---------53:06----------
know I I still you know so you feel like


---------53:08----------
your dad does love you and I don't think


---------53:10----------
that that's defensive so sometimes


---------53:12----------
people feel like their dads like you


---------53:14----------
know the people who are important them


---------53:15----------
and should love them love that they feel


---------53:18----------
that they want to believe that they're


---------53:19----------
their parents love them do you think


---------53:22----------
that you actually genuinely believe that


---------53:25----------
you're your dad loves you or do you


---------53:27----------
think that that's just you like holding


---------53:29----------
on to like childlike hope I believe that


---------53:33----------
yeah so then the question is why why why


---------53:39----------
do I believe that like I said he's like


---------53:42----------
making changes to try and change and


---------53:45----------
like show that he loves me more


---------53:50----------
yeah so I think in other ways even


---------53:53----------
though he didn't say the words I think


---------53:54----------
also when you were growing up there were


---------53:57----------
probably some things that he did that


---------53:59----------
made you feel loved


---------54:00----------
yeah can you tell us about those I


---------54:06----------
remember there I guess like one of the


---------54:09----------
better memories I have with my dad was


---------54:10----------
like you know geocaching sort of no it's


---------54:14----------
like we you go to like a location or a


---------54:17----------
spot and then like this app gives you


---------54:19----------
tips on how to find the treasure there


---------54:21----------
oh yeah right okay I remember like doing


---------54:23----------
that with them and that was really nice


---------54:24----------
like fun and I don't know he didn't even


---------54:29----------
say like I love you or anything during


---------54:30----------
that but it's just like whoa


---------54:42----------
I mean I guess the easy word is loved


---------54:44----------
but yeah probably more do it can I give


---------54:48----------
you another one


---------54:49----------
mmm did he make you feel wanted yeah


---------54:53----------
like he valued you being there and he


---------54:57----------
valued your time together yeah for sure


---------55:08----------
uh I though it's just like yeah it's a


---------55:13----------
few and far between yeah III wasn't


---------55:16----------
trying to be silent for to be awkward I


---------55:18----------
just didn't know how to follow that off


---------55:20----------
okay trying to get more out of here no


---------55:24----------
no that's why I was like oh [ __ ] he


---------55:26----------
thinks that there's more to know it's


---------55:27----------
just like I literally don't I don't


---------55:29----------
always you know sometimes it takes me a


---------55:31----------
second to process - yeah I'm just trying


---------55:39----------
to think about so let's pause for a


---------55:41----------
second okay since we don't know where to


---------55:43----------
go so tell me know what are we talking


---------55:44----------
about today man


---------55:45----------
I mean this was the big thing I just


---------55:48----------
want to know like what do I do while I'm


---------55:52----------
here because realistically I just I


---------55:53----------
can't just go back so how do i what do


---------55:56----------
you mean what what is the big thing


---------55:58----------
let's start there just like my


---------56:01----------
relationship with my dad and what have


---------56:03----------
we done with that sport it a little more


---------56:07----------
understand it like at least a little


---------56:09----------
better and what do you understand about


---------56:11----------
it now that maybe you didn't before um


---------56:15----------
that there's like more conflict in me


---------56:18----------
other nights than I know there is I


---------56:20----------
think there is there's like okay take


---------56:27----------
your time


---------56:29----------
you don't have to make sense by the way


---------56:31----------
right we can help you with that that's


---------56:34----------
what we're doing it's just the choice is


---------56:40----------
there whether I want to or not I guess


---------56:41----------
is the big thing yep if somewhere down


---------56:44----------
the line I'm like maybe more mature or


---------56:47----------
something like that and I decide like


---------56:48----------
you know I'm at a place where I can


---------56:51----------
finally go through with this then it'll


---------56:53----------
always be there hopefully I guess maybe


---------56:57----------
not always but the choice will be there


---------57:00----------
yep yeah so I and yeah I think so thanks


---------57:08----------
for recapping let me just kind of tell


---------57:10----------
you what I heard so the first thing is


---------57:12----------
that you know I think you've been numb


---------57:13----------
to a lot of your thoughts and feelings


---------57:15----------
about your dad and you've also been


---------57:20----------
conflicted and I think


---------57:22----------
times some of that can some of those


---------57:24----------
conflicting feelings bubble up like I do


---------57:26----------
genuinely believe that there is a part


---------57:29----------
of you that but is afraid that your dad


---------57:31----------
does not love you there's an older part


---------57:34----------
of you that feels like he really does


---------57:36----------
love you but there's a younger part of


---------57:38----------
you that really is not so sure and is


---------57:41----------
actually afraid and that the we're wolf


---------57:43----------
the we love doesn't need to really


---------57:44----------
protect 19 year old Miguel so much as it


---------57:47----------
needs to protect 10 year old Miguel and


---------57:48----------
I think both of those Miguel's exist


---------57:51----------
within you yeah in terms of your road


---------57:55----------
forward I mean I think to be blunt


---------57:57----------
Miguel I think that you have to patch


---------57:59----------
things up with your dad if you want to


---------58:01----------
feel like you're at home at home okay it


---------58:05----------
doesn't mean that you can't be


---------58:07----------
functional is successful at home but if


---------58:09----------
we think about you being comfortable


---------58:11----------
like what does home mean like home is a


---------58:13----------
place that you you feel comfortable and


---------58:15----------
relaxed and you can be your best self


---------58:17----------
and you don't have to like you know have


---------58:18----------
to barricade yourself you don't have to


---------58:20----------
check the door to see if someone is


---------58:21----------
listening you you know you're not you're


---------58:24----------
not at home right now and I think it was


---------58:27----------
beautifully said that you felt homesick


---------58:28----------
for being at school because this is not


---------58:30----------
home for you yeah if you want it to be


---------58:32----------
at home for you this kind of goes back


---------58:34----------
to like motivation and the downward


---------58:36----------
spiral and all that kind of [ __ ]


---------58:37----------
is that like as long as your brain is


---------58:42----------
you know spending energy keeping those


---------58:45----------
walls up like just think about this for


---------58:47----------
a second you got up to get water and


---------58:49----------
there's a subconscious process running


---------58:51----------
in your mind that's like let's check the


---------58:52----------
door yeah there's no way that you can


---------58:56----------
like you can't be motivated because your


---------58:58----------
RAM is being taken up by all this crap


---------59:01----------
you know when you wake up in the morning


---------59:03----------
there are feelings of like resentment


---------59:05----------
and whatever that have been like stored


---------59:06----------
in your room and in this structure for a


---------59:10----------
long time and you're just gonna have to


---------59:12----------
deal with those it's gonna encumber you


---------59:15----------
it's almost like you know your your


---------59:17----------
house is a zone that like is gonna like


---------59:20----------
reduce your stats it's like a miasma and


---------59:23----------
as long as you're sitting in it you know


---------59:26----------
your damage is gonna be reduced your


---------59:27----------
health is gonna be reduced well someone


---------59:31----------
was saying the other day that I ran out


---------59:32----------
of mana and I think actually man is a


---------59:34----------
great exam


---------59:35----------
for like cognitive energy the issue here


---------59:37----------
is that you're you're like at school you


---------59:41----------
know your mana bar is like max so you


---------59:42----------
can do a lot of things because in each


---------59:45----------
thing you do makes it harder for you to


---------59:46----------
do the others but you've got enough mana


---------59:48----------
at home really the debuff that you've


---------59:50----------
got as your man is like cut by 50% yeah


---------59:53----------
so it's way harder so the question is


---------59:54----------
like what do we do about that so there's


---------59:56----------
some things that you can do to kind of


---------59:57----------
you know buff up your mana bar or maybe


---------59:59----------
like regenerate it throughout the day


---------60:01----------
like you can like we can always talk


---------60:02----------
about like I'll meditate like meditates


---------60:04----------
the session to all of your answers and


---------60:05----------
things like that but but I think at the


---------60:08----------
end of the day you know you can't you


---------60:10----------
can do as many band-aids as you want to


---------60:12----------
but I'm a big believer that like the


---------60:14----------
root of the problem is like really where


---------60:16----------
the problem is yeah and you can't


---------60:18----------
there's no you can adapt for the miasma


---------60:22----------
that you're in but ultimately like the


---------60:25----------
real thing that you that your real


---------60:26----------
answer lies and like fixing this [ __ ]


---------60:29----------
yeah and I'm sorry to say that but


---------60:32----------
that's just what I believe you know yeah


---------60:35----------
I mean that's just how we are I don't


---------60:38----------
know that I don't know that we I mean


---------60:45----------
there's still definitely more things we


---------60:46----------
could talk about but that's sort of my


---------60:48----------
sense what do you think about that I


---------60:50----------
mean honestly I feel like deep in I know


---------60:54----------
that - it's just like [ __ ] man


---------60:56----------
it sucks what's my call I go so like


---------61:01----------
back to the pro thing I felt like I was


---------61:03----------
in a really good spot I was finally like


---------61:05----------
hitting the goals I wanted to and then I


---------61:07----------
feel like I just got like [ __ ] robbed


---------61:09----------
or something like came back home I'm


---------61:11----------
just not playing well I just don't have


---------61:14----------
what I had and I want to do something


---------61:19----------
total and a half the dudes really all


---------61:21----------
right yeah so can I say something that


---------61:25----------
is potentially cliche and inspiring of


---------61:29----------
course so I I think I think this is you


---------61:33----------
watch anime course I do come on so you


---------61:38----------
know you're you're not in your Super


---------61:40----------
Saiyan form yet yeah how do you get to


---------61:43----------
be a Super Saiyan


---------61:46----------
it was anger I think sure like if you


---------61:53----------
think about like you know you think


---------61:55----------
about like you know people who are you


---------62:01----------
know you think about how you like


---------62:02----------
attained your final form it's not just


---------62:05----------
through training right it's through like


---------62:07----------
a conflict and dealing with your inner


---------62:09----------
demons yeah and I I do believe that for


---------62:12----------
you to be the best if you actually want


---------62:14----------
to be successful at all I think the best


---------62:17----------
way to do it is to I mean like take your


---------62:19----------
favorite movie scene where you know you


---------62:21----------
have this conflict with your parents and


---------62:22----------
then you're on your final match you're


---------62:24----------
down like two out it's a best-of-five


---------62:25----------
and you're down two and you look into


---------62:27----------
the audience and you see your dad there


---------62:29----------
and he's cheering for you yeah like and


---------62:32----------
then you go back and you win the next


---------62:34----------
three yeah yeah and so I think the very


---------62:41----------
thing that holds you back is gonna turn


---------62:44----------
you into the person that you need to be


---------62:46----------
to really be successful okay and I'll


---------62:52----------
take that to heart and I think that this


---------62:54----------
is gamez way of giving you that


---------62:56----------
opportunity right so you were on a


---------62:59----------
particular track and life and this is


---------63:02----------
where you don't have to believe in this


---------63:03----------
stuff is just the way that I


---------63:04----------
conceptualize things because I find it


---------63:06----------
helpful and life is giving you this


---------63:08----------
opportunity to take something that


---------63:10----------
you've sort of because the thing is even


---------63:12----------
at school and stuff it's still like


---------63:14----------
occupying like it's still like debuffing


---------63:16----------
your man a little bit and if you don't


---------63:18----------
really want to be successful at law like


---------63:19----------
you can't be at anything less than a


---------63:21----------
hundred percent yeah yeah I think about


---------63:25----------
satire time yeah and and so right now


---------63:28----------
like the problem is in your face and I


---------63:30----------
think sometimes life like you try to run


---------63:33----------
away from things and I think life sort


---------63:35----------
of says ah and when life says that's the


---------63:38----------
time for you to step up and I think


---------63:40----------
you'll be I mean because of this entire


---------63:42----------
time you've been trying to play lul and


---------63:43----------
you haven't been your perfect self yeah


---------63:46----------
and you can't ever be your perfect self


---------63:49----------
until this thing is settled and just


---------63:53----------
imagine how motivating it would be in


---------63:55----------
the morning if you wake up in the


---------63:56----------
morning you see your dad he says good


---------63:57----------
morning Miguel I love you like how would


---------64:00----------
your day change drastically on the


---------64:04----------
contrary it's like I remember I woke up


---------64:06----------
one morning I was like started


---------64:07----------
meditating and he like walked in the


---------64:09----------
middle of it I got so bad like I didn't


---------64:11----------
direct it towards them I was just like


---------64:13----------
oh it's not next time I was just like


---------64:15----------
after like the rest of day I'm just like


---------64:16----------
tilted there you go yeah right so so


---------64:20----------
understand that they whatever tilts you


---------64:23----------
takes energy right the problem is that


---------64:27----------
right now that that energy is like


---------64:28----------
pointed in the tilting direction instead


---------64:30----------
of the inspiring direction yeah and and


---------64:34----------
what you I think what you really need to


---------64:35----------
do is like shift that around we're not


---------64:37----------
talking about creating or destroying


---------64:38----------
because you can't create or destroy


---------64:40----------
energy you cannot create or destroy the


---------64:42----------
energy of the mind all you can do is


---------64:44----------
redirect it and shape it and that you


---------64:46----------
can do through Rican sexualizing right


---------64:49----------
you can change I wanted to tell you I


---------64:52----------
love you at one point you interpret it


---------64:54----------
is I love you but I mean sorry he didn't


---------64:58----------
love you and then you can reinterpret


---------64:59----------
that is that I've always loved you and


---------65:01----------
I've always had difficulty telling you


---------65:03----------
that okay now I think the challenge here


---------65:06----------
is I don't know what you exactly you do


---------65:08----------
about this because I don't know how


---------65:09----------
ready your dad is yeah we're presuming


---------65:12----------
that the only person that needs to be


---------65:14----------
ready here is you the other thing that


---------65:17----------
they taught me when I was training to


---------65:19----------
become a psychiatrist was that it's the


---------65:21----------
parent that they don't talk about that's


---------65:23----------
actually the problem really right so


---------65:31----------
yeah I mean you know I think that in any


---------65:35----------
situations with parents like this


---------65:37----------
there's also there tends to sometimes be


---------65:40----------
kind of like this actually I'm gonna ask


---------65:44----------
you what do you think about that um I


---------65:49----------
mean I have my like I I definitely have


---------65:53----------
my like fit to deal with my mom still


---------65:55----------
but it's not sure it's probably it's uh


---------65:59----------
how would you say oh I'm D buffing me of


---------66:01----------
it but it's something not as bad I did


---------66:04----------
do you have any resentment towards your


---------66:06----------
mom for letting your dad create this


---------66:08----------
life for you


---------66:11----------
I wouldn't say so I never really thought


---------66:13----------
about it like that but there's something


---------66:16----------
there there's some resentment yeah so I


---------66:18----------
think oftentimes that's a piece of it


---------66:20----------
right so you have the the dad who did


---------66:22----------
this to you and then you have your mom


---------66:24----------
who watched it happen yeah and she also


---------66:27----------
had a daughter more a responsibility to


---------66:29----------
like protect you from this or because


---------66:31----------
all really like Miguel the really sad


---------66:33----------
thing about this is this is actually not


---------66:35----------
your responsibility right that's what's


---------66:39----------
really kind of and that makes sense to


---------66:40----------
me that you're resentful because


---------66:41----------
generally speaking kids are not the ones


---------66:44----------
who respect responsible for like moving


---------66:46----------
a relationship forward with their


---------66:48----------
parents that changes as we start to


---------66:50----------
become adults but it's really your dad's


---------66:52----------
job and he hasn't done a very good job


---------66:54----------
it sounds like yeah it's like I guess


---------67:00----------
the way I see it though is like he's


---------67:03----------
probably in a silver spot when he was a


---------67:04----------
kid so he just doesn't know what to do


---------67:06----------
yeah and I think that's a wonderful way


---------67:09----------
to start building a conversation with


---------67:11----------
him so I think that's really good for a


---------67:14----------
couple of reasons like do you feel like


---------67:16----------
you could have a conversation with him


---------67:17----------
about what his upbringing was like like


---------67:21----------
how so do like just back in like like


---------67:25----------
how do you feel about having a


---------67:27----------
conversation with him about dad what was


---------67:29----------
it like growing up for you I mean yeah


---------67:35----------
fairly if I guess through the word again


---------67:38----------
if I hunkered down yeah I could okay is


---------67:41----------
there my senses that you have to hunker


---------67:44----------
down less to have that conversation than


---------67:46----------
to have a conversation about him and you


---------67:48----------
yeah definitely so I think that's where


---------67:52----------
you can start because it has nothing to


---------67:54----------
do like these so the we're wolf doesn't


---------67:55----------
necessarily have to wake up in that


---------67:58----------
conversation now you're you still have


---------68:00----------
to hunker down because you're gonna


---------68:01----------
hunker down any time you talk to your


---------68:02----------
dad sounds like yeah but to have some


---------68:05----------
kind of space that allows you guys to


---------68:08----------
connect and also for you to like not


---------68:12----------
have to deal with the biggest problem in


---------68:14----------
the room like we're not going straight


---------68:15----------
to the raid boss we're starting with


---------68:17----------
like you know cleaning out the trash


---------68:20----------
mobs yeah yeah how do you feel about


---------68:23----------
having a conversation with


---------68:24----------
like would you be interested in that I


---------68:27----------
mean yeah it's like feel like a


---------68:34----------
necessity almost at this point what


---------68:36----------
feels like a necessity to you I mean


---------68:40----------
this is sounds like this is like kind of


---------68:43----------
cold what this is another way I've been


---------68:45----------
thinking about is just like he's like


---------68:47----------
paying for my university he's like you


---------68:49----------
know paying for the house I live in like


---------68:51----------
the food supplies like I I'm almost like


---------68:56----------
feel like I shouldn't be allowed to just


---------68:57----------
like cut him off and be like alright


---------68:59----------
whatever deal with this ever what work


---------69:02----------
did yous cut him off should oh god yeah


---------69:10----------
right so that's your judgment so I think


---------69:13----------
there's a difference between a VA you


---------69:14----------
won't watch dreams and stuff before you


---------69:16----------
new dog yeah so you know what Hodder ma


---------69:18----------
means mm-hmm so I think that there's


---------69:21----------
self judgment and there's a dharma so


---------69:23----------
those are two different things


---------69:24----------
yeah so I do believe that you have a


---------69:27----------
duty and responsibility as a son to try


---------69:30----------
to repair your relationship with your


---------69:32----------
dad but I think is duty is greater so I


---------69:35----------
think if you want to repair your


---------69:36----------
relationship because that's that like


---------69:38----------
that he's longing for a relationship


---------69:40----------
with you and you guys have seen you know


---------69:44----------
you've started like you've seen some


---------69:46----------
kind of signs of life there I think you


---------69:48----------
should you should write because I think


---------69:51----------
it is your daughter ma to try to nurture


---------69:54----------
that when you're ready and when you're


---------69:56----------
able although I don't you know I don't


---------69:57----------
expect you to do it at the age of 19


---------69:59----------
yeah and but it's reasonable I think


---------70:03----------
that you that responsibility is


---------70:06----------
appropriate for you to bear and and also


---------70:09----------
like you know it's also his Dharma to


---------70:11----------
provide for you because he's your dad


---------70:12----------
yeah that's what he gives you and then


---------70:16----------
when he's old and infirm you provide for


---------70:18----------
him how old is your dad by the way he's


---------70:23----------
like


---------70:25----------
seventy okay so that's also a something


---------70:30----------
that's very very tricky right okay


---------70:35----------
because you guys have such a wide age


---------70:38----------
gap that developmentally it's very hard


---------70:43----------
for him to make a change so it sounds


---------70:44----------
like he had you at the age of 51 yeah


---------70:47----------
so people tend that was the first time


---------70:49----------
he had a child yeah so like being a


---------70:53----------
parent is very very hard it's a very


---------70:57----------
steep learning curve and generally


---------70:59----------
speaking the older you are the more


---------71:01----------
difficult it gets so when you're really


---------71:04----------
young gets hard when you're really old


---------71:05----------
like just the way that your brain works


---------71:07----------
like it's hard to learn new things so we


---------71:09----------
tend to get set in our ways it's not


---------71:11----------
that you can't teach an old dog new


---------71:12----------
tricks


---------71:13----------
but that there's a very real


---------71:15----------
neuroplasticity issue involved with like


---------71:18----------
learning and changing behavior so you


---------71:20----------
can teach a two-year-old new languages


---------71:23----------
like that it gets harder when you're


---------71:25----------
fifteen gets even harder when you're


---------71:27----------
thirty


---------71:28----------
probably evens out around there but


---------71:30----------
there's some things about developing a


---------71:32----------
child where like your brain just changes


---------71:35----------
like it's [ __ ] weird I used to be


---------71:36----------
able to watch scary movies and like I


---------71:39----------
cried maybe once every five to ten years


---------71:42----------
and now I try like five times a week


---------71:45----------
it's just weird I started noticing


---------71:47----------
emotions that I didn't have and I think


---------71:49----------
it's literally because like you have to


---------71:51----------
like your brain changes when you have a


---------71:52----------
child that's so in your data and how old


---------71:56----------
was your mom when you were born or how


---------72:00----------
old is she now she's like six 60-ish now


---------72:05----------
okay forty yeah okay so I think that's


---------72:10----------
kind of tricky I think there are a lot


---------72:12----------
of other dynamics that could go on like


---------72:13----------
like or your how old are your siblings


---------72:17----------
they're all like 30 ish yeah so so


---------72:20----------
that's some of this stuff unfortunately


---------72:22----------
Miguel like you kind of got dealt a


---------72:25----------
little bit of a shorthand in life in


---------72:28----------
terms of like you know it's hard to be


---------72:30----------
so your sense of loneliness growing up


---------72:32----------
with siblings who are way older and also


---------72:34----------
parents who are farther in age can be


---------72:36----------
tricky yeah


---------72:38----------
I mean unlike the top of a long one s is


---------72:41----------
just like kind of got used to it I guess


---------72:43----------
I'm like really introverted but like I


---------72:45----------
can go out of it when I want to yeah so


---------72:49----------
listen man I I don't know exactly what


---------72:51----------
I'm trying to tell you but I think that


---------72:53----------
what I mean to say is that I I think


---------72:56----------
that there are reasons that have nothing


---------72:58----------
to do with who you are


---------73:00----------
about why it was difficult for you to


---------73:04----------
form a relationship with your dad now


---------73:06----------
some of those things I think are on him


---------73:09----------
but in the sense you guys have the deck


---------73:10----------
stacked against you because yeah you


---------73:12----------
know by the time you were 10 he was 60


---------73:14----------
yeah so like it's hard to like you know


---------73:20----------
a lot of the things that fathers and


---------73:21----------
sons do may have actually just been


---------73:23----------
physically hard for him at that point I


---------73:25----------
don't know what kind of shame is I'm


---------73:27----------
pretty bad actually know pretty good


---------73:30----------
physical everyday yeah so so I mean


---------73:32----------
that's good but like when I just think


---------73:33----------
about you know the kinds of things that


---------73:35----------
I do with my kids like I noticed a


---------73:37----------
difference between I had my first kid at


---------73:39----------
the age of 31 to 32 and I could just


---------73:42----------
manhandle her physically in a way that


---------73:45----------
even now at like 37 it's like harder for


---------73:48----------
me to do with my younger kid like I just


---------73:50----------
it's weird it's like kind of scary but


---------73:52----------
so so I I think um you know in your case


---------73:56----------
I think it's a little bit tricky because


---------73:57----------
you guys do have an age gap that's not


---------73:59----------
your fault that's not his fault


---------74:00----------
yeah and but I still think you know I I


---------74:04----------
don't think you can get around this man


---------74:05----------
I think we can talk as much as you want


---------74:07----------
to about waking up on time and setting


---------74:09----------
your alarm and meditating and setting


---------74:10----------
all these strategies and behaviors and


---------74:12----------
atomic habits and all this kind of crap


---------74:15----------
yeah I mean I think you've got to become


---------74:18----------
your best version of yourself and I


---------74:19----------
don't think you can do that as long as


---------74:21----------
this is hanging over your head


---------74:24----------
I guess yeah I'll take I'll take the


---------74:29----------
first step at least because I don't want


---------74:32----------
this over my head obviously yeah what


---------74:34----------
does that first step look like to you um


---------74:38----------
just like saying down and talking like


---------74:41----------
that like you said like how his


---------74:42----------
childhood was like maybe just like more


---------74:45----------
about him I don't know more much about


---------74:47----------
him general feels like yeah and


---------74:52----------
so there's this chance that could


---------74:54----------
backfire it backfires shoot me a DM


---------74:58----------
because I don't okay hang in okay and


---------75:01----------
you know you're welcome to come back on


---------75:03----------
stream you know a couple weeks down the


---------75:05----------
road or something like that or I mean it


---------75:07----------
really if the conversation ends up


---------75:08----------
screwing you over in some way and you


---------75:10----------
feel like you've you know started a


---------75:13----------
ticking time bomb please let me know and


---------75:15----------
I'd love to help you through that sounds


---------75:17----------
fantastic thank you so much dr. kay yeah


---------75:19----------
of course man any thoughts or questions


---------75:21----------
before we wrap up um no those want to


---------75:26----------
stake it out


---------75:27----------
we should meditate I've gotten about it


---------75:28----------
eh yeah okay what kind of meditation do


---------75:31----------
you do um I'm so kind of a bomb I just


---------75:34----------
like guided meditation on YouTube or


---------75:36----------
something like that I started reading a


---------75:38----------
little bit more but a little bit


---------75:39----------
judgmental there yeah you're all wrong


---------75:43----------
yeah right so that's okay so Miguel you


---------75:46----------
got it you got to start where you are


---------75:48----------
man you can't expect to be somewhere


---------75:50----------
somewhere else like you're you're you're


---------75:52----------
at school you're at home I mean I


---------75:54----------
learned to meditate I meditate the way


---------75:55----------
that I do because I learned at an ashram


---------75:57----------
like I got to stay in India for three


---------75:58----------
months and we usually didn't have that


---------76:00----------
opportunity so guided meditation on


---------76:02----------
YouTube I think is quite respectable let


---------76:07----------
me just think what are we gonna teach


---------76:08----------
you


---------76:12----------
let me think


---------76:26----------
have you done naughty should be before


---------76:28----------
the the alternate nostril breathing I


---------76:31----------
don't think so okay so let's teach you


---------76:34----------
that let's start there um so I want you


---------76:37----------
to sit up straight okay okay you have


---------76:41----------
allergies or a deviated septum or


---------76:43----------
anything any of that stuff going on okay


---------76:44----------
now what part of the world are you in by


---------76:46----------
the way uh Midwest okay oh yes okay does


---------76:52----------
your dad still work


---------76:53----------
no he's retired okay we just think about


---------76:57----------
this so I'm gonna teach you something


---------76:58----------
called alternate nostril breathing so


---------77:00----------
can you do this what is that


---------77:02----------
yeah ah yep


---------77:05----------
so index finger down wait index finger


---------77:10----------
down okay yep very good excellent good


---------77:13----------
job and take care so what we're gonna do


---------77:16----------
is we're gonna use our thumb to block


---------77:17----------
this nostril and we're gonna breathe in


---------77:19----------
through that one then we're gonna use


---------77:21----------
these two fingers to block the other and


---------77:23----------
we're gonna breathe okay so what I'm


---------77:25----------
gonna do it's a little bit weird this or


---------77:27----------
block your right nostril


---------77:28----------
breathe in switch and breathe out


---------77:39----------
breathe in again through the same


---------77:41----------
nostril switch out


---------77:57----------
switch now


---------78:04----------
in


---------78:09----------
switch out


---------78:17----------
in


---------78:22----------
switch out


---------78:29----------
in


---------78:34----------
switch out now close your eyes raise up


---------78:41----------
your head a little bit sit up nice and


---------78:43----------
straight good and now continue at your


---------78:46----------
own pace remember that you breathe out


---------78:53----------
and then breathe in through the same


---------78:55----------
nostril before switching that you should


---------78:59----------
switch with a full breath


---------81:28----------
go ahead and finish the round that


---------81:30----------
you're on let your eyes remain closed


---------81:47----------
and sit in the stores


---------82:08----------
and now from this place Miguel start to


---------82:14----------
think through some of the things that


---------82:16----------
we've talked about today notice within


---------82:21----------
yourself your fear notice within


---------82:26----------
yourself the fear of being unwanted the


---------82:29----------
fear of being unloved and also notice


---------82:35----------
within yourself the instinctual


---------82:38----------
knowledge that you are loved that


---------82:43----------
sometimes these things conflict so be it


---------82:55----------
notice the burden you've been carrying


---------83:00----------
sometimes it manifests as a heaviness or


---------83:03----------
tightness in your chest


---------83:10----------
and notice that you can to certain agree


---------83:13----------
free yourself of that burden in moments


---------83:15----------
like this that there is a real Miguel a


---------83:23----------
true Miguel a pure version of you who's


---------83:28----------
a little bit distant from and separate


---------83:33----------
from all of your fears and worries and


---------83:37----------
also your joys and ambitions


---------83:51----------
and if you need to in the days ahead as


---------83:55----------
you struggle with motivation or


---------83:58----------
scheduling or things like that try to


---------84:00----------
come back to this place because from


---------84:03----------
this place things can get a little bit


---------84:05----------
easier you can see them a little bit


---------84:08----------
clearer and you can understand them a


---------84:13----------
little bit better and it's easier to act


---------84:17----------
from here


---------84:21----------
give yourself the opportunity to come


---------84:24----------
back here from time to time and now come


---------84:31----------
back to Miguel you're in the Midwest


---------84:35----------
your eyes are open can I share one last


---------84:42----------
thought with you Miguel


---------84:43----------
I don't think you can actually wait to


---------84:46----------
have this conversation now you were


---------84:51----------
saying earlier that you have lots of


---------84:52----------
time and you can deal with it later I


---------84:55----------
don't think so


---------84:57----------
you may not have as much time as you


---------84:59----------
think


---------85:03----------
and also you should not having as much


---------85:07----------
time as you think I want you to think


---------85:09----------
about this you know that you should also


---------85:12----------
give yourself the time to live and exist


---------85:17----------
within the relationship with your dad


---------85:20----------
that you want it's not about fixing


---------85:23----------
things up and then checking off a box


---------85:25----------
it's about checking off that box and


---------85:28----------
then having time to live in that space


---------85:31----------
whether it be days weeks months years or


---------85:35----------
even decades


---------85:38----------
okay yeah yeah of course man


---------85:43----------
what we're rooting for all righty


---------86:04----------
no no man


---------86:08----------
we love to complicate our lives don't we


---------86:11----------
we love to think about habits and


---------86:14----------
motivation and willpower and discipline


---------86:18----------
and all this all this stuff


---------86:32----------
sometimes I think unfortunately the


---------86:34----------
things that hold us back are simple and


---------86:36----------
difficult it's not really complicated so


---------86:39----------
I want you guys to understand this the


---------86:41----------
mind thrives in complicated things the


---------86:43----------
mind loves complicated equations right


---------86:47----------
because and the more you complicate the


---------86:48----------
equation the easier it is for the mind


---------86:51----------
to avoid that which it wants to avoid if


---------86:55----------
you think about this for a second if a


---------86:56----------
group project goes wrong whose fault is


---------86:59----------
it even if it's your fault


---------87:01----------
it's very easy to assign blame to others


---------87:04----------
it's way harder to avoid blame yourself


---------87:07----------
if it's a solo project and so different


---------87:10----------
variables of the mind are opportunities


---------87:13----------
for the mind to avoid looking at the


---------87:15----------
things that doesn't want to look at and


---------87:19----------
so be careful because the more you


---------87:22----------
complicate the things in your life the


---------87:24----------
less likely you are to actually move


---------87:28----------
forward I mean that's sort of a false


---------87:31----------
statement because I think a lot of you


---------87:33----------
know a lot of progress in life can be


---------87:35----------
made by optimizing different variables


---------87:37----------
but generally speaking I see a lot of


---------87:39----------
avoidance carried out through the


---------87:41----------
complexities of the mind yeah so just


---------87:50----------
think about that so think about you know


---------87:52----------
when you're struggling in life how many


---------87:53----------
answers do you come up with oh why


---------87:56----------
didn't you finish the project on time oh


---------87:57----------
I was late and there was traffic and and


---------88:00----------
I had to call the doctor and my dog


---------88:03----------
needed this all excuses right the more


---------88:05----------
excuses that you give the more likely


---------88:08----------
they are to bbs so the more variables


---------88:12----------
just think about this when someone when


---------88:14----------
you ask someone when someone doesn't do


---------88:15----------
a good job what makes you what sets off


---------88:19----------
your BS meter when they say they didn't


---------88:21----------
do a good job for one reason or when


---------88:22----------
they did they said they didn't do a good


---------88:24----------
job for five reasons oh it was this


---------88:27----------
confluence of events the microwave


---------88:30----------
wasn't working and then I hit traffic


---------88:32----------
and then this happened and this happened


---------88:33----------
in this habit that's why I'm late I'm so


---------88:35----------
sorry right so that's what your mind


---------88:39----------
does it gives you lots and lots of


---------88:40----------
reasons oh the reason you aren't


---------88:42----------
successful is because of this and this


---------88:43----------
and this


---------88:44----------
and this and this and this or what it


---------88:46----------
does is it oversimplifies things because


---------88:48----------
then it doesn't have to examine the


---------88:50----------
opposite is true if someone comes in and


---------88:54----------
they say like oh why were you late and


---------88:55----------
they're like ah I don't know


---------88:57----------
zero reasons or five reasons same thing


---------89:00----------
all bs why aren't you successful oh I'm


---------89:02----------
lazy yeah


---------89:03----------
bs not satisfactory right so don't let


---------89:11----------
your mind get away with zero reasons and


---------89:13----------
don't let it get away with five reasons


---------89:16----------
try to find V thing and understand that


---------89:19----------
your compass for finding what's holding


---------89:21----------
you back


---------89:21----------
is that the real compass is that it's in


---------89:26----------
the opposite direction of where your


---------89:27----------
compass points so if your point if


---------89:30----------
you're if your mind goes one way what


---------89:31----------
you need to do is look in the opposite


---------89:33----------
way you need to head south whether your


---------89:35----------
compass is pointing north that's where


---------89:37----------
you'll find the answers mm-hmm I'm


---------89:42----------
watching this instead of doing my


---------89:44----------
homework okay so now do your homework


---------89:45----------
because we're done for the day right


---------89:57----------
let's think about anybody have a


---------89:59----------
suggestion for who we should raid
