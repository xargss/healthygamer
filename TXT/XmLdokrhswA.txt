---------00:00----------
so i really liked today's interview


---------00:01----------
because like so tyler's fantastic um i


---------00:04----------
think he did a really good job of like


---------00:06----------
setting some really like healthy


---------00:07----------
boundaries


---------00:08----------
and you know not everyone is ready for


---------00:11----------
emotions right at the beginning


---------00:13----------
and the second thing to remember is that


---------00:15----------
if you're struggling to do something


---------00:17----------
remember that like emotions are just one


---------00:19----------
part of it so like why do we try to


---------00:21----------
teach people about emotions and explore


---------00:23----------
emotions it's because of the way that


---------00:25----------
emotions interact our like thought


---------00:27----------
process our motivation our ability to do


---------00:31----------
things so like digging into emotions for


---------00:33----------
entertainment value or


---------00:34----------
self-understanding or like things like


---------00:36----------
that like all that stuff is like fine


---------00:37----------
and all but what i've really found is


---------00:39----------
that emotions are just one part of us


---------00:41----------
right and as we begin to understand like


---------00:44----------
if i want to do a particular task and i


---------00:46----------
set out to do that task and i judge


---------00:47----------
myself if i feel incompetent if i'm


---------00:50----------
perfectionistic if i'm avoiding


---------00:52----------
particular things related to that task


---------00:53----------
that's why you need to understand


---------00:55----------
emotions because as you understand those


---------00:57----------
kinds of things it actually helps you do


---------00:59----------
the things that you want to do


---------01:03----------
hey man


---------01:05----------
hello


---------01:06----------
can you hear me okay


---------01:08----------
uh i can hear you just fine awesome man


---------01:10----------
i can hear you just fine too thank you


---------01:12----------
so much for coming on today hey thanks


---------01:14----------
for having me yeah um so can you uh what


---------01:17----------
do you go by how would you like


---------01:20----------
tyler or wildcat tyler's mine okay


---------01:23----------
um


---------01:24----------
so thank you very much for coming on


---------01:25----------
today tyler uh you know any anything in


---------01:28----------
particular that you wanted to kind of


---------01:30----------
talk about today or


---------01:31----------
um um anything you've got questions


---------01:34----------
about anything you want to share


---------01:36----------
i mean nothing real specific i guess but


---------01:38----------
um you know i


---------01:40----------
struggled a little bit with like anxiety


---------01:42----------
uh and i i had tweeted out that like one


---------01:44----------
of my biggest weaknesses is like how i


---------01:46----------
handle stress and like being overwhelmed


---------01:48----------
and that's when uh you guys reached out


---------01:50----------
and was like hey would you be interested


---------01:51----------
in talking and you actually reached out


---------01:54----------
like a year ago


---------01:55----------
and at the time i was like nah i just


---------01:57----------
didn't feel like i was


---------01:58----------
i don't know ready to do that i guess


---------01:59----------
like sure on on on stream and everything


---------02:02----------
um but now i'm a little i'm more open to


---------02:04----------
it


---------02:04----------
okay sure um


---------02:06----------
yeah so you know a couple of just ground


---------02:09----------
rules since it seems like in the past


---------02:11----------
maybe you were a little bit reluctant um


---------02:13----------
you know you don't have to talk about


---------02:15----------
anything that you don't feel comfortable


---------02:16----------
talking about


---------02:17----------
um you know if i sense that we're going


---------02:20----------
into territory that may feel


---------02:22----------
a little bit hesitant i may actually


---------02:24----------
point that out to you like hey i'm


---------02:26----------
noticing that maybe this is making you


---------02:27----------
feel uncomfortable


---------02:29----------
and you're welcome to just kind of step


---------02:31----------
away from those topics


---------02:32----------
uh so we'll try to keep things kind of


---------02:34----------
safe and and you know in territories


---------02:36----------
that


---------02:38----------
um


---------02:39----------
you know you're comfortable talking


---------02:40----------
about


---------02:41----------
and the last thing that i want to say is


---------02:42----------
i really appreciate you coming on


---------02:44----------
because i think how to handle stress is


---------02:46----------
something that a lot of people really


---------02:48----------
struggle with


---------02:49----------
i think it's like


---------02:51----------
um you know we use the word stress like


---------02:53----------
a catch-all but like what does that mean


---------02:55----------
and as we get into the different


---------02:57----------
components of stress we can start to


---------02:58----------
figure out almost like targeted ways to


---------03:01----------
think about our stress level and like


---------03:03----------
potentially like


---------03:04----------
mechanisms that we can use to sort of


---------03:06----------
manage it um so i think it's a really


---------03:08----------
important topic


---------03:09----------
and if you're willing to you know talk


---------03:11----------
about that today i think a lot of people


---------03:12----------
could benefit from it


---------03:14----------
yeah


---------03:15----------
hopefully okay


---------03:17----------
okay so so when you say you have trouble


---------03:20----------
handling stress help me understand what


---------03:22----------
that means


---------03:23----------
uh yeah i not necessarily that i have


---------03:26----------
like trouble handling i just think i


---------03:27----------
handle it poorly in terms of like


---------03:29----------
i don't


---------03:31----------
i feel like when i feel overwhelmed what


---------03:33----------
i should be doing is you know getting


---------03:35----------
motivated to take things out one by one


---------03:37----------
and just getting getting everything done


---------03:38----------
but instead what i do is i generally


---------03:40----------
just block out the things that are


---------03:41----------
either least interesting


---------03:43----------
or not as important or whatever and i


---------03:45----------
and i i put my focus on other things uh


---------03:47----------
especially when it comes to like doing


---------03:49----------
youtube


---------03:50----------
like i feel like i make an excuse for


---------03:52----------
myself where


---------03:53----------
you know whatever it may be like i


---------03:56----------
recently moved and so like moving was


---------03:58----------
like a big ordeal i was like oh it's so


---------03:59----------
overwhelming there's all these things i


---------04:00----------
have to do and i was like i'll just


---------04:02----------
focus on my youtube channel just make


---------04:03----------
some videos or whatever because i have


---------04:04----------
to do that anyway you know like i would


---------04:05----------
just kind of make that excuse for myself


---------04:07----------
yeah um


---------04:09----------
yeah


---------04:10----------
so i'm noticing that your mind sort of


---------04:12----------
retreats from things that feel important


---------04:14----------
to you


---------04:16----------
yeah


---------04:18----------
yeah in a way yeah and it sort of picks


---------04:20----------
other important things to focus on yeah


---------04:23----------
i guess i kind of like i set like a


---------04:24----------
priority list in my own head and like


---------04:27----------
instead of taking things out one by one


---------04:30----------
i just focus on like the top two or


---------04:31----------
whatever like the most you know a couple


---------04:33----------
important things that are


---------04:35----------
you know both important but also like


---------04:36----------
easier you know


---------04:38----------
okay


---------04:39----------
so it looks like sometimes your mind


---------04:42----------
chooses to tackle chooses to tackle


---------04:44----------
easier problems rather than hard ones


---------04:46----------
yeah just the things that come natural


---------04:48----------
to me um


---------04:50----------
sure


---------04:51----------
so tyler i'm gonna ask you kind of weird


---------04:52----------
question


---------04:54----------
what's wrong with that


---------04:56----------
um


---------04:57----------
i just think it's like a little lazy and


---------05:00----------
a little like unproductive


---------05:02----------
um


---------05:03----------
you know i feel like everybody has


---------05:04----------
things that they don't want to do that


---------05:06----------
they need to do and it's just it's


---------05:08----------
easier to just do them but for whatever


---------05:10----------
reason sometimes i just can't especially


---------05:11----------
when it's like a lot of stuff and i feel


---------05:13----------
overwhelmed and i i don't know how to


---------05:15----------
like


---------05:15----------
even break it down of like a list of


---------05:17----------
things to do and where to start


---------05:19----------
i guess that's really where it is when


---------05:20----------
i'm so overwhelmed i don't even know


---------05:21----------
where to start that's when it's really


---------05:23----------
hard


---------05:24----------
okay


---------05:25----------
what's lazy or unproductive about that


---------05:30----------
uh i'm just putting things off i don't


---------05:32----------
know just not getting not getting things


---------05:34----------
done i guess


---------05:35----------
well so i'm gonna play devil's advocate


---------05:37----------
by the way your camera seems to be like


---------05:39----------
zooming in or out i'm not sure if that's


---------05:40----------
lag on my end or it just blurs and then


---------05:43----------
refocuses yeah i think it's trying to


---------05:44----------
auto focus i could change it over to


---------05:46----------
manual but


---------05:47----------
um


---------05:49----------
so i'm gonna just play devil's advocate


---------05:51----------
and push back for a second okay which is


---------05:53----------
okay you know totally fine because i


---------05:54----------
think it'll we'll learn as as we kind of


---------05:56----------
so here you you make a priority list and


---------05:58----------
you say okay there's there are 10 things


---------06:00----------
to do


---------06:01----------
and you kind of rank them in terms of


---------06:03----------
priority and what i'm hearing you say is


---------06:05----------
that like you pick number one and number


---------06:06----------
two on the list and you just focus on


---------06:08----------
those and kind of forget about


---------06:09----------
everything else that seems to be like a


---------06:11----------
pretty good


---------06:12----------
you know strategy right like if you've


---------06:14----------
got a ton of stuff to do and you can't


---------06:15----------
do it all


---------06:17----------
you know making a priority list and then


---------06:18----------
focusing on the most important seems


---------06:20----------
like actually kind of a winning strategy


---------06:23----------
uh


---------06:24----------
kind of


---------06:25----------
except when one and two are like things


---------06:27----------
i can do infinitely you know when it


---------06:29----------
comes to like making videos or content


---------06:30----------
like i can i can literally do it all day


---------06:32----------
and call myself being productive but at


---------06:34----------
the end of the day i'm still putting off


---------06:36----------
other things i need to do


---------06:37----------
and the more i put off those little


---------06:39----------
things you know every day another little


---------06:41----------
thing gets added and it just adds up and


---------06:42----------
piles up then it gets overwhelming


---------06:45----------
yeah


---------06:46----------
so that's kind of interesting so what


---------06:47----------
i'm using or what i'm hearing this is


---------06:49----------
going to sound kind of weird


---------06:50----------
is that you use being productive as an


---------06:52----------
avoidance strategy


---------06:55----------
yeah


---------06:56----------
yeah


---------06:57----------
but it's like almost overproductive it's


---------06:59----------
like being productive in something that


---------07:00----------
i don't need to be productive in anymore


---------07:02----------
because there's other things i should do


---------07:03----------
but oh absolutely right so when we think


---------07:05----------
about avoidance strategies


---------07:07----------
the purpose of being productive is to


---------07:10----------
avoid doing this other stuff so you will


---------07:12----------
be


---------07:14----------
like productive until the end of time i


---------07:15----------
think you brought up a really good point


---------07:17----------
that the things at number one and number


---------07:19----------
two you never check like you never check


---------07:21----------
the box you're complete you're now time


---------07:23----------
to move on to number three


---------07:24----------
so it's really interesting that like


---------07:26----------
i've you know i i've actually heard this


---------07:29----------
every now and then that some people will


---------07:30----------
use productivity as a method of


---------07:32----------
avoidance


---------07:33----------
yeah


---------07:34----------
um and so let's try to understand what


---------07:36----------
do you think it is that you're avoiding


---------07:38----------
by


---------07:39----------
you know focusing on youtube


---------07:42----------
um


---------07:44----------
i don't i don't know if it's necessarily


---------07:45----------
i'm i guess it's just like it's just


---------07:47----------
mundane boring stuff i guess you know


---------07:49----------
just because youtube has always like


---------07:51----------
been so compelling and interesting and


---------07:53----------
it's always exciting and fun


---------07:56----------
um i also value like maintaining


---------07:59----------
relationships and so that's like another


---------08:00----------
thing that i think is high on the


---------08:01----------
priority list where it's like not


---------08:03----------
necessarily being productive you know


---------08:04----------
maybe it's like going out to eat with


---------08:05----------
friends or something but it's


---------08:06----------
maintaining relationships that i do feel


---------08:09----------
is important whether it's just


---------08:10----------
friendship family or you know business


---------08:12----------
whatever


---------08:13----------
um


---------08:14----------
like that's another thing where it's not


---------08:15----------
really being productive but it is


---------08:17----------
important


---------08:18----------
sure


---------08:19----------
so i'm hearing that relationships is


---------08:20----------
important like youtube is important


---------08:23----------
um


---------08:25----------
and so what kind of stuff do you tend to


---------08:27----------
avoid you mentioned like mundane like


---------08:29----------
what what's something that you wish you


---------08:31----------
could do more easily


---------08:34----------
um


---------08:35----------
i don't know i guess one example was


---------08:37----------
just like i moved recently and it was


---------08:39----------
like that was just such an overwhelming


---------08:41----------
like


---------08:42----------
task to me it was like to move


---------08:44----------
everything out of one house into a new


---------08:46----------
house and i still am not fully done like


---------08:47----------
all my boxes are in this new house but i


---------08:50----------
haven't gone through all my boxes and


---------08:51----------
organized everything and done all that


---------08:53----------
and it's like ah they're fine


---------08:54----------
sitting in the box in my garage or


---------08:56----------
whatever like technically this stuff is


---------08:58----------
here it's fine but it's like something i


---------09:00----------
need to do but it's something i can


---------09:02----------
easily excuse and be like i'll just go


---------09:04----------
like stream or make a video or something


---------09:05----------
or do something like that instead


---------09:07----------
um i guess that would be an example


---------09:10----------
and what do you so


---------09:12----------
you mentioned earlier that like you


---------09:13----------
don't handle stress well is there


---------09:16----------
something stressful about this


---------09:18----------
situation that we're describing


---------09:20----------
uh yeah it just gives me like a lot of


---------09:23----------
anxiety i guess to like


---------09:24----------
think about


---------09:26----------
trying to do it i guess


---------09:28----------
so when it comes like the moving it's


---------09:29----------
just like it's so overwhelming there's


---------09:31----------
so much stuff to go through and organize


---------09:32----------
it's gonna take so much time


---------09:34----------
and at the end of the day it's like it's


---------09:36----------
just fine sitting there in the box or


---------09:37----------
whatever you know like that's how my


---------09:38----------
head works


---------09:39----------
okay


---------09:40----------
so can you help me understand what you


---------09:42----------
mean by anxiety


---------09:46----------
um


---------09:48----------
i don't know i i mean just like an


---------09:50----------
anxious feeling just you know my heart


---------09:51----------
gets racing or whatever and my brain


---------09:53----------
just like tries to figure out and just


---------09:55----------
can't and she's like it's just so much


---------09:56----------
easier to just go focus on something


---------09:57----------
else you know


---------09:58----------
what what is it that your brain can't do


---------10:02----------
um


---------10:03----------
break down like


---------10:05----------
where to start doing something like that


---------10:07----------
okay um


---------10:10----------
you know it's like like i get it yeah


---------10:11----------
sure just go open the first box and like


---------10:13----------
see what's in it and start organizing it


---------10:14----------
but like that sounds easy but to me for


---------10:17----------
whatever reason my brain is just like oh


---------10:18----------
that's


---------10:19----------
that's not the best way to do it you


---------10:20----------
should do it this way or like you know i


---------10:22----------
don't know


---------10:25----------
okay


---------10:26----------
how are you feeling right now tyler


---------10:28----------
talking about this


---------10:30----------
uh i feel fine i just want to make sure


---------10:32----------
i convey


---------10:34----------
how i feel appropriately you know


---------10:37----------
do you feel like you're doing a good job


---------10:39----------
of conveying how you feel or you think


---------10:40----------
we're like missing pieces of it


---------10:43----------
no


---------10:44----------
no i think i just is i don't know i


---------10:46----------
think i'm doing okay okay


---------10:48----------
um i think you're doing great man


---------10:51----------
can i think for a second and just try to


---------10:53----------
put some stuff together


---------10:55----------
yeah um


---------10:56----------
oh we may go into teaching mode today


---------10:58----------
are you hoping to like have some kind of


---------11:00----------
emotional catharsis on stream today and


---------11:03----------
cry and


---------11:05----------
learn something no


---------11:07----------
no but i mean we can't i don't


---------11:09----------
if there's positive to come out the


---------11:11----------
other end yeah so i mean sometimes


---------11:13----------
people are sort of like


---------11:15----------
yeah i guess the only reason i'm anxious


---------11:16----------
about that is just because like


---------11:18----------
like we're on twitch right and twitch is


---------11:20----------
a bit of a bubble in terms of like


---------11:22----------
uh you know like a lot of people on


---------11:24----------
twitch probably haven't heard of me


---------11:25----------
because i don't really stream on twitch


---------11:26----------
um so it's like i don't know i feel like


---------11:28----------
i'm opening up to like a lot of


---------11:29----------
strangers right now you know


---------11:30----------
yeah so i


---------11:32----------
you know what we try to do tyler so look


---------11:34----------
let me just kind of take a step back and


---------11:35----------
explain so i you know i have a lot of


---------11:37----------
different experience so i studied for


---------11:39----------
about seven years to become a monk and


---------11:41----------
then i did neuroscience research and


---------11:42----------
went to medical school and became a


---------11:44----------
psychiatrist so through all of that you


---------11:46----------
know i've gained a lot of interesting


---------11:48----------
perspectives


---------11:49----------
and sometimes um when we try to like


---------11:52----------
teach people about themselves it


---------11:54----------
involves like digging into their


---------11:55----------
emotions and stuff we'll get there i


---------11:56----------
think there's a piece of that here


---------11:58----------
but basically what i


---------12:00----------
you know what we can try to do is try to


---------12:02----------
like help you understand like the


---------12:03----------
mechanism of your mind like what are the


---------12:05----------
rules because there's definitely like


---------12:07----------
all kinds of consistent programming in


---------12:10----------
your mind that something feels


---------12:12----------
overwhelming you don't know how to


---------12:14----------
start it's not the best way to do it


---------12:16----------
like all of those thoughts


---------12:18----------
i think are really important because i


---------12:20----------
think they make it hard for you to


---------12:21----------
actually engage in the action


---------12:24----------
and then what happens is you've got


---------12:25----------
something that your mind can justify


---------12:28----------
as a good use of your time and so here


---------12:30----------
you you've got thing number one that


---------12:32----------
like you kind of don't want to do you


---------12:34----------
don't really know how to do and even if


---------12:36----------
you just open the first box you would


---------12:37----------
sort of be doing it inefficiently like


---------12:39----------
does that make sense


---------12:41----------
yeah


---------12:42----------
and then on the other side you've got


---------12:44----------
things that are like clearly important


---------12:45----------
like how can you argue against like hey


---------12:47----------
my you know i'm like i'm a youtuber so


---------12:49----------
making like youtube content is like part


---------12:52----------
of my job like relationships are


---------12:54----------
important to me as a human being and so


---------12:56----------
anytime there's that conflict in your


---------12:57----------
mind like youtube and relationships like


---------12:59----------
always win out because it's like you


---------13:01----------
know compared to doing a crappy job of


---------13:03----------
opening boxes like come on man like


---------13:06----------
yeah why you know so i i think that that


---------13:09----------
what we can try to do is sort of


---------13:11----------
understand a little bit about how your


---------13:12----------
mind like looks at those problems and


---------13:14----------
hopefully help you


---------13:16----------
make it easier for you to sort of


---------13:19----------
open up boxes


---------13:21----------
by helping you understand like what the


---------13:23----------
resistance in your mind is


---------13:25----------
do you think that's a good use of our


---------13:27----------
time today


---------13:28----------
yeah okay yeah


---------13:31----------
um so


---------13:32----------
can i just ask you a couple of like uh


---------13:35----------
you know background questions a little


---------13:36----------
bit about how you got to where you are


---------13:38----------
and yeah so can you tell me a little bit


---------13:39----------
about where you grew up and and how you


---------13:41----------
what growing up was like for you


---------13:43----------
uh yeah i guess first of all i'll just


---------13:45----------
fully introduce myself my name is tyler


---------13:47----------
a wildcat um i have a youtube channel uh


---------13:50----------
i have almost 8 million subscribers i've


---------13:52----------
been doing it for damn son almost a


---------13:54----------
decade


---------13:55----------
uh my channel will turn 10 years old in


---------13:57----------
a month


---------13:58----------
um i'm 28 years old i've already said


---------14:01----------
that uh but i grew up in northeast


---------14:03----------
indiana pretty much the middle of


---------14:04----------
nowhere small town


---------14:06----------
um


---------14:08----------
and recently moved six years ago to


---------14:10----------
nashville tennessee area


---------14:12----------
i've been living here since


---------14:15----------
and yeah so yeah i started my channel


---------14:16----------
like 10 years ago and i've been doing it


---------14:18----------
full-time for like seven almost


---------14:20----------
um and doing it as a job for like eight


---------14:23----------
okay um yeah


---------14:25----------
can you tell me what growing up in


---------14:26----------
indiana was like


---------14:28----------
um


---------14:31----------
it was interesting i guess uh when i was


---------14:34----------
first growing up like up until i was


---------14:36----------
like eight or ten somewhere in there i


---------14:37----------
don't remember like third grade or


---------14:38----------
fourth grade uh my family lived in like


---------14:41----------
a little subdivision there was a bunch


---------14:42----------
of other kids i was playing with kids


---------14:43----------
all the time


---------14:44----------
um


---------14:45----------
you know going to elementary school and


---------14:46----------
then my parents moved out to like the


---------14:48----------
country and that was like a little


---------14:49----------
isolating because at the time i was an


---------14:50----------
only child used to just be able to walk


---------14:53----------
outside and go play with a bunch of


---------14:54----------
friends do whatever


---------14:55----------
now you know it was like


---------14:57----------
there was one neighbor over


---------14:59----------
that


---------15:00----------
uh they had kids but i didn't really


---------15:01----------
know them very well and they were like


---------15:02----------
homeschooled which at the time i was


---------15:03----------
like these are weird or whatever i think


---------15:05----------
that was just how my 10 year old brain


---------15:06----------
worked um


---------15:09----------
and then


---------15:10----------
high school was fun you know once i got


---------15:12----------
the ability to drive or like friends


---------15:14----------
started to get the ability to drive was


---------15:15----------
like okay now i don't feel so isolated


---------15:16----------
me and my friends can go drive somewhere


---------15:18----------
go do stuff um you know there's a lot of


---------15:21----------
country redneck activities i guess like


---------15:23----------
bonfires and going four-wheeling and all


---------15:25----------
that kind of stuff so


---------15:26----------
yeah


---------15:27----------
yeah sounds good man so it sounds like


---------15:30----------
you were were you pretty happy growing


---------15:32----------
up


---------15:33----------
uh yeah yeah


---------15:35----------
yeah there were there were definitely


---------15:36----------
times where like i felt you know like


---------15:38----------
lonely or whatever like i said like when


---------15:39----------
we first moved here a new area didn't


---------15:41----------
have any friends lived at home you know


---------15:44----------
away from a bunch of you know i couldn't


---------15:45----------
go outside and play with friends anymore


---------15:47----------
and i was an only child but


---------15:49----------
yeah oh you said you were an only child


---------15:52----------
are you still an only child or not


---------15:53----------
anymore no not anymore um my parents had


---------15:56----------
my sister when i was 12.


---------16:00----------
so yeah


---------16:01----------
what's it like


---------16:03----------
what's it like having a younger sister


---------16:06----------
uh it's cool it's cool it's very it's


---------16:08----------
funny because like she's getting into


---------16:10----------
high school now and so


---------16:12----------
uh like she's like a little zoomer


---------16:14----------
and so like we're like


---------16:16----------
we're both on the internet but like at


---------16:18----------
two spectrums almost


---------16:20----------
so it's like it's pretty fun uh like we


---------16:22----------
know of all the same stuff but we're at


---------16:23----------
two different ends of everything so


---------16:26----------
what's it like for her having a brother


---------16:28----------
who's youtube famous


---------16:30----------
uh i don't know i've talked about it


---------16:32----------
sometimes uh i feel like she tries to


---------16:34----------
like kind of hide from it a little bit


---------16:36----------
but like kids at her school know um i


---------16:39----------
feel like she tries not to make a big


---------16:40----------
deal about it but yeah


---------16:42----------
and and how did you


---------16:43----------
um sounds like it's fun to have a


---------16:45----------
younger sister


---------16:46----------
yeah yeah


---------16:48----------
and how did you start how did you get


---------16:49----------
the idea to start making stuff on


---------16:51----------
youtube


---------16:53----------
um


---------16:55----------
when i went when i was in high school i


---------16:58----------
was in like a mass media class where we


---------16:59----------
like me and my friends like would put on


---------17:01----------
the school news which was like the


---------17:02----------
announcements in the morning but it was


---------17:04----------
like in a video news broadcast format we


---------17:06----------
had a ton of fun with that


---------17:08----------
uh and then we would make like videos to


---------17:10----------
promote like upcoming events like prom


---------17:11----------
we would make some goofy advertisement


---------17:13----------
to advertise prom or whatever and that


---------17:15----------
was like one of my favorite like


---------17:16----------
creative processes was like making goofy


---------17:18----------
skits and like putting on the news and


---------17:20----------
that kind of stuff and then when i


---------17:21----------
started to go to college


---------17:23----------
um


---------17:24----------
i was originally gonna go for


---------17:25----------
communications but i realized i was like


---------17:26----------
where am i gonna get a job like in film


---------17:28----------
production or video production in


---------17:30----------
northeast indiana so i quickly changed


---------17:33----------
to just what i was good at which was


---------17:34----------
math i was like all right i'll do


---------17:35----------
electrical engineering or whatever but i


---------17:36----------
still had that itch to like be creative


---------17:38----------
video wise and i've always been into


---------17:40----------
video games and so right around that


---------17:42----------
time is when i discovered youtube and


---------17:44----------
other people uploading like video game


---------17:45----------
stuff so i was like oh i can do this


---------17:47----------
i just looked into what to get and just


---------17:49----------
started


---------17:50----------
it was terrible at first


---------17:52----------
uh and then on my first ever video i


---------17:53----------
uploaded a guy named vanossgaming


---------17:56----------
messaged me on my first video he had


---------17:58----------
just started as well and he was like hey


---------18:00----------
i'm looking for other people that are


---------18:01----------
just starting out uh i liked your first


---------18:03----------
video he's like you want to play some


---------18:04----------
time we can play and that guy now has 25


---------18:07----------
million subscribers so


---------18:09----------
that was pretty crazy that literally my


---------18:10----------
first video i met one of the most


---------18:12----------
important people in terms of like my


---------18:13----------
youtube career and friends


---------18:15----------
um


---------18:16----------
how do you how do you understand that


---------18:19----------
what do you mean


---------18:20----------
like


---------18:21----------
what do you think about just you know in


---------18:22----------
your first video meeting one of the most


---------18:24----------
important and influential people


---------18:27----------
uh i don't know it's just crazy i mean i


---------18:29----------
feel very lucky um but also it was like


---------18:32----------
you know


---------18:33----------
he just all he did was message and then


---------18:35----------
just from there it was just like it was


---------18:36----------
a natural fit we got along together and


---------18:40----------
we made a lot of funny videos together


---------18:41----------
and stuff so complimented each other


---------18:42----------
well


---------18:43----------
do you remember what your first video


---------18:45----------
was about


---------18:46----------
like what were you playing yeah it was


---------18:47----------
it was a call of duty commentary like


---------18:50----------
everybody back in 2010 2011 it was


---------18:53----------
terrible it was filmed on like uh what


---------18:56----------
was it roxio game capture or whatever


---------18:58----------
which was like 480p but it was like kind


---------19:00----------
of upscale it looked terrible i sounded


---------19:02----------
terrible i had no idea what i was


---------19:04----------
talking about i was like saying that


---------19:05----------
like i wanted to like create a channel


---------19:07----------
to like help people get better but i was


---------19:08----------
like not even good


---------19:11----------
i had no idea what i was doing and then


---------19:13----------
over the course of the next like year


---------19:14----------
and a half everything kind of evolved


---------19:16----------
and i actually found out like what type


---------19:18----------
of videos i was good at making hey what


---------19:20----------
kind of videos are you good at making


---------19:22----------
uh just like comedy videos just like


---------19:24----------
goofy stuff with friends so like me and


---------19:25----------
my friends will play whatever game we're


---------19:26----------
playing for a couple hours and turn that


---------19:29----------
two hours into the funniest edited 10 15


---------19:31----------
minutes that we can


---------19:33----------
um you know it's a lot of just like


---------19:34----------
goofy improv stuff a lot of like role


---------19:36----------
playing stuff


---------19:39----------
sounds awesome man sounds like a lot of


---------19:40----------
fun


---------19:41----------
yeah


---------19:42----------
i'm not surprised that you would rather


---------19:44----------
do that


---------19:45----------
than open up boxes oh yeah it's yeah


---------19:48----------
yeah


---------19:50----------
absolutely


---------19:51----------
that's how i justified it it makes sense


---------19:52----------
to me but yeah man


---------19:54----------
i mean you make a strong case for it bro


---------19:56----------
yeah


---------19:57----------
it's like let me open up this box


---------20:00----------
or


---------20:01----------
you know i can get on with friends and


---------20:03----------
and make a fun like play games for a


---------20:05----------
while and yeah and have some fun and


---------20:07----------
then oh by the way this also happens to


---------20:09----------
be my work


---------20:10----------
yeah and and so i can pay my bills doing


---------20:13----------
this it sounds like it's a strong


---------20:14----------
argument against you know


---------20:16----------
opening up boxes


---------20:18----------
um


---------20:20----------
and so it sounds like it took you about


---------20:21----------
a year and a half and i'm curious like


---------20:23----------
when you said that you know you kind of


---------20:25----------
started out out terrible and it took you


---------20:27----------
a while to kind of find your niche or


---------20:29----------
kind of discover what you were good at


---------20:31----------
what was the process like of being


---------20:33----------
terrible


---------20:34----------
like how did you feel about what you


---------20:36----------
were doing


---------20:37----------
six months in yeah i mean i wasn't like


---------20:39----------
terrible it was more just like i was in


---------20:41----------
no place to like give people tips or


---------20:42----------
whatever so like at the time i made my


---------20:44----------
first video was like 2011 i think i had


---------20:46----------
just gotten high-speed internet at my


---------20:48----------
house like a few months prior like


---------20:51----------
because we used to live like i said we


---------20:52----------
lived down the middle of nowhere we had


---------20:53----------
dial up until like 2010 and then we got


---------20:55----------
high-speed internet that was like two


---------20:57----------
megabits down like one up


---------20:59----------
um


---------21:00----------
so like i hadn't even really played


---------21:02----------
online much um but like i was decent but


---------21:04----------
just definitely in no position like give


---------21:06----------
tips and i slowly realized that like i


---------21:08----------
don't take video games that seriously


---------21:10----------
like i you know i just i just play to


---------21:11----------
have fun


---------21:12----------
i might get good at a game or something


---------21:14----------
but i don't ever try to like you know


---------21:16----------
that's that's not my goal is to like be


---------21:17----------
the best at any game i play or whatever


---------21:19----------
or like i only care about winning like


---------21:20----------
it's just having fun with friends and


---------21:22----------
messing around


---------21:23----------
okay makes sense


---------21:25----------
um so i'm i'm kind of hearing that you


---------21:27----------
weren't really like you didn't think it


---------21:29----------
was really a problem that six months in


---------21:32----------
you weren't making what you deemed to be


---------21:34----------
like great youtube videos like you it's


---------21:36----------
i'm hearing that you were kind of okay


---------21:38----------
with


---------21:39----------
not being good at stuff oh yeah no i no


---------21:42----------
yeah i mean i i enjoyed making the


---------21:44----------
videos regardless and they did get some


---------21:46----------
attention early just because me and my


---------21:48----------
friends kind of like


---------21:49----------
we acted as a group where if one person


---------21:51----------
grew everybody kind of grew and we


---------21:52----------
networked in that way


---------21:53----------
and so


---------21:54----------
i didn't know that they were


---------21:56----------
as terrible as i know they are now but i


---------21:58----------
mean everybody's old videos are you know


---------22:00----------
not great um but they were getting


---------22:02----------
attention and i was growing and so


---------22:04----------
yeah i didn't really


---------22:06----------
think too much of it


---------22:07----------
okay


---------22:09----------
so um thanks for kind of and what's it


---------22:11----------
like making being a uh you know youtube


---------22:13----------
content creator now like how how do you


---------22:17----------
um


---------22:18----------
i mean it's still really really fun and


---------22:20----------
still just as rewarding um you know i


---------22:23----------
feel very lucky


---------22:24----------
but there's a lot more like


---------22:26----------
i don't know i guess like hurdles and


---------22:29----------
different things that


---------22:30----------
make it


---------22:32----------
hard but it's not


---------22:33----------
i don't know it's not too hard even just


---------22:35----------
saying that like


---------22:36----------
that's one of the things like even


---------22:37----------
trying to like make any complaint or


---------22:39----------
whatever about the job just seems so


---------22:40----------
like stupid just because compared to you


---------22:42----------
know


---------22:43----------
you know what what other people do for a


---------22:44----------
living or just i know i'm fortunate to


---------22:46----------
be in the position i'm in so


---------22:50----------
hmm


---------22:51----------
just did something sneaky there tyler


---------22:55----------
so so i do you so i'm hearing you say


---------22:58----------
like you know that there are hurdles and


---------23:00----------
challenges and difficulties to being a


---------23:02----------
youtuber


---------23:03----------
and then you were like it's stupid to


---------23:05----------
say those


---------23:07----------
what things


---------23:07----------
you think about that a little bit


---------23:10----------
uh


---------23:11----------
well i just feel like i have a lot of


---------23:13----------
like my problems are not that


---------23:16----------
important in the grand scheme of things


---------23:17----------
in terms of like you know the problems


---------23:19----------
that a lot of people face


---------23:21----------
um yeah


---------23:24----------
what does that mean about the problems


---------23:26----------
that you face


---------23:28----------
um


---------23:31----------
i don't know i i don't know


---------23:33----------
i just don't feel that they're


---------23:36----------
so important that i like


---------23:37----------
i don't know i just feel like


---------23:38----------
complaining about them comes across


---------23:41----------
wrong to a lot of people


---------23:43----------
um


---------23:44----------
because at the end of the day it's like


---------23:45----------
a lot of people go through a lot worse


---------23:46----------
stuff


---------23:47----------
than just being stressed out or


---------23:49----------
overwhelmed or anxious about things


---------23:56----------
can i think for a second


---------23:58----------
sure


---------24:03----------
i'm almost kind of hearing that because


---------24:05----------
you've been so lucky


---------24:07----------
and you're so grateful for what you have


---------24:10----------
that it's not really fair for you to


---------24:11----------
complain because so many other people


---------24:13----------
have it worse


---------24:14----------
some things yeah i think so


---------24:17----------
so if we think about you know the things


---------24:19----------
that we're stressed out about


---------24:22----------
if you're stressed out about something


---------24:23----------
relating to your youtube channel and you


---------24:26----------
don't think it's really fair for you to


---------24:28----------
be stressed out about it


---------24:30----------
how do you think that affects your


---------24:31----------
ability to deal with it effectively


---------24:36----------
um i definitely think it makes it harder


---------24:38----------
how so


---------24:40----------
because it


---------24:41----------
i feel like i have a natural bias to


---------24:42----------
just like shrug a lot of things off


---------24:45----------
just like uh like i just i just have to


---------24:47----------
deal with it like it's not that big a


---------24:48----------
deal


---------24:50----------
yeah


---------24:51----------
so let me ask you a question


---------24:53----------
if i say to something in my mind it's


---------24:56----------
not that big of a deal


---------24:59----------
and when i sort of


---------25:00----------
downplay something or even devalue it


---------25:03----------
what do you think that does to my


---------25:04----------
ability to deal with it


---------25:07----------
makes it a lot harder


---------25:09----------
how


---------25:11----------
um


---------25:12----------
just because you're not making it as


---------25:15----------
important of a thing to tackle or deal


---------25:16----------
with i guess yeah


---------25:18----------
yeah right it's interesting because like


---------25:20----------
what i'm sort of hearing is that you


---------25:21----------
actually go through a process in your


---------25:23----------
mind


---------25:25----------
that makes things feel less important


---------25:30----------
does that make sense


---------25:31----------
yeah i mean i i still feel like these


---------25:33----------
things like


---------25:34----------
that they're important but i internalize


---------25:36----------
them a lot more you know i don't like


---------25:39----------
i don't like reaching out to other


---------25:40----------
people i guess really


---------25:42----------
what as much


---------25:44----------
what makes it hard for you to what makes


---------25:46----------
you not like to reach out to other


---------25:47----------
people


---------25:48----------
um i don't know i guess i just


---------25:51----------
when i when i feel personally like all


---------25:53----------
like a lot of people go through a lot


---------25:54----------
more stuff like it's not


---------25:56----------
i feel like i would just be reaching out


---------25:57----------
to someone that probably has worse


---------25:59----------
problems that they're dealing with than


---------26:00----------
my own i guess


---------26:03----------
in some in some ways


---------26:05----------
sounds very isolating


---------26:08----------
a little not i don't know


---------26:11----------
i mean i have some i have close friends


---------26:12----------
that i can reach out to you know but


---------26:14----------
yeah


---------26:16----------
so tyler i'm gonna need your help with


---------26:18----------
something


---------26:19----------
okay


---------26:22----------
so i'm gonna need to try to figure out


---------26:23----------
so sometimes when i'm talking to people


---------26:25----------
and like i point out a potential you


---------26:27----------
know emotional block or something to


---------26:29----------
them they'll say yeah it's like a small


---------26:30----------
problem


---------26:31----------
and so i don't know


---------26:33----------
if


---------26:35----------
i'm making a mountain out of molehill


---------26:37----------
or


---------26:38----------
you're making a molehill out of a


---------26:39----------
mountain


---------26:42----------
because the problem with my profession


---------26:43----------
is that once we get a hypothesis in our


---------26:45----------
mind


---------26:46----------
we come up with all kinds of ideas to


---------26:48----------
prove ourselves true irrespective of


---------26:50----------
what you say right oh he's he's defended


---------26:54----------
he's got resistance he can't face it oh


---------26:56----------
he's got like all these defense


---------26:58----------
mechanisms active right versus like like


---------27:00----------
how do we really figure out because what


---------27:02----------
i'm hearing is actually like


---------27:04----------
does it sound


---------27:07----------
how can i say this so i think a lot of


---------27:09----------
times when i work with content creators


---------27:12----------
they have trouble holding something


---------27:14----------
called the dialectic which is like


---------27:17----------
two things that feel opposing but can


---------27:19----------
actually coexist at the same time


---------27:22----------
so sometimes when i work with my


---------27:23----------
patients for example like some of them


---------27:24----------
will feel like


---------27:26----------
if someone is angry with me it's


---------27:28----------
impossible for them to love me the idea


---------27:30----------
that someone can love you and be angry


---------27:32----------
with you at the same time is like


---------27:34----------
something that their mind can't compute


---------27:36----------
so what they end up doing is they like


---------27:38----------
tip the scales in one way or the other


---------27:40----------
so either this person loves me or


---------27:43----------
they're angry with me and when they're


---------27:44----------
angry with me they certainly don't love


---------27:46----------
me and what i'm hearing you almost do is


---------27:49----------
sort of say like do you have a lot to be


---------27:51----------
grateful for do you have it easier than


---------27:52----------
other people like absolutely and at the


---------27:55----------
same time like i don't know if you get


---------27:57----------
this bro but being like a successful


---------27:58----------
youtuber is like a pretty high stress


---------28:00----------
profession


---------28:02----------
right there's like a lot


---------28:04----------
yeah right


---------28:06----------
and and furthermore like when you


---------28:08----------
devalue like


---------28:10----------
your experience of that stress as you


---------28:12----------
pointed out it makes it like way harder


---------28:14----------
to deal with


---------28:16----------
yeah


---------28:18----------
and i'm sort of noticing are you how are


---------28:19----------
you feeling right now you doing okay


---------28:21----------
yeah i feel fine okay good so i'm kind


---------28:23----------
of noticing that maybe the first step to


---------28:25----------
like why you feel overwhelmed is that


---------28:28----------
like there's a part of your mind


---------28:31----------
there's a problem that you have to deal


---------28:32----------
with but there's a part of your mind


---------28:34----------
that's actually trying to shrink it


---------28:37----------
and once you try to shrink it like


---------28:39----------
you can't deal with it appropriately


---------28:41----------
like if i think something is you know


---------28:43----------
this sized


---------28:45----------
and then it's easy for me to hold but


---------28:47----------
like i don't really appreciate that it's


---------28:49----------
actually this size then this is like way


---------28:50----------
harder for me to hold


---------28:52----------
and this is the reality of it but


---------28:53----------
instead my mind is like oh it's like not


---------28:55----------
that big of a deal


---------28:57----------
does that make sense


---------28:59----------
yeah


---------29:00----------
so


---------29:01----------
i'm also kind of


---------29:04----------
curious i mean what's stressful so if


---------29:06----------
it's okay with you what i'm gonna do is


---------29:07----------
like ask you some questions


---------29:10----------
and maybe then what we'll try to do is


---------29:11----------
like try to figure out whether like


---------29:14----------
it's you know we'll try to figure out


---------29:15----------
what the right size is does that make


---------29:17----------
sense


---------29:18----------
so i'm going to try to unpack some of


---------29:20----------
the devaluing that you do for your own


---------29:22----------
problems


---------29:24----------
and i want you to pay attention to how


---------29:26----------
you feel talking about this like do you


---------29:28----------
feel like you're coming across as


---------29:29----------
ungrateful do you feel like you're


---------29:31----------
coming across as like


---------29:32----------
someone who's like arrogant and


---------29:34----------
shouldn't be complaining and stuff like


---------29:35----------
that can i trust you to do that


---------29:38----------
yeah okay so tell me what's stressful


---------29:41----------
about you know you said there are


---------29:43----------
hurdles that you have to go through what


---------29:45----------
can you help me understand those


---------29:47----------
uh with regards to


---------29:49----------
like you i i asked you like what's it


---------29:51----------
like being a youtuber now and you said


---------29:52----------
there are hurdles and then you went down


---------29:54----------
this track of like i shouldn't complain


---------29:56----------
um


---------29:58----------
i've yeah um


---------30:00----------
i don't know


---------30:01----------
i feel like there's


---------30:03----------
a lot of expectations


---------30:05----------
put on people with a platform


---------30:08----------
um


---------30:09----------
people like you know i don't know like


---------30:11----------
people expect a lot of perfection these


---------30:13----------
days i feel like


---------30:15----------
um


---------30:15----------
[Music]


---------30:18----------
what's i think


---------30:19----------
go ahead go for it


---------30:22----------
i don't even remember what i was saying


---------30:23----------
because you can go oh


---------30:25----------
you're fine


---------30:26----------
uh so tell me what what's it like to


---------30:29----------
have people expect perfection from you


---------30:34----------
uh i mean it's definitely like stressful


---------30:35----------
because i know i'm just you know i'm


---------30:37----------
just


---------30:38----------
another person we all nobody's perfect


---------30:41----------
everybody has


---------30:42----------
their problems everybody has you know


---------30:45----------
laws


---------30:46----------
um


---------30:47----------
yeah


---------30:48----------
what's it like to be


---------30:50----------
not perfect and have people expect you


---------30:53----------
to be perfect


---------30:55----------
stressful


---------30:56----------
what does that mean


---------30:58----------
what is it what's stressful about it


---------31:02----------
trying to please people that have an


---------31:04----------
unexpected like an un


---------31:07----------
an expectation that's just not like


---------31:08----------
reality i guess


---------31:10----------
um


---------31:12----------
it sounds like you're being held to an


---------31:13----------
impossible standard


---------31:16----------
yeah i mean only to some people right i


---------31:19----------
feel like most people know but only some


---------31:21----------
people yeah


---------31:23----------
yeah that sounds i mean it sounds like a


---------31:24----------
game that's rigged that you can't win


---------31:27----------
yeah i think i tweeted something similar


---------31:29----------
to this like a couple months back was


---------31:30----------
just like


---------31:32----------
to do youtube you need to like be real


---------31:34----------
but don't be too real because if you're


---------31:36----------
too real people realize you're not


---------31:37----------
perfect and people expect you to be


---------31:38----------
perfect i think it's something i tweeted


---------31:40----------
like a couple months ago because that's


---------31:41----------
how that's pretty much how i feel


---------31:45----------
sounds like you have to be artificially


---------31:47----------
real


---------31:48----------
yes like i like i like trying to be


---------31:49----------
authentic


---------31:51----------
but being authentic means you're going


---------31:53----------
to show your own flaws and when you show


---------31:54----------
your own flaws people will judge you and


---------31:56----------
you know


---------31:57----------
think negatively about you


---------31:58----------
especially more so i feel like these


---------32:00----------
days


---------32:01----------
when i started but


---------32:03----------
it sounds hard to be judged by


---------32:06----------
people i mean it just sounds tough like


---------32:08----------
it sounds like a game that you're


---------32:09----------
destined to lose


---------32:11----------
yeah


---------32:13----------
how do you deal with that man


---------32:15----------
um


---------32:17----------
i don't i i brush a lot of stuff off i


---------32:19----------
guess you know like i mean just


---------32:22----------
kind of have to have thick skin a little


---------32:23----------
bit not care what too many people say


---------32:25----------
but it's also


---------32:26----------
doing youtube it's also important to


---------32:28----------
listen to what people are saying


---------32:30----------
you know um


---------32:32----------
at the end of the day you know you have


---------32:33----------
to


---------32:34----------
you know you want to have an audience


---------32:35----------
and that audience has things that they


---------32:37----------
want from you or or how you behave i


---------32:40----------
guess


---------32:41----------
um


---------32:42----------
and so like you want to please those


---------32:44----------
people but at the same time realize that


---------32:45----------
like you're not going to please everyone


---------32:47----------
sure


---------32:48----------
yeah sounds like you've


---------32:50----------
learned a lot about yourself and how to


---------32:52----------
like interact with like


---------32:54----------
the youtube sphere and people


---------32:58----------
you sound sound like you've really


---------32:59----------
adapted to the challenges of your


---------33:02----------
environment


---------33:03----------
yeah i would say


---------33:05----------
i'm kind of curious when you say you


---------33:06----------
brush things off


---------33:08----------
what what does that


---------33:10----------
how do you do that


---------33:12----------
what happens can you give me an example


---------33:13----------
of something that you've had to brush


---------33:15----------
off like tell us a story about that


---------33:17----------
um


---------33:19----------
i i don't even know i


---------33:23----------
i can't even think of one example but


---------33:26----------
okay


---------33:26----------
um when you made that tweet how did


---------33:28----------
people respond


---------33:30----------
i mean a lot of people agreed


---------33:32----------
um


---------33:34----------
i mean i don't think that tweet was


---------33:35----------
anything like super controversial but i


---------33:37----------
guess that's another thing is like


---------33:38----------
almost anything you say or any opinion


---------33:40----------
you put out these days is controversial


---------33:42----------
you know you have people that disagree


---------33:43----------
and


---------33:44----------
um


---------33:45----------
will judge you based off of that


---------33:47----------
that's really like


---------33:48----------
kind of stressful


---------33:51----------
so you keep on using this word stressful


---------33:53----------
so when people are judging you can you


---------33:55----------
help me understand like pretend i'm an


---------33:57----------
alien


---------33:58----------
and i'm trying to understand how humans


---------34:00----------
work and when someone makes a comment


---------34:03----------
about you like what happens in your mind


---------34:05----------
and what happens in your body


---------34:07----------
like what does that mean stressful


---------34:10----------
well i mean anytime someone i think says


---------34:12----------
something about you or like makes a


---------34:14----------
statement about you or judges you in


---------34:16----------
some way you're


---------34:17----------
naturally going to want to be


---------34:18----------
defensive but at the same time it's


---------34:21----------
important to like


---------34:23----------
not be so confident in yourself that you


---------34:25----------
think


---------34:26----------
you know


---------34:27----------
you're right all the time you know maybe


---------34:29----------
there is some validity to what someone


---------34:30----------
is saying and so i think that you know


---------34:33----------
it makes your brain


---------34:34----------
go crazy trying to think of all the


---------34:36----------
possibilities and everything


---------34:39----------
yeah so it's so what happens in your


---------34:41----------
mind so i'm i'm hearing


---------34:43----------
there's like i know it sounds kind of


---------34:44----------
weird but like


---------34:46----------
you get a comment and then you want to


---------34:48----------
be defensive what does that mean


---------34:51----------
uh you want to just shrug it off be like


---------34:53----------
oh this person doesn't know what they're


---------34:54----------
talking about or this person only knows


---------34:56----------
you know they only know


---------34:58----------
they only know who i am through like


---------34:59----------
what i you know this window or whatever


---------35:02----------
whatever content i make or whatever i


---------35:03----------
say online or whatever


---------35:04----------
um you know they don't actually


---------35:07----------
know


---------35:08----------
sure


---------35:09----------
and so i know i know it sounds kind of


---------35:11----------
weird but before you have those thoughts


---------35:14----------
do you feel hurt


---------35:17----------
i mean sometimes it depends yeah yeah


---------35:20----------
okay


---------35:21----------
um because you know when you use the


---------35:23----------
word defensive i generally think like


---------35:26----------
both the body and the mind we react


---------35:28----------
defensively like when we get hurt


---------35:30----------
right so if you think about like a


---------35:32----------
physical like defensive reaction it's


---------35:33----------
usually because


---------35:35----------
there's some kind of like stimulus that


---------35:37----------
we're responding to


---------35:38----------
yeah


---------35:41----------
i guess it's yeah


---------35:43----------
i'm not hurt in the sense of like what


---------35:45----------
they say necessarily hurts me but it's


---------35:46----------
more of just like oh there's someone out


---------35:48----------
there that like dislikes me this much or


---------35:50----------
whatever or hates me this much for like


---------35:51----------
what i see is a dumb reason or whatever


---------35:53----------
you know


---------35:54----------
um i guess that's what like


---------35:56----------
i guess that's what hurts yeah so so i'm


---------35:58----------
noticing there's kind of an initial


---------36:00----------
something sinks into your mind and then


---------36:02----------
you have a defensive reaction and then


---------36:04----------
how do you end up


---------36:06----------
do you respond to the defensive reaction


---------36:08----------
in some way i know we're kind of really


---------36:09----------
tunneling down now


---------36:13----------
um


---------36:14----------
sorry what was the question again sorry


---------36:16----------
um so you get you get defensive


---------36:19----------
and then what do you do


---------36:22----------
um


---------36:24----------
yeah i guess just like think whether or


---------36:26----------
not


---------36:27----------
like if there's genuinely something that


---------36:29----------
i'm doing wrong or that


---------36:31----------
is wrong or there's like what you know


---------36:33----------
if there is a flaw


---------36:35----------
or if this person is just having


---------36:36----------
unreasonable expectations or this person


---------36:39----------
just doesn't know me or whatever you


---------36:41----------
know


---------36:41----------
so it sounds like then you go go through


---------36:43----------
the process of like thinking through it


---------36:45----------
kind of analyze and get things like that


---------36:48----------
yeah


---------36:49----------
so i'm gonna toss out


---------36:52----------
um a definition for you i'm curious what


---------36:56----------
you think about that


---------36:57----------
so you use the word stressful


---------37:00----------
and i was about to ask you tyler what's


---------37:02----------
stressful about this process but let me


---------37:04----------
try to toss something out so i i would


---------37:06----------
almost venture that like what i imagine


---------37:08----------
is stressful for you is that like you're


---------37:10----------
trying to go about your day and live


---------37:11----------
your life right you got boxes to unpack


---------37:14----------
and then someone makes a comment on the


---------37:16----------
internet and then like


---------37:18----------
you no longer get to focus on what you


---------37:21----------
want to do and now your mind has to


---------37:23----------
think through this crap


---------37:25----------
it's like you feel a little bit hurt


---------37:27----------
then you kind of feel defensive then you


---------37:29----------
have to kind of think through it it's


---------37:31----------
almost like it's stressful to have this


---------37:33----------
thing like dumped on your plate


---------37:36----------
yeah i mean i think those two things are


---------37:38----------
more separate than that like i mean if


---------37:41----------
i'm disconnected you know if i'm doing


---------37:42----------
something like just organizing boxes or


---------37:44----------
whatever like i'm


---------37:45----------
you know i'm disconnected from online at


---------37:47----------
that point you know like i'm in my own


---------37:49----------
world just doing my own thing


---------37:50----------
um


---------37:51----------
[Music]


---------37:52----------
yeah


---------37:53----------
so what do you think what does it mean


---------37:55----------
to be what's stressful about this


---------37:57----------
process of like online judgment


---------38:01----------
um


---------38:02----------
[Music]


---------38:03----------
trying to be just trying to be yourself


---------38:05----------
while also trying to like make everyone


---------38:06----------
happy that you can't make everyone happy


---------38:08----------
you know okay


---------38:11----------
now sometimes when people have a


---------38:13----------
challenge like that it's something that


---------38:14----------
they actually had like growing up


---------38:17----------
and sometimes it's just


---------38:18----------
created by the internet because that's


---------38:20----------
what the internet does


---------38:21----------
were there periods of time in your life


---------38:23----------
like before


---------38:24----------
youtube where you felt like you were


---------38:26----------
stuck trying to make everyone happy and


---------38:28----------
couldn't live up to expectations


---------38:31----------
um


---------38:33----------
not


---------38:34----------
not not really in terms of like trying


---------38:36----------
to make everyone happy but i guess


---------38:39----------
um


---------38:40----------
you know trying to like make friends and


---------38:42----------
and whatnot


---------38:43----------
um like like i said when i had first


---------38:44----------
moved you know it was hard for me to


---------38:46----------
make friends in a new environment um


---------38:49----------
yeah


---------38:50----------
and how did you feel do you remember how


---------38:53----------
you felt


---------38:54----------
trying to make friends in a new


---------38:55----------
environment


---------38:56----------
oh yeah like very overwhelmed and


---------38:59----------
lonely and upset yeah


---------39:01----------
exactly like fourth grade but yeah


---------39:03----------
okay so i know this is gonna sound kind


---------39:05----------
of weird


---------39:06----------
but


---------39:06----------
the way that you feel nowadays dealing


---------39:09----------
with stress does it feel similar to the


---------39:12----------
way that you felt in the fourth grade


---------39:15----------
yeah kind of


---------39:17----------
can you help me understand that a little


---------39:19----------
bit in some ways


---------39:21----------
um


---------39:24----------
just the the same kind of overwhelming


---------39:26----------
feeling i guess i don't know


---------39:29----------
okay


---------39:30----------
the same overwhelming feeling okay


---------39:34----------
can you tell me about the fourth grade


---------39:35----------
tyler


---------39:38----------
um i mean it was fine after i made


---------39:40----------
friends like i i didn't have any kind of


---------39:43----------
like


---------39:44----------
real issues growing up or anything it


---------39:45----------
was more of just


---------39:47----------
um


---------39:48----------
yeah


---------39:49----------
that that you know moving i don't i


---------39:51----------
don't think there's really


---------39:53----------
anything from like my childhood that


---------39:55----------
reflects on things now i think i'm


---------39:58----------
i think it's a very different


---------39:59----------
circumstance now


---------40:00----------
but


---------40:01----------
i would agree i think the circumstance


---------40:03----------
sounds quite different


---------40:04----------
which is why i'm a little bit surprised


---------40:06----------
that the feeling feels somewhat similar


---------40:11----------
yeah


---------40:13----------
i don't know


---------40:14----------
so i don't know i don't know if it's


---------40:15----------
that similar but more of just yeah


---------40:18----------
all right


---------40:19----------
i'm easily overwhelmed i would say


---------40:22----------
okay kind of always have been


---------40:26----------
okay


---------40:27----------
can you tell me about when you say you


---------40:30----------
kind of always have been can you tell me


---------40:32----------
like


---------40:34----------
can you tell me about the fourth grade


---------40:35----------
i'm gonna ask again so now i'm hammering


---------40:37----------
okay so you got to let me know if this


---------40:38----------
feels weird


---------40:40----------
because you're you're sending me a lot


---------40:41----------
of mixed signals which i can help you


---------40:43----------
unpack in a second but


---------40:45----------
um


---------40:47----------
you say you've always easily been


---------40:48----------
overwhelmed which implies that there


---------40:50----------
have been times when you were like


---------40:52----------
before this whole youtube thing where


---------40:54----------
you got overwhelmed so can you does


---------40:56----------
anything pop into your mind about like


---------40:59----------
when you felt like super overwhelmed


---------41:02----------
um


---------41:04----------
no i i guess the biggest comparison i


---------41:06----------
guess would be


---------41:07----------
um like in school i tried to like


---------41:11----------
always be perfect in terms of like my


---------41:13----------
schoolwork


---------41:15----------
um that could be overwhelming uh and i


---------41:17----------
was like really


---------41:19----------
kind of hard on myself


---------41:21----------
and always wanted to do really well


---------41:23----------
um


---------41:25----------
i would strive for perfection in that in


---------41:27----------
that way


---------41:28----------
um


---------41:30----------
can you tell me a little bit about how


---------41:32----------
you decided to major in engineering


---------41:35----------
yeah i was just that was just i was


---------41:37----------
naturally good at math math was easy for


---------41:39----------
me math was fun


---------41:41----------
um and so it just seemed like the best


---------41:43----------
fit


---------41:45----------
obviously there's there's good jobs you


---------41:47----------
know yeah why did you um


---------41:52----------
why do you think you were so


---------41:53----------
perfectionistic in terms of grades


---------41:58----------
um


---------42:00----------
i don't know i guess that was just i


---------42:02----------
school was easy to me


---------42:04----------
and so


---------42:05----------
and it was like the only you know it was


---------42:07----------
like the most important thing at the


---------42:08----------
time


---------42:09----------
and so i just wanted to make sure i did


---------42:11----------
a good job at it i don't know


---------42:13----------
and what's overwhelming about that


---------42:16----------
uh


---------42:17----------
making mistakes not understanding


---------42:19----------
something you know i didn't understand


---------42:21----------
something it was really


---------42:23----------
stressful to like try and


---------42:26----------
you know have an expectation on myself


---------42:27----------
and not be able to meet it i guess


---------42:29----------
sure


---------42:32----------
and how did you feel about yourself when


---------42:34----------
you didn't live up to your expectations


---------42:38----------
i yeah i mean i would get really upset


---------42:40----------
at myself


---------42:41----------
what does that mean


---------42:43----------
what does that look like um


---------42:47----------
i don't i don't know um


---------42:53----------
i don't even know just upset at myself


---------42:55----------
out you know


---------42:57----------
crying whatever stress whatever i don't


---------42:58----------
know


---------43:00----------
would you kind of beat yourself up in


---------43:01----------
your head tell yourself things like you


---------43:03----------
should be able to do this


---------43:06----------
yeah


---------43:09----------
um


---------43:13----------
is that at all how you feel when you


---------43:14----------
think about unpacking a box


---------43:19----------
in some ways yes in some ways yeah


---------43:21----------
like this is not a complicated thing but


---------43:23----------
i don't understand why like it's so hard


---------43:25----------
for me


---------43:26----------
um


---------43:28----------
or you know or even if it is actually


---------43:30----------
hard for me if i'm just being lazy like


---------43:32----------
another expectation i guess


---------43:35----------
so


---------43:36----------
i'm also wondering whether your mind did


---------43:38----------
a similar thing when it was like when


---------43:40----------
you didn't get grades like were you like


---------43:41----------
oh


---------43:43----------
how can i say this is this just hard for


---------43:45----------
you or am i just stupid it's almost like


---------43:47----------
correlating like is this hard for me or


---------43:49----------
like am i just lazy


---------43:51----------
like i'm


---------43:52----------
does that make sense


---------43:54----------
yeah


---------44:03----------
can i think for a second


---------44:06----------
what do you think about this


---------44:07----------
conversation tyler


---------44:10----------
um


---------44:11----------
i don't know


---------44:12----------
it's interesting


---------44:15----------
a little


---------44:16----------
nerve-wracking i guess in a sense just


---------44:19----------
yeah but


---------44:21----------
i'm trying to figure out do you get the


---------44:23----------
sense would it help you if i try to try


---------44:26----------
to tell you like where i'm going


---------44:29----------
sure yeah okay


---------44:31----------
so i'm noticing a couple of connections


---------44:34----------
um and i want to just explain to you a


---------44:36----------
little bit about how i understand the


---------44:38----------
mind to work


---------44:39----------
now a lot of this this what i'm about to


---------44:41----------
share with you doesn't really come so


---------44:42----------
much from western psychology but


---------44:45----------
the way that like yogi's studying in


---------44:47----------
india sort of understood the mind to


---------44:49----------
work okay


---------44:51----------
so


---------44:52----------
it's kind of interesting because they


---------44:53----------
notice that when we experience negative


---------44:55----------
emotions especially when we're young we


---------44:58----------
don't know how to process them properly


---------45:01----------
and so if you think about the emotional


---------45:02----------
energy of the mind until you like digest


---------45:05----------
it so in the west for example we have


---------45:07----------
methods of emotional digestion like


---------45:09----------
going to therapy


---------45:11----------
journaling we go through these like very


---------45:13----------
like you know like active emotional


---------45:15----------
processes to like you know process


---------45:17----------
breakups grief whatever we go to like


---------45:19----------
funerals and stuff and we like share


---------45:21----------
stories like all that kind of stuff is


---------45:23----------
like emotional processing but when


---------45:25----------
you're a kid you don't you know you


---------45:26----------
can't give a eulogy when you're a kid


---------45:28----------
but giving a eulogy can be incredibly


---------45:30----------
therapeutic so what they sort of


---------45:32----------
realized is that we have these


---------45:34----------
experiences early in life and then what


---------45:36----------
happens is we kind of store those


---------45:37----------
emotions


---------45:39----------
and then what happens is our brain has


---------45:41----------
this scanning function so i know this is


---------45:42----------
going to sound kind of weird but like


---------45:44----------
you know you can look at a toilet that


---------45:46----------
you've never used before and know how to


---------45:48----------
use the toilet well how is that it's


---------45:50----------
because your mind has an impr like it


---------45:52----------
has all this data


---------45:54----------
and then it recalls the appropriate data


---------45:56----------
based on the appropriate circumstance


---------45:58----------
does that make sense and so sometimes


---------46:01----------
the emotions that we feel


---------46:03----------
in benign situations like unpacking


---------46:06----------
can feel


---------46:08----------
actually extra overwhelming because the


---------46:11----------
emotion isn't created from the unpacking


---------46:14----------
it's actually stored emotion that then


---------46:16----------
gets recalled into your mind and makes a


---------46:19----------
benign action feel overwhelming


---------46:22----------
does that make sense


---------46:24----------
yeah


---------46:25----------
so a good example of this is like if we


---------46:27----------
think about someone with like ptsd right


---------46:29----------
so if i've got ptsd and i was like you


---------46:31----------
know in afghanistan or something and


---------46:33----------
then i come back


---------46:35----------
home


---------46:35----------
and then they're benign stimuli like


---------46:38----------
someone banging a car door which will


---------46:41----------
trigger a reaction in me that is


---------46:43----------
disproportionate to the actual like


---------46:45----------
event does that make sense


---------46:47----------
yeah so one of the things that i've been


---------46:49----------
trying to suss out is whether


---------46:52----------
your difficulty in unpacking boxes


---------46:54----------
because you use these like interesting


---------46:56----------
words like because i'll ask you what


---------46:57----------
does it mean to be stressed what does it


---------46:59----------
mean to be overwhelmed and you're not


---------47:00----------
able to really give me a good answer you


---------47:02----------
kind of noticing that


---------47:04----------
yeah


---------47:05----------
and so part of the reason for that is


---------47:07----------
because sometimes when we're young the


---------47:10----------
resolution of our feelings is like very


---------47:12----------
poor


---------47:13----------
and so when i talk to adults that are


---------47:15----------
not able to describe like how they feel


---------47:18----------
in the present oftentimes it's because


---------47:20----------
it's emotional energy from the past that


---------47:22----------
has a very low resolution we're talking


---------47:24----------
like 120p


---------47:26----------
and so i can ask you lots of questions


---------47:27----------
about it doesn't mean you're stupid it


---------47:29----------
just means that like


---------47:30----------
the resolution of the emotion is like


---------47:32----------
super rough because all you really


---------47:34----------
remember was feeling like overwhelmed


---------47:36----------
but we're absolutely like if we go back


---------47:38----------
and we like listen to the words that you


---------47:40----------
use to describe your current


---------47:42----------
stresses and we listen to the words that


---------47:44----------
you use to describe your previous


---------47:46----------
stresses they're actually all the same


---------47:47----------
words it's overwhelmed stressed and


---------47:50----------
isolated


---------47:51----------
those are the three things that i'm


---------47:53----------
hearing from you over and over and over


---------47:55----------
again


---------47:57----------
and then it's kind of interesting


---------47:58----------
because when i ask you about like


---------47:59----------
unpacking boxes you're like yeah there's


---------48:00----------
some overlap it's not like one to one


---------48:03----------
which it's not gonna be because i think


---------48:05----------
there's some amount of stress from


---------48:06----------
unpacking boxes and then some amount of


---------48:08----------
stress that your mind is like pulling


---------48:10----------
back from the past and kind of


---------48:12----------
projecting onto the present


---------48:14----------
there's also a very similar pattern in


---------48:16----------
terms of your cognition


---------48:18----------
so these are just observations i don't


---------48:19----------
know if this is like true or not right


---------48:20----------
there's no like test for this but one is


---------48:22----------
that like when you're faced with a task


---------48:25----------
there's also the other theme that i'm


---------48:26----------
hearing here is expectations


---------48:28----------
so it seems like you set high


---------48:30----------
expectations on yourself you have you


---------48:32----------
know a lot of expectations of perfection


---------48:35----------
placed upon you by by you like you know


---------48:38----------
the youtube audience it's really


---------48:39----------
interesting because i've worked with a


---------48:40----------
lot of content creators and i've seen


---------48:42----------
this pattern where the kind of


---------48:44----------
expectation that they live up to has to


---------48:46----------
do with what they put on themselves


---------48:49----------
so like you have an expectation you're


---------48:50----------
like it's hard to be perfect whereas


---------48:52----------
someone else may say like it's hard to


---------48:54----------
be like


---------48:55----------
you know


---------48:56----------
funny


---------48:57----------
and that's because and then when i talk


---------48:59----------
to them it's like back when they were


---------49:00----------
younger they had like concerns that


---------49:02----------
people didn't think they were funny or


---------49:03----------
something like that so i think like does


---------49:05----------
this make sense like i'm kind of


---------49:06----------
pointing out themes to you and now i'm


---------49:08----------
going to kind of just put it back to you


---------49:09----------
like what do you think is any of this


---------49:10----------
stuff making sense or am i just you know


---------49:12----------
being way too analytical and trying to


---------49:14----------
like craft a constellation out of a pile


---------49:17----------
of stars


---------49:20----------
i mean i think some of it makes sense i


---------49:21----------
think some of it might be a little


---------49:23----------
you know a little


---------49:24----------
extrapolated i guess sure i feel like a


---------49:26----------
lot of it is just kind of


---------49:29----------
um like i've never been diagnosed with


---------49:31----------
like adhd or anything but i've heard a


---------49:32----------
lot of like


---------49:33----------
i forget i saw something on twitter that


---------49:35----------
was like um people with adhd struggle


---------49:37----------
with


---------49:38----------
uh tasks if they don't live up to if


---------49:40----------
they don't meet four


---------49:42----------
constraints or something which was


---------49:44----------
um was it interesting challenging novel


---------49:48----------
or urgent and that like resonated with


---------49:50----------
me like


---------49:51----------
a lot


---------49:52----------
like if something is not interesting or


---------49:54----------
challenging or new to me then i will not


---------49:56----------
do it until it is urgent like that is


---------49:58----------
100


---------49:59----------
how my brain works


---------50:00----------
yeah um


---------50:02----------
so have you ever seen a mental health


---------50:03----------
professional


---------50:05----------
no


---------50:06----------
ever been kind of interested in seeing


---------50:09----------
if you have adhd


---------50:11----------
yeah


---------50:13----------
what


---------50:14----------
what keeps you from seeing one


---------50:17----------
um


---------50:18----------
just i guess busyness and


---------50:20----------
i feel like i function pretty okay like


---------50:23----------
i don't feel like i'm


---------50:24----------
you know i just have


---------50:26----------
some things that i struggle with but i


---------50:27----------
don't think it's like


---------50:29----------
enduring my life in any crazy way


---------50:32----------
um


---------50:33----------
yeah


---------50:34----------
yeah so i think that's a reasonable


---------50:37----------
so i you know i think it's not a bad


---------50:39----------
idea to get checked out and at the same


---------50:42----------
time you know one of the criteria for


---------50:44----------
basically any psychiatric disorder or


---------50:46----------
any diagnosis is usually impairment to


---------50:49----------
function


---------50:50----------
so if we try to figure out like what's


---------50:51----------
the line between like you know being sad


---------50:54----------
and like having clinical depression it's


---------50:56----------
like impairment to function so everyone


---------50:58----------
feels sad everyone i'm not surprised i


---------51:00----------
mean i'm kind of the same way where you


---------51:02----------
know it's really hard for me to do


---------51:04----------
things that are


---------51:05----------
not urgent not interesting not


---------51:07----------
challenging


---------51:10----------
so out of the stuff that i was kind of


---------51:11----------
sharing with you what seemed to make


---------51:13----------
sense and what do you think was like too


---------51:15----------
much of a stretch like what did resonate


---------51:19----------
um


---------51:21----------
i don't i don't know i'm trying to


---------51:22----------
remember


---------51:23----------
i mean a lot of it definitely resonated


---------51:24----------
i think some of


---------51:26----------
you know


---------51:28----------
i don't i don't know that there's too


---------51:29----------
much of like ties from like my childhood


---------51:31----------
really aside from just expectations on


---------51:33----------
myself i definitely think that that


---------51:34----------
makes sense um


---------51:36----------
expectations i put on myself based off


---------51:38----------
of


---------51:39----------
expectations


---------51:40----------
other people have you know i guess if


---------51:43----------
that makes sense


---------51:45----------
um


---------51:45----------
that makes sense like that's kind of


---------51:47----------
been a thing for sure okay so yeah so i


---------51:49----------
think you know the the purpose of having


---------51:51----------
conversations like this is like


---------51:53----------
occasionally i'm gonna you know sort of


---------51:55----------
take a shotgun approach where i'm gonna


---------51:57----------
toss a lot of crap out and then like i'm


---------52:00----------
it's actually like you're the expert


---------52:01----------
here so you're the one who has to say


---------52:03----------
hey i think a lot of this stuff is like


---------52:06----------
kind of doesn't make sense to me and


---------52:08----------
this kind of thing does


---------52:09----------
now i suspect if you


---------52:13----------
i suspect there's there may be a little


---------52:15----------
bit of like


---------52:17----------
money to be found if we talk about


---------52:20----------
what the early stages of fourth grade


---------52:22----------
was like


---------52:23----------
um but if you don't want to we don't


---------52:25----------
have to


---------52:26----------
i yeah i probably wouldn't want to but


---------52:29----------
okay i don't think there's anything


---------52:30----------
there that like that's that significant


---------52:32----------
i don't think it was like


---------52:34----------
i don't know okay that's totally fine it


---------52:37----------
was just out you know just a kid trying


---------52:38----------
to make friends in a place i didn't


---------52:40----------
didn't know you know i think any kid


---------52:41----------
would struggle with that i don't think


---------52:43----------
there's anything really much deeper than


---------52:44----------
that personally but


---------52:46----------
yeah so i mean if if you're


---------52:48----------
if you don't think it's useful to talk


---------52:50----------
about i think that's totally fine um i i


---------52:52----------
do think you know just like you said


---------52:55----------
it's


---------52:56----------
i think your experience there


---------52:58----------
sounds quite common


---------53:00----------
right in the sense that like any kid


---------53:02----------
who's moving to a new place would


---------53:03----------
struggle to make friends like


---------53:05----------
um the reason that i was thinking that


---------53:07----------
maybe there's something there is because


---------53:11----------
even though the experience is common and


---------53:13----------
expected it doesn't it still means that


---------53:16----------
most kids in that situation would be


---------53:18----------
affected a particular way yeah


---------53:21----------
and even when it comes to sort of


---------53:22----------
reaching out with people now like it


---------53:24----------
sounds like when you struggle sometimes


---------53:26----------
you feel kind of isolated and you feel


---------53:28----------
like


---------53:29----------
not wanting to reach out to other people


---------53:34----------
yeah maybe in terms of like


---------53:37----------
you know yeah with like my problems like


---------53:39----------
i don't have any problem like making


---------53:41----------
friends or yeah yeah connecting even


---------53:43----------
connecting with people it's more of just


---------53:44----------
like i just try not to


---------53:45----------
burden people i guess with like my


---------53:47----------
problems because i don't feel like like


---------53:49----------
i said at the end i don't feel like my


---------53:50----------
problems are


---------53:51----------
that


---------53:52----------
you know


---------53:53----------
bad in the grand scheme of things


---------53:55----------
sure um


---------53:56----------
yeah and that i think makes a lot of


---------53:58----------
sense too i think you have a lot to be


---------54:00----------
lucky uh uh you have a lot to be


---------54:02----------
grateful for and you're you're quite


---------54:03----------
lucky in a lot of ways


---------54:06----------
so let me ask you tyler what do you


---------54:08----------
think would be a good use of our time


---------54:10----------
if you have any particular ideas that's


---------54:12----------
fine otherwise i can give you like two


---------54:14----------
or three options


---------54:16----------
um yeah you can give me some options


---------54:18----------
okay so number one is we can try to


---------54:21----------
understand the process of like unpacking


---------54:24----------
boxes because i think we have a little


---------54:25----------
bit more information now and we can kind


---------54:27----------
of revisit that and try to understand um


---------54:31----------
you know like how does that work like


---------54:33----------
how does our mind work you know how do i


---------54:35----------
go about doing things that are not


---------54:37----------
important challenging


---------54:39----------
urgent


---------54:40----------
uh


---------54:41----------
the second thing that i think we the


---------54:43----------
second track we could go down is you


---------54:45----------
mentioned that out of all the stuff that


---------54:46----------
sort of resonated with you the


---------54:48----------
expectations that you place on yourself


---------54:50----------
seem to be like what kind of stuck out


---------54:53----------
the most so we can try to explore and


---------54:55----------
understand those a little bit better


---------54:57----------
and then


---------54:59----------
i think the third thing to potentially


---------55:00----------
talk about is that i do think that


---------55:04----------
your ability to do particular things if


---------55:07----------
you got a little bit better at


---------55:10----------
not devaluing or not


---------55:12----------
discounting some of your own experiences


---------55:15----------
because you relate your experience to


---------55:18----------
someone else


---------55:19----------
like


---------55:20----------
you know i i don't know how to say this


---------55:22----------
but


---------55:23----------
you know i've had


---------55:25----------
patients come into my office since you


---------55:27----------
know


---------55:28----------
who've had trauma


---------55:30----------
and then what they always do is say like


---------55:32----------
but i it's not like i'm an afghani


---------55:35----------
refugee trying to flee the country right


---------55:37----------
what they'll do is they'll take their


---------55:39----------
experience which is like painful and


---------55:41----------
affects them and they'll say like other


---------55:43----------
people have it worse like i have it


---------55:44----------
relatively like so i had one patient for


---------55:47----------
example who had like


---------55:48----------
a single encounter of of kind of like


---------55:51----------
sexual assault in a public place with a


---------55:53----------
stranger


---------55:54----------
and so you know he was like a teenage


---------55:57----------
kid at the time and then like but one of


---------55:58----------
the things that he kept on saying when


---------56:00----------
he would come to my office is like there


---------56:01----------
are people who would get like you know


---------56:02----------
abused by family members or pre there


---------56:04----------
are people at some like i was just like


---------56:05----------
a one-time thing it wasn't actually that


---------56:07----------
bad you know my parents showed up before


---------56:09----------
things got too crazy and so he had like


---------56:12----------
this really common pattern of saying


---------56:13----------
like oh other people have it bad but for


---------56:16----------
some reason like we kept on kind of


---------56:18----------
coming back to it and he sort of felt


---------56:19----------
like you know it's not really that


---------56:21----------
traumatic


---------56:23----------
whereas it actually was right because it


---------56:25----------
doesn't it sort of doesn't matter


---------56:27----------
you know if i get hit by eight bullets


---------56:29----------
and you get hit by one bullet like


---------56:31----------
you've still been hit by a bullet


---------56:33----------
you know that damage is there


---------56:34----------
so i'm a little bit


---------56:36----------
you know i think it could help and this


---------56:38----------
is something that i found when i work


---------56:39----------
with content creators to sort of you


---------56:41----------
know be able to accept some of the


---------56:43----------
feelings that you have about being like


---------56:45----------
you know kind of getting a bad beat


---------56:46----------
sometimes and you can be grateful for


---------56:48----------
things and at the same time hold the


---------56:50----------
dialectic of like stuff can suck for you


---------56:53----------
like you're not impervious to that as


---------56:55----------
you pointed out earlier like you are


---------56:56----------
human


---------56:58----------
and just because you have a lot to be


---------57:00----------
grateful for doesn't mean that like


---------57:03----------
you can't


---------57:04----------
you know


---------57:06----------
be unhappy or complain


---------57:10----------
yeah


---------57:11----------
what do you think about those three


---------57:13----------
options so boxes expectations and


---------57:17----------
kind of


---------57:19----------
um


---------57:21----------
i think


---------57:22----------
trying to like


---------57:24----------
help myself


---------57:26----------
handle


---------57:28----------
tasks that i find overwhelming i think


---------57:29----------
would be


---------57:30----------
most useful to me


---------57:32----------
okay i feel like that's something that i


---------57:34----------
really struggle with


---------57:35----------
okay it's only getting worse is like i


---------57:37----------
get older and have more responsibilities


---------57:39----------
and stuff so


---------57:40----------
interesting okay so let's talk about


---------57:42----------
that so can you tell me a little bit


---------57:43----------
about how it's getting worse with more


---------57:45----------
responsibilities


---------57:46----------
that sounds scary um


---------57:49----------
yeah i don't know i mean just as you get


---------57:51----------
older you have more responsibilities you


---------57:52----------
have more people in your life to


---------57:56----------
maintain relationships with or


---------57:58----------
you know more


---------57:59----------
things to take care of or maintain


---------58:02----------
um you know like my youtube channel


---------58:04----------
grows year over year you know so there's


---------58:05----------
always something new and different um


---------58:08----------
so


---------58:09----------
i think that kind of stuff


---------58:11----------
okay um so do you feel like


---------58:14----------
yeah go ahead


---------58:16----------
no just there's there's you know there's


---------58:17----------
just it feels like you're over here


---------58:18----------
there's always


---------58:19----------
new things that


---------58:21----------
need


---------58:22----------
managing i guess


---------58:24----------
and


---------58:25----------
am i hearing that there's like a trend


---------58:27----------
towards like maybe things are getting


---------58:29----------
unmanageable at some point or will


---------58:31----------
become unmanageable at some point


---------58:33----------
because it's just


---------58:35----------
yeah


---------58:36----------
is that something you think about or


---------58:37----------
worry about


---------58:39----------
um


---------58:41----------
kind of


---------58:42----------
like sometimes i feel like


---------58:44----------
i maybe should simplify things you know


---------58:48----------
um


---------58:49----------
but yeah


---------58:51----------
okay


---------58:52----------
um


---------58:54----------
let me just think for a second so tyler


---------58:57----------
what do you think would be more helpful


---------58:58----------
so if we're taking uh if we're taking


---------59:00----------
like you know how to manage tasks is our


---------59:02----------
problem do you think it would be more


---------59:04----------
helpful for me to sort of explain


---------59:06----------
frameworks and like teach a little bit


---------59:08----------
or do you want me to try to like help


---------59:10----------
explore like with you and ask you


---------59:12----------
questions what would you prefer


---------59:14----------
um i think teach i think okay i'm kind


---------59:17----------
of getting that vibe too


---------59:18----------
so let's start with um


---------59:21----------
[Music]


---------59:22----------
tasks okay so the first thing that i


---------59:24----------
want to point out is that


---------59:27----------
okay let me just can i compose my


---------59:28----------
thoughts for a second and kind of come


---------59:30----------
up with like


---------59:33----------
i'm halfway there okay give me a minute


---------59:36----------
you're fine


---------59:37----------
i just don't know how i'm gonna wrap up


---------59:38----------
i've got the first half of it


---------59:41----------
okay


---------59:44----------
all right


---------59:45----------
i'm going to compose a story of pure


---------59:47----------
fiction


---------59:48----------
based on conjecture about your life


---------59:51----------
okay


---------59:52----------
give me a second so i'm gonna pull out


---------59:53----------
um an ipad and i think i'm gonna need to


---------59:56----------
draw for this so i'm gonna screen share


---------59:58----------
with you okay


---------59:59----------
so one of my um


---------60:02----------
there's a streamer who gave me a bit of


---------60:04----------
advice which was to


---------60:06----------
have two wi-fi networks


---------60:10----------
and was saying that you know if you have


---------60:11----------
two wi-fi networks like if one of them


---------60:13----------
goes out you don't have to stop


---------60:14----------
streaming


---------60:15----------
so i've done that


---------60:16----------
and it works well


---------60:18----------
but the only problem is that um


---------60:21----------
now sometimes all of my things are not


---------60:23----------
on the same network


---------60:25----------
and so like this may be like completely


---------60:28----------
bs okay so you tell me if this sounds


---------60:30----------
like it makes sense or not okay so can


---------60:32----------
you see this


---------60:35----------
uh yes


---------60:37----------
okay


---------60:38----------
okay but it's kind of blank right now


---------60:39----------
right okay


---------60:40----------
so let's start with this so we've got


---------60:43----------
tasks


---------60:44----------
okay


---------60:44----------
[Music]


---------60:46----------
oh man how am i going to stitch this


---------60:47----------
together okay so


---------60:50----------
so sometimes you do things that are


---------60:51----------
stressed like like you've got tasks that


---------60:53----------
you've got to do and then there are the


---------60:55----------
tasks that are like important


---------60:58----------
like youtube


---------60:59----------
relationships right


---------61:02----------
and then there are the tasks that are


---------61:03----------
fun


---------61:05----------
sorry for my handwriting i am a medical


---------61:06----------
doctor which means that i suck at


---------61:08----------
writing things i think it's fine um and


---------61:11----------
this can also be relationships right


---------61:13----------
yeah and so then you've got your


---------61:15----------
priority list and so what happens is


---------61:18----------
that you know naturally like you're


---------61:19----------
gonna pick important stuff


---------61:21----------
and fun stuff so here's relationships


---------61:25----------
and then you know


---------61:27----------
down here is going to be boxes


---------61:31----------
but i think there's


---------61:32----------
so we may say that this priority list is


---------61:35----------
based on


---------61:36----------
um


---------61:38----------
you know things like importance and fun


---------61:40----------
but i think that there are a couple of


---------61:42----------
other things that we've sort of hit on


---------61:44----------
one is avoidance


---------61:46----------
okay one is going to be expectation


---------61:51----------
and what i mean is like i should be able


---------61:53----------
to do this


---------61:57----------
right so this is a thought that you have


---------61:59----------
when it comes to boxes right


---------62:01----------
yeah


---------62:02----------
okay


---------62:04----------
and then um


---------62:06----------
there's also kind of like a where to


---------62:07----------
start


---------62:10----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------62:12----------
like these are sort of easy


---------62:14----------
because you know how to do this and this


---------62:16----------
is kind of hard because you don't really


---------62:18----------
like know where to start


---------62:20----------
and then the other problem here is that


---------62:22----------
like perfectionism is also in play do


---------62:25----------
you know how so you're like kind of a


---------62:26----------
perfectionistic person right


---------62:28----------
yeah


---------62:29----------
because there you are opening a box and


---------62:31----------
you're like but there's like a complete


---------62:33----------
system


---------62:34----------
to do this


---------62:35----------
and and opening a box is not something


---------62:38----------
that you can just you can't just open a


---------62:40----------
box


---------62:41----------
right what you've got to do is like


---------62:42----------
unpack


---------62:44----------
and unpack is a really


---------62:46----------
like broad thing that you can't really


---------62:48----------
see to the end of


---------62:50----------
you so it's hard to start because you


---------62:52----------
can't see the end does that make sense


---------62:54----------
yeah


---------62:54----------
okay so i'm going to teach you something


---------62:56----------
interesting how long have you been


---------62:57----------
playing video games


---------63:00----------
uh


---------63:00----------
i don't feels like forever i don't know


---------63:03----------
since i was like five or six probably


---------63:05----------
okay


---------63:05----------
so your brain has wired differently from


---------63:08----------
like people other people's brains so


---------63:11----------
here's an interesting observation i made


---------63:13----------
i don't know how much actual data there


---------63:15----------
is to support this but i've seen this


---------63:16----------
pattern time and again is there's two


---------63:18----------
kinds of problem solving close-ended


---------63:20----------
problem solving


---------63:23----------
and open-ended problem-solving


---------63:27----------
and what close-ended problem-solving is


---------63:29----------
is like if i give you a set of tasks and


---------63:31----------
i kind of give you the rules of the game


---------63:34----------
you will be very good at this


---------63:36----------
gamers are very good at close-ended


---------63:38----------
problem-solving like as i understand you


---------63:40----------
kind of do like a variety of games right


---------63:41----------
so you're not like necessarily an expert


---------63:43----------
in a particular thing


---------63:45----------
but if i give you a set of criteria you


---------63:48----------
can shine within it so like if i say


---------63:51----------
um tyler i want you to make content i


---------63:54----------
want you to play this game with these


---------63:55----------
three people and i want you to have fun


---------63:57----------
doing it like you can do that like you


---------64:00----------
can see the start you can see the end


---------64:02----------
and you can sort of figure out like how


---------64:03----------
to get from a to z does that make sense


---------64:06----------
yeah


---------64:07----------
and and you can thrive like you don't


---------64:08----------
even need to like really script it out


---------64:10----------
or anything you can be kind of organic


---------64:11----------
but you sort of know


---------64:13----------
the steps between like a and z and you


---------64:15----------
do an awesome job with it does that make


---------64:17----------
sense


---------64:18----------
yep


---------64:19----------
so if you look at video games because


---------64:21----------
that's what video games do right like so


---------64:22----------
video games put boundaries


---------64:25----------
around the task to be solved


---------64:27----------
so like gamers are really good at


---------64:29----------
optimizing dps rotations because


---------64:32----------
all of like the buttons that i can press


---------64:34----------
and the damage that they do in their


---------64:36----------
cast times and things like that those


---------64:38----------
are all like entered into the system and


---------64:40----------
i have all the puzzle pieces does that


---------64:42----------
make sense


---------64:43----------
yeah it's it's almost like if i give you


---------64:45----------
a bunch of legos like you can put


---------64:47----------
something together because legos are


---------64:49----------
constrained and like what the pieces are


---------64:51----------
so what i found with people who played


---------64:53----------
video games for a very long time is that


---------64:56----------
they're very good at close-ended


---------64:57----------
problem-solving


---------64:59----------
the other interesting thing is they seem


---------65:01----------
worse at open-ended problem-solving


---------65:04----------
um and so this is like people who are


---------65:05----------
like non-gamers


---------65:07----------
so uh i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------65:10----------
like if you give a gamer like a task


---------65:12----------
like unpack


---------65:13----------
there is no real start and no real end


---------65:16----------
to that right it's kind of like this


---------65:18----------
open-ended thing so this is why gamers


---------65:20----------
struggle to do things like find a job


---------65:23----------
so find a job is actually like a pretty


---------65:25----------
complex abstract process where it's like


---------65:28----------
how do you know you know or get a good


---------65:30----------
job let's say that so how do you know


---------65:32----------
like when a job is good enough right


---------65:34----------
like you know you can find maybe a job


---------65:35----------
but like a good job you know that's


---------65:38----------
something that we really struggle with


---------65:39----------
and if you kind of think about it if you


---------65:41----------
look at the development of let's say


---------65:43----------
like someone who's a non-gamer


---------65:45----------
there's this system of graduated


---------65:48----------
open-ended solving okay and what i mean


---------65:50----------
by that is like when you're in when


---------65:53----------
you're in school like grade school like


---------65:54----------
you don't really have any choices about


---------65:56----------
your classes right and then you go to


---------65:58----------
high school and you kind of get to pick


---------66:00----------
like then you have like more choice so


---------66:01----------
when you're like 10 years old this is


---------66:04----------
the scope of your choice and then when


---------66:05----------
you're 15 years old this is the scope of


---------66:08----------
your choice and then when you go to


---------66:09----------
college this is the scope of your choice


---------66:12----------
and then when you graduate from college


---------66:14----------
this is the scope of your choice does


---------66:15----------
that make sense


---------66:17----------
yeah like because you can take like you


---------66:18----------
know you can take a gap year or not take


---------66:20----------
a gap year and so over time if you look


---------66:23----------
at people who are sort of like you know


---------66:26----------
kind of like living a regular life


---------66:29----------
their ability so the abstraction


---------66:31----------
increases the older that you get does


---------66:34----------
that make sense


---------66:36----------
because at 25 you know you can do


---------66:38----------
whatever you want to


---------66:39----------
but generally speaking what i found with


---------66:41----------
gamers is that you know when they're 20


---------66:43----------
years old and they spend their time


---------66:45----------
playing video games instead of getting


---------66:46----------
an internship or instead of doing


---------66:48----------
extracurriculars the path of a gamer is


---------66:51----------
actually like a little bit different


---------66:53----------
so what i mean by that is


---------66:54----------
how do i get this thing to


---------66:59----------
um


---------67:00----------
so let's like so if you look at the path


---------67:02----------
of the gamer this is the same


---------67:04----------
at 15 maybe people are doing


---------67:05----------
extracurriculars but gamers are kind of


---------67:07----------
here and then at 20 like you know i may


---------67:09----------
go to classes and i may pick a major and


---------67:11----------
stuff but i'm kind of over here and then


---------67:13----------
at 25 it's like you've been making


---------67:14----------
youtube for a long time so it's kind of


---------67:16----------
like you're kind of you're kind of doing


---------67:18----------
what you're doing so and then this gap


---------67:20----------
is what i tend to see between gamers and


---------67:22----------
non-gamers with their ability to deal


---------67:24----------
with open-ended problem solving with me


---------67:26----------
so far


---------67:26----------
yeah so i think the first thing to


---------67:29----------
understand is that you know this is why


---------67:31----------
these things feel easy like i hate to


---------67:33----------
break this to you tyler but making a


---------67:35----------
successful youtube channel is actually


---------67:37----------
like more complicated than unpacking


---------67:39----------
boxes agree or disagree no i agree yeah


---------67:43----------
so but why does this feel easier to you


---------67:46----------
uh because it just it already happened i


---------67:49----------
guess and it kind of just did happen


---------67:50----------
naturally like it wasn't something i


---------67:52----------
tried to make happen


---------67:53----------
so i would say the reason this feels


---------67:55----------
easier is because you're more


---------67:56----------
experienced so what your brain like


---------67:59----------
literally i know this sounds kind of


---------68:00----------
weird but what your brain is able to do


---------68:01----------
is if i tell you tyler i want you to


---------68:04----------
make a video about fortnite that is like


---------68:06----------
an abstract goal but literally what your


---------68:08----------
brain can do is take like video about


---------68:10----------
fortnight


---------68:11----------
and it can day okay step one's gonna be


---------68:13----------
this step two is gonna be this step


---------68:14----------
three is gonna be this step four is


---------68:15----------
gonna be this step five's gonna be this


---------68:16----------
step six is gonna be this and you can do


---------68:19----------
that like you do it in your


---------68:20----------
sleep does that make sense


---------68:22----------
yeah


---------68:22----------
so this is the process that we call


---------68:25----------
operationalizing a problem


---------68:29----------
so what operationalizing a problem is is


---------68:31----------
taking an abstract goal


---------68:34----------
and turning it into steps


---------68:37----------
does that make sense


---------68:38----------
yeah and this process like is actually


---------68:41----------
really hard like if you were to ask me


---------68:42----------
dr k make a successful youtube video i


---------68:45----------
would be absolutely overwhelmed i would


---------68:47----------
not know how to do that but in your mind


---------68:49----------
like you're thinking about thumbnail


---------68:51----------
you're thinking about title you're


---------68:52----------
thinking about okay who would be good to


---------68:54----------
partner with for this particular game


---------68:56----------
and your mind is actually like you're so


---------68:58----------
you're so good at this right because


---------68:59----------
you've got like eight million


---------69:01----------
subscribers on youtube or whatever so


---------69:03----------
like you're kind of good at this and you


---------69:04----------
know how to do this process which is


---------69:06----------
going to be overwhelming for like 99.9


---------69:09----------
percent of people


---------69:10----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------69:12----------
this is something that you may want to


---------69:14----------
operationalize so if you have trouble


---------69:16----------
doing a process


---------69:18----------
instead of holding it in your head


---------69:21----------
okay which i don't know if that makes


---------69:23----------
sense but like you know your mind


---------69:24----------
automatically like does this stuff for


---------69:26----------
youtube you may have to like


---------69:29----------
operationalize it out like in a


---------69:31----------
particular way so what i mean by that is


---------69:33----------
sort of think about okay so if we're


---------69:35----------
unpacking boxes one one thing we can


---------69:37----------
look at is number of boxes


---------69:40----------
and another thing we can look at is like


---------69:41----------
rooms in the house


---------69:43----------
yeah


---------69:44----------
right and then so the more you kind of


---------69:46----------
sit down and you can think like okay but


---------69:47----------
the problem is that like if you unpack


---------69:49----------
one box maybe it's got kitchen stuff and


---------69:52----------
maybe it's got bedroom stuff


---------69:54----------
and that's kind of chaotic and then if


---------69:56----------
you've got rooms in the house the


---------69:57----------
problem is there's stuff stuff in box


---------69:58----------
one and stuff in box a


---------70:01----------
does this sort of make sense like why


---------70:02----------
this is hard


---------70:04----------
yeah yeah right and so this is what


---------70:06----------
feels overwhelming about


---------70:08----------
unpacking because it feels like and yeah


---------70:11----------
go ahead and and what adds to that is


---------70:13----------
like that's not the only task that is


---------70:16----------
like this you know like i might have


---------70:18----------
three or four other things where it's


---------70:20----------
like


---------70:21----------
so not only is there a complicated


---------70:23----------
process to do each individual task but


---------70:25----------
then there's multiple tasks to be done


---------70:27----------
and trying to figure out which one you


---------70:29----------
know i should do which is why it's like


---------70:30----------
oh it's just easier just go


---------70:32----------
to youtube or whatever


---------70:33----------
yep so now we get to should do love it


---------70:35----------
so basically like


---------70:38----------
what we are asking you to do tyler is


---------70:40----------
the equivalent of asking my my


---------70:42----------
grandmother to figure out a dps rotation


---------70:45----------
in final fantasy 14. she can unpack


---------70:47----------
boxes


---------70:49----------
but she just doesn't know where to start


---------70:51----------
right and it's not that she's stupid and


---------70:53----------
it's not that you're stupid it's just


---------70:55----------
like literally think about this bro


---------70:56----------
you've been playing games since the age


---------70:58----------
of five where you've been given the


---------71:00----------
legos


---------71:01----------
and now what we're doing is we're giving


---------71:02----------
you plato


---------71:04----------
and it's like wait this is like way too


---------71:05----------
abstract like i need some way to turn


---------71:08----------
plato into legos and then i can put


---------71:10----------
something together like if i were to


---------71:12----------
give you 30 balls of play-doh and say


---------71:15----------
make a horse you could assemble the


---------71:17----------
balls into a horse shape easier than you


---------71:20----------
could take a lump of play-doh and like


---------71:22----------
form it into a horse does that make


---------71:24----------
sense yeah


---------71:26----------
and so this has nothing to do with you


---------71:28----------
being you know like


---------71:30----------
incompetent or anything it's just like


---------71:31----------
literally i've noticed that when people


---------71:32----------
play games a lot and especially if


---------71:34----------
you've been making youtube videos for a


---------71:36----------
decade like your brain is equipped to do


---------71:39----------
a particular task well


---------71:41----------
okay


---------71:42----------
so so what i would recommend is you know


---------71:44----------
try to create some sort of system


---------71:47----------
and be careful because when you create


---------71:49----------
the system this is what your mind is


---------71:51----------
going to do the perfectionistic


---------71:53----------
tendencies are gonna pop up so now


---------71:56----------
okay so step number one so if you're


---------71:57----------
trying to do a task okay step number one


---------72:01----------
is operationalize it


---------72:04----------
the second thing that you're gonna need


---------72:05----------
to do is when you operationalize it


---------72:07----------
you're gonna get resistance


---------72:09----------
so when you try to do step number one


---------72:11----------
what is your mind gonna tell you if i


---------72:13----------
were to tell you okay


---------72:15----------
um tyler what i want you to do is like


---------72:17----------
make a list of boxes and a list of


---------72:19----------
places where the things in the boxes go


---------72:21----------
and then what's your mind going to say


---------72:22----------
to that


---------72:24----------
like oh my god


---------72:26----------
what is the most efficient way to do


---------72:28----------
this or the best way to do it there it


---------72:30----------
is


---------72:31----------
yeah


---------72:31----------
why are you a successful youtuber tyler


---------72:33----------
what did you do when you started making


---------72:35----------
youtube videos


---------72:37----------
uh i always tried to improve them i


---------72:39----------
guess i was a bit of a perfectionist


---------72:41----------
over time sort of sort of but if you


---------72:44----------
really pay attention go back and watch


---------72:45----------
the vod


---------72:47----------
when you made your first youtube video


---------72:49----------
oh i just did it i just


---------72:51----------
yeah and that's something that i've


---------72:53----------
that's something that i've been able to


---------72:54----------
like take into doing more things youtube


---------72:57----------
related like it's like i wanted to do a


---------72:58----------
podcast and i was like i don't know how


---------73:00----------
to do a podcast i don't really know how


---------73:02----------
to interview people so i was like i'm


---------73:03----------
just gonna do it and i have gotten


---------73:04----------
better about that when it comes to


---------73:07----------
like youtube related stuff but yeah i


---------73:09----------
don't know why i still struggle with


---------73:10----------
that in like


---------73:11----------
real life stuff yeah so i think the


---------73:13----------
reason you struggle with that in real


---------73:15----------
life stuff is because you are skilled at


---------73:17----------
youtube


---------73:18----------
right whereas you're not skilled at the


---------73:20----------
other stuff like on your character sheet


---------73:23----------
you're like level 88 at youtube


---------73:26----------
and you're like level four and other


---------73:28----------
stuff


---------73:29----------
yeah so so what we see here if we really


---------73:31----------
look at the times that you've been


---------73:33----------
successful what you've been able to do


---------73:35----------
is let go of the perfectionism whereas


---------73:37----------
even like who the cares if you're


---------73:39----------
inefficient with unpacking your boxes


---------73:42----------
like yeah


---------73:43----------
you know


---------73:44----------
you know like but the answer is you care


---------73:48----------
yeah just in my head i'm like i want to


---------73:49----------
get this done as fast as possible and so


---------73:51----------
i yeah


---------73:52----------
yeah so now you have to be careful


---------73:53----------
because


---------73:54----------
even when you try to do something so


---------73:56----------
this is the other thing when it comes to


---------73:58----------
like i'm not motivated to do a task so


---------74:00----------
one thing we can do is operationalize


---------74:02----------
the problem so that we can like create


---------74:04----------
bite-size chunks and then approach it


---------74:06----------
this is the tricky thing is that that is


---------74:08----------
insufficient because when we do that our


---------74:10----------
psychology creates some kind of


---------74:13----------
resistance


---------74:15----------
does that make sense


---------74:16----------
and then the resistance this is


---------74:18----------
something that's going to feel


---------74:19----------
emotionally uncomfortable


---------74:23----------
and then what we do


---------74:25----------
is when we feel emotionally


---------74:27----------
uncomfortable what we do is avoid


---------74:29----------
and then this creates the avoidance and


---------74:31----------
then you go back and then once we are


---------74:33----------
once our mind is decided hey this feels


---------74:36----------
emotionally uncomfortable i feel like an


---------74:38----------
idiot doing this i feel like there's a


---------74:39----------
better way to do it i feel kind of


---------74:41----------
incompetent like how dumb can i possibly


---------74:43----------
be that i can't unpack these boxes


---------74:45----------
there's all that self-judgment and crap


---------74:47----------
that we sort of hit on right and this is


---------74:49----------
what you call stressful by the way


---------74:52----------
this process is i think what you mean


---------74:54----------
when you say the word stressful then


---------74:56----------
what happens is then we get to


---------74:58----------
justifications and rationalizations


---------75:03----------
so once there's something that you feel


---------75:05----------
uncomfortable or you're self-judging


---------75:07----------
about or you're not doing it good enough


---------75:09----------
i know i'm tossing a lot of words at you


---------75:11----------
but like


---------75:12----------
does this sort of make sense


---------75:14----------
and then you avoid that and then once


---------75:16----------
your mind decides emotionally


---------75:19----------
that you want to avoid something once it


---------75:20----------
becomes emotionally untenable then it


---------75:23----------
recruits our intellect to rationalize


---------75:26----------
and justify and then what it tells you


---------75:28----------
is oh by the way like this is more


---------75:30----------
important and this is more fun it is


---------75:32----------
objectively better for me to do youtube


---------75:34----------
than it is to unpack boxes and then it's


---------75:37----------
game over


---------75:38----------
yeah and then you're not going to do it


---------75:40----------
does that make sense yeah this is yeah


---------75:42----------
this is exactly this is exactly what


---------75:43----------
happens yeah right so now let's think a


---------75:46----------
little bit about okay how do we deal


---------75:47----------
with this this resistance so this is why


---------75:50----------
i was asking you kind of like the


---------75:51----------
psychological questions and what we


---------75:52----------
really try to do at healthy gamer it's


---------75:54----------
not about you know digging for like you


---------75:56----------
know deep emotional stuff just for the


---------75:58----------
sake of digging for emotional stuff it's


---------76:00----------
recognizing that you have had particular


---------76:03----------
experiences


---------76:04----------
which are going to create a psychology


---------76:06----------
that you'll be like vulnerable to that


---------76:09----------
will control you in particular ways so


---------76:11----------
the real thing that i would advise you


---------76:13----------
to do is the next time you try to pack a


---------76:15----------
box


---------76:16----------
look for this part of the script in your


---------76:19----------
mind telling you not to


---------76:21----------
right and as long as you see that script


---------76:24----------
and then you ask yourself you know why


---------76:26----------
can't i


---------76:27----------
and now we're going to get to a stretch


---------76:29----------
because i don't know if this is actually


---------76:30----------
the case but like i would imagine that


---------76:32----------
you feel somewhat stupid


---------76:34----------
for


---------76:36----------
when you try to unpack a box


---------76:39----------
yeah


---------76:40----------
and and then what happens is like you've


---------76:42----------
got this remember this crap up here


---------76:44----------
about self-judgment and like devaluing


---------76:46----------
the way that you feel then we get into


---------76:48----------
problem number three is that you feel


---------76:49----------
stupid


---------76:51----------
for not being able to unpack a box


---------76:53----------
and then what you say is i shouldn't


---------76:55----------
feel stupid


---------77:00----------
you know this is dumb like i shouldn't


---------77:02----------
feel this way and then when you devalue


---------77:04----------
this feeling you're like ignoring it and


---------77:06----------
once you ignore a particular feeling


---------77:08----------
like you can't deal with it it's sort of


---------77:10----------
like you know if i'm getting aggroed by


---------77:12----------
a mob and i'm like the mob isn't there


---------77:14----------
it's stupid there shouldn't be like this


---------77:16----------
thing shouldn't spawn in this zone it's


---------77:18----------
dumb it shouldn't be there but does it


---------77:20----------
stop the mob from like


---------77:22----------
messing you up right so when you devalue


---------77:24----------
your emotions


---------77:26----------
they start to go like kind of dormant


---------77:29----------
in a sense or invisible is maybe a


---------77:31----------
better word


---------77:32----------
and then what they do is they fuel this


---------77:34----------
resistance


---------77:35----------
because most of the resistance that we


---------77:37----------
have to things is actually like


---------77:39----------
emotional


---------77:41----------
and if as long as you're devaluing it


---------77:43----------
not taking that feeling of stupid like


---------77:45----------
seriously it's gonna like mask itself


---------77:48----------
and it'll just manifest as resistance to


---------77:51----------
you doing a task


---------77:53----------
does that make sense


---------77:54----------
yeah yep so i know it sounds kind of


---------77:56----------
weird but like i would start with first


---------77:59----------
of all like the next time you feel like


---------78:01----------
you shouldn't feel a certain way like


---------78:03----------
try to stop yourself


---------78:05----------
like notice that you know even though


---------78:07----------
you're lucky and you've got 8 million


---------78:09----------
subscribers it doesn't mean that your


---------78:11----------
life isn't stressful


---------78:13----------
right it's okay for you to feel stressed


---------78:15----------
it's okay for you to feel isolated it's


---------78:17----------
okay for you to feel alone do other


---------78:18----------
people have it worse than you do yes but


---------78:21----------
just because someone else got you know


---------78:24----------
you know like just because bad things


---------78:26----------
are happening to other people doesn't


---------78:27----------
mean that like bad things aren't going


---------78:29----------
to happen to you


---------78:30----------
and


---------78:31----------
you know the the guy who found it


---------78:32----------
started buddhism this guy named buddha


---------78:35----------
buddha


---------78:36----------
had a really interesting revelation that


---------78:37----------
i think we've forgotten despite all of


---------78:40----------
the propagation of like mindfulness and


---------78:41----------
eastern wisdom nowadays which is he said


---------78:44----------
that like dukkha or suffering is like a


---------78:46----------
constant in life


---------78:48----------
that like no amount of privilege or


---------78:50----------
power actually


---------78:52----------
will like protect you from suffering


---------78:54----------
that suffering comes it's sort of like


---------78:56----------
an internal thing and sure there's like


---------78:59----------
definitely advantages to having


---------79:00----------
privilege right like there's like lower


---------79:02----------
levels of stress and health outcomes are


---------79:04----------
improved for people who have like


---------79:05----------
financial security and things like that


---------79:07----------
there are a lot of advantages but the


---------79:08----------
interesting thing is that i don't know


---------79:09----------
that suffering is what we protect from


---------79:13----------
and so one of the the hardest things


---------79:15----------
that i try to do is for people who are


---------79:17----------
lucky in a lot of ways trying to get


---------79:19----------
them to accept their suffering like you


---------79:22----------
can be lucky and still suffer that kind


---------79:23----------
of goes back to the dialectic where like


---------79:25----------
someone can be angry at you and still


---------79:27----------
love you right but it can be hard to


---------79:29----------
hold both of those things like i'm


---------79:30----------
incredibly lucky and i also have a lot


---------79:33----------
to be stressed out about right like just


---------79:35----------
because i'm lucky and i'm privileged


---------79:36----------
doesn't mean that like i don't get to


---------79:39----------
feel stress and doesn't mean that i


---------79:41----------
don't deserve compassion from other


---------79:43----------
human beings or myself


---------79:46----------
does that make sense


---------79:48----------
yeah


---------79:49----------
questions


---------79:51----------
um


---------79:53----------
no i mean that all that is yeah that is


---------79:55----------
exactly what happens and why i struggle


---------79:57----------
to do a lot of things


---------79:59----------
um and i've i've


---------80:01----------
tried to take some steps to like get


---------80:03----------
better at things so like i have


---------80:05----------
i have like i have like a notebook where


---------80:06----------
i like write down a to-do list every day


---------80:08----------
and i i noticed that like the more i


---------80:11----------
break everything down


---------80:12----------
uh you know like whatever the task like


---------80:14----------
unpack boxes instead of that it's like


---------80:16----------
unpack these boxes or whatever like


---------80:18----------
i break the list down


---------80:20----------
as minimal as i can i even put in things


---------80:22----------
like eat or like shower or and it just


---------80:24----------
feels good to cross stuff off like i've


---------80:26----------
been doing that recently that's been


---------80:28----------
super helpful


---------80:29----------
um but yeah is


---------80:31----------
what you just described is exactly what


---------80:33----------
happens so so you stumbled upon


---------80:36----------
operationalizing because then that


---------80:38----------
abstract problem in your mind


---------80:40----------
you're chunking up


---------80:42----------
and then when you chunk it up it's like


---------80:44----------
more manageable so the other other thing


---------80:47----------
and the last thing that i'm going to


---------80:48----------
kind of i'm going to share one other


---------80:49----------
principle with you which is cognitive


---------80:51----------
ram


---------80:53----------
so


---------80:54----------
you know you you kind of said at the


---------80:55----------
very beginning of our interview like the


---------80:57----------
more stuff that piles up on your to-do


---------80:59----------
list


---------81:00----------
the more


---------81:01----------
i should be able to like


---------81:03----------
you know like the more


---------81:06----------
the bigger my to-do list is the the


---------81:08----------
higher it should increase in urgency


---------81:11----------
and since urgency is a motivator i


---------81:13----------
should be able to act does that make


---------81:15----------
sense


---------81:16----------
yeah and i also get that get tones of


---------81:18----------
this when you talk about the increased


---------81:20----------
amount of responsibility with age


---------81:23----------
which i think you're actually quite


---------81:24----------
scared of i think you're afraid that now


---------81:26----------
i'm hypothesizing okay so i'm i'm i'm


---------81:29----------
hypothesizing that there's a part of you


---------81:31----------
that's actually pretty scared that


---------81:33----------
soon enough things will get so bad that


---------81:35----------
you won't be able to handle it


---------81:38----------
um


---------81:39----------
and we don't we don't have to go down


---------81:40----------
that route but


---------81:41----------
just something for you to think about


---------81:42----------
possibly yeah um but so you kind of


---------81:45----------
think as urgency increases i should be


---------81:47----------
able to do something there's the


---------81:48----------
self-judgment by the way


---------81:50----------
see that


---------81:51----------
but the interesting thing is that our


---------81:53----------
brain


---------81:54----------
has like a certain amount of cognitive


---------81:56----------
ram


---------81:57----------
and so like if your mind is holding on


---------82:00----------
to like 10 tasks that you need to manage


---------82:03----------
then you only have this much like


---------82:05----------
working ram


---------82:07----------
and then something interesting happens


---------82:09----------
is that if we only have two tasks that


---------82:11----------
we have to remember then we have this


---------82:13----------
much working ram


---------82:14----------
and so people think that as the number


---------82:16----------
of tasks increases the urgency should


---------82:19----------
increase and i should be able to do like


---------82:21----------
it should like push me to do things but


---------82:24----------
actually what i found and one of my


---------82:26----------
you know meditation teachers told me


---------82:28----------
this like really kind of really


---------82:29----------
interesting is that like the more stuff


---------82:32----------
that your mind has to hold on to it's


---------82:34----------
sort of like you know i can't fix


---------82:36----------
something if i have my hands full


---------82:38----------
right i can't actually do any work if i


---------82:40----------
have my hands full so what you really


---------82:42----------
want to do is try to empty your mind and


---------82:44----------
then the more working memory you have


---------82:46----------
like the more you'll be able to do


---------82:50----------
tasks does that make sense


---------82:53----------
yeah


---------82:54----------
and so this is why if you look at it


---------82:56----------
like if i have ten tasks to do and i


---------82:58----------
complete one


---------83:01----------
is nine tasks easier or harder than ten


---------83:04----------
tasks


---------83:05----------
yeah easier right so we what people


---------83:07----------
notice is like there's the snowball


---------83:08----------
effect of like you know 10 is taking up


---------83:11----------
this much space and then nine is taking


---------83:13----------
up this much space and then eight is


---------83:15----------
taking up this much space and so what


---------83:16----------
people find is once they start checking


---------83:18----------
things off their to-do list it frees up


---------83:20----------
more of your mind and then you have more


---------83:22----------
ram to actually work on the remaining


---------83:24----------
tasks


---------83:26----------
that's just something for you to kind of


---------83:28----------
think about it's another principle that


---------83:29----------
i found


---------83:32----------
questions


---------83:34----------
um


---------83:35----------
no i no this all makes a lot of sense um


---------83:38----------
the cognitive uh ram thing is pretty


---------83:40----------
like i i always use the term mental


---------83:42----------
bandwidth so i have something that's


---------83:43----------
like the exact same thing yeah yep yep


---------83:46----------
yeah yeah i definitely get like periods


---------83:48----------
where i feel like


---------83:49----------
i can't handle like i don't like someone


---------83:51----------
will message me or something with


---------83:52----------
something and i just my brain was i


---------83:54----------
can't handle it like i just don't have


---------83:56----------
a mental bandwidth like


---------83:58----------
address this new thing


---------84:00----------
when i'm worried about all these other


---------84:01----------
things


---------84:02----------
makes perfect sense


---------84:04----------
yeah that's another that's another part


---------84:06----------
of all this i guess is like


---------84:08----------
not responding to people right away like


---------84:10----------
i feel like you know if i have enough


---------84:12----------
things to do and someone has something


---------84:14----------
else they need from me or whatever it


---------84:15----------
may be


---------84:17----------
as simple as it might be i brush it off


---------84:19----------
until it's like i don't even have like i


---------84:21----------
can't even think about that right now


---------84:22----------
like i have to worry about these things


---------84:23----------
or whatever


---------84:24----------
yeah so there's two other if you're


---------84:27----------
curious um you know there's a little bit


---------84:29----------
like there's a couple of other


---------84:31----------
interesting things about mental ram


---------84:33----------
so


---------84:35----------
i'm gonna just share um


---------84:37----------
two perspectives okay


---------84:39----------
so one of my teachers in in india once


---------84:41----------
told me that like every task that is


---------84:44----------
left on complete


---------84:45----------
is a karmic drain


---------84:48----------
and so what he means by that is like you


---------84:50----------
know if you have i don't know if this is


---------84:51----------
really true but he was kind of saying


---------84:53----------
that like you know if you have an


---------84:54----------
intention you make a promise to someone


---------84:56----------
and you don't keep that promise


---------84:58----------
it sort of karmically like drains your


---------85:00----------
energy because you still have like that


---------85:02----------
incomplete task to do and so i thought


---------85:04----------
that it was like kind of an interesting


---------85:06----------
example of like the more things on your


---------85:08----------
to-do list you have the harder it is to


---------85:10----------
do things


---------85:11----------
and so what he was kind of saying is as


---------85:13----------
you go back and you you sort of complete


---------85:16----------
all of your karmic tasks as you complete


---------85:18----------
those karmas and you become like


---------85:19----------
spiritually free from it what it


---------85:21----------
actually does is like gives you


---------85:23----------
spiritual energy and then eventually


---------85:25----------
you'll start like manifesting success


---------85:27----------
that's kind of a weird spiritual


---------85:28----------
perspective that i think sort of maps


---------85:30----------
onto cognitive ram in some way and the


---------85:32----------
other really interesting evidence-based


---------85:34----------
perspective is alcoholics anonymous


---------85:37----------
and in alcoholics anonymous so


---------85:39----------
alcoholics anonymous is really


---------85:40----------
interesting because it seems to be like


---------85:42----------
a good intervention


---------85:44----------
you know in some ways it like helping


---------85:45----------
people overcome like this biological


---------85:48----------
addiction and so if you think about it


---------85:50----------
like you know how does that work we


---------85:51----------
don't really know but alcoholics


---------85:53----------
anonymous when i talk to people who are


---------85:55----------
trying to get sober they talk about um


---------85:58----------
one particular


---------85:59----------
step which helps them a lot and that's


---------86:02----------
the making of men's step


---------86:04----------
and so what they do is like they've done


---------86:05----------
all of this bad crap in the past and


---------86:08----------
something about all of that like


---------86:10----------
emotional energy creates some degree of


---------86:12----------
resistance in avoidance in their mind


---------86:15----------
that then causes them to chase alcohol


---------86:17----------
and the ones who do really really well


---------86:19----------
are the ones who do the making amends


---------86:21----------
step so like literally what they do is


---------86:23----------
they'll go and they'll like apologize to


---------86:25----------
like random people from 10 years ago


---------86:27----------
when they were drinking and when they


---------86:28----------
were an and they go back and


---------86:30----------
they just like try to set things right


---------86:32----------
they don't necessarily have to you know


---------86:34----------
fix everything they don't have to like


---------86:35----------
go back and graduate from college but


---------86:37----------
they go through this mental process of


---------86:38----------
thinking about you know who's everyone


---------86:40----------
that i've screwed over like what are all


---------86:42----------
the bad things that i've done and then


---------86:44----------
they go and they try to track those


---------86:45----------
people down they say hey i'm sorry for


---------86:46----------
doing that and something really cool


---------86:48----------
happens which is that when they go


---------86:50----------
through this making amends phase


---------86:52----------
something happens with their cognitive


---------86:54----------
ram and they're much more able to sort


---------86:56----------
of like control their alcohol and like


---------86:59----------
resist its impulses so i think these are


---------87:01----------
just sort of two really interesting


---------87:02----------
observations from other dimensions based


---------87:05----------
on that kind of relate to mental


---------87:06----------
bandwidth unclear what's sort of


---------87:08----------
scientifically valid and what isn't it's


---------87:10----------
just interesting when there's you know


---------87:11----------
three different perspectives that are


---------87:13----------
all kind of speaking to the same thing


---------87:15----------
does that make sense


---------87:17----------
yeah


---------87:18----------
um but it's really fascinating that you


---------87:20----------
know the science the neuroscience and


---------87:21----------
psychology of how alcoholics anonymous


---------87:23----------
works


---------87:24----------
um


---------87:25----------
okay so other thoughts or questions


---------87:29----------
um


---------87:31----------
no um


---------87:34----------
i think


---------87:36----------
i think i also prioritize like doing


---------87:39----------
things for others before


---------87:41----------
myself when it comes to like like that


---------87:43----------
kind of ties back to the relationship


---------87:44----------
thing yeah in terms of like if i have


---------87:46----------
something


---------87:47----------
super simple that i need done but you


---------87:49----------
know a friend of mine or something has


---------87:50----------
something super simple that they need


---------87:52----------
done like that always like is something


---------87:53----------
that takes priority too


---------87:55----------
um


---------87:56----------
yeah bro so you really gotta work on


---------87:59----------
not devaluing yourself


---------88:01----------
yeah


---------88:03----------
i totally get that


---------88:05----------
right because relationships is up here


---------88:07----------
and yeah like i like i i


---------88:10----------
tyler is not necessarily that i like i


---------88:11----------
prioritize other people more of just


---------88:13----------
like i'd rather


---------88:14----------
let myself down you know than like let


---------88:16----------
someone else down you know what i mean


---------88:17----------
like if i have someone who expects


---------88:18----------
something from me


---------88:20----------
that's definitely like yeah


---------88:23----------
so i i it's classic tyler because if a


---------88:25----------
friend asked you hey tyler this saturday


---------88:27----------
can you help me move in you'd be like


---------88:29----------
absolutely bro


---------88:31----------
yeah all right


---------88:33----------
you'll help someone else unpack boxes at


---------88:35----------
the drop of a hat


---------88:37----------
really common


---------88:39----------
really really common


---------88:40----------
it's just because you're a good person


---------88:42----------
but there's a there's an interesting


---------88:43----------
part of that which is that so here's


---------88:45----------
kind of what i would summarize for you


---------88:46----------
tyler it sounds like you've already


---------88:48----------
started to figure out how to


---------88:49----------
operationalize that will help you unpack


---------88:51----------
your boxes


---------88:52----------
when you think about unpacking a box be


---------88:54----------
careful because watch i want you to look


---------88:57----------
for it okay i want you to like you know


---------89:00----------
place a hidden camera and prepare


---------89:02----------
yourself for like oh this is inefficient


---------89:05----------
and i could do this better i should do


---------89:07----------
this better it would be so much easier


---------89:09----------
if i did it this way look for that


---------89:11----------
thought


---------89:12----------
and then like look for this thought too


---------89:14----------
where i i shouldn't feel stupid this


---------89:16----------
should be easy for me i should be able


---------89:17----------
to handle this


---------89:18----------
because all that crap is going to be


---------89:20----------
devaluing it and as best as you can what


---------89:22----------
i want you to do in that moment is like


---------89:24----------
kind of notice those thoughts and like


---------89:26----------
look for them because they're going to


---------89:27----------
be psychological patterns it's like


---------89:29----------
program it's like malware in your brain


---------89:32----------
so prepare when i open up firefox


---------89:35----------
there's going to be pop-ups telling me


---------89:37----------
to purchase this penis enlargement pill


---------89:40----------
right like you're going to look for it


---------89:42----------
and then if you're prepared for it it's


---------89:44----------
going to be a lot easier to close


---------89:47----------
okay


---------89:48----------
and


---------89:50----------
yeah


---------89:51----------
and then it it you know in a more


---------89:53----------
long-term sense you know if you're


---------89:54----------
interested in seeing a mental health


---------89:56----------
professional i think it could be good


---------89:58----------
you know if you're curious about whether


---------89:59----------
you have adhd or not you could kind of


---------90:00----------
get an evaluation for that but i i think


---------90:03----------
this there's you got to be really


---------90:04----------
careful because you're such a good dude


---------90:06----------
and you recognize that you're so lucky


---------90:08----------
and you have so much gratitude that


---------90:09----------
you're almost kind of skirting right on


---------90:11----------
the edge of what i would call toxic


---------90:13----------
positivity


---------90:14----------
which is like oh my god like i should be


---------90:16----------
grateful like yeah and you are grateful


---------90:18----------
right like the important thing is to be


---------90:19----------
grateful and also be compassionate


---------90:22----------
towards yourself


---------90:23----------
[Music]


---------90:25----------
thoughts


---------90:26----------
questions no that makes sense


---------90:27----------
okay um


---------90:30----------
go ahead


---------90:31----------
nope


---------90:32----------
go for it


---------90:33----------
so you were gonna ask a question yeah i


---------90:35----------
was just gonna ask like how how was this


---------90:37----------
for you like in terms of when we kind of


---------90:39----------
just went through that and like is this


---------90:41----------
like helpful or


---------90:42----------
yeah definitely helpful um i just know


---------90:45----------
that i feel like there's like


---------90:47----------
a lot to unpack i feel like and it's


---------90:50----------
yeah it's just a lot to think about and


---------90:52----------
unpack and


---------90:53----------
i'm still


---------90:55----------
uh you know admittedly like i'm


---------90:56----------
definitely still like a little anxious


---------90:58----------
and nervous about this just like i said


---------90:59----------
opening up in front of you know an


---------91:00----------
audience is something that's like really


---------91:02----------
sure uh difficult and even i feel like


---------91:05----------
even for me more so than like you know a


---------91:07----------
streamer or something like i don't


---------91:08----------
typically stream most of my stuff is


---------91:10----------
just making videos and so like when it


---------91:12----------
comes to my online presence it's just


---------91:14----------
like i said it's just those 10 minutes


---------91:16----------
of funny good times with friends i don't


---------91:18----------
really try to delve into


---------91:19----------
a whole lot of


---------91:21----------
you know behind the scenes kind of


---------91:22----------
personal stuff um


---------91:24----------
it's definitely it's hard for me but


---------91:26----------
yeah so i i kind of noticed that and i


---------91:28----------
think that's totally fine like we don't


---------91:29----------
have to do what's hard for you so this


---------91:32----------
is where it's important tyler i think


---------91:34----------
you doing that work is important it's


---------91:36----------
absolutely not necessary to do live in


---------91:38----------
front of the internet


---------91:40----------
like you know


---------91:43----------
it's about your growth and what you feel


---------91:45----------
comfortable with so i would encourage


---------91:47----------
you to you know spend a little bit i


---------91:48----------
don't know like who you've got in your


---------91:50----------
life but like you know if you want to


---------91:51----------
see a therapist or something that's


---------91:52----------
totally fine otherwise you know i would


---------91:55----------
honestly spend some time like thinking


---------91:56----------
about the first few weeks of fourth


---------91:58----------
grade


---------91:59----------
and what that was like for you and like


---------92:01----------
let yourself


---------92:03----------
almost be like an older brother


---------92:06----------
to your fourth grade self


---------92:08----------
and tell yourself like you know you must


---------92:10----------
have been frightened that you wouldn't


---------92:12----------
make friends like it's


---------92:13----------
terrifying dude like does it happen to a


---------92:16----------
lot of kids yeah like it happened to me


---------92:17----------
too and like i remember


---------92:19----------
how terrifying it was


---------92:21----------
because you didn't know like the second


---------92:23----------
day you went and the third day you went


---------92:24----------
you didn't have friends like you didn't


---------92:26----------
know like does this like am i gonna make


---------92:28----------
a friend on the fourth day


---------92:30----------
it feels like you're never gonna make a


---------92:31----------
friend


---------92:32----------
yeah and so some of those kinds of like


---------92:34----------
thoughts and emotions and stuff like


---------92:36----------
they still carry with you


---------92:39----------
you know and i don't think you need to


---------92:40----------
talk about it here i'm glad you told me


---------92:42----------
you know we talked a little bit about


---------92:43----------
boundaries even even at the beginning


---------92:44----------
but um so i'm glad you sort of said yeah


---------92:46----------
i don't think that would be that useful


---------92:48----------
i think it's actually important for you


---------92:49----------
to do but i don't think you need to go


---------92:50----------
on stream


---------92:51----------
you know this way


---------92:53----------
journal or take a walk or like talk to


---------92:55----------
your dog


---------92:56----------
you know like yeah


---------92:58----------
you know the dog's gonna listen a whole


---------92:59----------
lot right now but yeah no he'll you'll


---------93:01----------
be surprised


---------93:03----------
so you know pet therapy is an


---------93:04----------
evidence-based intervention that helps


---------93:06----------
people with with you know dealing with


---------93:08----------
grief and things like that people live


---------93:10----------
longer


---------93:11----------
pets are awesome at this kind of stuff


---------93:13----------
yeah


---------93:14----------
but i i don't think you need to open up


---------93:16----------
in front of the internet you know we're


---------93:17----------
here to help you and like do whatever


---------93:19----------
meet you where you're at and we're here


---------93:21----------
to help and if it


---------93:22----------
opening up on the internet doesn't have


---------93:23----------
to be a part of it


---------93:25----------
yeah


---------93:27----------
yeah it's just i don't know it's just


---------93:29----------
very hard for me um yeah


---------93:31----------
for whatever reason i don't know


---------93:33----------
if you want to be conscious in that


---------93:34----------
regard i guess yeah sure i mean if you


---------93:37----------
want to we can talk for a second about


---------93:38----------
why it's hard for you but we also don't


---------93:40----------
have to


---------93:41----------
what makes it hard for you


---------93:44----------
uh


---------93:45----------
i don't know i guess just circling back


---------93:47----------
to like what i talked about before is


---------93:48----------
just like caring about how people


---------93:51----------
perceive me and stuff um i mean


---------93:53----------
obviously


---------93:54----------
it's


---------93:55----------
important when it comes to doing youtube


---------93:58----------
like i said to like listen to what


---------94:00----------
people think but at the same time it's


---------94:01----------
like i i


---------94:03----------
you only let in


---------94:05----------
you only show people what you want to


---------94:06----------
show them and


---------94:08----------
i don't know i guess it's just worrying


---------94:09----------
in that regard not funny being judged i


---------94:11----------
guess you know and what are you afraid


---------94:14----------
of what is the judgment that you're


---------94:15----------
afraid will happen if you open up on the


---------94:18----------
internet


---------94:20----------
i don't know


---------94:21----------
i don't know i guess it's probably a


---------94:22----------
little irrational i guess because i


---------94:24----------
don't feel like


---------94:26----------
i don't know


---------94:28----------
hard to explain


---------94:29----------
yeah so i don't think it's irrational


---------94:32----------
so watch out for those kinds of


---------94:33----------
statements


---------94:34----------
right so there you are doing what to


---------94:36----------
yourself


---------94:38----------
uh i guess devaluing yeah i feel a


---------94:40----------
little bit yeah yeah right oh it's


---------94:42----------
stupid for me to feel this way


---------94:44----------
yeah


---------94:45----------
no it's not


---------94:47----------
and and so i i think if you really like


---------94:49----------
look at it like i suspect


---------94:51----------
um


---------94:54----------
you know i don't i don't know how much


---------94:55----------
we want to have this conversation


---------94:56----------
because i think we could get to feelings


---------94:58----------
so we'll just i'll get you started


---------95:00----------
um and and so you know i suspect you


---------95:03----------
know what are you afraid people will


---------95:04----------
think


---------95:05----------
let me just ask you that


---------95:08----------
i don't


---------95:09----------
i'm not afraid of any like one specific


---------95:11----------
thing i guess just


---------95:13----------
like i don't it's not fun to be judged


---------95:15----------
by people who just they don't know you


---------95:17----------
you know and in


---------95:18----------
i'm not i don't feel like i'm the


---------95:20----------
greatest at like articulating how i feel


---------95:22----------
or


---------95:23----------
you know my thoughts a lot of times so


---------95:25----------
maybe someone could have form an opinion


---------95:28----------
about me based on something i said even


---------95:30----------
though what i said is not really


---------95:32----------
how i felt it was just how i happened


---------95:34----------
you know what i mean like how i happen


---------95:35----------
to say it or whatever


---------95:36----------
um


---------95:37----------
[Music]


---------95:38----------
yeah so i know this sounds kind of weird


---------95:40----------
but like


---------95:43----------
that's a very common


---------95:45----------
thing for your profession


---------95:47----------
so it's almost like it's own like i i


---------95:50----------
don't know you know i don't know how


---------95:50----------
much of this is you and how much of this


---------95:52----------
is just being a streamer because like


---------95:54----------
literally what happens on youtube is


---------95:55----------
like people will take a slice


---------95:57----------
of what you're trying to represent and


---------96:00----------
read into it and judge it


---------96:02----------
right so like like people who are on


---------96:04----------
youtube and twitch and tick tock and


---------96:06----------
instagram and stuff like you all get


---------96:08----------
really really you all learn the hard way


---------96:10----------
that like any kind of communication that


---------96:14----------
is unfiltered


---------96:15----------
is like


---------96:17----------
you know letting off a firework inside


---------96:19----------
the house you have no idea where it's


---------96:21----------
gonna end up


---------96:23----------
because you all get punished


---------96:25----------
for being unfiltered


---------96:28----------
um is this something deep and


---------96:29----------
psychological relating to your you know


---------96:31----------
earlier life or is it a function is it


---------96:33----------
like just one of the consequences of


---------96:34----------
your job i'd probably say like 50 50.


---------96:38----------
yeah i would say probably more the


---------96:40----------
second but maybe


---------96:42----------
yeah


---------96:44----------
maybe more the second like i said i've


---------96:45----------
seen it in just about every successful


---------96:47----------
content creator i've ever worked with


---------96:49----------
um so i think that that makes a lot of


---------96:51----------
sense


---------96:53----------
but i think it's you know are you


---------96:55----------
concerned about your inability to open


---------96:57----------
up


---------96:59----------
um


---------96:59----------
a little bit


---------97:01----------
definitely something i've struggled with


---------97:02----------
a lot


---------97:03----------
um


---------97:04----------
what are you concerned about


---------97:08----------
not not i i just don't think it i mean i


---------97:10----------
don't think it's healthy


---------97:11----------
not even about like opening up online


---------97:13----------
but just in general you know like it's


---------97:14----------
good to talk to people and


---------97:16----------
and


---------97:18----------
voice you know your thoughts and


---------97:20----------
feelings


---------97:21----------
um


---------97:22----------
i found myself doing that


---------97:24----------
on twitter at times and i'm like why why


---------97:26----------
of all places would i ever like


---------97:29----------
go to twitter like i don't know


---------97:31----------
what are you looking for when you post


---------97:33----------
on twitter like that i don't know it's


---------97:35----------
more just venting i guess you know just


---------97:37----------
getting something off my chest it's not


---------97:38----------
even like i'm looking for approval from


---------97:40----------
anyone specific or anything it's more of


---------97:42----------
just


---------97:42----------
it's a thought collected and then put


---------97:45----------
out i guess


---------97:46----------
yeah


---------97:48----------
what do you think makes it hard for you


---------97:50----------
to do that even in private


---------97:53----------
um


---------97:54----------
i don't know


---------97:56----------
no idea okay


---------97:58----------
so i'll


---------97:59----------
give you


---------98:02----------
give you some thoughts okay so first of


---------98:04----------
all


---------98:05----------
well actually let's let's


---------98:07----------
one more question so do you feel a


---------98:08----------
little bit incompetent at not being able


---------98:11----------
to do that


---------98:13----------
yeah i would say yeah okay so this is a


---------98:15----------
theme so when i said 50 50.


---------98:17----------
so i i'm noticing a thread


---------98:20----------
that when there's something that you


---------98:22----------
feel like you should do


---------98:25----------
you feel kind of incompetent and then it


---------98:28----------
makes it really hard to do it to begin


---------98:29----------
with


---------98:31----------
so whether that's opening up whether


---------98:33----------
that's unpacking boxes there's something


---------98:35----------
about and and this i think is like now


---------98:37----------
pretty specific


---------98:38----------
to something that you carry with you


---------98:40----------
right because you've got a particular


---------98:42----------
like psychological thing where like


---------98:44----------
you're it's not specific to you by the


---------98:46----------
way tons of people have this which is


---------98:47----------
why we do this online in the first place


---------98:48----------
because i can guarantee you there are


---------98:49----------
like you know hundreds or thousands of


---------98:51----------
people who feel the exact same way and


---------98:53----------
so this is something that's really


---------98:55----------
common is that somewhere along the way


---------98:57----------
our society teaches us that like


---------98:59----------
competent like we we blur the lines


---------99:01----------
between like experience and like talent


---------99:06----------
so i'd say that the reason that it's


---------99:08----------
hard for you to open up is because you


---------99:09----------
haven't had practice


---------99:13----------
yeah it makes sense


---------99:14----------
and so i don't think that you're


---------99:16----------
busted in some way i don't think that


---------99:18----------
there's anything wrong with you i think


---------99:20----------
it's like hard for you to open up


---------99:21----------
because


---------99:22----------
you know you may have just grown up in


---------99:24----------
an environment where there wasn't a


---------99:25----------
whole lot of that you know if we really


---------99:27----------
want to hypothesize like


---------99:30----------
i'd say 20 percent of people with your


---------99:32----------
experience when you were back in the


---------99:33----------
fourth grade i know i keep going back


---------99:35----------
there we don't have to talk about it but


---------99:36----------
i'm trying to copy with stuff yeah you


---------99:38----------
know there's a chance that you had a


---------99:39----------
conversation with your mom and your dad


---------99:41----------
where you said hey i don't like school


---------99:43----------
i'm not making any friends i want to


---------99:44----------
move back


---------99:46----------
and i'd say one out of five people


---------99:48----------
had an experience like that that where


---------99:50----------
their parents said sorry we can't do


---------99:52----------
that and even though it's completely


---------99:53----------
reasonable


---------99:55----------
their answer is completely reasonable it


---------99:57----------
can be psychologically jarring


---------100:00----------
almost like traumatic in a sense


---------100:02----------
and then like people


---------100:04----------
even people who are normal healthy


---------100:06----------
people with happy upbringings


---------100:08----------
we all have things because our minds are


---------100:10----------
underdeveloped so we don't really know


---------100:12----------
how to interpret that stuff and what you


---------100:14----------
can learn in that moment is like opening


---------100:16----------
up to other people like doesn't help


---------100:20----------
and once your mind learns that kind of


---------100:22----------
thing it can be like really hard to open


---------100:24----------
up to other people


---------100:26----------
that makes sense yeah so i'd say lack of


---------100:29----------
practice


---------100:31----------
um you know once again i would notice


---------100:33----------
that self-judgment and and remind


---------100:35----------
yourself that it's okay to not be able


---------100:37----------
to open up


---------100:38----------
you know like even if you're


---------100:40----------
theoretically coming on twitch to open


---------100:42----------
up you know open up you do what


---------100:43----------
you're you do what you're ready for


---------100:46----------
tyler and whatever you do today is


---------100:48----------
perfect there's nothing better that you


---------100:50----------
could do and nothing worse that you


---------100:51----------
could do you're great just the way that


---------100:53----------
you are whatever you've done is awesome


---------100:55----------
which i know may sound like a foreign


---------100:57----------
idea but like really i believe that


---------101:00----------
and practice you know like maybe open up


---------101:03----------
to a therapist or something like that


---------101:04----------
i'd recommend doing it you know


---------101:05----------
privately because i think every


---------101:07----------
advantage to help you in opening up


---------101:09----------
would be a good thing


---------101:10----------
and then the last thing to really think


---------101:11----------
about is have there been times in my


---------101:13----------
life where i've tried to open up to


---------101:16----------
people and it hasn't worked really well


---------101:18----------
and even something that you said about


---------101:20----------
the sensitivity of like you may not be


---------101:22----------
trying to convey something but like you


---------101:24----------
you convey something that then get gets


---------101:26----------
misinterpreted by people so that's a


---------101:28----------
specific fear that you have now i don't


---------101:31----------
know if that fear comes from the


---------101:32----------
internet which is completely reasonable


---------101:34----------
or whether there have been times that


---------101:36----------
have nothing to do with the internet


---------101:37----------
where you've tried to articulate


---------101:38----------
feelings


---------101:39----------
and you've learned hey i'm not very good


---------101:42----------
at this and i'm not able to convey what


---------101:44----------
i want to


---------101:45----------
therefore i'm not going to try


---------101:48----------
so those kinds of experiences could


---------101:50----------
exist in your past as well


---------101:56----------
yeah


---------101:58----------
that makes a lot of sense


---------102:00----------
um


---------102:03----------
yeah i have like now now i'm thinking of


---------102:06----------
exact scenarios yeah that has happened


---------102:08----------
yeah yep


---------102:10----------
um


---------102:12----------
yeah definitely stuff things in school


---------102:16----------
um


---------102:17----------
like where i would get emotional


---------102:19----------
would have you know like i would get


---------102:21----------
made fun of


---------102:22----------
and stuff in school for that you know


---------102:25----------
um


---------102:27----------
yeah that's definitely one thing for


---------102:29----------
sure yeah


---------102:31----------
so i noticed we're coming right up on


---------102:32----------
the edge of emotions


---------102:34----------
and based on some of the boundaries that


---------102:35----------
you've set i'm not gonna ask you about


---------102:37----------
that today


---------102:38----------
i think we're gonna go ahead and wrap up


---------102:40----------
are you okay with that yeah that's


---------102:42----------
perfect okay


---------102:43----------
so so just the connecting the dots is


---------102:46----------
what we're here for not the


---------102:48----------
entertainment value so we're just gonna


---------102:50----------
you know so now that you kind of you


---------102:52----------
know think about those things you can


---------102:53----------
feel that emotion coming up that's that


---------102:56----------
dormant emotion which has been there all


---------102:58----------
along


---------103:00----------
right and as you kind of feel it like i


---------103:01----------
want you to go take a walk with your dog


---------103:03----------
or whatever and like if you want to go


---------103:05----------
cry in the bathroom or whatever you need


---------103:07----------
to do you go and you process your


---------103:09----------
emotions with someone that you care


---------103:11----------
about in a place that you feel safe


---------103:13----------
and then then you'll be able to express


---------103:15----------
it you'll you're on your journey dude


---------103:17----------
you'll get there right


---------103:18----------
you've focused you've invested all of


---------103:20----------
your leveling up points into being an


---------103:22----------
awesome youtube creator


---------103:24----------
and look at how awesome you've done and


---------103:26----------
so you've got this other side of the


---------103:28----------
skill set your character sheet which you


---------103:30----------
need to spend some time work on so work


---------103:32----------
on it you know it's all good bro


---------103:40----------
yeah you're very welcome man no yeah


---------103:42----------
that's been good um


---------103:45----------
yeah i definitely


---------103:46----------
definitely probably should go


---------103:48----------
talk


---------103:49----------
someone and work through a lot of stuff


---------103:51----------
makes a lot of sense yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------103:54----------
you don't have to do it on the internet


---------103:56----------
yeah


---------103:58----------
the purpose of you coming here is to get


---------104:00----------
you to a place where you can go and and


---------104:02----------
you know


---------104:03----------
do it in a place that you feel safe


---------104:05----------
because i think you owe it to yourself


---------104:07----------
and especially i don't the one thing


---------104:08----------
that i really dislike about your thought


---------104:10----------
process is the way that you blame


---------104:12----------
yourself for things that i really don't


---------104:14----------
think are your fault


---------104:16----------
and that it's okay to not be perfect and


---------104:18----------
it's okay to not know how to do stuff


---------104:20----------
like it's just


---------104:21----------
you know you're heavily invested in


---------104:23----------
becoming an awesome youtube creator so


---------104:24----------
cool so you're 28 years old you have a


---------104:27----------
long way to go i have no idea if you're


---------104:28----------
in a relationship or you have kids or


---------104:30----------
things like that


---------104:31----------
but you know as those things become a


---------104:33----------
more important part of your life you


---------104:34----------
should do this kind of work and it'll be


---------104:36----------
awesome like you'll be able to you know


---------104:38----------
