---------00:26----------
awesome yeah I'm nervous but glad to be


---------00:30----------
here yeah so tell us a little bit what


---------00:32----------
do you prefer to be called Jessica or


---------00:33----------
madam Faye Jessica's fine


---------00:36----------
so Jessica tell me help me understand a


---------00:38----------
little bit about what sort of motivated


---------00:40----------
you to come on stream and what we're


---------00:41----------
gonna be talking about today my husband


---------00:45----------
actually watches domination time a lot


---------00:46----------
okay and then he found you through him


---------00:50----------
and he's like I think you would really


---------00:51----------
like this doctor the way he talks about


---------00:54----------
things seems like you would benefit from


---------00:56----------
so I watched a couple videos Mike yeah


---------00:58----------
yeah I really like this and the the big


---------01:01----------
kicker was the interview that you did


---------01:03----------
was Tom and the exchange that you guys


---------01:06----------
had it wasn't just one person talking


---------01:09----------
you guys both talked about things and I


---------01:11----------
really liked the exchange so after I


---------01:14----------
watched that I sent the email okay well


---------01:16----------
thanks for reaching out so what would


---------01:18----------
you like to talk about today I sent an


---------01:24----------
email and I gave a little bit of details


---------01:25----------
and I can kind of try to backtrack a bit


---------01:27----------
yeah I have I have a lot of self


---------01:32----------
judgment that I have struggled with for


---------01:36----------
a long time and I've been trying to make


---------01:42----------
I guess I try to move forward and figure


---------01:45----------
out how to quell the judgment and just


---------01:48----------
have a better a better healthy


---------01:50----------
self-image


---------01:51----------
uh-huh and I'm just I have no idea where


---------01:55----------
to start okay beautiful


---------01:56----------
so I think I already know what your


---------01:58----------
problem is which is that you're trying


---------02:00----------
to quell the self judgment yeah the


---------02:02----------
first thing to point out is that like so


---------02:04----------
sometimes we have thoughts about


---------02:05----------
ourselves and we're critical and and


---------02:07----------
what do you do when you have those


---------02:09----------
critical thoughts about yourselves I


---------02:12----------
mean it personally it sort of depends on


---------02:15----------
the day sometimes they just keep going


---------02:17----------
other times I'm like no you're you're


---------02:19----------
better than that you're worth more than


---------02:20----------
that yeah that you need to stop doing


---------02:22----------
that and let's go and do something


---------02:24----------
different yeah and so if I were to put


---------02:28----------
it and we'll go into more details but I


---------02:29----------
just kind of want to outline things for


---------02:31----------
the people who are watching so the first


---------02:32----------
thing is like you fight against them


---------02:34----------
right so it's a battle yes and do you


---------02:38----------
know who wins when you fight against


---------02:40----------
yourself probably no one absolutely


---------02:43----------
right so that's the first thing to


---------02:45----------
understand is that like when you fight


---------02:47----------
against yourself you just can't win


---------02:49----------
there's like there's no winning because


---------02:50----------
like you're gonna lose and you're gonna


---------02:52----------
win like that's just and I think this is


---------02:54----------
what happens with self judgment is like


---------02:56----------
I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions


---------02:58----------
okay Jessica so do you feel like every


---------03:00----------
day


---------03:00----------
so you're you're not fighting against


---------03:02----------
like you're you're in a war against


---------03:04----------
yourself yeah is that what it feels like


---------03:07----------
yes and it's a kind of a war of


---------03:09----------
attrition yeah and there are some days


---------03:12----------
that you win battles but you're not


---------03:15----------
making progress in the war no it's just


---------03:18----------
it never stops


---------03:19----------
yeah so I want to just point out to you


---------03:22----------
that like you can't like you can


---------03:23----------
overcome that judgment temporarily but


---------03:26----------
over time like like that takes a lot of


---------03:28----------
energy when you overcome it right yes


---------03:31----------
and then eventually like there's gonna


---------03:33----------
be a day I understand do you have kids


---------03:34----------
yes yeah so like how many kids you have


---------03:37----------
I have two girls and one of them is


---------03:39----------
almost three and the other ones one and


---------03:41----------
a half yes so like when you have two


---------03:43----------
young kids at home you're just gonna


---------03:45----------
lose battles of discipline and


---------03:47----------
motivation because kids just take an


---------03:49----------
unbelievable amount of energy investment


---------03:51----------
you've got nothing left for yourself


---------03:53----------
that's very true and so we've got a


---------03:56----------
think about how can we change the way in


---------03:58----------
which you talk to yourself that is a why


---------04:03----------
we're calling absolutely we're talking


---------04:04----------
today why don't we start by telling can


---------04:07----------
you tell me a little bit about how long


---------04:08----------
you've been judging yourself ever since


---------04:11----------
I can remember


---------04:12----------
okay so what do you remember like when


---------04:14----------
you were let's say like in middle school


---------04:17----------
um


---------04:18----------
middle school I wanted to be part of


---------04:22----------
like the popular kids group uh-huh and I


---------04:24----------
did my best to socialize but those


---------04:27----------
people but I could never really find


---------04:28----------
common ground with them uh-huh and I


---------04:31----------
kind of figured that they just didn't


---------04:32----------
like me okay and so did you think this


---------04:36----------
is gonna sound so the first thing to


---------04:38----------
think about is that you you tried to be


---------04:41----------
something so did you try really hard to


---------04:45----------
get them to like you at the time I


---------04:50----------
probably thought I tried really hard but


---------04:52----------
looking back I don't think I did I think


---------04:55----------
when I met rejection I just kind of


---------04:57----------
withdrew from the whole thing okay I


---------04:59----------
didn't really put forth a lot of effort


---------05:02----------
after that uh-huh and and what do you


---------05:04----------
think it was that make you withdrew was


---------05:06----------
wrong I'm not sure how to handle


---------05:09----------
rejection


---------05:11----------
okay.i it makes me have a worst self


---------05:16----------
judgment and I just I don't know how to


---------05:19----------
reconcile that I don't know how to


---------05:20----------
accept rejection okay I'm gonna just


---------05:27----------
think about that for a second okay this


---------05:29----------
is gonna sound kind of weird but are you


---------05:30----------
sure you don't accept rejection too much


---------05:33----------
I guess that's a possibility right so if


---------05:38----------
you're telling me that when when someone


---------05:39----------
rejects like let me let me put it to you


---------05:41----------
this way like let's say that I go to a


---------05:43----------
used-car salesman and the used-car


---------05:46----------
salesman says hey I'd like you to buy


---------05:48----------
this car and I say no if that person


---------05:51----------
doesn't accept rejection what are they


---------05:52----------
gonna do um still fight for you to buy


---------05:57----------
that even though you've said no exactly


---------05:59----------
but what I'm hearing you say is that you


---------06:01----------
actually don't do that right when when


---------06:04----------
they turn away what you're actually


---------06:05----------
saying is that when they shut you down


---------06:07----------
you don't try hard enough


---------06:09----------
yeah bizarre way it sounds to me like


---------06:11----------
you actually accept rejection way too


---------06:13----------
easily I never thought about that but


---------06:16----------
yeah how does that feel when I say that


---------06:18----------
like does that resonate is that what


---------06:20----------
could be going on it's a definitely a


---------06:25----------
new idea and yes it does resonate okay


---------06:28----------
so now like so this is why people don't


---------06:30----------
move forward because their conception of


---------06:33----------
what's wrong with them is actually wrong


---------06:34----------
because good diagnosis precedes good


---------06:37----------
treatment and so here you are saying


---------06:39----------
that you don't accept rejection easily


---------06:42----------
enough but I think like the problem here


---------06:44----------
is that you accept it too easily and


---------06:46----------
that's what traps you you see that yeah


---------06:49----------
and so what we have to teach you how to


---------06:52----------
do is actually do the very thing so if


---------06:54----------
you think that you're running a certain


---------06:56----------
play but you're actually running an


---------06:57----------
opposite play if you think you're


---------06:58----------
playing a passing game do you watch


---------07:00----------
football okay do you understand off


---------07:04----------
about it to follow you okay so like if I


---------07:06----------
think I'm running a passing game but I'm


---------07:08----------
actually running a running game and


---------07:10----------
that's not working like what I need to


---------07:13----------
do is like get like improve my passing


---------07:14----------
game but your does that make sense like


---------07:16----------
you're actually you're you think you're


---------07:18----------
doing the thing that you're not doing so


---------07:19----------
no wonder it's not working because you


---------07:21----------
think you're doing something entirely


---------07:22----------
different Yeah right


---------07:24----------
so


---------07:24----------
and weird so now we get to a real


---------07:26----------
question right so which is why do you


---------07:28----------
accept rejection so easily so if we talk


---------07:33----------
about confidence now this is making


---------07:36----------
sense because the problem here is that


---------07:39----------
when someone rejects you you take you


---------07:42----------
you value their opinion over what you


---------07:45----------
feel yourself does that make sense yes


---------07:48----------
are you getting emotional I get


---------07:50----------
emotional when I talk about that stuff


---------07:52----------
yes I do what are you feeling


---------07:59----------
that what you're saying is the truth and


---------08:02----------
it's hard to accept


---------08:05----------
what's hard to accept about it that I


---------08:18----------
don't value myself enough absolutely


---------08:24----------
right so that's beautiful I mean not


---------08:27----------
it's not beautiful that you know


---------08:28----------
yourself enough what I think is


---------08:30----------
beautiful it's like I don't have to


---------08:32----------
explain the rest of it to you right so


---------08:33----------
here I in my mind I had started out with


---------08:35----------
this kind of whole map of like getting


---------08:38----------
you to the conclusion that you don't


---------08:39----------
value yourself and isn't as much as you


---------08:41----------
need to but you figure that power cut


---------08:43----------
out all on your own yeah I do that you


---------08:47----------
do what you figure things out on your


---------08:49----------
own good yeah makes our life easy makes


---------08:54----------
my life easy I do a lot of self


---------08:57----------
introspection and try to understand why


---------09:00----------
I do the things that I do but you know


---------09:04----------
if I was thinking that I was doing one


---------09:06----------
thing and I'm doing another it makes a


---------09:08----------
lot of sense while I could figure this


---------09:09----------
one out of my own yeah and so I want you


---------09:12----------
to be really careful here because when


---------09:15----------
you're not able to figure things out on


---------09:16----------
your own


---------09:17----------
you're probably judging yourself for not


---------09:20----------
being able to fix yourself yeah right


---------09:24----------
all the time and that in turn makes you


---------09:28----------
feel more and more like a piece of [ __ ]


---------09:30----------
which in turn makes it easier for you to


---------09:34----------
be rejected because deep down you don't


---------09:37----------
believe that you're worthy of being


---------09:39----------
accepted yep now what are we gonna do


---------09:44----------
about that consider this as a new


---------09:54----------
information and got to put some kind of


---------09:58----------
action into play in here about incorrect


---------10:01----------
it correct correct we're not gonna wear


---------10:04----------
action is not where you're you're going


---------10:07----------
wrong Jessica okay right like where


---------10:10----------
you're going wrong is like so you're


---------10:13----------
hurt you don't have confidence in


---------10:15----------
yourself


---------10:17----------
so let me ask you a question so you have


---------10:19----------
a three-year-old right boy or girl yes


---------10:21----------
two girls okay so you've got a


---------10:23----------
three-year-old girl when she has a


---------10:26----------
problem with confidence what do you do


---------10:29----------
do you implement an action plan to build


---------10:32----------
her confidence well we have really


---------10:36----------
haven't had any issues with that that


---------10:38----------
I've seen just okay but I think what I


---------10:42----------
would do would be just to sit down and


---------10:45----------
talk to her about what's going on and


---------10:47----------
why she feels that way yeah and you know


---------10:50----------
what that's probably not what you do to


---------10:53----------
yourself what I guess is that you tell


---------10:56----------
yourself hey I need to be more confident


---------11:00----------
and I need to get my [ __ ] [ __ ] in


---------11:02----------
order and and I need to stop feeling


---------11:05----------
this way and I need to implement actions


---------11:07----------
to change the person that I am how would


---------11:11----------
that work with your kid she wouldn't


---------11:14----------
understand what I was telling her yes


---------11:18----------
and so I think what you need to learn is


---------11:21----------
like how to talk to yourself and instead


---------11:25----------
of like being you know instead of being


---------11:27----------
so corrective be a little bit


---------11:30----------
compassionate yeah are you nice to


---------11:35----------
yourself


---------11:39----------
okay so I could ask you why aren't you


---------11:45----------
nice to yourself but I don't think


---------11:48----------
that's actually a productive question


---------11:49----------
I'm gonna ask you a different question


---------11:51----------
and stuff instead when did you learn and


---------11:53----------
this can be hard to answer so we can you


---------11:55----------
know I can ask this a bunch of ways when


---------11:57----------
did you learn that you're not worth


---------11:59----------
being nice to that is a kind of a long


---------12:08----------
story there we go so let's hear right I


---------12:12----------
might be able to sit so it's not know


---------12:15----------
cute a whole hour we don't need to


---------12:17----------
condense and just start okay see it like


---------12:20----------
let me pause for a second so I want to


---------12:22----------
point something out to you so when you


---------12:24----------
say that you want to condense it that's


---------12:27----------
the problem like you're not letting


---------12:30----------
yourself like you're saying that my


---------12:32----------
story needs to be condensed you're not


---------12:35----------
accepting what the actual like you're


---------12:37----------
like what you need to do in that moment


---------12:39----------
is not condense it right you need to you


---------12:42----------
need to accept like who you are fully


---------12:44----------
and that the reason you are this way is


---------12:47----------
like long and complicated and that like


---------12:50----------
cliff notes is not like there's a part


---------12:52----------
of you that says oh I need to do the


---------12:54----------
Cliff Notes version because everyone


---------12:56----------
else you know I'm not worth their time


---------12:58----------
and we have more important things to


---------13:01----------
talk like you see how you're doing that


---------13:02----------
it's so [ __ ] it's automatic like oh


---------13:04----------
like the Cliff Notes version because I'm


---------13:06----------
not worth it like I'm not worth the full


---------13:08----------
hour I need to condense things so that


---------13:11----------
we can move on to the action plan yes so


---------13:16----------
it's so automatic it's like insidious


---------13:18----------
because it it's you become your default


---------13:20----------
programming so we're gonna stop right


---------13:22----------
there


---------13:22----------
and I want you to notice that when you


---------13:24----------
like try to condense it what you're


---------13:26----------
actually doing is like invalidating


---------13:28----------
yourself okay


---------13:30----------
so let's hear the long version my


---------13:37----------
parents got divorced when I was little I


---------13:39----------
would say probably five or six not sure


---------13:42----------
about the timeframe on that but


---------13:48----------
my dad got remarried 98 ish I think I


---------13:53----------
was 10 or 11 and a middle-school


---------13:58----------
actually about that time I started


---------14:01----------
noticing some different things when we


---------14:03----------
would visit my dad on the weekend like I


---------14:06----------
would have just gotten out of the shower


---------14:08----------
at mom's house getting ready to go to


---------14:10----------
dad's house and get the car and he first


---------14:12----------
thing he says to me is you you need to


---------14:15----------
get the shower soon as we get there my


---------14:17----------
hair is still wet why do I need to get


---------14:19----------
in the shower we get there we can't sit


---------14:21----------
on the furniture I have a stepsister who


---------14:24----------
lived with them but she can sit on the


---------14:26----------
furniture she can come upstairs out of


---------14:28----------
the designated play room or play area


---------14:31----------
that they had but my brother and I we


---------14:33----------
had to stay down there I would want to


---------14:36----------
go to school dances and junior high we


---------14:39----------
weren't I wasn't allowed to do that if I


---------14:42----------
still wanted to go to Dad's house


---------14:43----------
because it was his time I was interested


---------14:47----------
in religion at a very early age and I


---------14:52----------
got interested in more alternative


---------14:55----------
religions and brought that to him the


---------15:00----------
biggest memory about that conversation


---------15:01----------
that I have is you're going to hell


---------15:04----------
because I'm not interested in the same


---------15:06----------
things that he's interested in it he


---------15:10----------
would call and I actually stopped going


---------15:15----------
to his house after a while because there


---------15:17----------
were just so many small little things


---------15:19----------
that ended up just piling up like this


---------15:21----------
and I would tell him I'm not I'm not


---------15:24----------
coming I'm not coming to your house so


---------15:26----------
he would call and we would try to have


---------15:28----------
these phone conversations to figure out


---------15:30----------
why I don't want to go to his house


---------15:32----------
anymore


---------15:32----------
and they would go nowhere he would say


---------15:36----------
things like well you don't have any


---------15:38----------
opinions of your own they're all your


---------15:40----------
mother's opinions I'm the adult you're


---------15:44----------
the child you need to do what I say sort


---------15:46----------
of thing my mom you know she'd sit there


---------15:51----------
with me well I have these conversations


---------15:52----------
on the phone with dad she do her best to


---------15:55----------
just be there for me and then after


---------15:57----------
these conversations were over she you


---------16:00----------
know I understand what's going on here


---------16:02----------
you you probably should still go to your


---------16:04----------
dad's but she would never force me to do


---------16:07----------
anything like that because she she could


---------16:09----------
see what was happening my brother still


---------16:13----------
went to my father's house and I'm not


---------16:20----------
sure what his time was like when he was


---------16:22----------
there but after a while my mom told me


---------16:25----------
that when he was there the dad would


---------16:28----------
just be like well why isn't your sister


---------16:30----------
coming over my brother and I have a


---------16:32----------
terrible relationship we are civil to


---------16:35----------
each other we show up at family events


---------16:37----------
but we were not close at all there's


---------16:41----------
there's no one to be close either like


---------16:45----------
neither one of us really want to go


---------16:46----------
further and try to mean closer I to this


---------16:55----------
day I don't have a want to have a


---------16:57----------
relationship with my father I will


---------16:59----------
answer his phone calls talk about


---------17:03----------
whatever it is he's called to talk about


---------17:04----------
I don't do holidays with him and my


---------17:09----------
daughter turned one in June we had a


---------17:13----------
small birthday at our house I did not


---------17:15----------
call to invite him and I did not feel


---------17:19----------
guilty about that it felt like a relief


---------17:22----------
I don't have a want to be closer to him


---------17:27----------
I have a want to figure out how to just


---------17:31----------
be okay with what happened yeah so damn


---------17:37----------
essica thank you so much there's so much


---------17:39----------
there I imagine twitch chat is exploding


---------17:43----------
right now but I can't see them so that's


---------17:44----------
probably good so and you shouldn't watch


---------17:47----------
them either


---------17:47----------
no watching try I'm not good so Jessica


---------17:51----------
my first question I'm gonna ask kind of


---------17:53----------
weird questions okay the first thing


---------17:55----------
that I want to point out is like do you


---------17:58----------
feel so why don't you feel guilty for


---------18:01----------
treating your dad the way that you do


---------18:08----------
because I did feel guilty about it for a


---------18:10----------
long time because you know he's your dad


---------18:12----------
you should be close to your dad and I I


---------18:15----------
think I did try for a little while to


---------18:19----------
figure out how to make some type of


---------18:21----------
relationship work but it just stressed


---------18:24----------
me out it made me feel worse it never


---------18:26----------
made me feel better


---------18:27----------
uh-huh so I don't give it that effort


---------18:29----------
anymore beautiful so if you want to fit


---------18:32----------
I'm sorry did you want to say something


---------18:33----------
else I was gonna say that something that


---------18:36----------
he didn't really talk about is another


---------18:39----------
thing that he would say to me my


---------18:41----------
stepmother is biracial he would tell me


---------18:44----------
that I don't want to come over because


---------18:45----------
I'm racist he would say things like that


---------18:48----------
as well


---------18:48----------
and I actually tried to have a direct


---------18:50----------
conversation with her a little over a


---------18:53----------
year ago uh-huh


---------18:54----------
I have the conversation on my phone


---------18:57----------
still and I don't know how to explain it


---------18:59----------
other than she still wanted to treat me


---------19:03----------
like I was 12 years old and that


---------19:05----------
everything that I did was wrong and she


---------19:07----------
had no fault of her own and anything


---------19:10----------
that happened and I asked my father to


---------19:13----------
read that conversation and I asked him


---------19:16----------
if we could have a discussion about the


---------19:18----------
things that we talked about and the way


---------19:20----------
that I feel about what happened and he


---------19:22----------
told me that he can't fix what's in the


---------19:25----------
past so he doesn't want to talk about it


---------19:28----------
throughout what do you think about that


---------19:32----------
that was kind of a a reinforcement on


---------19:36----------
the fact that I don't need to give it


---------19:38----------
effort if I'm not gonna get anything


---------19:40----------
from it okay so I want to say something


---------19:47----------
so I think your road forward actually


---------19:50----------
comes from your current relationship


---------19:52----------
with your dad because in a weird way


---------19:55----------
like even though you're doing things


---------19:56----------
like so just think about this your self


---------19:58----------
judgemental self-critical nature tends


---------20:00----------
to latch on to all kinds of stuff to


---------20:03----------
make you feel like a piece of [ __ ] and


---------20:04----------
when it comes to the way that you treat


---------20:07----------
your dad I would think that the self


---------20:09----------
judgmental part of you has plenty of


---------20:11----------
ammo to be self-critical of you with the


---------20:16----------
way that you treat your dad now right


---------20:17----------
yeah but you but it doesn't now you see


---------20:21----------
that so that's actually true north for


---------20:23----------
us that's your solution if you can


---------20:25----------
understand what has happened in your


---------20:28----------
mind to accept your relationship with


---------20:30----------
your dad and not feel guilty about it


---------20:32----------
because you're not self-critical even


---------20:33----------
though you're on paper doing things that


---------20:35----------
a lot of people would think would be


---------20:37----------
like not treating your dad well like not


---------20:39----------
inviting to his grandkids first birthday


---------20:41----------
party on paper that's something that


---------20:44----------
feels like neglectful and mean but it


---------20:47----------
isn't and more importantly you don't


---------20:50----------
trick yourself into thinking it isn't so


---------20:53----------
you actually feel confident and accept


---------20:55----------
yourself even though on paper that


---------20:57----------
behavior can be perceived as bad right


---------20:59----------
right so like do you see how that's our


---------21:01----------
kernel of confidence all we have to do


---------21:04----------
is understand like how did you get to


---------21:06----------
that place with your dad and if we can


---------21:09----------
understand how you got to that place and


---------21:10----------
we can duplicate it then you're gonna be


---------21:12----------
fine


---------21:13----------
does that make sense yeah it does okay


---------21:16----------
so now I'm gonna ask you so you said


---------21:21----------
earlier that like there were a lot of


---------21:23----------
these things that piled up with your dad


---------21:25----------
right you mentioned that like even


---------21:27----------
though you had just showered like he


---------21:29----------
wouldn't let you sit on furniture yes he


---------21:32----------
wouldn't let you go to school dances he


---------21:35----------
thinks you're racist


---------21:37----------
so what do you when you say all of that


---------21:40----------
stuff piled up what is it there that's


---------21:42----------
piling


---------21:45----------
it was kind of like little messages that


---------21:48----------
you're you're not worth my love yeah


---------22:21----------
so Jessica now I'm going to ask you


---------22:22----------
question


---------22:24----------
when you're self-critical too when you


---------22:27----------
when you beat yourself up is there some


---------22:31----------
sentiment that you are not worth your


---------22:33----------
own love I don't know how does it feel


---------22:39----------
when you beat yourself up I don't really


---------22:53----------
know how to answer that okay so let's do


---------22:55----------
this why don't you tell me a little bit


---------22:57----------
about how so this is the barrier right


---------23:00----------
like this is the barrier of our


---------23:02----------
understanding so we've come this far and


---------23:03----------
I think you're doing fantastic by the


---------23:04----------
way and I can see that we're bringing up


---------23:08----------
a lot of very raw feelings for you how


---------23:10----------
are you holding up actually let me ask


---------23:12----------
you that first oh I'm okay


---------23:19----------
because it's not like this hasn't


---------23:21----------
happened before okay I'm trying to


---------23:27----------
remain a little bit in control so we can


---------23:30----------
still talk okay I appreciate that and


---------23:33----------
also if you don't want to remain in


---------23:35----------
control that's fine too


---------23:37----------
okay and you know we can pull the plug


---------23:39----------
anytime you want to


---------23:40----------
so I okay you know just let me know


---------23:42----------
where you're you know where your limit


---------23:43----------
is okay now let me so tell me a little


---------23:46----------
bit about like give me an example of


---------23:48----------
like how you're critical towards


---------23:49----------
yourself or something that you judge


---------23:51----------
yourself for I'm actually a student at


---------23:58----------
school currently as well okay so did


---------24:02----------
that's insane yeah I do really well at


---------24:08----------
school actually and I'm not surprised


---------24:11----------
I'm very important that I do really well


---------24:13----------
and if I do the less that well I I could


---------24:17----------
beat myself up about that why is it


---------24:19----------
important that you do well because when


---------24:22----------
I started in school I was actually


---------24:23----------
started college I was seventeen oh wow


---------24:29----------
but I didn't do well then okay I I


---------24:33----------
didn't go I didn't follow through


---------24:36----------
assignments


---------24:37----------
I withdrew classes try to get another


---------24:40----------
semester it was just the same cycle over


---------24:43----------
and over again so I want to succeed this


---------24:46----------
time okay like I know I can succeed and


---------24:50----------
I don't want to go back into that old


---------24:52----------
pattern okay okay so when I'm not doing


---------24:58----------
well it's like you don't want to you


---------24:59----------
don't want to fall back you've got to


---------25:00----------
take it up got to do better instead of


---------25:04----------
me like like a 4.0 in a class is not


---------25:07----------
that important hmm


---------25:09----------
it's okay if you get a 90% and not a


---------25:12----------
hundred percent like part of me knows


---------25:14----------
this but I don't think I allowed myself


---------25:17----------
to do that okay and what happens when


---------25:19----------
you get a let's say a 90 or heaven


---------25:22----------
forbid an 88 and all right I try to


---------25:29----------
figure out what I did wrong and what I


---------25:31----------
could have done better and make sure


---------25:34----------
that that doesn't happen on the next


---------25:35----------
assignment okay


---------25:37----------
there's not I don't spend a lot of time


---------25:39----------
being like oh you're steep I don't do


---------25:40----------
that it's just so there's not a lot of


---------25:43----------
focus yeah so this feels this feels like


---------25:48----------
it's in a wrong direction actually to me


---------25:50----------
okay like the sentiment that I'm getting


---------25:52----------
from your college experience seems like


---------25:54----------
the emotions that are tied up there have


---------25:57----------
to do with your performance when you


---------25:59----------
were 17 like fixing that mistake this


---------26:02----------
feels like it's very different from like


---------26:04----------
what your dad made you feel like okay it


---------26:07----------
also feels like relatively balanced to


---------26:10----------
me like do you think that the way that


---------26:12----------
you beat yourself up over college is


---------26:14----------
like a problem or you think you do a


---------26:15----------
pretty good job with it


---------26:17----------
I don't think it's a problem I just


---------26:19----------
couldn't really think of any examples


---------26:21----------
other than that that was the first thing


---------26:23----------
okay so I think I think once again it


---------26:26----------
sounds to me like you're actually doing


---------26:27----------
pretty well there yeah like you kind of


---------26:29----------
screwed up like you're sort of proactive


---------26:31----------
and you're telling me that you don't


---------26:33----------
beat yourself up when you get an 88


---------26:34----------
therefore it's not what we're looking


---------26:37----------
for okay right like as we're talking


---------26:39----------
about when you beat yourself up so and


---------26:42----------
it's okay like so it's it's great that


---------26:44----------
you shared that example so like a lot of


---------26:45----------
times you know when we're talking about


---------26:47----------
things we sort of like it's gonna take


---------26:49----------
us some time to find what we're looking


---------26:50----------
for and it was really bizarre that you


---------26:53----------
went right to it you know the first five


---------26:54----------
minutes like that's awesome but we can't


---------26:56----------
accept to expect that kind of success


---------26:58----------
going forward so what's something else


---------27:00----------
have you beat yourself up for


---------27:10----------
okay for the longest time I didn't have


---------27:16----------
friends I didn't try to have friends so


---------27:20----------
I've made sure to do things like a story


---------27:24----------
time with my kids so they have some sort


---------27:26----------
of socialization uh-huh even though that


---------27:28----------
whole thing makes me uncomfortable


---------27:30----------
okay and what I when I don't do that


---------27:34----------
with them


---------27:35----------
well they're gonna be just like you and


---------27:38----------
you can't let that happen


---------27:39----------
that sort of thing okay I think now


---------27:42----------
we're getting to it so when you say


---------27:44----------
they're gonna be just like you what does


---------27:47----------
that mean what are you like Jessica I


---------27:50----------
don't know how to talk to you uh-huh


---------27:56----------
and


---------28:01----------
what kind of person doesn't know how to


---------28:03----------
talk to people


---------28:13----------
the first thing I said was not a very


---------28:15----------
good one what do you mean by that


---------28:24----------
someone that knew how to talk to people


---------28:26----------
is a better person someone who knows how


---------28:29----------
to socialize people


---------28:33----------
and so you're afraid that your kids are


---------28:36----------
going to end up like what


---------28:41----------
isolated not know how to relate to the


---------28:44----------
world okay


---------28:47----------
and you feel like you're isolated and


---------28:49----------
you don't know how to relate to the


---------28:51----------
world what's the time yes and what do


---------28:55----------
you think it like so this is gonna sound


---------28:58----------
kind of weird but there are all kinds of


---------29:00----------
reasons why people will be isolated and


---------29:02----------
not be able to relate to the world why


---------29:05----------
do


---------29:05----------
what's the reason that you're not able


---------29:07----------
to do it probably because I accepted it


---------29:16----------
too much rejection


---------29:20----------
just kind of let that feed the figure


---------29:23----------
that I need it to be isolated this isn't


---------29:25----------
okay so I'm gonna stop you you're not


---------29:27----------
allowed to use anything that I tell you


---------29:29----------
okay like I hate it when people give me


---------29:32----------
the right answer so like this is this is


---------29:34----------
the part of you that's like coming up


---------29:36----------
with the right car like that's a


---------29:37----------
cognitive answer I'm asking you like


---------29:38----------
like there's a part of you that feels


---------29:40----------
like you're just not okay with the rest


---------29:43----------
of the world right right like tell me


---------29:45----------
about that part don't spoon feed me my


---------29:49----------
own [ __ ]


---------29:49----------
I mean you're right but let's step away


---------29:55----------
from that right so like what like why do


---------30:00----------
you feel like let's say one year ago


---------30:01----------
let's actually go back to when you said


---------30:03----------
that you haven't had a whole lot of


---------30:04----------
friends for for awhile let's say like


---------30:08----------
four years ago did you have free would


---------30:13----------
okay


---------30:14----------
why didn't you feel like you had a whole


---------30:16----------
like did you have no friends at one


---------30:17----------
point I've had steadily I've had one


---------30:21----------
friend that we've been close with off


---------30:23----------
and on and I guess I could kind of see


---------30:27----------
people that you know they go out with


---------30:30----------
their friends on the weekend okay I


---------30:32----------
never did that sort of thing uh-huh


---------30:33----------
I was I was never really interested and


---------30:38----------
the things that they would do like go to


---------30:40----------
bars and whatnot yeah that wasn't my


---------30:42----------
thing and I guess I just never found


---------30:46----------
somebody that was interested the same


---------30:49----------
type of things I was haha wait I was


---------30:51----------
interested in at them I never found


---------30:54----------
somebody who I had common ground with


---------30:56----------
and I thought that that meant there was


---------30:57----------
something wrong with me yeah and what


---------31:00----------
did they tell me about that feeling it


---------31:05----------
made me not what to socialize mm-hmm


---------31:08----------
because if there's something wrong with


---------31:10----------
me and then who would want to talk with


---------31:12----------
me sort of thing mm-hmm so I


---------31:18----------
- notice something that's going on right


---------31:20----------
now right so you're you're using some


---------31:22----------
amount of cognition to rationalize like


---------31:27----------
good reasons why you weren't able to


---------31:28----------
make friends like you just weren't


---------31:29----------
interested in going out and getting


---------31:31----------
hammered you know and most of the people


---------31:33----------
who you were hanging out with we're


---------31:34----------
interested in going out and getting


---------31:35----------
hammered that makes perfect sense and


---------31:38----------
every time you say something like that


---------31:40----------
it moves away from the feeling that like


---------31:43----------
some part of you felt like you just


---------31:46----------
weren't worth getting to know right you


---------31:51----------
see that yeah and and so I can also see


---------31:54----------
that your your facial expression has


---------31:55----------
changed you seem calmer to me now so if


---------32:02----------
it makes me call there to try to


---------32:05----------
rationalize things absolutely right


---------32:09----------
uh-huh so what do you do like tell me


---------32:11----------
about that how like how does


---------32:12----------
rationalizing help you stay calm


---------32:22----------
my emotions could be very turbine


---------32:25----------
turbulent yep and in the past I've


---------32:31----------
gotten so caught up in them that they


---------32:34----------
they have led me to some pretty bad


---------32:36----------
places yeah like what I had a problem I


---------32:44----------
was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and


---------32:47----------
about that time with my diagnosis I had


---------32:50----------
a lot of suicidal ideation mm-hmm so I


---------32:55----------
guess that's been kind of like a I want


---------32:58----------
to say a coping mechanism but I'm not


---------33:00----------
sure how to express it beautiful you can


---------33:04----------
rationalize thinking yeah yeah try to we


---------33:08----------
call that it yep we call that a defense


---------33:11----------
mechanism yeah


---------33:13----------
there you go so but let me ask you


---------33:15----------
something but I have a couple questions


---------33:17----------
for you Jessica so do you do you feel


---------33:21----------
like the judgment that so the south


---------33:23----------
judgmental part of you and I want you to


---------33:25----------
kind of envision that like so you're


---------33:27----------
like I think there's a part of you that


---------33:29----------
recognizes that you're an awesome and


---------33:31----------
wonderful person that true yes and then


---------33:35----------
there's this other part of you that


---------33:37----------
thinks that you're a piece of [ __ ] yes


---------33:39----------
so let me ask you something does that


---------33:42----------
person that thinks you're a piece of


---------33:44----------
[ __ ] is that rooted in emotion or rooted


---------33:47----------
in rationality emotion absolutely all


---------33:51----------
right so I want you I want you and other


---------33:52----------
people to kind of understand this that


---------33:54----------
like what happens is that part of your


---------33:56----------
mind hijacks your rational thinking it's


---------34:00----------
like there's like a rational part of


---------34:02----------
your mind that knows that you're a good


---------34:03----------
person but when those emotions rise up


---------34:06----------
they like bully your rational mind and


---------34:08----------
they say hey I feel like a piece of [ __ ]


---------34:10----------
and I want you to give me a thousand


---------34:12----------
reasons why I'm a piece of [ __ ] and then


---------34:14----------
your mind starts thinking those thoughts


---------34:16----------
does that make sense yes what the root


---------34:18----------
is emotion


---------34:20----------
and I think this is where like the crazy


---------34:23----------
thing here is that Jessica I think you


---------34:25----------
were taught you're not like mentally ill


---------34:28----------
you were taught that you're like look


---------34:32----------
this is important to understand you were


---------34:33----------
taught that you're not worth it


---------34:36----------
right do you see that if this is a


---------34:39----------
lesson that you learned because when


---------34:42----------
we're kids and we're growing up we learn


---------34:44----------
all kinds of things that are not like


---------34:46----------
information that are not like state


---------34:48----------
capitals and mathematics our parents


---------34:51----------
give us a sense of value in like who we


---------34:54----------
are and and right now I imagine that


---------34:58----------
you're an amazing parent yeah yeah right


---------35:02----------
yeah and like how long does it take when


---------35:06----------
your three-year-old starts crying how


---------35:08----------
long does it take to calm her down it


---------35:11----------
depends on the situation but not very


---------35:13----------
long usually how long are we talking a


---------35:15----------
couple minutes really a couple minutes I


---------35:18----------
would say like five minutes tops tops


---------35:22----------
yeah you calm her down in less than two


---------35:24----------
minutes usually yeah yeah like I would


---------35:28----------
be surprised if actually I wouldn't be


---------35:30----------
surprised if half the time you calmed


---------35:32----------
her down in less than 60 seconds yeah


---------35:35----------
like 60 seconds of crying is a lot right


---------35:38----------
yeah so I think actually I would I would


---------35:41----------
be I wouldn't be surprised if all like


---------35:43----------
you calmed her down in 30 seconds


---------35:45----------
yeah and that tells me that you're


---------35:47----------
actually doing an amazing job at being a


---------35:49----------
mother because kids who get calmed down


---------35:53----------
or kids that are secure yeah and so when


---------35:56----------
mom tells me everything is gonna be okay


---------35:58----------
like she has faith in you and she


---------36:00----------
wouldn't have that faith and you like


---------36:01----------
kids don't have faith in in like bad


---------36:04----------
parents right like the reason that they


---------36:06----------
have faith in you is because like they


---------36:07----------
know that when you say everything is


---------36:09----------
okay actually everything ends ends up


---------36:11----------
okay and 99% of the time everything ends


---------36:13----------
up okay so she has faith in you and that


---------36:14----------
means you're doing an awesome job it's


---------36:16----------
something called secure attachment you


---------36:17----------
can like do a Google Scholar search but


---------36:19----------
I would guess that your kid huh my


---------36:21----------
degree that I'm getting is child


---------36:23----------
development Oh perfect so like your kids


---------36:25----------
have I think they have very secure


---------36:27----------
attachment yeah and so I think you're an


---------36:29----------
awesome person and your give you're


---------36:31----------
instilling them a sense of confidence


---------36:33----------
and what they're learning like is that


---------36:35----------
they're a good person that the world


---------36:37----------
like makes sense right


---------36:39----------
whereas what you learn from your dad is


---------36:41----------
that the world is a confusing place and


---------36:43----------
that actually like you don't have a


---------36:44----------
voice and you're not like a good person


---------36:46----------
right right that you can take a shower


---------36:48----------
and he tells you like you're you're


---------36:50----------
[ __ ] not allowed to sit in furniture


---------36:52----------
right like if you think about one of the


---------36:56----------
things that makes like you know that


---------36:58----------
that feels to me like he's making you


---------37:00----------
feel subhuman yeah like you know I


---------37:04----------
wasn't alive when civil rights was like


---------37:06----------
a big thing back in the 60s but I can


---------37:08----------
imagine that when you're a human being


---------37:10----------
and you were told that you're not


---------37:11----------
allowed to drink at one water fountain


---------37:13----------
you have to drink it a different water


---------37:15----------
fountain like it makes people feel


---------37:17----------
subhuman and when I hear the way that


---------37:20----------
your dad treated you it makes me feel


---------37:22----------
like he treated you in a subhuman way


---------37:25----------
and when you beat yourself up I think it


---------37:30----------
there's a part of you that learned that


---------37:33----------
you are subhuman and you can and that


---------37:36----------
that emotion is there and you can argue


---------37:39----------
against it all you want to but that


---------37:41----------
emotion doesn't give a [ __ ] does that


---------37:44----------
make sense because when it starts to


---------37:46----------
hijack your rational reasoning like it's


---------37:49----------
like a tidal wave and you can try to put


---------37:51----------
up whatever kind of like you can try to


---------37:53----------
you know blow or splash towards the


---------37:56----------
tidal wave as much as you want to but


---------37:57----------
it's not gonna stop it and it doesn't


---------37:58----------
[ __ ] work right right so now the


---------38:03----------
question becomes how how do you fix this


---------38:05----------
what do you think I have no idea


---------38:11----------
how do you help your child feel like a


---------38:14----------
human being I talk to her like she


---------38:19----------
matters yeah do you talk to yourself


---------38:22----------
like you matter bad as off as I should


---------38:27----------
well there you go


---------38:30----------
do you talk to yourself like you matter


---------38:31----------
when it comes to school yes there we go


---------38:35----------
right remember when I said like the


---------38:37----------
school is not that's not the right


---------38:38----------
examiner because I think that's a good


---------38:40----------
example of what you're doing right when


---------38:42----------
you're when you feel guilty for not


---------38:45----------
inviting your dad to your daughter's


---------38:47----------
first birthday party how do you talk to


---------38:48----------
yourself


---------38:50----------
it didn't feel guilty for that Yeah


---------38:53----------
right and this is the key thing I think


---------38:55----------
you did feel guilty and I think you


---------38:57----------
talked to yourself like you mattered and


---------38:59----------
what you actually told yourself was that


---------39:01----------
hey on paper I know that I should I


---------39:04----------
should invite him but like he's an


---------39:06----------
[ __ ] and I don't want him to be a


---------39:08----------
part of my daughter's life and like you


---------39:11----------
talked to yourself like you matter right


---------39:13----------
like in that moment you matter to


---------39:15----------
yourself in your opinion matters and


---------39:16----------
what you believe matters and the love


---------39:18----------
that you have for your child matters


---------39:20----------
more than his feelings in a weird way


---------39:24----------
like in the same way that it's


---------39:26----------
instinctive for you to beat yourself up


---------39:28----------
it's actually instinctive sometimes for


---------39:30----------
you to treat yourself like you matter


---------39:32----------
like when you get into a fight with you


---------39:34----------
with your husband and I'm assuming


---------39:36----------
you're married to man but when you get


---------39:37----------
into a fight with your husband and like


---------39:39----------
he's in the wrong how do you talk to


---------39:41----------
yourself we don't have any arguments


---------39:46----------
okay I'm trying to think of it example


---------39:52----------
yeah so actually you don't have to


---------39:53----------
because I think that's telling right so


---------39:55----------
there's it like there's a chance that


---------39:57----------
the reason that you guys don't have


---------39:58----------
arguments is because you know like it's


---------40:01----------
a very like pat like you're not willing


---------40:03----------
to argue with him or he's not willing to


---------40:05----------
argue with you like maybe one of you


---------40:06----------
guys has like there's a big power


---------40:08----------
dynamic and you guys don't want to pick


---------40:09----------
a fight but I guess the reason that you


---------40:11----------
don't have arguments with him is because


---------40:13----------
you actually advocate and when you talk


---------40:14----------
to him you treat yourself like you


---------40:16----------
matter and you make sure that he


---------40:18----------
understands that yes and like that's


---------40:22----------
that's your answer you're already doing


---------40:24----------
it in some dimensions of your life but


---------40:28----------
there's a part of you that that you


---------40:30----------
don't you don't treat yourself like that


---------40:32----------
right like so when it comes here when it


---------40:34----------
comes to your kids when it comes to


---------40:36----------
school when it comes to your current


---------40:38----------
relationship with your dad and it comes


---------40:40----------
to your relationship with your husband


---------40:41----------
you treat yourself like you matter with


---------40:43----------
other things other feelings that you


---------40:46----------
have where you feel like you're a piece


---------40:47----------
of [ __ ] and what you do is you try to


---------40:49----------
bully that part right you fight against


---------40:50----------
it you say oh you shouldn't feel that


---------40:52----------
way but my guess is that when your


---------40:56----------
daughter is not feeling well you never


---------40:58----------
tell her you shouldn't feel that way no


---------41:03----------
right what do you tell her try to talk


---------41:07----------
about the situation like said it's it's


---------41:10----------
gonna be okay yeah but when yourself


---------41:13----------
wouldn't not now here's the here's the


---------41:15----------
punchline Jessica when you're


---------41:17----------
self-critical towards yourself do you


---------41:18----------
ever tell yourself does the thought it's


---------41:20----------
going to be okay ever enter your mind


---------41:23----------
yeah absolutely


---------41:26----------
right what enters your mind is a [ __ ]


---------41:28----------
action plan


---------41:30----------
you're not okay but if you were to do


---------41:33----------
these things you'll be okay in the


---------41:34----------
future that's not what you tell your


---------41:37----------
daughter you don't tell her you have to


---------41:38----------
do X Y & Z and then things will be okay


---------41:40----------
you tell her have faith in yourself


---------41:42----------
things are gonna be okay no matter what


---------41:44----------
we'll figure this out I'm here with you


---------41:46----------
that's what you tell her but that's not


---------41:48----------
what you tell yourself and if you can


---------41:52----------
learn how to tell yourself that then


---------41:55----------
you're gonna be fine


---------42:05----------
good side


---------42:09----------
how you feeling right now that are glad


---------42:13----------
I prepared my desk with tissues yeah


---------42:22----------
I'm feeling like we're getting somewhere


---------42:25----------
yeah you look a little bit lighter yeah


---------42:35----------
so weird how that feels right that's


---------42:38----------
good though


---------42:39----------
yeah it's very good means we're getting


---------42:41----------
somewhere


---------42:42----------
yeah you have any thoughts or questions


---------42:48----------
at this point I had a thought


---------42:54----------
yeah it'll share it I thought about


---------42:57----------
making a sari for my desk but you know


---------43:01----------
it's gonna be okay just kind of putting


---------43:03----------
it up there what do you think about that


---------43:05----------
what do you think about it sounds like a


---------43:08----------
good idea to me okay that right I think


---------43:15----------
the one thing I would caution you about


---------43:18----------
is watch out for the judgment even with


---------43:21----------
that


---------43:24----------
so a weird way what I what I can foresee


---------43:26----------
happening is that you look up at the


---------43:28----------
sign and you say oh I used to believe


---------43:30----------
that but now I don't anymore


---------43:33----------
and you can judge yourself for like does


---------43:36----------
that make sense yes you can even judge


---------43:38----------
yourself for like not believing the sign


---------43:40----------
and you're like you can even tell


---------43:43----------
yourself oh I used to be on the right


---------43:44----------
path but [ __ ] look at where I got myself


---------43:46----------
now so watch out for that okay so I


---------43:49----------
think that that sign can be wonderful


---------43:51----------
and inspiring and at the same time you


---------43:55----------
should maybe tack a smaller sign which


---------43:57----------
is that if that's not how I'm feeling


---------43:58----------
right now that's okay too I like that


---------44:02----------
you get the beat yeah it makes me think


---------44:06----------
of my husband when we were dating he


---------44:11----------
made a side that's actually hanging up


---------44:13----------
at her house it was a the played' you


---------44:17----------
know get married have kids graduate get


---------44:19----------
jobs happily ever [ __ ] after is what


---------44:22----------
it says on the bottom of it [ __ ] it


---------44:25----------
makes me think about yeah absolutely


---------44:26----------
because it's that last part right it's


---------44:29----------
not the plan


---------44:30----------
it's the whatever yeah so whatever at


---------44:34----------
the bottom and that's what you need to


---------44:35----------
learn how to do for yourself yeah


---------44:38----------
concretely I think if you're not seeing


---------44:41----------
a therapist you should really think


---------44:42----------
about it I do okay day perfect yeah yeah


---------44:48----------
well I mean I'm gonna say that maybe we


---------44:51----------
should go ahead and and stop cuz I think


---------44:52----------
this is a great place to stop how do you


---------44:54----------
feel I agree okay well thanks for coming


---------44:57----------
on Jessica I'm gonna thank you very much


---------45:01----------
and strong work today
