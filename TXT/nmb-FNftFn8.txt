---------00:00----------
people are asking so there are three


---------00:01----------
questions about reheating stuff in


---------00:03----------
nutrients okay so the first thing is a


---------00:05----------
year ago I did was like so I had heard


---------00:08----------
this stuff right like people and I like


---------00:10----------
Ayurvedic doctors will say like don't


---------00:11----------
use microwaves and so I was like okay is


---------00:13----------
there any data behind this st. John's


---------00:17----------
wort you have to be careful about for


---------00:18----------
sure especially because you can get


---------00:20----------
serotonin and overdoses if you're taking


---------00:22----------
regular antidepressants as well I don't


---------00:27----------
recommend really medical marijuana in


---------00:29----------
most cases


---------00:34----------
yeah your thumb stick if you take benzos


---------00:37----------
that's right so let's just talk about


---------00:40----------
reheating food for a second okay


---------00:47----------
no serotonin overdose doesn't lead to


---------00:50----------
burnout you're gonna [ __ ] start


---------00:51----------
shaking and like I don't think you can


---------00:53----------
have seizures but it can be really bad


---------00:55----------
like you're gonna have an elevated heart


---------00:57----------
rate you're gonna [ __ ] up reflexes


---------00:59----------
it's like really bad so we're gonna just


---------01:05----------
talk for a second about the reheating


---------01:09----------
food okay so a lot of these like


---------01:12----------
alternative medicine folks talk about


---------01:13----------
like eating freshly cooked food and


---------01:15----------
stuff like that like I personally think


---------01:17----------
that that has validity that's anecdotal


---------01:19----------
so about a year ago I sat down and I


---------01:22----------
tried to like understand like what


---------01:23----------
studies have been done about nutrients


---------01:25----------
and food and the best that I could find


---------01:28----------
is like most of the studies about


---------01:29----------
nutrients and reheated food actually


---------01:32----------
come from like the 1970s when microwave


---------01:35----------
started to become popular so when


---------01:37----------
microwaves became popular there were a


---------01:38----------
bunch of studies that were done on like


---------01:40----------
the nutrient impact of microwavable like


---------01:43----------
microwaves and reheating food on


---------01:45----------
nutrients the short answer is that these


---------01:49----------
studies basically found a minimal amount


---------01:51----------
of difference between microwaved food


---------01:53----------
and like a reheated food and other


---------01:55----------
things the problem is that they really


---------01:57----------
only looked at like macronutrient


---------02:00----------
components so they looked at like grams


---------02:03----------
of carbohydrate so what they did is they


---------02:05----------
took like let's say like a lasagna and


---------02:07----------
they like measured the amount of grams


---------02:09----------
of carbohydrate grams of fat grams of


---------02:11----------
protein in a lasagna and then they


---------02:13----------
microwaved it and then they measured the


---------02:15----------
grams of carbohydrate the grams of


---------02:17----------
protein in the grams of fat and they


---------02:18----------
basically found there's very little


---------02:20----------
difference so from a macronutrient


---------02:22----------
perspective that the raw number of like


---------02:25----------
the grams of protein and stuff are


---------02:28----------
relatively the same the problem is that


---------02:31----------
it doesn't look at any of like the more


---------02:34----------
subtle things that we've learned to


---------02:35----------
detect right so it doesn't look at what


---------02:37----------
the inflammatory state of that that


---------02:40----------
lasagna is it doesn't look at


---------02:42----------
micronutrients doesn't really look at


---------02:44----------
vitamins and minerals and things like


---------02:45----------
that like like vitamin C has a half-life


---------02:48----------
of something like 12 hours so like you


---------02:51----------
know a lot of a lot of vitamins have a


---------02:54----------
very low half-life and the other really


---------02:57----------
interesting thing is that if you like if


---------02:58----------
you pick up a piece of fruit


---------03:00----------
it's cold like fruit a piece of fruit at


---------03:04----------
room temperature is gonna feel colder


---------03:06----------
than the surrounding objects and the


---------03:09----------
question is why it's because the fruit


---------03:12----------
is actually still alive right like do


---------03:15----------
you guys get that when you have a fruit


---------03:17----------
and a vegetable that that those are


---------03:19----------
still like living organisms like you can


---------03:21----------
take the bottom of like a head of


---------03:23----------
lettuce you can stick it in water and


---------03:25----------
it's gonna start to grow like if you


---------03:27----------
have a potato that's sitting in your


---------03:30----------
your closet or in your pantry net


---------03:32----------
potatoes gonna start sprouting so you


---------03:35----------
have active metabolism going on in like


---------03:37----------
fruits and vegetables and and so the the


---------03:41----------
nutritional capacity of like an orange


---------03:44----------
that's sitting on your shelf is like a


---------03:46----------
hundred percent because that vitamin C


---------03:48----------
has not started to decay because the


---------03:49----------
thing is actually alive whereas if you


---------03:52----------
have like a bottle of orange juice they


---------03:55----------
fortify it with vitamin C but then that


---------03:56----------
vitamin C is going to start decaying


---------03:58----------
because there's nothing alive in there


---------04:00----------
so I think that that the the data


---------04:04----------
actually doesn't do a great job at


---------04:06----------
supporting the view that I'm propagating


---------04:08----------
which is that you know healthy food I


---------04:11----------
mean that that reheating food negatively


---------04:13----------
impacts it but like if we just stop and


---------04:17----------
think about our human experience of


---------04:19----------
eating reheated versus freshly cooked


---------04:21----------
food it tastes wildly different so what


---------04:24----------
I wonder is like what is it that yours


---------04:26----------
your taste buds and your senses or


---------04:28----------
picking up right so there's got to be


---------04:32----------
something that they're picking up and if


---------04:33----------
you think about like you know when you


---------04:34----------
eat like a piece of really old food and


---------04:37----------
then you get an upset stomach like why


---------04:38----------
do you get an upset stomach like that's


---------04:40----------
not mental and and something in your


---------04:42----------
taste buds is warning you before you


---------04:44----------
even get the indigestion that it's like


---------04:46----------
hey man like maybe you shouldn't really


---------04:48----------
be eating this like if you eat like


---------04:49----------
freshly cooked baby back ribs that [ __ ]


---------04:53----------
is delicious and you're like I want to


---------04:54----------
eat more I want to eat more I want to


---------04:56----------
eat more whereas if you have like baby


---------04:58----------
back ribs that have been like sitting


---------05:00----------
out on the countertop for like four days


---------05:01----------
and you start to eat it your body is not


---------05:04----------
going to tell you I want more I want


---------05:05----------
more I want more right it's gonna be


---------05:07----------
like this is kind of nasty and like


---------05:09----------
maybe you shouldn't eat this so your


---------05:11----------
body is able to pick up a lot of signals


---------05:13----------
that we don't even scientifically


---------05:15----------
understand and it's it's my opinion that


---------05:17----------
those signals correlate with like


---------05:19----------
nutritious nosov food which is why


---------05:22----------
things like cooked vegetables taste


---------05:23----------
better because they have more like they


---------05:25----------
have more available nutrients so my


---------05:27----------
sense is that we're picking up on all


---------05:29----------
kinds of different like changes in the


---------05:30----------
nutrient density the nutrient quality


---------05:33----------
which cause us to enjoy cooked foods


---------05:35----------
less so I do think that


---------05:41----------
that that reheated food has less


---------05:44----------
nutritional value than freshly cooked


---------05:47----------
food and I think that that net nutrient


---------05:50----------
value isn't simply in terms of like


---------05:52----------
carbohydrates proteins fats and isn't


---------05:54----------
necessarily just in terms of vitamins as


---------05:56----------
well there's something about I don't


---------05:58----------
know how it works but like there's


---------05:59----------
something about it that just makes it


---------06:01----------
taste good and so I think you know I'm a


---------06:06----------
big fan of like meal prep Sunday because


---------06:09----------
like I think it allows you to make


---------06:10----------
healthy food choices throughout the week


---------06:11----------
so I'm not saying that you shouldn't do


---------06:13----------
meal prep Sunday because like if you


---------06:15----------
have a choice between eating like


---------06:16----------
meatballs and french fries and doing


---------06:18----------
meal prep prep Sunday and like making


---------06:20----------
yourself like three days of stir fry I


---------06:22----------
think you should go with the stir fry at


---------06:25----------
the same time you should try to eat as


---------06:26----------
much freshly cooked food as you can and


---------06:28----------
like try to portion things and then try


---------06:31----------
to use things like slow cookers and


---------06:32----------
stuff like that and and like there are a


---------06:37----------
lot of like there are a lot of really


---------06:38----------
quick things that you can make like you


---------06:40----------
can take a piece of fish sprinkle it


---------06:42----------
with salt pepper seasoning breadcrumbs


---------06:46----------
Pat it down heat up some olive oil in a


---------06:49----------
pan and you can be start-to-finish


---------06:51----------
within 25 minutes you can have like


---------06:53----------
prepared like prep the fish cook the


---------06:57----------
fish eaten the fish and wash the pot


---------06:59----------
right like you can do that so people are


---------07:05----------
asking like


---------07:06----------
it's the balance between meal prep and


---------07:09----------
eating fresh food I'd say like do what


---------07:10----------
you can so if your choice is between


---------07:13----------
eating like unhealthy food like burgers


---------07:16----------
every day right like a freshly cooked


---------07:18----------
burger I don't think is as good is like


---------07:21----------
on a daily basis as as like a stir-fry


---------07:24----------
meal prep but I'd say that if you're if


---------07:28----------
you're really like and you just have to


---------07:29----------
figure out what your own personal


---------07:30----------
threshold is and and what you like what


---------07:33----------
you you know what you want to prioritize


---------07:36----------
like how much of your time is it worth


---------07:38----------
sacrificing to eat freshly cooked food


---------07:40----------
so in my case like I try to eat


---------07:42----------
something fresh at least everyday


---------07:44----------
like usually at twice a day and it's not


---------07:47----------
that hard I think if you guys have


---------07:50----------
roommates and stuff it becomes way


---------07:52----------
easier even if you have co-workers like


---------07:54----------
I used to do this thing with my with my


---------07:57----------
med school classmates were like there


---------07:59----------
were some days and we're like like one


---------08:00----------
of us would cook for everyone so like I


---------08:03----------
would wake up and I would like make food


---------08:05----------
for like four of us and then like we'd


---------08:07----------
all have lunch together and I like have


---------08:09----------
freshly cooked food like that day and


---------08:11----------
then like the next day someone else


---------08:12----------
brings something it doesn't have to be


---------08:13----------
super like fancy like sometimes it's


---------08:15----------
just sandwiches and stuff


---------08:21----------
so I think you should just find your own


---------08:24----------
personal balance with what you have like


---------08:26----------
I think it helps if you're like I'm


---------08:28----------
married and I have two kids and my mom


---------08:29----------
lives with us so like there are three


---------08:31----------
adults that can cook freshly cooked food


---------08:33----------
every day we're really careful about


---------08:35----------
feeding my kids freshly cooked food so


---------08:37----------
we try to like really give them fresh


---------08:39----------
food every day um yeah so as someone's


---------08:43----------
asking like what if you don't like some


---------08:44----------
what if you don't like someone else's


---------08:46----------
cooking well I mean so I think you


---------08:48----------
should learn how to do things that you


---------08:50----------
don't like right so like why don't you


---------08:53----------
like it and like what's the reason for


---------08:54----------
that I mean you guys are you guys are


---------08:57----------
like you're assuming that if you don't


---------09:00----------
like your your actions are dictated by


---------09:02----------
what you like and what you don't like


---------09:03----------
well that's a shitty way to go through


---------09:04----------
life my friend if your actions are


---------09:07----------
dictated by your intentions as opposed


---------09:09----------
to what you like or dislike then you're


---------09:11----------
going to be in a far different place


---------09:18----------
if you like reheated food I'm not sure


---------09:21----------
so I think there are some foods that


---------09:22----------
improve with being like old right not


---------09:26----------
old but like so for example I think if


---------09:29----------
you if you cook a soup a lot of the


---------09:31----------
flavors will like blend like hours after


---------09:34----------
the soup is cooked and the second day


---------09:37----------
they're like they like kind of reheat


---------09:38----------
better and things like that there are


---------09:39----------
definitely cases of that but


---------09:48----------
I think that I'm not sure why your your


---------09:52----------
taste buds would prefer that


---------09:57----------
yes so the other thing is you know the


---------09:59----------
other reason why you may like reheated


---------10:01----------
food is because your taste buds have


---------10:02----------
just grown accustomed to it right so


---------10:05----------
like if you grow up eating something


---------10:06----------
like I've had some people like you know


---------10:08----------
I I hear about some people who like like


---------10:10----------
eat steak that's like well-done and


---------10:12----------
cooked like shoe leather and that's just


---------10:14----------
the way they grew up eating it so that's


---------10:16----------
how they like it and so that could have


---------10:19----------
something to do with it I mean if you


---------10:20----------
just eat a lottery heated food then


---------10:22----------
that's just how it is


---------10:25----------
[Music]


---------10:30----------
okay


---------10:37----------
something that helped me eat healthier


---------10:39----------
was prepping all my meals would you say


---------10:41----------
it's worth the effort to try and cook


---------10:42----------
more fresh foods I worry I struggle to


---------10:44----------
eat as healthy as I am now if I were to


---------10:46----------
cook yeah so I think prep is great right


---------10:50----------
so I think it's like a good idea to like


---------10:51----------
prep whatever you can ahead of time but


---------10:54----------
you can cook whole meals or you can prep


---------10:56----------
stuff and this is where you know like


---------11:00----------
for example what I was telling gizmo


---------11:01----------
today is like when you wake up in the


---------11:02----------
morning while you're making a cup of tea


---------11:04----------
or you're making your cup of coffee like


---------11:05----------
literally so this is literally just grab


---------11:09----------
a bell pepper wash it and slice it up


---------11:11----------
the process of grabbing a bell pepper


---------11:14----------
washing it and slicing it into like nine


---------11:16----------
pieces is like 60 seconds I think a lot


---------11:21----------
of people grossly misunderstood


---------11:23----------
overestimate how long it actually takes


---------11:26----------
to cook food and prepare food like


---------11:29----------
grabbing a piece of fruit washing it and


---------11:31----------
slicing it is like a 60-second endeavor


---------11:32----------
you can spend five minutes prepping


---------11:35----------
stuff and you will be amazed like you


---------11:37----------
grab a piece of fish wash it pat it down


---------11:39----------
sprinkle salt take three or four things


---------11:41----------
of seasoning sprinkle it on there and


---------11:43----------
then you're done that that whole process


---------11:45----------
is like 90 seconds yeah so I think this


---------11:50----------
is also where there's this beautiful


---------11:51----------
thing called YouTube and on YouTube


---------11:54----------
sometimes there are people on there it's


---------11:55----------
[ __ ] weird there's just like people


---------11:56----------
who have like cooking experience and


---------11:58----------
they just show you how to like prep


---------11:59----------
things and they show you how to like


---------12:01----------
slice and it's like really easy like if


---------12:04----------
you're if you're I don't know how to


---------12:06----------
describe this but if you're having


---------12:06----------
trouble with the seeds in a bell pepper


---------12:08----------
you need to like if this is the bell


---------12:10----------
pepper you need to cut down from the top


---------12:12----------
right so you just cut you make four


---------12:14----------
slices you pull off the top and that's


---------12:16----------
all the seeds and then you're done


---------12:19----------
like there's no bother with the seeds


---------12:21----------
the other thing if you have trouble with


---------12:23----------
with seeds and a bell peppers you wash


---------12:24----------
it after you cut it all those things


---------12:26----------
just come out you're done easy
