---------00:00----------
it's you that goes backwards it's you're


---------00:02----------
not telling me that you fail you're not


---------00:03----------
you've never said that to me right you


---------00:07----------
say that when I am actually making


---------00:09----------
progress this weird things happens in my


---------00:12----------
mind where I come back to the center


---------00:23----------
so what am i calling you buddy anything


---------00:27----------
from me Rick if you want what do you


---------00:30----------
prefer indifferent okay so should I call


---------00:37----------
you crucifer or Rick again industry


---------00:43----------
which do you prefer I guess I'll go with


---------00:45----------
crucifer project because that's that's


---------00:48----------
what I in my mind what I have yes so


---------00:50----------
tell me how what are we talking about


---------00:51----------
today cruson oh I'm not sure I have a


---------00:54----------
general idea you know I I guess


---------00:57----------
generally addiction okay feelings of


---------01:01----------
powerlessness and weakness I suppose in


---------01:03----------
daily life in getting out of that


---------01:05----------
sure so is that tell me is that how you


---------01:09----------
feel


---------01:09----------
uh generally yeah I mean I've been doing


---------01:13----------
pretty good right now


---------01:14----------
I guess I never really last for long and


---------01:18----------
then I tend to feel pretty powerless and


---------01:21----------
then what he was what do you mean by


---------01:23----------
powerless and hopeless like no matter


---------01:26----------
what I do in my life it doesn't matter


---------01:28----------
no matter how hard I try to fix


---------01:30----------
something it's it's never fixable you


---------01:33----------
know no matter how much effort I put


---------01:35----------
into it ya don't want to Thanks ah


---------01:40----------
there's so many things I'd like to fix


---------01:42----------
I'd like to get independence in my life


---------01:45----------
I'd like to fix my health I would like


---------01:47----------
to just get you you know I don't have


---------01:49----------
big aspirations I just like to get to a


---------01:51----------
place where I'm comfortable I'm happy


---------01:53----------
you know you know I'm nervous to be


---------01:55----------
homeless or offering myself [ __ ] yeah


---------01:59----------
that actually sounds like being


---------02:01----------
comfortable and happy i think is


---------02:02----------
actually a tall order that's not it oh


---------02:05----------
yeah yeah perhaps I guess not


---------02:09----------
immediately at risk of of decently happy


---------02:13----------
I suppose having more days that are


---------02:15----------
happy than not yeah so you know couse if


---------02:18----------
you come across as very reasonable and


---------02:20----------
very collected very calm very


---------02:22----------
intelligent thank you you too yeah thank


---------02:27----------
you


---------02:27----------
I'm not you're talking about these


---------02:30----------
emotions of powerlessness and


---------02:31----------
hopelessness but I'm not getting those


---------02:33----------
vibes from you


---------02:36----------
yeah it's very complicated and strange


---------02:37----------
you know mentally I think I've got it


---------02:40----------
there I know what I have to do and I


---------02:42----------
think I'm intelligent enough to do that


---------02:43----------
the best way to explain that I suppose


---------02:46----------
is it's a bit like an invisible wall you


---------02:49----------
like using game terms i suppose it's


---------02:53----------
like finding that invisible wall you


---------02:55----------
can't go any further in the game yeah


---------02:57----------
but you know I think that's that's a


---------03:01----------
great analogy can you help us understand


---------03:02----------
what that means in real life like what's


---------03:05----------
the invisible wall what does that mean


---------03:08----------
um I guess for me it's that part where


---------03:12----------
you know I know what I have to do but I


---------03:16----------
can't do it


---------03:17----------
and it's I can't put my finger on it I


---------03:20----------
don't know what needs to be done or have


---------03:24----------
the resources or yeah absolutely so you


---------03:27----------
can you can see it's like you can see


---------03:28----------
exactly where you're supposed to go but


---------03:30----------
as you start walking there you run into


---------03:33----------
a glitch and you're like well I need


---------03:34----------
that you know this is on the Waze keypad


---------03:37----------
I'm hitting the W and I should be moving


---------03:39----------
forward but I'm just not able to move


---------03:40----------
forward and you're able to kind of see


---------03:42----------
everything and you just yeah so so let's


---------03:46----------
talk a little bit about that and see if


---------03:48----------
we can understand why is it that when


---------03:51----------
you know what you need to do you can't


---------03:54----------
seem to do it and my sense is that you


---------03:58----------
know most people don't understand that


---------04:00----------
there are forces within them that are


---------04:02----------
actually trying to keep them in place


---------04:03----------
and maybe we can try to understand what


---------04:06----------
those are or their obstacles that


---------04:08----------
they're not able to see which means that


---------04:09----------
they aren't it's not that they're not


---------04:11----------
there it's just you're not able to


---------04:12----------
recognize it so well let's dig into that


---------04:15----------
so tell me something about what I mean


---------04:17----------
what do you feel powerless about so you


---------04:19----------
said that there are a lot of different


---------04:20----------
things and you're not asking for much


---------04:23----------
you mentioned health and stuff like that


---------04:24----------
so let's pick something and dig into it


---------04:26----------
um I don't know if I could pick


---------04:30----------
something specifically it's just general


---------04:32----------
life I seem to suck at even though I


---------04:35----------
know what to do you know little things


---------04:37----------
that everybody else seems to define that


---------04:39----------
I tend to struggle with yourself so here


---------04:42----------
we have problem number one right which


---------04:44----------
is what I asked you for something


---------04:46----------
specific like I asked you what direction


---------04:47----------
do you want to move in you say


---------04:50----------
what I'd no idea


---------04:53----------
III don't know I can't pick anything


---------04:56----------
specific there's problem number one


---------04:58----------
right so like what you're talking about


---------05:00----------
is sucking at life which I too have


---------05:02----------
sucked at life in in my life it's it's


---------05:04----------
something that I think is quite common


---------05:06----------
and the first problem is that like


---------05:08----------
you're trying to fix something that is


---------05:10----------
so broad and you don't know you're


---------05:12----------
saying that you see an invisible wall


---------05:13----------
but I think the basic problem is like


---------05:15----------
are you hitting W a s or D right like


---------05:21----------
which direction are you trying to go in


---------05:23----------
you're not able to give me a clear


---------05:24----------
direction so that's problem number one I


---------05:26----------
supposed to use that analogy it's like I


---------05:29----------
can't go in that direction


---------05:31----------
pressing WASD and I can't move yeah but


---------05:34----------
so so I'll ask you one more time and I


---------05:37----------
don't know if this is gonna be kind of


---------05:38----------
like oddly stubborn but pick something


---------05:45----------
sure let's say it's a health okay so


---------05:48----------
let's talk about health


---------05:52----------
tell me about your health yeah I'm very


---------05:56----------
overweight I I'm not sure how much I


---------06:00----------
weigh now but uh she's a good example


---------06:02----------
I've been going to the gym I've recently


---------06:06----------
started going again that hasn't been


---------06:08----------
great but before then goodbye I was


---------06:10----------
going figure I was going for like three


---------06:12----------
years straight now yeah that's what time


---------06:15----------
should be it is she was the kicker I


---------06:18----------
really didn't lose that much anyway


---------06:20----------
oh thanks because I'll say I'm watching


---------06:22----------
the right things but I know what to do


---------06:24----------
in fact I'd say I know probably more


---------06:27----------
about about you know healthy diet than


---------06:32----------
most people


---------06:33----------
yeah I absolutely have knowledge but I


---------06:34----------
just can't but it in place for some


---------06:36----------
reason I gained a tremendous amount of


---------06:39----------
strength and muscle mass but and I found


---------06:43----------
a passion for working out but that's


---------06:46----------
that's an example of an invisible wall


---------06:49----------
for me okay so you're saying that you


---------06:53----------
didn't make progress or you did make


---------06:54----------
progress I made progress


---------06:59----------
and I gained like something silly like


---------07:01----------
20 pounds more muscle in a year so I


---------07:06----------
made massive progress I gained a


---------07:08----------
tremendous amount of strength and size


---------07:11----------
but you know in my peak even though I


---------07:15----------
was working out I still weighed and I


---------07:18----------
have wait I weighed myself in that time


---------07:21----------
520 pounds okay yeah and so I can't wait


---------07:26----------
okay so I think that the natural thing


---------07:29----------
to do is to ask you about the other


---------07:31----------
things that you were doing to work out


---------07:34----------
right like what are you eating right and


---------07:35----------
things like that so they're like that's


---------07:36----------
the direction that instinctively we


---------07:39----------
would go I'm actually gonna steer clear


---------07:41----------
of it because I don't think that's the


---------07:42----------
issue so yep go ahead there's no you're


---------07:46----------
absolutely right I it was dyed


---------07:48----------
absolutely and I know what it is but I


---------07:50----------
don't okay so that's what we want to


---------07:54----------
talk about right the issue here isn't


---------07:56----------
that you know you need to fix your diet


---------07:58----------
the issue here is that you're not able


---------07:59----------
to fix it so yeah what what gets in the


---------08:03----------
way of what what is it let's so let's


---------08:05----------
define things so I think this is like


---------08:07----------
problem number one that people have is


---------08:08----------
that when you're saying that you suck at


---------08:10----------
life like I don't think that that is a


---------08:12----------
problem that is solvable that's not an


---------08:14----------
action there's no action you can take so


---------08:18----------
this is important to understand Chris so


---------08:19----------
I'm gonna just talk for a little bit


---------08:21----------
okay all right so if you want to fix a


---------08:23----------
problem it requires a human being to


---------08:25----------
take an action agree or disagree agree


---------08:30----------
so the first problem is like what is the


---------08:32----------
action to fix sucking it life but to do


---------08:39----------
something about it


---------08:40----------
what does that mean to do something


---------08:42----------
about it that's not an action to take


---------08:45----------
action towards fix yourself whatever


---------08:48----------
yeah what is that like I'm asking you so


---------08:51----------
I come to you crucify nice a I suck at


---------08:53----------
life what should I do


---------08:55----------
good right that's a goal that's not an


---------09:00----------
action right do you see that you see the


---------09:04----------
difference here sure you hear so I think


---------09:06----------
the first problem that many people


---------09:08----------
suffer form gamers especially is that


---------09:11----------
they pick they focus on goals


---------09:13----------
and don't define their problems in terms


---------09:15----------
of like actionable solutions yes yeah


---------09:19----------
yeah right so so that's the first thing


---------09:22----------
that we've got to change because the


---------09:24----------
human mind cannot you're talking about


---------09:26----------
an invisible wall but I what I'm getting


---------09:28----------
from you is not just a wall we'll get to


---------09:30----------
what that wall is but a sense of like


---------09:32----------
lack of direction about what what you


---------09:34----------
want to go you know that you want to


---------09:35----------
achieve a goal like this is like saying


---------09:37----------
like I want to be a millionaire one day


---------09:39----------
gosh right that's and then but what's


---------09:42----------
the action how do I become a millionaire


---------09:46----------
Yeah right so I think the first problem


---------09:49----------
is that your your prob the way that you


---------09:51----------
define your problem is not a definition


---------09:55----------
that leads to a solution you're defining


---------09:59----------
your problem like you can't fix someone


---------10:01----------
who sucks at life that's not something


---------10:03----------
you can fix


---------10:03----------
yeah does that make sense you with me


---------10:06----------
yeah totally


---------10:07----------
so this is what happens when we so the


---------10:09----------
really interesting thing about this you


---------10:11----------
play video games oh yeah yeah a lot no


---------10:17----------
I'm pretty pretty controls it accounts


---------10:20----------
the video games how many what do you


---------10:22----------
play anything recently I've been


---------10:26----------
installed eval you cuz my girlfriend's


---------10:27----------
been playing it a lot have a bit of fun


---------10:31----------
with herself okay I've been playing that


---------10:33----------
much okay that's something that we got


---------10:35----------
to explore at some point why you need a


---------10:38----------
better farm than your girlfriend to run


---------10:41----------
in her face yeah did you did you play a


---------10:44----------
lot of games when you were growing up


---------10:46----------
yeah yeah I think so like what oh I was


---------10:52----------
super into you my show again Motown be


---------10:54----------
oblivion when I was very young yeah it's


---------10:57----------
awesome yeah I I didn't have a game or I


---------11:01----------
couldn't afford the game for longest


---------11:02----------
time I just remember watching YouTube


---------11:04----------
videos every single day on it and then


---------11:07----------
when I eventually got it I think you


---------11:10----------
pretty much everything about the game


---------11:11----------
and I loved it thanks funny I remember


---------11:14----------
the first time I played the Battle of


---------11:16----------
kawatche yeah because I hadn't I didn't


---------11:20----------
know anything about it I was like this


---------11:21----------
is insane


---------11:22----------
it's it's like one of my best gaming


---------11:24----------
memories ever the


---------11:26----------
Bolivians fantastic so I think you know


---------11:29----------
let's just talk about oblivion for a


---------11:30----------
second so like how does oblivion tell


---------11:33----------
you have you played morrowind


---------11:37----------
introduction okay so this is gonna be


---------11:40----------
kind of obscure and I I don't think most


---------11:41----------
people are gonna get this but do you


---------11:43----------
understand like what do you like how do


---------11:45----------
you how can I say this so the problem


---------11:49----------
that gamers have is basically like the


---------11:51----------
difference between morrowind


---------11:52----------
and Oblivion they're used to playing


---------11:55----------
oblivion but real life is like morrowind


---------11:57----------
it's not like oblivion and I'll tell you


---------11:59----------
exactly what I mean by that in in


---------12:01----------
morrowind


---------12:02----------
do you know what a quest looks like in


---------12:05----------
morrowind No so this is kind of weird


---------12:12----------
because they don't make quests like this


---------12:14----------
anymore morrowind was a game where they


---------12:16----------
would tell you like hey I want you to go


---------12:17----------
to this cave and get this thing just


---------12:19----------
like in Oblivion and all of the other


---------12:21----------
games like Wow and stuff like that the


---------12:22----------
difference is they would tell you no


---------12:24----------
they wouldn't give you any information


---------12:25----------
or they give you like bizarre directions


---------12:28----------
about how to get there there are no


---------12:29----------
quest markers they tell you like you


---------12:31----------
need to leave from the South Gate and


---------12:33----------
follow the river until you cross the


---------12:35----------
river and once you cross the river


---------12:37----------
instead of getting back on the road you


---------12:38----------
need to head east and then there's gonna


---------12:40----------
be a fork in the road and then you need


---------12:41----------
to head south and then there's gonna be


---------12:43----------
a big rock and then from the big rock


---------12:45----------
you go there what is oblivion do when it


---------12:48----------
gives you a quest


---------12:52----------
it gives you an objective marker yeah


---------12:56----------
right so gamers are really good at


---------13:00----------
following a quest marker but the problem


---------13:03----------
is when you say you suck at life like


---------13:05----------
what is the quest marker for that ya


---------13:09----------
don't have one exactly right so you say


---------13:13----------
you know what you need to do because


---------13:15----------
you're kind of saying like okay I need


---------13:17----------
to improve my diet but improving your


---------13:19----------
diet is not actually a quest marker it's


---------13:21----------
a goal it's like a nebulous objective


---------13:23----------
yeah the question is what are the


---------13:26----------
actions that you need to take because


---------13:28----------
sucking it life is like I don't I mean


---------13:31----------
that's not something you can fix


---------13:34----------
yeah right so like let's


---------13:37----------
let's talk about so what is something


---------13:40----------
that you want to change like like define


---------13:42----------
something for me you want to go with


---------13:43----------
back to wait we can go back to wait


---------13:45----------
that's fine uh sure


---------13:48----------
okay let's just wait because we've


---------13:50----------
established it it's okay so what if I


---------13:54----------
were to tell you crucify can't lose


---------13:56----------
weight it's impossible what I say being


---------13:58----------
correct right okay so tell me what is


---------14:01----------
the action that results in weight loss


---------14:04----------
uh eating healthy foods eating less okay


---------14:08----------
so if I if I so this is important to


---------14:11----------
understand what is the verb so weight


---------14:14----------
loss is not a verb right but what is


---------14:18----------
weight loss like what is it I get what


---------14:24----------
you're saying I mean explain it to


---------14:26----------
everyone else


---------14:27----------
sure sure is I'm not making something no


---------14:29----------
did I lose weight you can't just say you


---------14:31----------
know I'm gonna lose weight and then not


---------14:33----------
do anything you have to go you have to


---------14:35----------
buy healthy foods you have to stock your


---------14:36----------
shelves at home with only healthy foods


---------14:38----------
right so do you do that you don't


---------14:40----------
healthy no yes No okay right see now


---------14:45----------
we're getting somewhere right so now


---------14:46----------
there's a difference between losing so


---------14:48----------
this is important you can't lose weight


---------14:51----------
that's not an action you can go and buy


---------14:54----------
healthy foods and stock them on your


---------14:56----------
shelf that is not weight loss agreed jr.


---------15:00----------
but that is how you get to weight loss


---------15:03----------
mmm so in your mind I think part of your


---------15:06----------
problem is that you're thinking in terms


---------15:07----------
of goals and you're not thinking in


---------15:11----------
terms of actions but as a human being


---------15:13----------
you cannot actually accomplish a goal


---------15:16----------
you can only take an action


---------15:20----------
I see you krinkle your eyebrows which is


---------15:22----------
perfect so tell me what's what are you


---------15:25----------
thinking um I'm thinking in general I


---------15:29----------
don't like I know that it takes actions


---------15:33----------
and I know what I have to do but perhaps


---------15:36----------
it's an issue of motivation rather than


---------15:39----------
the not taking action


---------15:43----------
because I actively make an attempt to


---------15:46----------
take action


---------15:49----------
okay okay so I think that's a piece of


---------15:53----------
it too so step one is to first of all


---------15:58----------
recognize that sucking at life is not a


---------16:00----------
solvable problem so we have to define


---------16:04----------
something in a way that we have to set a


---------16:06----------
quest marker that you can move towards


---------16:08----------
so some people struggle because they the


---------16:12----------
goals that they set for themselves are


---------16:14----------
so nebulous that they don't know how to


---------16:16----------
start and when you say you suck at life


---------16:18----------
that screams to me I don't know where to


---------16:20----------
start because you say that every


---------16:22----------
dimension of my life is a problem right


---------16:24----------
so that is a problem of ill-defined


---------16:27----------
problems so yeah totally get you to


---------16:31----------
shorten this a little bit I guess I


---------16:33----------
explained it badly I mean I untie can


---------16:36----------
action I'm going to the gym that's a


---------16:40----------
form of action I'm doing yep


---------16:41----------
great attempting of my best to eat


---------16:44----------
healthier by filling my shopping with


---------16:46----------
healthier foods meat and veggies I you


---------16:50----------
know bindery also it makes it easier for


---------16:52----------
me to cook takes less time things like


---------16:53----------
that great


---------16:56----------
yeah so it feels like that's not the


---------17:01----------
issue


---------17:01----------
okay so let's yeah let's move so what do


---------17:04----------
you think is the issue


---------17:08----------
so that's the issue I don't know what


---------17:10----------
the issue is and I can't put my finger


---------17:12----------
on it okay but I don't think it's it's a


---------17:15----------
matter of I get what you're saying you


---------17:17----------
know you have to focus on each step


---------17:19----------
you're taking instead of yeah when you


---------17:21----------
end up and yeah I'm not sure it's okay


---------17:24----------
so what happens when you try to take a


---------17:26----------
step so you're saying that when you try


---------17:28----------
to take a step you've defined that you


---------17:30----------
need to take one step forward


---------17:32----------
something gets in the way of you taking


---------17:33----------
a step forward and what what goes into


---------17:35----------
that


---------17:36----------
sure here's another thing right I


---------17:39----------
currently not working I would like to


---------17:43----------
have more money by getting a job is


---------17:46----------
working but whenever I do try to get a


---------17:50----------
job and work and I've been anywhere from


---------17:52----------
IT support at a school to coca-cola


---------17:56----------
salesperson I end up getting depressed


---------18:00----------
and suicidal


---------18:01----------
in fact I I'm on disability because


---------18:03----------
whenever I go into a job I I don't care


---------18:08----------
about my life anymore


---------18:10----------
so it's strange yeah what's strange


---------18:13----------
about that I I think it's strange


---------18:16----------
because I don't have the motivation to


---------18:19----------
maintain my life I guess I mean if you


---------18:23----------
told me you need to get a job right now


---------18:24----------
otherwise you're homeless you know


---------18:27----------
you're gonna die I don't think it would


---------18:30----------
change what I did on a daily basis


---------18:33----------
hmm yeah okay and I tribute for how i


---------18:38----------
lost thinking perhaps maybe that has


---------18:40----------
that's a lot of the issue maybe yeah so


---------18:44----------
I think it's strange that when you start


---------18:46----------
to actually move towards your quest


---------18:48----------
marker you feel depressed and suicidal


---------18:50----------
yes that's really strange I think we've


---------18:55----------
got to figure out what's the deal there


---------18:56----------
because I think part of the reason that


---------18:58----------
you're not making progress per se is


---------19:00----------
because when you make progress you start


---------19:03----------
to feel worse that's what I'm hearing


---------19:06----------
from you that's very it's not as strange


---------19:08----------
as people think but I'm gonna call that


---------19:09----------
strange so let's understand what the


---------19:11----------
[ __ ] is going on there


---------19:12----------
right I never thought about that but


---------19:15----------
that actually is pretty accurate that's


---------19:18----------
never clicked with me before but that's


---------19:20----------
okay so are you thinking about other


---------19:23----------
things in your life for which that's


---------19:24----------
true yeah tell me about this I will


---------19:30----------
fitness it seems to be whenever I get


---------19:32----------
whenever I'm making progress it goes


---------19:36----------
downhill again worse now let's be clear


---------19:41----------
when you say goes downhill are you


---------19:43----------
talking about the physical progress that


---------19:47----------
you've made or you start to feel


---------19:48----------
something similar to when you get a job


---------19:50----------
I'm soon mental accident right so now


---------19:54----------
we're on to something we're on to a


---------19:55----------
pattern where when crucifix one step


---------19:58----------
forward something in his mind awakens


---------20:01----------
and makes you feel worse and stops you


---------20:04----------
from moving forward


---------20:08----------
- strange yes so now we are


---------20:10----------
spray-painting the wall right there's


---------20:13----------
this wall and you haven't seen it before


---------20:14----------
and now we're spray-painting and it's


---------20:16----------
like hey there's something here let's


---------20:18----------
figure out what this is


---------20:20----------
so what other parts of your life do you


---------20:23----------
think that happens


---------20:29----------
specifically I mean we can we can say a


---------20:32----------
lot of things with this generally


---------20:35----------
looking after myself day-to-day you know


---------20:37----------
the motivation to get up in the shower


---------20:40----------
when I run like you know keeping my


---------20:43----------
house clean and I'm getting better so to


---------20:46----------
speak getting out of that slump yeah


---------20:48----------
looking after myself


---------20:50----------
it comes back and I get more and more


---------20:54----------
depressed and more progress I made yeah


---------20:57----------
like isn't that weird man yeah


---------21:03----------
so now you're describing something that


---------21:05----------
is not the original problem you were


---------21:07----------
describing you were saying when you try


---------21:09----------
to move forward there's an invisible


---------21:11----------
wall that prevents you from moving


---------21:13----------
forward but what I'm hearing from you is


---------21:15----------
something else it's like you're attached


---------21:17----------
to a spot with a rubber band


---------21:20----------
and the harder you run away from the


---------21:22----------
spot the harder the rubber band pulls


---------21:24----------
you back yeah yeah right so the first


---------21:30----------
thing is like that's very different from


---------21:32----------
a wall


---------21:41----------
i muted no no like what are you thinking


---------21:49----------
hey yeah okay oh okay there we go


---------21:57----------
what was that I don't know I think we


---------22:00----------
just broke something okay


---------22:02----------
we're we were making progress and


---------22:04----------
discord rubber-banded us back it was the


---------22:07----------
power of my brain clinking yeah that's


---------22:10----------
what happens we just it just blows it


---------22:12----------
blows our internet connections out the


---------22:14----------
wazoo


---------22:14----------
okay so let's talk about the rubber band


---------22:16----------
okay so let's tell me how so let's pick


---------22:19----------
one of these things so now so the


---------22:20----------
interesting thing is you know earlier I


---------22:22----------
was saying that if you suck at life


---------22:24----------
that's like too big of a problem to


---------22:26----------
solve but what I'm recognizing now is


---------22:28----------
like maybe that was actually idiotic of


---------22:30----------
me because what I'm seeing is that you


---------22:31----------
have one thing one pattern that prevents


---------22:36----------
you from moving forward in lots of


---------22:38----------
different directions


---------22:39----------
and that maybe the problem isn't in


---------22:41----------
defining you know it doesn't matter


---------22:44----------
whether you're trying to move north


---------22:45----------
south east or west the problem is that


---------22:46----------
you're attached by a rubber band and so


---------22:48----------
like that your instinctive


---------22:50----------
characterization of the problem was


---------22:51----------
actually better than mine and it was and


---------22:54----------
we're seeing something different which


---------22:55----------
is that what you were saying originally


---------22:57----------
so let's talk let's dig into one of


---------22:59----------
these and try to understand what that


---------23:00----------
rubber band is so pick something [ __ ]


---------23:08----------
okay let's pick the job saying yeah yeah


---------23:20----------
after about a week I feel suicidal can't


---------23:23----------
force myself to go to the job anymore


---------23:25----------
and I'm just not showing up okay so tell


---------23:29----------
me about how do you feel when you apply


---------23:31----------
for a job excited


---------23:34----------
confident it's not something pleasant I


---------23:40----------
don't really like traditional sort of


---------23:43----------
job but it's something you have to do


---------23:45----------
and I feel a bit of pride I don't feel


---------23:50----------
particularly know


---------23:52----------
and the the first week is usually you


---------23:55----------
know fun at some day and then


---------23:58----------
immediately yours down in what way and


---------24:02----------
so one day I just can't [ __ ] do this


---------24:06----------
one day I can't get out of bed one day


---------24:09----------
before that happens like so tell me what


---------24:12----------
day three of your job is like starting


---------24:15----------
to get kind of sick of this okay and


---------24:18----------
what kind of thoughts do you have when


---------24:20----------
you start to get kind of sick of this I


---------24:22----------
don't want to do this [ __ ] why


---------24:25----------
should I yeah why should I be working


---------24:27----------
towards someone else's success wasting


---------24:33----------
time sure I'm not gonna get this time


---------24:36----------
back the average person spends a massive


---------24:39----------
majority of their life working instead


---------24:43----------
of living yeah yeah so that's good I'm


---------24:54----------
just trying to think about how to


---------24:55----------
explain this okay so so the first thing


---------25:01----------
that I want you to notice is that when


---------25:03----------
we think about being unable to follow


---------25:06----------
through with a behavior there's another


---------25:09----------
like minor misdiagnosis that you made


---------25:12----------
which is that you say that one day I


---------25:13----------
wake up and I just can't do it anymore


---------25:15----------
right so like that's like the rubber


---------25:18----------
band snapping back into place but the


---------25:21----------
main thing to understand crucifies that


---------25:23----------
the tension in that rubber band actually


---------25:26----------
starts way before the snapback like if


---------25:29----------
I'm moving against a rubber band I'm


---------25:30----------
gonna feel it pulling against me pulling


---------25:32----------
against me pull against me on day three


---------25:33----------
day four day five day six by day seven


---------25:36----------
you snap back yeah so if you want to


---------25:39----------
stay in your job you have to figure out


---------25:40----------
like that's that's tension that's


---------25:42----------
building up over the course of the week


---------25:44----------
and you're not doing anything about an


---------25:46----------
intention so of course it's gonna


---------25:47----------
overwhelm you at some point yeah so I


---------25:51----------
would hypothesize that you are


---------25:53----------
neglectful of your thoughts and your


---------25:55----------
feelings up until the breaking point


---------25:59----------
yeah that you power through you're a


---------26:02----------
power through kind of guy like you just


---------26:04----------
tough it out and you're like okay I'm


---------26:06----------
gonna go I have to pull myself out of


---------26:07----------
bed I don't want to work for someone


---------26:09----------
else's [ __ ] success like people waste


---------26:11----------
their time but I'm gonna I gotta work so


---------26:14----------
I'm gonna get up


---------26:15----------
I'm gonna go to go to work I'm gonna


---------26:16----------
pull myself out of my bed I'm gonna use


---------26:18----------
willpower to you know go to work the


---------26:22----------
next day and then overtime what's


---------26:25----------
happening is you've got this mental like


---------26:27----------
trash


---------26:28----------
that's like building up in your mind and


---------26:30----------
then at some point the mental trash


---------26:32----------
overwhelms you and then you know you


---------26:35----------
just ghost them so what do you think you


---------26:38----------
should do about that I if I knew I think


---------26:43----------
I'd fixed it yep


---------26:46----------
okay so so I think the problem here is


---------26:50----------
that is that mental trash enters you


---------26:52----------
need to like offload it like as it's


---------26:55----------
happening perhaps a large part of me


---------26:59----------
doesn't want to [ __ ] work though that


---------27:01----------
job you know yep like that


---------27:04----------
that's the trash so here's the problem


---------27:07----------
is that you don't want to let go of your


---------27:08----------
trash yeah I don't I don't want to


---------27:11----------
[ __ ] work shitty jobs that mean


---------27:13----------
nothing there you go


---------27:15----------
right so now we come to the heart of it


---------27:18----------
crucify is your problem is ego your


---------27:22----------
problem is arrogance it's not


---------27:24----------
hopelessness it's not powerlessness


---------27:26----------
it's [ __ ] ego what do you think about


---------27:31----------
that


---------27:38----------
uh-huh I I don't think I think I


---------27:43----------
disagree but I'm wrong that I disagree


---------27:46----------
no no I'm not sure I been right once


---------27:48----------
before today and I've been wrong so let


---------27:51----------
go ahead and disagree I could be wrong


---------27:54----------
maybe I want to disagree because the


---------27:56----------
matter but possible that's some real


---------27:59----------
Freudian level stuff you've got going on


---------28:01----------
there I feel like I don't feel


---------28:04----------
particularly arrogant but I feel like


---------28:05----------
that's what an arrogant I think perhaps


---------28:07----------
so this is important I don't think


---------28:10----------
you're arrogant in the standard way I


---------28:11----------
think you're arrogant in a son script or


---------28:13----------
yogic way and I'll tell you specifically


---------28:16----------
you have a very subtle arrogance you're


---------28:18----------
not mean to other people you don't think


---------28:20----------
your other your other people but I think


---------28:22----------
when you get one of those jobs you start


---------28:25----------
to think lots of thoughts like you are


---------28:27----------
better than this this job is too lowly


---------28:29----------
for you and so you don't want it anymore


---------28:31----------
and you can only subject yourself to


---------28:34----------
that for a certain amount of time


---------28:36----------
totally accurate I wouldn't say the jobs


---------28:39----------
too lowly for me I would say it takes I


---------28:42----------
admire people who could do a job like


---------28:44----------
that because they're hard workers than


---------28:46----------
me and they can deal with [ __ ]


---------28:48----------
better than I can


---------28:50----------
does that make sense yes so I think


---------28:53----------
there are subtleties here okay so I


---------28:55----------
think the first thing is that you do


---------28:57----------
have some ego around this job because I


---------28:59----------
do think that you feel like you're too


---------29:01----------
good for it the other thing is that you


---------29:05----------
have a very defined sense of who you are


---------29:08----------
and who you aren't and your problem is


---------29:11----------
that you're not willing to let go of


---------29:13----------
that


---------29:15----------
you


---------29:18----------
like you're not you're not the kind of


---------29:21----------
person who can work a job like this


---------29:25----------
how does that statement resonate with


---------29:27----------
you it resonates a lot well so I think


---------29:30----------
you go ahead go ahead


---------29:32----------
I feel like that applies to nearly every


---------29:36----------
single job available to me on the


---------29:38----------
standard sort of job market so this


---------29:40----------
let's I completely agree and this is


---------29:43----------
your problem so I want you to just


---------29:48----------
understand this so I don't think you're


---------29:50----------
arrogant in the standard sense but I I


---------29:54----------
shouldn't be working a job like this


---------29:56----------
this is not the kind of job that I


---------29:58----------
should have that's a statement of


---------30:01----------
arrogance yeah does that make sense what


---------30:03----------
we you agree with that yeah sure that's


---------30:06----------
the problem so you have to like let go


---------30:09----------
over the fact that the only thing that


---------30:11----------
you can get are shitty jobs and the


---------30:13----------
problem is like you get excited about a


---------30:14----------
job you go there and then every day that


---------30:16----------
goes by that ego starts to pile up right


---------30:19----------
and says like this is stupid


---------30:21----------
I can't do this this is boring this is I


---------30:23----------
don't think you quite think this is


---------30:25----------
beneath you because but I think there's


---------30:28----------
a lot of like shame and ego involved


---------30:31----------
with like the jobs that you can get and


---------30:33----------
so like you don't want to work because


---------30:35----------
those are not the jobs that you want to


---------30:36----------
work yeah totally but that's that's the


---------30:40----------
problem it's not that you're not willing


---------30:43----------
to work it's that you don't want it's


---------30:44----------
not that you can't work it's that you


---------30:46----------
don't want to work this is not the kind


---------30:48----------
of [ __ ] job that you want yeah yeah


---------30:52----------
that's right that's right I think I'm a


---------30:54----------
very hard worker actually I think you


---------30:56----------
are too I think your problem is not that


---------30:59----------
you're stupid is not that you're lazy in


---------31:01----------
fact I think you have an immense amount


---------31:03----------
of willpower people may look at you and


---------31:05----------
they may think you're lazy they may


---------31:07----------
think that you're not hard-working I


---------31:08----------
completely disagree I think your problem


---------31:11----------
is that you're your ego I think your


---------31:13----------
problem is that you're not willing to


---------31:15----------
work that job for longer than a week


---------31:23----------
yeah it's straight ensuring this when my


---------31:26----------
entire life I've been totally obviously


---------31:28----------
you know ya can told that you're lazy


---------31:30----------
not working hard enough you need to just


---------31:33----------
do it and it doesn't feel that simple to


---------31:35----------
you and then you just try to do it and


---------31:36----------
fail


---------31:37----------
I suppose so this is why I think you


---------31:39----------
actually have a lot of willpower because


---------31:42----------
you try to do it despite these heavy


---------31:45----------
heavy forces pulling you back you can


---------31:48----------
get up and apply for a job again and


---------31:52----------
again and again that actually is


---------31:54----------
incredibly resilient


---------31:57----------
you know your stamin is actually really


---------31:59----------
high I think you have a lot of willpower


---------32:03----------
because walking around inside your head


---------32:06----------
is like it's hard to overcome those


---------32:07----------
forces within you but you're able to do


---------32:09----------
it for stretches of time like that's


---------32:11----------
actually pretty amazing


---------32:15----------
think your problem is that you're not


---------32:16----------
willing to accept where you are right


---------32:19----------
now and that getting out of your


---------32:21----------
position is going to involve some pretty


---------32:23----------
demeaning stuff


---------32:27----------
you're gonna have to start huh you tell


---------32:30----------
me are you telling me to stop kami


---------32:32----------
stop what are you telling me to stop


---------32:35----------
camping on my three cans or something


---------32:37----------
I'm not a mother but Sir what little


---------32:40----------
joke little joke go ahead sorry help I


---------32:42----------
didn't understand yeah that's okay I I


---------32:51----------
have to like bring the mood up a little


---------32:54----------
does get a little bit emotional because


---------32:58----------
you're a you're a wholesome man


---------33:01----------
so so what what let's talk about that


---------33:04----------
what were you feeling emotionally why


---------33:05----------
did you have to break them up


---------33:07----------
I I don't want to try on your [ __ ]


---------33:10----------
Street okay what makes you feel like


---------33:12----------
crying


---------33:15----------
not sure it's it's nice to know that


---------33:20----------
you're not just a piece of [ __ ] and that


---------33:22----------
you're kind of working really hard we'll


---------33:23----------
try so just think about this screw so


---------33:27----------
think about this these are not bad tears


---------33:31----------
these are good tears and what are you


---------33:34----------
doing holding back moving away from them


---------33:41----------
you have gotten so used to the idea that


---------33:44----------
you are lazy and that you're worthless


---------33:47----------
that when you start to realize that


---------33:49----------
you're not it becomes unfamiliar


---------33:51----------
territory and you run no wonder you're


---------33:54----------
stuck because the parts of you that are


---------33:56----------
actually there within you that can help


---------33:59----------
you move forward that are amazing and


---------34:02----------
intelligent and full of willpower and


---------34:03----------
stamina when you see them something


---------34:07----------
about that like scares the [ __ ] out of


---------34:09----------
you and you move away from it don't move


---------34:12----------
away man move towards it look where did


---------34:20----------
you get this idea that you're like lazy


---------34:21----------
and and worthless like where does that


---------34:23----------
come from oh I think you know maybe my


---------34:27----------
family growing up you know I guess


---------34:32----------
they're not psychiatrists right so they


---------34:34----------
don't know any better they just want to


---------34:37----------
help you but they you know but there is


---------34:40----------
a small part of me that says that this


---------34:42----------
is [ __ ] and that's not true and that


---------34:45----------
I am just lazy you know and that you're


---------34:47----------
just telling me what I want to share


---------34:48----------
maybe why I'm accepting that because I


---------34:51----------
want to share it so this is important


---------34:54----------
how does that part of you make you feel


---------34:55----------
and I'll tell you after you I mean I


---------34:59----------
have the hypothesis but how does that


---------35:01----------
part of you make you feel the pocket


---------35:03----------
doubts yeah yep the part that thinks


---------35:06----------
that you're lazy yes see that's weird


---------35:12----------
it makes you feel comfortable so like


---------35:16----------
let's just pause and look at that the


---------35:18----------
part of you that keeps you down makes


---------35:21----------
you feel comfortable and now you're even


---------35:23----------
looking all over the place the part of


---------35:25----------
you that makes you feel hopeful about


---------35:28----------
yourself


---------35:29----------
you retreat from you have to break the


---------35:30----------
tension by making a joke so like just


---------35:33----------
look at your mind for a second you


---------35:35----------
gravitate comfortable is like okay if


---------35:38----------
I'm lazy like I can deal with that I've


---------35:39----------
been told that in my entire life


---------35:41----------
that is comfortable territory it's a


---------35:43----------
game that I played before I know how to


---------35:44----------
play that game and I'm asking you to


---------35:46----------
play a different game we say and if you


---------35:49----------
want to change your life you have to you


---------35:51----------
can't play the game where you gravitate


---------35:53----------
towards the comfort of being lazy and a


---------35:55----------
failure you've got a risk


---------35:58----------
you've got to risk the possibility that


---------36:00----------
you're actually worth something that you


---------36:03----------
can accomplish a lot that if you go to


---------36:05----------
one job you're terrified that one job


---------36:08----------
won't lead to another better job and so


---------36:11----------
you're not willing to play that game


---------36:12----------
because you don't know if you're gonna


---------36:14----------
waste your whole life in a call center


---------36:16----------
that thought is terrifying to you and


---------36:20----------
you don't know if you're gonna be able


---------36:22----------
to move beyond that and so if there's


---------36:25----------
that chance of failure you would rather


---------36:26----------
just quit here's the thing you've got to


---------36:30----------
take a chance that you are better than


---------36:32----------
what you think you are and that's a


---------36:34----------
dangerous game


---------36:52----------
what are you thinking what are you


---------36:53----------
feeling it's uh it's hard to process


---------36:58----------
mm-hmm talk to uh to agree with you and


---------37:05----------
I feel bad for not being able to yeah


---------37:09----------
that's okay you don't have to agree with


---------37:11----------
me so can we agree on one thing so I


---------37:17----------
want to just track back on what's said


---------37:19----------
when I said something to you that made


---------37:22----------
you feel good about yourself how did


---------37:24----------
that make you feel relieved but also a


---------37:31----------
little bit ashamed for some reason yep


---------37:34----------
right so and then you you moved away


---------37:36----------
from it can we agree on that yeah okay


---------37:40----------
and when we talk about you being that


---------37:42----------
when there's that doubting voice in the


---------37:44----------
back of your mind that says actually


---------37:46----------
this guy is just telling you this


---------37:47----------
because he's a nice guy and he says this


---------37:49----------
to everyone he's not really talking


---------37:51----------
about me he doesn't really understand me


---------37:53----------
he's just saying that because that's


---------37:54----------
what he does how does how does that


---------37:58----------
voice make you feel do you move towards


---------38:01----------
it or do you move away from it away no


---------38:06----------
no towards it towards that right so like


---------38:09----------
even if we even if we don't even if I'm


---------38:12----------
wrong can we at least agree that your


---------38:14----------
mind is doing something kind of funny


---------38:16----------
that it's moving away from the things


---------38:19----------
that actually make you feel hopeful and


---------38:21----------
it's moving towards the things that make


---------38:23----------
you feel hopeless there's safety and


---------38:25----------
comfort and being lazy and hopeless and


---------38:29----------
sucking at life yeah and there's


---------38:32----------
discomfort in the possibility that


---------38:35----------
you're something more like those are


---------38:36----------
your emotional reactions right that's


---------38:38----------
not coming from me yeah and now we have


---------38:43----------
this other idea which like kind of


---------38:45----------
parallels with the wall in the rubber


---------38:46----------
band that the weird thing is it's not


---------38:49----------
that something's holding you back it's


---------38:50----------
that when you try to take a step forward


---------38:52----------
instead of embracing the possibility


---------38:55----------
that you're worth something and that you


---------38:56----------
can accomplish something that rubber


---------38:58----------
band pulls you back to that corner of


---------39:00----------
your mind that says that you're lazy and


---------39:02----------
makes you


---------39:03----------
overleaf that's you see that it's the


---------39:06----------
same thing so we're we're seeing a


---------39:09----------
microcosm of what's happening is


---------39:12----------
something going on are you okay uh no


---------39:16----------
I'm okay okay you're just like looking


---------39:18----------
around a lot and I'm trying to figure


---------39:19----------
out am I making you uncomfortable no no


---------39:22----------
no no this is weird yeah


---------39:25----------
what's weird tell me what tell me what


---------39:27----------
that means I didn't think I was I mean I


---------39:30----------
I always thought there was something


---------39:31----------
different and I was sort of [ __ ] up


---------39:33----------
and I needed help yeah I didn't expect


---------39:36----------
this to be the issue I suppose some sort


---------39:39----------
of strange that such a it feels I don't


---------39:45----------
deserve to have this issue it seems like


---------39:48----------
it feels like I'm being told the issue


---------39:50----------
is that you're actually really great


---------39:52----------
person and you just need to apply


---------39:54----------
yourself or something or have faith in


---------39:56----------
yourself and that feels unworthy and


---------39:59----------
stupid yeah absolutely you know why it's


---------40:03----------
stupid so this may be confusing for


---------40:06----------
people right the reason it feels stupid


---------40:09----------
because like if that was the issue


---------40:13----------
you're even more of a failure because


---------40:16----------
this means that you always had the


---------40:17----------
option to do a good job you just chose


---------40:19----------
not to yeah right like this is important


---------40:25----------
this is ego too because if it was


---------40:27----------
something so simple as this then you're


---------40:31----------
a real idiot because you didn't have to


---------40:34----------
live this life but if the issue is


---------40:37----------
something much larger much more grand


---------40:40----------
and much more devastating then you have


---------40:43----------
an excuse for the life that you live and


---------40:47----------
this is scary because like this is


---------40:52----------
something that you need to understand


---------40:53----------
crucifer I mean this is gonna sound kind


---------40:55----------
of cheesy but with great power comes


---------40:56----------
great responsibility and what I see


---------40:58----------
within you is great power and it's


---------41:02----------
absolutely your responsibility


---------41:06----------
your problem is like it's not one of


---------41:08----------
powerlessness it's like the opposite and


---------41:10----------
what did you feel when I said that


---------41:13----------
you like uh you were I I feel really bad


---------41:18----------
but I still feel like it's [ __ ] but


---------41:21----------
what do you mean by feel really bad I


---------41:23----------
feel bad for thinking it's [ __ ]


---------41:27----------
that's okay you're allowed to think it I


---------41:31----------
want to believe it so much I feel like


---------41:34----------
it's too good to be true and I can't get


---------41:36----------
over this hurdle that's fine that


---------41:38----------
bothers me that's okay don't don't try


---------41:42----------
to get over the hurdle I wouldn't I


---------41:45----------
wouldn't beat yourself up for that I


---------41:46----------
don't think you need to get over the


---------41:48----------
hurdle it makes me it feels like it's


---------41:54----------
just like you telling me that I'm not


---------41:56----------
confident enough in myself but I feel


---------42:00----------
like I'm very confident


---------42:03----------
but I feel like it's probably [ __ ]


---------42:05----------
then that makes you right and I don't


---------42:07----------
want you to be right because that means


---------42:09----------
I'm wrong yeah so what do we call that


---------42:16----------
ah


---------42:20----------
I'm not sure is this like a some twitch


---------42:22----------
chat twit twit chat understands ego


---------42:26----------
right that's your [ __ ] problem man


---------42:29----------
who tweet chat and these guys these guys


---------42:31----------
aren't trained right they're there


---------42:34----------
they're like they're noobs because


---------42:40----------
because I'll tell you that here's the


---------42:42----------
operative words I don't want you to be


---------42:44----------
right I want you to be wrong and I want


---------42:47----------
to be right because it would be easier


---------42:50----------
and more comfortable for me if you were


---------42:52----------
less and I could keep sort of just


---------42:55----------
thinking I'm a piece of [ __ ] yes


---------43:00----------
see now you're seeing


---------43:04----------
so let this be a lesson to everyone that


---------43:08----------
if you want to grow it's not easy right


---------43:12----------
because growing is abandoning the things


---------43:15----------
that you believe about yourself growing


---------43:18----------
is actually the process of abandoning


---------43:20----------
what works it's hard growth isn't easy


---------43:24----------
because this has worked for you you've


---------43:27----------
created a comfortable life right and


---------43:31----------
it's kind of like you're just kind of


---------43:33----------
like existing right now and you've


---------43:35----------
created a life that's like decent in a


---------43:36----------
lot of ways and what I'm asking you to


---------43:39----------
duke rusev is risk it


---------43:42----------
if you really want to change you've got


---------43:44----------
a risk you've got a risk because right


---------43:47----------
now you have like you have this like


---------43:49----------
little little got this little safety


---------43:51----------
you've got this trump card in your hand


---------43:53----------
which is that you're not really giving


---------43:55----------
it your all and you're bowing out so you


---------43:58----------
have some excuse your ego has this


---------44:01----------
refuge right it's like there's a


---------44:03----------
difference between the shame of working


---------44:07----------
a dead-end job and not getting promoted


---------44:09----------
and like working a dead-end job and


---------44:12----------
quitting after a week you protect


---------44:13----------
yourself from the possibility you


---------44:16----------
protect yourself from so many things


---------44:18----------
that would be so devastating for you


---------44:20----------
because like what if you worked at the


---------44:22----------
call center and you're smart right cuz


---------44:24----------
you're a smart guy like I can tell that


---------44:26----------
you like a very smart guy and as smart


---------44:29----------
as you are if you don't get promoted


---------44:30----------
egos not gonna like that


---------44:34----------
ya see you say I'm a smart guy but I I


---------44:39----------
mean I also dropped out of school


---------44:40----------
dropped out of college you know I


---------44:44----------
actually that's a pretty big trend huh


---------44:46----------
yep yeah why did you drop out of college


---------44:51----------
Mike's


---------44:55----------
it's sort of different I suppose because


---------44:57----------
my my lecturer at the time did kind of


---------44:59----------
[ __ ] me over a lot and she was a [ __ ]


---------45:02----------
probably still is a [ __ ] okay just so


---------45:06----------
men out there if she's watching I hate


---------45:09----------
you okay something there yeah well I


---------45:15----------
mean yeah no I we came to like the last


---------45:19----------
week before I was you know graduated


---------45:21----------
nice way I guess well sure he gets go


---------45:24----------
over that but uh I was sick for a week


---------45:26----------
fried of that and she took me out of my


---------45:28----------
group that I was working with for like


---------45:30----------
an entire year and then when I said well


---------45:32----------
what do I do now I put all of my work


---------45:36----------
into the screw rod scripts recorded [ __ ]


---------45:39----------
and I did a lot of stuff most of it was


---------45:41----------
my idea


---------45:42----------
she said guess you're gonna do years


---------45:45----------
worth of work in a week and so I walked


---------45:48----------
out and didn't come back to the cost


---------45:51----------
yeah boy did you get screwed over yeah


---------45:57----------
yeah and high school yeah I got bullied


---------46:01----------
quite a bit it was really unhealthy time


---------46:03----------
I was in fights every day that wasn't


---------46:06----------
becoming a very good person that was


---------46:08----------
quite a bad person and suicidal every


---------46:12----------
day and thankfully my parents pulled me


---------46:15----------
out so that's a different situation too


---------46:17----------
yeah I'm feeling like that's different


---------46:21----------
yeah both different yeah so maybe it's


---------46:24----------
not I still think there's a lot of ego


---------46:27----------
with the teacher yeah right you see that


---------46:31----------
yeah yeah I saw it in general maybe


---------46:37----------
okay yeah what do you mean by that uh


---------46:42----------
growing up I always seem to have an


---------46:44----------
issue with authority figures like as you


---------46:46----------
know maybe I don't have it so much now I


---------46:49----------
definitely did I never got along with my


---------46:53----------
ass of lecturers or teachers disagreed


---------46:59----------
with them a lot


---------47:01----------
okay I said that's arrogance right and I


---------47:03----------
think that's pretty typical growing up I


---------47:05----------
don't know I I don't think that's the


---------47:07----------
ego that I'm talking about


---------47:10----------
it could be but I think so crucify you


---------47:14----------
what are you thinking about what we've


---------47:16----------
talked about today so we're we're gonna


---------47:18----------
have to wrap up in like maybe five to


---------47:19----------
ten minutes or see if people have


---------47:20----------
questions so let's just let's try to


---------47:22----------
find some kind of I mean I feel like


---------47:26----------
you've made progress today I've kind of


---------47:29----------
more lost today yep yeah I guess


---------47:34----------
progress yeah


---------47:39----------
tell me why you found us know what to do


---------47:41----------
with myself I don't know this is really


---------47:43----------
overwhelming I suppose yeah I see that


---------47:45----------
that's why okay so let me try to help


---------47:47----------
you okay so I I think I can see why you


---------47:51----------
feel overwhelmed because what I'm doing


---------47:53----------
is I'm taking away I'm pulling the rug


---------47:55----------
out from under you yeah right you've


---------47:58----------
conceptualized your life in some way and


---------48:00----------
you're telling me that you suck at life


---------48:02----------
and so then what I'm trying to do and I


---------48:07----------
think what we've done is change the


---------48:09----------
conception for which you're you have


---------48:12----------
about your life and I think that is a


---------48:14----------
good but painful experience that we've


---------48:18----------
left you lost because like I've told you


---------48:20----------
that the narrative that you've built


---------48:22----------
your life on is actually untrue


---------48:24----------
and that instead of being lazy in


---------48:27----------
sucking it life you're actually


---------48:30----------
intelligent and capable and you were


---------48:32----------
giving me this evidence I'm not just


---------48:34----------
saying this because I'm a nice guy when


---------48:36----------
you say I've been working on a project


---------48:38----------
for a year that I've been directing and


---------48:40----------
doing most of the work for and I got


---------48:41----------
kicked out of it one week from


---------48:43----------
completion what I hear is that maybe


---------48:45----------
this guy has like interpersonal problems


---------48:48----------
and doesn't understand like like what


---------48:50----------
happened in that situation there seems


---------48:52----------
to be another side of that story but I'm


---------48:55----------
also hearing that you were able to like


---------48:57----------
run a project for a year where you did


---------48:59----------
most of the heavy lifting which is


---------49:00----------
actually consistent with what I think


---------49:02----------
about so I don't think that you're


---------49:05----------
incapable but that's dangerous because


---------49:09----------
if you're capable then whose fault is it


---------49:12----------
that you're in this situation I don't


---------49:15----------
okay I know I know you don't so then we


---------49:20----------
get to this so this is what I want you


---------49:21----------
to focus on is that there are some


---------49:24----------
things in life so I want you to stop


---------49:26----------
thinking so the invisible wall is a lack


---------49:29----------
of capability right those two things are


---------49:31----------
the same but the rubberband is not like


---------49:36----------
your focus on you being capable is the


---------49:39----------
or incapable is the rubberband pulling


---------49:41----------
you back and we can see evidence of that


---------49:43----------
because when you actually start to move


---------49:45----------
forward what happened


---------49:49----------
I go back yes it's you that goes


---------49:53----------
backwards it's you're not telling me


---------49:55----------
that you fail you're not you've never


---------49:56----------
said that to me right you say that when


---------50:00----------
I am actually making progress this weird


---------50:03----------
things happens in my mind where I come


---------50:05----------
back to the center yeah that's not a


---------50:09----------
lack of capability that's like something


---------50:11----------
you pulling you back to the center


---------50:13----------
that's that's like something within you


---------50:14----------
so if you want and the other thing is


---------50:17----------
this is pervasive in your life you see


---------50:19----------
it in working out you see it in school


---------50:20----------
you see it in jobs there's something


---------50:22----------
about you and they're like the one


---------50:24----------
emotional moment that you just you know


---------50:26----------
head like you just made some kind of


---------50:27----------
weird joke I I still understand but like


---------50:29----------
you know I'm sure it was and and so like


---------50:33----------
that's the one time over this interview


---------50:36----------
I mean I've called you all kinds of


---------50:37----------
things that people may find offensive


---------50:39----------
and none of that you had to block you


---------50:43----------
don't have to block any of it right you


---------50:45----------
don't even realize I was saying this


---------50:46----------
stuff some of the stuff that I've said


---------50:47----------
to use it like could be mean in other


---------50:48----------
circumstances yeah the thing that you


---------50:52----------
huh I think I'm wrong yes I think so I


---------50:57----------
want you to watch this interview right


---------50:59----------
and see what it is that you retreat from


---------51:01----------
we see you running away from it and


---------51:03----------
that's actually the feeling of hope and


---------51:08----------
and it's not as simple as like you're


---------51:11----------
saying I think you're saying that I just


---------51:13----------
need confidence and believing in myself


---------51:14----------
no man like that's it's not that simple


---------51:16----------
it's way harder than that


---------51:18----------
what you need to do is like what budva


---------51:20----------
did in his life which is like become


---------51:22----------
enlightened like you'd that's the road


---------51:23----------
you're walking it's a hard road it's


---------51:26----------
it's a road about grappling against


---------51:28----------
yourself the search for enlightenment is


---------51:30----------
it has nothing to do at the external


---------51:31----------
world it has to do it the final boss of


---------51:34----------
life is yourself


---------51:36----------
it's not anything else it's you and


---------51:38----------
you're saying like oh I just need to


---------51:40----------
have content no man like you don't


---------51:42----------
understand like how big this like


---------51:45----------
Tyrannosaurus Rex of yourself is that


---------51:48----------
you have to overcome but I have faith


---------51:49----------
that you can do it you just need to


---------51:51----------
start trying


---------51:53----------
so through it not just do it awareness


---------51:57----------
what your problem has never been your


---------52:00----------
inability to just do it in fact you've


---------52:02----------
told me time and time again that you're


---------52:04----------
capable of just doing it you pull


---------52:06----------
yourself out of the gutter and you apply


---------52:07----------
for a job and you show up there and then


---------52:09----------
the next day you just do it and the next


---------52:11----------
day you just do it and the next day that


---------52:12----------
you just do it and eventually you just


---------52:14----------
run out of energy and you quit your


---------52:16----------
problem is not just doing it your


---------52:17----------
problem is a lack of awareness about


---------52:19----------
what are the forces inside you that keep


---------52:22----------
you from doing it so this is what I want


---------52:26----------
you to pay attention to I want you to


---------52:28----------
try something you pick what it is Jim


---------52:31----------
job whatever and I want you to look for


---------52:34----------
this this dichotomy look for this


---------52:36----------
confusing thing look for this sense that


---------52:38----------
as you start to move up you pull


---------52:42----------
yourself back notice that force within


---------52:44----------
you notice the force of the rubber band


---------52:46----------
and see it happening and then recognize


---------52:49----------
that it's not actually a lack of


---------52:50----------
capability it's you yourself are telling


---------52:54----------
yourself to retreat to the safety of


---------52:56----------
your life of nothingness see that thing


---------53:00----------
it's like a gravitational pull and see


---------53:03----------
that thing happening within you if you


---------53:05----------
give in to it that's fine if you don't


---------53:08----------
give in to it that's better but the most


---------53:11----------
important thing is awareness awareness


---------53:13----------
awareness understanding understanding


---------53:15----------
understanding the reason that you can't


---------53:18----------
see the wall is because it's not there


---------53:20----------
man it's a rubber band it's not a wall


---------53:24----------
so the solution to the issue is to


---------53:27----------
understand when it's happening what's


---------53:29----------
happening and you can try to push don't


---------53:33----------
even try to push through that's even


---------53:35----------
like let it happen just watch first okay


---------53:41----------
pushing through is what you do what I


---------53:44----------
would say is see that it happens and


---------53:47----------
then actually don't push through it


---------53:48----------
accept it and move on despite it okay


---------53:53----------
understand that that is a part of you


---------53:55----------
understand that you have this little


---------53:56----------
thing that's sitting on your shoulder


---------53:58----------
that's gonna be with you


---------54:00----------
and it doesn't mean that you push it off


---------54:02----------
you don't fight against it you


---------54:03----------
acknowledge it and you move forward


---------54:05----------
that's actually a solution it's not


---------54:07----------
pushing through because pushing through


---------54:10----------
is like I know it sounds like this is a


---------54:12----------
semantic thing but good but you don't


---------54:14----------
want to just pushing through implies


---------54:16----------
blindness to me yeah right you want to


---------54:20----------
acknowledge it and understand that you


---------54:22----------
may not be ready to push you may not be


---------54:24----------
ready to accept it what you actually


---------54:26----------
need towards yourself is not pushing


---------54:28----------
through also implies like a certain


---------54:29----------
sense of combating or antagonism it's


---------54:32----------
like you versus it that's not a battle


---------54:34----------
you can win the games that you play


---------54:36----------
against yourself only have one loser


---------54:39----------
sure right so like you don't want to


---------54:43----------
play that game what you actually need


---------54:44----------
towards yourself is compassion


---------54:47----------
acknowledgement/recognition and


---------54:49----------
compassion not willpower not energy not


---------54:53----------
intelligence see that thing happening


---------54:55----------
within you you'll be amazed if you


---------54:59----------
practice this yeah and then if it


---------55:02----------
happens you cut yourself some slack


---------55:04----------
right you can say okay day three I don't


---------55:06----------
want to go to work I feel like this is a


---------55:09----------
waste of time and then you say oh this


---------55:11----------
is that part of me I don't know what it


---------55:12----------
is it's bitter it feels like this is


---------55:15----------
beneath me it's egotistical like that's


---------55:18----------
a piece of me that is activating within


---------55:20----------
my mind because it's not there right now


---------55:22----------
it only happens when you like leave the


---------55:24----------
house and try to do something with your


---------55:25----------
life like you see that means like a trap


---------55:28----------
that it's like the ego trap that arises


---------55:30----------
when you try to do something with your


---------55:32----------
life yeah and if you fall victim to it


---------55:35----------
that's fine other things practically you


---------55:38----------
can do do you see a therapist


---------55:41----------
I would like to okay do you not live


---------55:43----------
where do you live I live in the UK okay


---------55:47----------
so mental was kind of horrible okay so


---------55:50----------
as best as you can try to find a


---------55:52----------
therapist because I think if you can get


---------55:54----------
some assistance if you could party up


---------55:55----------
with someone and work through this stuff


---------55:58----------
as it's happening I think it's gonna


---------55:59----------
help


---------56:00----------
I see a consultant psychiatrist every


---------56:03----------
few months but last conversation I had


---------56:06----------
with them was pretty a pretty ridiculous


---------56:09----------
in the band I've asked them for to see a


---------56:11----------
therapist but they don't seem willing


---------56:14----------
that's strange I don't understand the UK


---------56:17----------
health system sorry you're in that


---------56:18----------
situation yeah um I mean I I know that


---------56:24----------
sometimes you know psychiatrists they


---------56:27----------
don't do a great job and I'm sorry


---------56:29----------
you're kind of in that situation but I


---------56:30----------
think that as best as you can try to


---------56:33----------
find someone to help you work through


---------56:35----------
this stuff the last thing is meditate so


---------56:39----------
if you really want to get good at this


---------56:41----------
meditation is the practice of noticing


---------56:45----------
things within yourself so that they do


---------56:46----------
not have control that is what meditation


---------56:49----------
is about yeah so as you meditate you


---------56:52----------
will notice forces like as you train


---------56:54----------
yourself to meditate you train yourself


---------56:56----------
to focus your attention on the thing


---------56:58----------
that you choose to focus your attention


---------57:00----------
on and literally the reason that I want


---------57:02----------
you to meditate is as this specter Rises


---------57:04----------
within you as this like trap rises


---------57:06----------
within you that's thinking all these


---------57:08----------
thoughts if you are a trained meditator


---------57:10----------
you can actually tell your mind I'm not


---------57:12----------
gonna look over here all of these


---------57:14----------
thoughts about how this is worthless and


---------57:16----------
my boss is an [ __ ] and I'm working


---------57:17----------
for someone else's stuff in capitalism


---------57:19----------
is bad you co you look over here and you


---------57:22----------
say I'm gonna work because this is what


---------57:23----------
I've decided for myself yeah and that


---------57:27----------
this is what I want to do what would you


---------57:30----------
recommend for me


---------57:33----------
- do you know I looked at John Marcin


---------57:36----------
and I really hate the idea of doing


---------57:38----------
anything I have my own aspirations that


---------57:40----------
I'd like to do yep but I felt like I had


---------57:44----------
a lack of focus and I lost interest and


---------57:46----------
maybe that was just this rubber banding


---------57:49----------
now that I would like to try out again


---------57:51----------
yes I think ego exists in the space


---------57:56----------
between your aspirations and the job


---------57:59----------
that you can get so this is important


---------58:01----------
the wider the job that you want is from


---------58:06----------
the job that you can get the bigger your


---------58:08----------
ego is going to be yeah and you just


---------58:11----------
have to understand like you have to see


---------58:12----------
that that's ego and you just don't want


---------58:14----------
a go to be running your life so if you


---------58:16----------
decide to get a job I think get a job


---------58:18----------
and just recognize that you're gonna


---------58:19----------
feel bad for a while and recognize that


---------58:21----------
the reason that you're getting the job


---------58:23----------
is not to get a job not to get a career


---------58:25----------
not to make money the reason you are


---------58:28----------
getting a job crucify you can have an


---------58:31----------
experimental laboratory for yourself in


---------58:34----------
the feelings that arise that that


---------58:36----------
happened within you when you try to move


---------58:37----------
forward in life that's the reason you


---------58:39----------
need to get a job if you get a job


---------58:41----------
fantastic if you make money fantastic if


---------58:43----------
you get promoted fantastic you need to


---------58:45----------
start living your life as a laboratory


---------58:47----------
because your problem is a lack of


---------58:49----------
understanding and really I mean I said


---------58:52----------
this earlier but I think the the reason


---------58:54----------
if the wall is invisible because it's


---------58:55----------
like that's not what's holding you back


---------58:57----------
that's why you can't see it so you have


---------59:00----------
to understand what's holding you back


---------59:02----------
and the only way to do that is to like


---------59:04----------
get in the ring and like get into the


---------59:05----------
water and feel your feelings see what


---------59:07----------
happens within yourself and ideal it's


---------59:09----------
very hard to do on your own by the way


---------59:11----------
so like really good if you can find some


---------59:13----------
kind of professional help even if you


---------59:15----------
enjoy like a meditation center or


---------59:16----------
something like that and have that


---------59:18----------
meditation centers yeah


---------59:21----------
oh well I don't know where you live but


---------59:23----------
maybe there's I live in Wales in the UK


---------59:25----------
it's kind of a pretty shitty where I


---------59:27----------
live in swarms that we don't have many


---------59:29----------
like sounds like that but I can


---------59:32----------
certainly try meditating yeah so so


---------59:34----------
meditate on it before okay so we're


---------59:37----------
gonna do we're gonna do meditation now


---------59:39----------
unless you have questions hold on one


---------59:41----------
second let me just see if other people


---------59:43----------
have questions


---------59:46----------
yeah I'd love time so any course I have


---------59:50----------
any questions I


---------59:54----------
I have a chat thing boomer into my way


---------60:00----------
into how do you get anyone without


---------60:03----------
learning about all this technical oh


---------60:05----------
it's it's it's great I mean I have so


---------60:07----------
many people to help me so okay let me


---------60:11----------
just see


---------60:15----------
okay


---------60:24----------
okay I'm seeing lots of questions I


---------60:26----------
don't think


---------60:29----------
I don't think any of them were really


---------60:31----------
directed towards you per se


---------60:37----------
you


---------60:40----------
okay


---------60:43----------
okay so like here here someone's asking


---------60:49----------
what kind of work would you burn to do


---------60:51----------
what are your aspirations that's a good


---------60:52----------
question


---------60:54----------
voice acting is something I'd love to do


---------60:57----------
well dude twitch chat was talking about


---------61:01----------
that they think that you'd be a great Oh


---------61:03----------
exhibit yeah yeah I saw it the entire


---------61:07----------
time yeah I think I do I think I'd be a


---------61:12----------
really good voice actor but I guess


---------61:13----------
that's the issue right if I felt like I


---------61:15----------
was a gonna be a [ __ ] voice actor I


---------61:17----------
guess I'd be one by now isn't that my


---------61:19----------
issue yes so that well I mean on a


---------61:22----------
practical sense there may be like how do


---------61:23----------
you become a voice actor I have no idea


---------61:25----------
it's kind of difficult I suppose it


---------61:28----------
would just be trying out for different


---------61:31----------
roles getting your voice out there yeah


---------61:34----------
well that's great man so I think you


---------61:37----------
should try that let's just move to LA


---------61:46----------
okay mm-hmm all right so so I think some


---------61:49----------
of these questions are relate to you but


---------61:51----------
I think they're more directed towards me


---------61:52----------
so that they're questions like how can


---------61:54----------
you overcome the ego that arises within


---------61:59----------
what you're saying sounds good to him


---------62:01----------
but his problem is ignoring what should


---------62:03----------
be done how can he change that so like


---------62:04----------
these are questions that I think or if


---------62:06----------
he if he tries to improve and then gets


---------62:08----------
pulled back by the rubber and says screw


---------62:10----------
everything we talked about I'm going to


---------62:11----------
my comfort zone what should one do to


---------62:13----------
prevent that and still stick to what one


---------62:15----------
knows is needed to improve okay these


---------62:17----------
are all questions that I think are


---------62:18----------
related to you so first of all Creuset I


---------62:20----------
really want to thank you for coming on


---------62:22----------
because I do for having you gave me the


---------62:27----------
time of day on nobody I I did reach out


---------62:30----------
to you when you had like 200 years in


---------62:32----------
the stream so didn't expect reckful then


---------62:34----------
you know sky and then destiny to come on


---------62:36----------
so that was great


---------62:39----------
in my time today why do you think you're


---------62:42----------
nobody


---------62:45----------
haha [ __ ] I am like it why wouldn't I


---------62:56----------
give you the time of day because I have


---------63:00----------
nothing to give back to you well I guess


---------63:02----------
I have to give me something back huh


---------63:04----------
yeah yeah well I guess I'm wrong how


---------63:08----------
does that feel pretty shitty ha


---------63:11----------
judgement yep


---------63:13----------
so hard to admit that you have Worth and


---------63:16----------
value and you've helped other people man


---------63:20----------
there's your [ __ ] problem I'd like to


---------63:27----------
help people more good start by helping


---------63:31----------
yourself sure yeah see like it's all


---------63:36----------
wrapped up in there like this sort of


---------63:38----------
pervasive sense of lack of self-worth


---------63:40----------
and inability to help someone that I'm


---------63:41----------
is someone and you're and no one like


---------63:43----------
who do you think is helping more people


---------63:45----------
right now me are you but you definitely


---------63:48----------
I disagree


---------63:50----------
if I if I just came on stream and


---------63:53----------
started talking I don't think I'd


---------63:54----------
helping you you being sure no I couldn't


---------64:00----------
come to it I wouldn't have figured out


---------64:02----------
what this situation was yeah but you're


---------64:04----------
the like who are people learning from me


---------64:07----------
are you both sure I think they're


---------64:12----------
learning more from you than they're


---------64:13----------
learning from me I think they see


---------64:16----------
themselves within you and I think it


---------64:19----------
takes a certain amount of courage to


---------64:21----------
come on here and to air your dirty


---------64:24----------
laundry and to speak honestly and


---------64:26----------
authentically about yourself and I don't


---------64:29----------
know if you recognize this but crucifer


---------64:32----------
you watch this stream like it's not


---------64:36----------
about me talking it's about the people


---------64:38----------
who come on that's what you resonate


---------64:41----------
with like you get that like people are


---------64:47----------
here


---------64:48----------
and that so that's like I know it's hard


---------64:51----------
for you to accept and I know you keep on


---------64:53----------
defaulting to this you're wrong I'm


---------64:55----------
right I mean you're right and I'm wrong


---------64:56----------
like forget about that just just sit


---------64:59----------
with the idea that you're actually


---------65:00----------
helping people and that you're like a


---------65:01----------
decent person and that just try sitting


---------65:05----------
with it for a little I know it's gonna


---------65:06----------
make you uncomfortable and then try to


---------65:08----------
do something and when you do something


---------65:10----------
notice those two voices within you if


---------65:12----------
they're little bits that are gonna say


---------65:13----------
oh you're actually like good at this and


---------65:15----------
you can actually accomplish things and


---------65:16----------
people care about you and they value you


---------65:18----------
and there's gonna be this big voice that


---------65:20----------
says no no no no no no no no no no I'm


---------65:23----------
worthless [ __ ] this I'm just gonna go


---------65:24----------
home because I can't do it I'm disabled


---------65:27----------
listen to those two voices and recognize


---------65:29----------
them yeah that's how you get power over


---------65:32----------
them yeah if you're if you're a dental


---------65:34----------
work done uh yeah you ever been numbed


---------65:38----------
up with like lidocaine or anything yeah


---------65:41----------
I had no idea was coming to yeah how's


---------65:43----------
your control over your mouth when you're


---------65:46----------
numbed up pretty cool and what happens


---------65:49----------
when you can start to feel again um


---------65:52----------
should I know maybe you start slowly


---------65:55----------
getting control back yeah how's your


---------65:57----------
control over your mouth now pretty


---------65:59----------
pretty good yeah


---------66:01----------
awareness proceeds control if you want


---------66:05----------
to control it you have to feel it you


---------66:07----------
