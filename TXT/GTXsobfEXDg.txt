---------00:11----------
our coaching program so we we have one


---------00:14----------
of our awesome coaches today


---------00:15----------
who is going to be coaching dr k and so


---------00:18----------
i'm going to be the client and he's


---------00:20----------
going to be the coach


---------00:21----------
what uh do we want to vote on a coaching


---------00:23----------
scenario


---------00:25----------
or are we going to wing it


---------00:30----------
yeah vote gaming addiction


---------00:34----------
[Music]


---------00:35----------
you guys tell me what do you all want me


---------00:37----------
to play


---------00:39----------
okay so let's uh oh no


---------00:42----------
i've blocked him so chat meet pax


---------00:47----------
pax can you just um is that okay if i


---------00:49----------
ask you a couple of questions about your


---------00:50----------
experience as a coach


---------00:52----------
at healthy gamer before we dive in hell


---------00:53----------
yeah so why don't you tell us like how


---------00:56----------
you


---------00:56----------
how you came to be a coach to start off


---------00:59----------
with think about it karmically it's a


---------01:01----------
long


---------01:01----------
long story but i basically heard about


---------01:04----------
healthy gamer


---------01:05----------
through uh bobby scar and then


---------01:08----------
from there i was like oh this seems cool


---------01:10----------
uh


---------01:12----------
and then i saw you guys were like


---------01:13----------
looking for coaches i was like i


---------01:15----------
maybe i can do that uh and so i just


---------01:17----------
applied for it uh


---------01:19----------
like last like almost a year ago now


---------01:21----------
this you should be familiar with right


---------01:23----------
so you remember our coach role playing


---------01:24----------
from


---------01:24----------
from training and how terrible it was to


---------01:26----------
have you as a client


---------01:28----------
yes well i was actually trying to


---------01:30----------
remember that i was like i don't know if


---------01:31----------
i ever did it with dr k


---------01:32----------
because i think i remember doing that


---------01:34----------
with other coaches okay


---------01:36----------
and i was like curious i was like i


---------01:37----------
wonder what dr k's version


---------01:39----------
of like a challenging client is because


---------01:41----------
that's my assumption of what we're going


---------01:42----------
to be working on


---------01:43----------
okay um so yeah so we've got i'm going


---------01:46----------
to give you a choice pax


---------01:47----------
you can tell us a little bit about like


---------01:49----------
you know what clients you see commonly


---------01:52----------
and what kinds of problems they have


---------01:54----------
and then we can kind of pick one of


---------01:55----------
those or


---------01:57----------
um you know or maybe you can just share


---------01:59----------
a little bit about that and then like


---------02:01----------
twitch chat has given me some


---------02:02----------
suggestions


---------02:04----------
we could you could you could give


---------02:06----------
yourself over to the webs


---------02:08----------
twitch chat if you want to or why don't


---------02:10----------
you tell us like a little bit about what


---------02:11----------
you usually see


---------02:12----------
i guess what what i experience as coach


---------02:14----------
what i see a lot


---------02:15----------
is um i see people who


---------02:19----------
you know they're almost they always


---------02:20----------
always are like i just want to get


---------02:21----------
unstuck it's like what is that you know


---------02:23----------
what is unstuck


---------02:24----------
right um and very commonly they know


---------02:27----------
what they should be doing uh but


---------02:30----------
they can't bring themselves to do that


---------02:33----------
stuff so then they're like well now what


---------02:36----------
and then we talk about that and kind of


---------02:37----------
go from there we end up getting into


---------02:39----------
their past and


---------02:40----------
um you know that tends to be helpful for


---------02:43----------
reasons i'm sure


---------02:44----------
everyone hopefully everyone here


---------02:45----------
understands um


---------02:47----------
but i'd say that's like the biggest


---------02:49----------
biggest trend is like


---------02:51----------
like i know what to do but i don't do it


---------02:52----------
what's happening am i broken


---------02:54----------
like yeah great perfect okay so we're


---------02:57----------
gonna we'll do that then


---------02:59----------
so let's let's um i'm gonna be a


---------03:02----------
particular flavor of unstuck


---------03:04----------
i'm going to combine have you been


---------03:05----------
watching the stream did you see what


---------03:06----------
chat wanted


---------03:08----------
hell no i've okay yes yeah perfect


---------03:11----------
okay so um let's let's get started


---------03:15----------
uh hello alok it's all okay


---------03:18----------
yeah okay cool yeah so i'm paxton


---------03:21----------
welcome to coaching


---------03:22----------
uh or pax whichever doesn't matter no


---------03:24----------
i'm just gonna talk about some boring


---------03:26----------
[ __ ] for like a few minutes and then we


---------03:27----------
can kind of like launch into like what


---------03:29----------
we need to be doing


---------03:30----------
you know coaching like i don't know what


---------03:31----------
your understanding of coaching is but


---------03:33----------
basically we kind of operate


---------03:34----------
under the assumption that like if you


---------03:36----------
understand yourself then like you can


---------03:38----------
kind of


---------03:39----------
do what's in your best interest and kind


---------03:40----------
of go from there and what keeps people


---------03:42----------
kind of in place is like they don't


---------03:43----------
really understand much about themselves


---------03:46----------
and so i'm assuming that's like part of


---------03:48----------
the reason what brings you here and


---------03:50----------
absolutely we'll get into that more cool


---------03:53----------
so


---------03:53----------
i think sometimes i understand myself


---------03:55----------
too well


---------03:58----------
okay yeah i want to get into that in a


---------04:01----------
second


---------04:01----------
i've been coaching for you know since


---------04:04----------
last summer this is like what i do


---------04:05----------
full-time it's like what's on my mind


---------04:07----------
all the time it's


---------04:07----------
this is my jam just some expectations


---------04:09----------
about um


---------04:10----------
how this is gonna work so we're gonna


---------04:12----------
show up at the same time every week for


---------04:13----------
50 minutes sometimes we go


---------04:15----------
a little bit over that that's usually


---------04:16----------
fine um


---------04:19----------
i try to avoid it because i have other


---------04:20----------
clients kind of lined up afterwards


---------04:22----------
basically what we're going to be doing


---------04:23----------
in session is like i'm going to ask you


---------04:24----------
questions and you're just going to like


---------04:26----------
answer me and we're just


---------04:27----------
kind of just having a conversation


---------04:28----------
sometimes i give assignments i don't


---------04:29----------
usually do that it's not really my thing


---------04:31----------
some coaches do more some coaches do


---------04:32----------
less i'm


---------04:33----------
i'm one of the ones who do less i'm not


---------04:35----------
really great at assignments anyway


---------04:38----------
yeah that makes sense to me uh


---------04:42----------
there's going to be surveys after every


---------04:43----------
session so like i encourage you to get


---------04:45----------
those done


---------04:46----------
as you get them if you have trouble with


---------04:47----------
assignments and that


---------04:49----------
sort of be is one of them that we could


---------04:51----------
talk about that we might have to do them


---------04:53----------
in session but i don't get any of that


---------04:54----------
data none of that goes to me so you can


---------04:55----------
be as honest as you need to i don't i


---------04:56----------
don't see what you write


---------04:58----------
as for like confidentiality like you


---------04:59----------
already signed off on that i'm not gonna


---------05:00----------
like tell people your business


---------05:02----------
uh like me and the other coaches we kind


---------05:03----------
of talk about cases anonymously to kind


---------05:05----------
of like


---------05:06----------
you know get input on sort of like how


---------05:08----------
to help people like just like which my


---------05:10----------
clients in this situation like what


---------05:11----------
should i focus on


---------05:12----------
right okay um and then yeah


---------05:15----------
medical disclaimer you know this isn't


---------05:16----------
therapy i know this isn't therapy


---------05:18----------
it's not treatment of any kind we're


---------05:19----------
just two people but what what's


---------05:22----------
but i i've never really been in therapy


---------05:23----------
i thought this was like what's different


---------05:25----------
about this in therapy


---------05:28----------
isn't it yeah that's good about your


---------05:29----------
feelings


---------05:31----------
uh it can be but it not always is like


---------05:34----------
it's not always the case so like we talk


---------05:35----------
about feelings here that tends to be the


---------05:37----------
natural progression


---------05:38----------
um but some clients we talk more about


---------05:42----------
feelings than others


---------05:43----------
um therapy is very specialized it's very


---------05:46----------
specific um whereas coaching is


---------05:49----------
i i don't want to just say i'm just a


---------05:51----------
dude but like i'm kind of just a dude


---------05:55----------
and you know i just want to like help


---------05:57----------
you figure your [ __ ] out


---------05:58----------
whereas a therapist is like no they're


---------06:00----------
not


---------06:02----------
i can't really speak for them so maybe i


---------06:04----------
won't but i hope that makes sense


---------06:06----------
yeah cool um yeah so like


---------06:10----------
that sounds great man like how do we get


---------06:12----------
started


---------06:14----------
why don't you tell me like what brings


---------06:15----------
you to coaching like what's your


---------06:17----------
situation what's like your deal what's


---------06:19----------
your vibe


---------06:20----------
um well kind of like you said i i kind


---------06:22----------
of feel like i'm stuck


---------06:25----------
yeah you know what makes you say that


---------06:29----------
well i feel like um


---------06:33----------
you know i kind of know


---------06:36----------
what i need to do it's just i'm sort of


---------06:38----------
like lazy


---------06:40----------
like i was born with like the


---------06:41----------
undisciplined trait


---------06:43----------
on my character sheet okay and so um


---------06:47----------
you know you kind of mentioned that like


---------06:48----------
we're here to figure things out but i


---------06:49----------
feel like i've kind of already figured


---------06:51----------
everything out like i know what i need


---------06:52----------
to do


---------06:53----------
it you know i kind of know who i am and


---------06:56----------
what my weaknesses are it's just like i


---------06:58----------
can't figure out a way to


---------07:01----------
you know i i really want to get more


---------07:02----------
disciplined okay


---------07:04----------
uh so first thing i apologize if i laugh


---------07:06----------
i laugh a lot but it's nothing


---------07:08----------
you know if that bothers you let me know


---------07:10----------
um second i get laughed out of that


---------07:12----------
sounds like no big deal


---------07:16----------
fair enough uh we will talk about that


---------07:18----------
more


---------07:19----------
um come on facts you can't let that


---------07:23----------
slide bro


---------07:26----------
what would you actually it's your fault


---------07:27----------
i know i know it's my fault it's my face


---------07:30----------
that would not


---------07:30----------
that you know that would not yeah that's


---------07:32----------
not how you would respond


---------07:33----------
sorry sounds like you know yourself


---------07:35----------
pretty well


---------07:37----------
and so it's like you know if that's the


---------07:39----------
case it's like what can be done


---------07:42----------
absolutely go from here yeah right


---------07:45----------
that's why


---------07:45----------
you know i've been watching dr k streams


---------07:47----------
for a while


---------07:49----------
and um you know i was thinking that like


---------07:53----------
you know by the way when do i get to see


---------07:55----------
him uh


---------07:56----------
on stream this week later i think um


---------07:59----------
that's not like kind of how


---------08:00----------
like you're not gonna like have a


---------08:02----------
session with him i mean you can like


---------08:03----------
apply for like his


---------08:05----------
individual like he's like a psychiatry


---------08:07----------
website where like you can kind of


---------08:08----------
sign up for i think they're at capacity


---------08:09----------
right now because healthy gamer kind of


---------08:10----------
blew up out of nowhere but


---------08:12----------
was that an expectation you had did you


---------08:14----------
think no i just


---------08:15----------
i wasn't sure it's just you know


---------08:16----------
sometimes i think that like um


---------08:20----------
you know i feel like i like he would


---------08:21----------
really understand me


---------08:24----------
and he seems to like help a lot of


---------08:25----------
people like get on stock so


---------08:27----------
you know that's why i signed up for


---------08:28----------
coaching


---------08:31----------
right okay uh


---------08:34----------
let me think about that


---------08:39----------
yeah so you're saying because he


---------08:40----------
understands people he could be helpful


---------08:43----------
yeah i mean i've tried help from a lot


---------08:45----------
of people and it hasn't really worked


---------08:48----------
so you know i sometimes feel like this


---------08:50----------
is my like last chance


---------08:55----------
okay what does that mean well


---------08:58----------
i don't know man like i've tried


---------09:00----------
everything you know i've tried like


---------09:02----------
reading books and like i've tried like


---------09:05----------
you know i've watched a lot of jordan


---------09:06----------
peterson's stuff and


---------09:08----------
and you know like no matter how


---------09:10----------
important it is to clean my room like i


---------09:12----------
just can't


---------09:12----------
clean my room like it's just


---------09:16----------
it's still a mess and so i i don't know


---------09:19----------
it just sort of feels like


---------09:21----------
you know like i was just born with that


---------09:25----------
undisciplined trait so i don't really


---------09:26----------
know


---------09:28----------
you know like i feel like if i could


---------09:31----------
flip a switch in my brain


---------09:32----------
then like my life would be awesome


---------09:36----------
like i know exactly what i need to do


---------09:37----------
and i just need to flip that switch


---------09:39----------
and once that switch gets flipped


---------09:42----------
and i've seen it kind of happen on


---------09:44----------
stream with dr k where like you can see


---------09:45----------
people like flip a switch in their brain


---------09:47----------
and like i just know that


---------09:49----------
you know their life is transformed


---------09:50----------
gotcha


---------09:52----------
so so what i'm hearing is that you've


---------09:55----------
done a lot of kind of


---------09:56----------
external like research yeah and like


---------09:59----------
about how that relates to you about all


---------10:00----------
the things you like need to do


---------10:02----------
and so you're saying like you know since


---------10:05----------
you know everything that has to be done


---------10:06----------
you just need to like find this switch


---------10:08----------
and like flip it


---------10:10----------
and like once that happens it's like


---------10:12----------
your life is perfect


---------10:13----------
absolutely man


---------10:16----------
okay what what about you makes you


---------10:21----------
say that you're just like undisciplined


---------10:23----------
that you just like have this trait


---------10:26----------
well i mean like i see other people like


---------10:28----------
living their lives right but that's not


---------10:29----------
what i do


---------10:31----------
like other people get up and they you


---------10:34----------
know like shower and shave and like


---------10:36----------
cook themselves some breakfast and stuff


---------10:38----------
like that and in my case it's sort of


---------10:41----------
like


---------10:41----------
i just wake up and you know just hop


---------10:44----------
online and like


---------10:46----------
kind of screw around on reddit for like


---------10:48----------
an hour or two and then


---------10:50----------
you know i know there's like stuff i


---------10:52----------
need to do but and then like i start


---------10:54----------
watching twitch and i kind of have that


---------10:55----------
up on my second monitor


---------10:57----------
and then maybe i'll like play some games


---------10:59----------
and then like


---------11:01----------
you know i have some pizza left over


---------11:02----------
from yesterday


---------11:05----------
so okay so what i'm hearing you say is


---------11:09----------
like


---------11:09----------
compared to other people you're like not


---------11:12----------
disciplined because


---------11:14----------
instead of waking up yeah because like


---------11:15----------
other people other people like wake up


---------11:17----------
and they


---------11:18----------
[ __ ] do stuff and i just wake up and


---------11:20----------
i don't do [ __ ]


---------11:22----------
what do you think about that it


---------11:25----------
sucks what sucks about that


---------11:28----------
well i mean it's like every day is like


---------11:30----------
groundhog day


---------11:32----------
like every day is the same and like


---------11:34----------
every day is like


---------11:35----------
you know like every day that goes by


---------11:37----------
like i know i like i just know exactly


---------11:39----------
what i need to do i just can't do it


---------11:43----------
sounds frustrating yeah


---------11:47----------
i just think of like a dog on a leash


---------11:49----------
that's just like barking at everything


---------11:51----------
because it wants to like run at stuff


---------11:52----------
but it's like on this leash


---------11:53----------
and doesn't really understand it


---------11:57----------
yeah i mean i guess that's that's a good


---------11:59----------
way of putting it like i do feel like


---------12:00----------
you know definitely there's something


---------12:02----------
holding me back so that's like you know


---------12:04----------
like the switch like i want to get off


---------12:05----------
the leash


---------12:06----------
you know yep


---------12:10----------
what's it like to be on that leash like


---------12:12----------
you say it sucks


---------12:13----------
and like it's frustrating but like is


---------12:15----------
there more to it


---------12:17----------
i mean i think it's it's sort of like


---------12:18----------
you know the difference is that with a


---------12:20----------
leash you can take it off but like in my


---------12:21----------
situation that feels like it's like a


---------12:23----------
leash made


---------12:24----------
out of concrete like it's just the way


---------12:26----------
it is


---------12:27----------
and you know i've tried a lot of stuff


---------12:29----------
and like people have tried to help me


---------12:30----------
too


---------12:31----------
and it's been a waste of time and you


---------12:33----------
know sometimes like it's also kind of


---------12:34----------
like [ __ ] annoying because like they


---------12:36----------
tell me like they know what it's like


---------12:38----------
to like be in my shoes so they'll just


---------12:39----------
like tell me stuff right they'll be like


---------12:41----------
oh you should just do this bro


---------12:43----------
you just go like just right go and do


---------12:45----------
that bro


---------12:47----------
and i mean i would if they could yeah it


---------12:50----------
sounds like they don't really get it


---------12:52----------
and like there's kind of a disconnect


---------12:54----------
it's like you know that stuff already


---------12:56----------
yeah it's like you don't need you don't


---------12:58----------
need captain hindsight telling you what


---------12:59----------
you should have done or what you should


---------13:00----------
be doing


---------13:01----------
i mean it's like their brain is


---------13:03----------
different from my brain right like they


---------13:04----------
were born with the discipline right so


---------13:06----------
they can do that kind of thing


---------13:10----------
yeah oh look you've kind of said a lot


---------13:11----------
of times now like you've kind of made


---------13:12----------
this allusion to like


---------13:15----------
you know i'm just this way and that's


---------13:17----------
just how it is and like other people


---------13:18----------
aren't


---------13:21----------
yeah i guess i


---------13:24----------
yo what what he isn't that


---------13:30----------
i'm confused why do what is that yeah


---------13:34----------
what yeah so like


---------13:38----------
i'm just yeah because that's how it is


---------13:43----------
right so


---------13:46----------
when i think about that like if that's


---------13:47----------
just how it is then it's like i don't


---------13:49----------
know if we can do anything


---------13:50----------
right


---------13:54----------
well i mean yeah i mean that's why i


---------13:56----------
kind of feel like this is my last chance


---------13:58----------
because it's like


---------13:59----------
you know i don't feel like i can do


---------14:00----------
anything


---------14:03----------
like it would be easy if i was like


---------14:05----------
disciplined


---------14:07----------
yep so what i mean you say like it's


---------14:10----------
just how it is but like what


---------14:12----------
like what's the what's underneath it


---------14:15----------
like how do you know that


---------14:16----------
how do you know that that's just how it


---------14:18----------
is for you


---------14:21----------
well i mean because i have lots of


---------14:22----------
evidence


---------14:24----------
right so i i have like


---------14:28----------
like you know just for example like


---------14:31----------
i'm i sometimes like am alone and like i


---------14:34----------
want a relationship but i can't


---------14:36----------
get one and you know i've kind of like


---------14:40----------
i've tried that in the past but like


---------14:42----------
women just find me unattractive so


---------14:46----------
you know there's just really nothing i


---------14:47----------
can do about that


---------14:50----------
it's just truth you know


---------14:55----------
that that you're unattractive yeah


---------14:59----------
so like you can't ask people out because


---------15:02----------
it's just like you just know like you're


---------15:03----------
unattractive and it's like


---------15:05----------
there's no point absolutely


---------15:08----------
you know because like like i was reading


---------15:10----------
this website and they were talking about


---------15:12----------
signals like


---------15:13----------
you know how to tell if a girl likes you


---------15:15----------
and like they don't give me any of the


---------15:16----------
signals like so i know they don't like


---------15:18----------
me


---------15:21----------
oh okay


---------15:24----------
so because you're not getting these


---------15:26----------
signals that you that you researched


---------15:28----------
on the internet it's like you just know


---------15:30----------
they don't like you at all


---------15:32----------
yep


---------15:39----------
right because that's how you know


---------15:42----------
like whether they like you or not and so


---------15:45----------
i just know cause like i can also look


---------15:47----------
in the mirror


---------15:48----------
and i can tell you know i don't have the


---------15:52----------
jawline


---------15:55----------
right because you don't have the jawline


---------15:59----------
you're not gonna you're not getting the


---------16:00----------
signals so


---------16:02----------
you can't ask anyone out yep


---------16:06----------
okay


---------16:09----------
so yeah man i feel like the way you're


---------16:11----------
you're presenting oh go ahead


---------16:13----------
i was just gonna say i mean i guess i


---------16:14----------
could but like it's not gonna go well


---------16:16----------
you know wha what makes you say that


---------16:21----------
well because i'm not getting the signal


---------16:22----------
so like


---------16:24----------
it's just not going to go well


---------16:28----------
what does it mean to to go well


---------16:34----------
um i i don't know i guess like she'd


---------16:38----------
give me her number


---------16:42----------
okay i guess i i don't really know


---------16:46----------
i haven't really thought about that


---------16:48----------
before


---------16:51----------
okay what does it mean if you ask her


---------16:53----------
out and she doesn't give you her number


---------16:56----------
i i think it i think it just confirms


---------16:58----------
what i knew before right that like


---------17:00----------
she wasn't giving me the signal so


---------17:02----------
that's you know


---------17:05----------
that i'm unattractive like i kind of


---------17:08----------
know that already it's just like


---------17:10----------
you know it's just testing a hypothesis


---------17:13----------
like finding proof for your hypothesis


---------17:18----------
so if you know it to be true what's the


---------17:20----------
harm in asking then what's the harm in


---------17:22----------
just trying and seeing what happens


---------17:26----------
well i mean i already know what's gonna


---------17:28----------
happen so like what's the point doing it


---------17:32----------
you sound like you you know what's going


---------17:33----------
to happen a lot of the time


---------17:35----------
like you sound very convinced like you


---------17:36----------
know how things are going to pan out


---------17:38----------
yeah smart dude super high iq


---------17:43----------
right have you ever been wrong about


---------17:45----------
that


---------17:46----------
just curious have you ever thought you


---------17:49----------
knew what was gonna happen and then


---------17:51----------
you were pleasantly or unpleasantly


---------17:53----------
surprised i mean very few times


---------17:56----------
right like sure like theoretically i can


---------17:58----------
be wrong


---------18:00----------
like sometimes i make posts on reddit


---------18:02----------
that get downvoted and people tell me


---------18:04----------
i'm wrong


---------18:04----------
that's just because they're a bunch of


---------18:05----------
noobs


---------18:10----------
how do how does that how does that feel


---------18:12----------
when like a post gets downvoted


---------18:14----------
a bunch that's a really good question i


---------18:16----------
never really thought about that


---------18:18----------
um i mean i i think it sort of like


---------18:20----------
feels like i'm


---------18:21----------
you know like the world is all like


---------18:23----------
telling me one thing and like i think


---------18:24----------
something else


---------18:26----------
you know and it just makes me feel a lot


---------18:28----------
like you know they're like


---------18:30----------
all the regular people out there who are


---------18:32----------
sort of like living their lives and like


---------18:33----------
that's their perspective of like regular


---------18:35----------
people


---------18:37----------
you know it kind of feels a lot like


---------18:39----------
when people say


---------18:41----------
you know just go do this it's like they


---------18:43----------
all like they all think that and like


---------18:45----------
everyone tells me this stuff like all


---------18:46----------
the time


---------18:47----------
like people tell me that like i'm


---------18:49----------
actually like pretty good looking


---------18:51----------
you know like you know


---------18:54----------
and stuff like that like people tell me


---------18:56----------
all this stuff all the time but


---------18:59----------
you know that sounds like kind of very


---------19:02----------
conflicting


---------19:06----------
yeah i guess so i mean it's just you


---------19:08----------
know it's like people like my mom though


---------19:10----------
you know so it's like it's her job to


---------19:12----------
tell you that


---------19:14----------
and then also like some of my sister's


---------19:16----------
friends and things like that so it's


---------19:17----------
just like


---------19:19----------
got you it it's your mom's job and your


---------19:22----------
sister's friend's job to


---------19:24----------
say that you're attractive well i mean


---------19:25----------
it's not really their job but


---------19:27----------
you know they're just they're like


---------19:29----------
making fun of me you know


---------19:32----------
what what makes you say that well i mean


---------19:35----------
come on dude


---------19:38----------
like do you think i'm attractive what


---------19:41----------
would it mean to you


---------19:42----------
either way


---------19:47----------
what do you what do you mean by that


---------19:50----------
so i mean you're pretty certain that


---------19:52----------
you're unattractive that's what you're


---------19:53----------
telling me


---------19:54----------
yeah and so whether i did or not it


---------19:56----------
sounds like it doesn't matter sounds


---------19:57----------
like


---------19:57----------
it like means nothing


---------20:06----------
well i mean if if you were like genuine


---------20:08----------
about it i


---------20:11----------
you know that's kind of interesting


---------20:12----------
because like i feel like if you were to


---------20:15----------
say


---------20:17----------
yeah i do think you were attracted first


---------20:19----------
of all that'd be [ __ ] weird and then


---------20:20----------
secondly like you know i feel like it'd


---------20:22----------
be your job to say that


---------20:24----------
yeah but then i'm kind of like i'm kind


---------20:25----------
of realizing that i'm putting myself


---------20:27----------
into like a logical fallacy which is


---------20:29----------
like


---------20:31----------
you know no matter what it's like


---------20:35----------
i kind of ask a question but like i i'm


---------20:37----------
just noticing that


---------20:39----------
you know no matter what you say i'm


---------20:41----------
going to think the same thing yeah


---------20:43----------
that's kind of what it sounds like to me


---------20:44----------
is like no matter which answer i give


---------20:46----------
you


---------20:47----------
i'm either doing my job and like


---------20:49----------
patronizing you or i'm weird


---------20:51----------
or you were right the whole time at the


---------20:53----------
end of the day you're correct


---------20:58----------
what does that mean i'm gonna give that


---------21:01----------
one back to


---------21:02----------
you like what do you think about that


---------21:07----------
well i know what you're gonna say


---------21:11----------
what am i gonna say well you're gonna


---------21:13----------
say it's like all in my head and like


---------21:14----------
this is all self-fulfilling prophecy or


---------21:16----------
like


---------21:17----------
and like you know that no matter what i


---------21:20----------
like


---------21:20----------
like i see what you're saying like


---------21:21----------
you're kind of like maneuvering me into


---------21:23----------
this corner of like


---------21:25----------
you know it doesn't matter you know it


---------21:28----------
doesn't


---------21:30----------
i don't know man it feels like


---------21:34----------
you know it feels like you're going to


---------21:35----------
say that it's like all in my head


---------21:37----------
what makes you think i would say that to


---------21:39----------
you


---------21:41----------
well because it is like it's like you


---------21:44----------
know like


---------21:44----------
like kind of like you what you said like


---------21:46----------
you were like you know what would it


---------21:47----------
mean to you and i


---------21:48----------
i don't know i mean i'm kind of seeing


---------21:50----------
that you know i can see like it doesn't


---------21:52----------
matter what


---------21:53----------
how you would respond to that and so


---------21:55----------
like what you would tell me is that


---------21:57----------
you know maybe i'm doing that in other


---------21:58----------
parts of my life like i've i've watched


---------22:00----------
dr k's videos like i know how this [ __ ]


---------22:02----------
works you know


---------22:04----------
and then and then you know i don't i


---------22:07----------
don't know man


---------22:08----------
this is not what i was expecting isn't


---------22:09----------
it


---------22:11----------
yeah how do you feel right now uh it's


---------22:14----------
like different from what i was expecting


---------22:15----------
like i thought that


---------22:16----------
you know you would be like teaching me


---------22:18----------
how to meditate and


---------22:20----------
you know i thought like like maybe you


---------22:22----------
would ask me like bunches of questions


---------22:23----------
about like my feelings like what feeling


---------22:25----------
is that


---------22:26----------
and what feeling is that and what


---------22:27----------
feeling is that but i don't know i just


---------22:29----------
didn't think it would be so


---------22:31----------
i don't know man it's just it's just


---------22:32----------
different from what i was expecting


---------22:34----------
you know your expectation was not met


---------22:36----------
this is not what you were expecting at


---------22:37----------
all and so


---------22:39----------
you're feeling a type of way it's


---------22:40----------
interesting because i've asked you twice


---------22:41----------
now kind of like


---------22:42----------
about feeling like how do you feel and


---------22:44----------
and you've kind of never really given me


---------22:46----------
a straight answer so if you don't mind


---------22:47----------
i'm going to ask you again like how do


---------22:48----------
you feel right now


---------22:51----------
honestly like you know like kind of


---------22:54----------
confused but also like a little bit


---------22:56----------
intrigued


---------22:57----------
like i i think you may be a pretty smart


---------22:59----------
dude


---------23:03----------
i don't know uh but okay so you feel


---------23:06----------
confused and intrigued


---------23:08----------
what's intriguing i mean it's just not


---------23:11----------
what i expected you know i think that


---------23:12----------
like


---------23:13----------
i've watched so much stuff about this


---------23:15----------
kind of thing and like usually people


---------23:17----------
are


---------23:18----------
you know just like giving you like you


---------23:19----------
know people will say like these are the


---------23:20----------
10 things you need to do


---------23:22----------
to get your life in order like jvp's


---------23:24----------
book about you know the 12


---------23:26----------
rules and it's like you know


---------23:29----------
and and so it's different because we're


---------23:30----------
not i mean you're not really like giving


---------23:32----------
me rules


---------23:33----------
which is like what most people kind of


---------23:34----------
do right so it's kind of weird


---------23:36----------
yeah i mean it sounds like you've sought


---------23:38----------
out a lot of those rules and nothing has


---------23:40----------
really come of it


---------23:42----------
well yeah because i'm undisciplined


---------23:45----------
you know so it's like it's like how do i


---------23:47----------
get undisciplined is the


---------23:49----------
is the question i i don't really know if


---------23:51----------
we're


---------23:52----------
working on that or not i thought you


---------23:54----------
would like give me like a


---------23:57----------
you know like do this and then do this


---------23:58----------
and then do this kind of thing


---------24:03----------
right uh let me think for a second


---------24:08----------
remember when we were talking about


---------24:10----------
attractiveness like two seconds ago


---------24:12----------
yeah right and like it really seems like


---------24:16----------
for a moment there you kind of like


---------24:18----------
started to think a little differently


---------24:20----------
about


---------24:21----------
your assumption was am i wrong there


---------24:25----------
no i mean i think it's it you know i


---------24:28----------
don't know that i was thinking


---------24:29----------
differently but like


---------24:30----------
i was definitely thinking about it you


---------24:31----------
know i'm still pretty sure like i've


---------24:34----------
gotten mountains of evidence about how


---------24:36----------
unattractive i am so i'm


---------24:37----------
you know that past is still real but


---------24:40----------
like


---------24:40----------
you know i think it's definitely sort of


---------24:42----------
a little bit different i don't know


---------24:45----------
what do you mean by that how is it


---------24:46----------
different


---------24:51----------
i don't know man i just feel kind of you


---------24:52----------
know confused


---------24:56----------
what's confusing i thought you knew that


---------24:59----------
you like weren't attractive you had like


---------25:01----------
all this evidence right


---------25:03----------
yeah but then there's this whole other


---------25:05----------
angle of like maybe it's all in my head


---------25:07----------
right


---------25:09----------
what makes you think that


---------25:13----------
but i guess you


---------25:19----------
i mean don't you think i'm stupid


---------25:22----------
like for i mean like it's dumb dude like


---------25:29----------
i'm like confused like


---------25:31----------
you must think i'm an idiot because like


---------25:32----------
you're asking all these simple questions


---------25:34----------
and like i don't have good answers for


---------25:35----------
them


---------25:37----------
you say you don't have good answers like


---------25:39----------
what makes you say that


---------25:41----------
well because like i could hear the words


---------25:42----------
coming out of my mouth and they're like


---------25:44----------
they're not like you're asking me like


---------25:45----------
why i'm confused and i can't even answer


---------25:47----------
that you know it's sort of like


---------25:49----------
yeah you seem pretty taken aback right


---------25:51----------
now yeah


---------25:53----------
absolutely man like i said this isn't


---------25:55----------
what i was expecting


---------25:58----------
how do you feel like physically right


---------25:59----------
now


---------26:02----------
kind of uncomfortable like like just i


---------26:05----------
got like a little bit of tightness in my


---------26:06----------
chest like i'm not


---------26:07----------
you know i feel like i need to take a


---------26:08----------
deep breath and sort of sit up


---------26:12----------
do you think do you want to try that do


---------26:13----------
you want to like take a deep breath and


---------26:14----------
like sit up


---------26:16----------
yeah maybe i guess


---------26:20----------
i'll do it with you i mean i'm standing


---------26:22----------
but


---------26:25----------
yeah yeah that's that's cool i should


---------26:27----------
get a standing desk too


---------26:34----------
uh i'm not laughing


---------26:38----------
at the client i'm laughing at dr k um


---------26:42----------
sure so let's take a deep breath yeah


---------26:44----------
all right pax let's pause


---------26:45----------
just like yeah please so pax


---------26:49----------
how was that for you


---------26:52----------
um familiar but


---------26:56----------
very extreme i would say i've never had


---------26:59----------
a client who's like on that end


---------27:00----------
like so far on that end right absolutely


---------27:04----------
so pax i thought you did a fantastic job


---------27:06----------
i was trying to throw you as many


---------27:07----------
curveballs as i could


---------27:09----------
in wednesday i could tell yeah i thought


---------27:12----------
you did a really fantastic job let's


---------27:14----------
just i'm going to check


---------27:15----------
a chat what did you guys think about


---------27:18----------
that


---------27:21----------
no so this is the thing is so so even


---------27:24----------
though i was trying


---------27:25----------
really really hard pax to be


---------27:28----------
so sure of my beliefs you did a


---------27:31----------
fantastic job of like confusing me which


---------27:33----------
is exactly what you need to do


---------27:34----------
right so like because when people have


---------27:38----------
very rigid beliefs about themselves


---------27:40----------
what what we want to do is like we want


---------27:43----------
to you know it's sort of like they've


---------27:44----------
saved a document that is only readable


---------27:46----------
but is not editable


---------27:48----------
and so confusion is actually like the


---------27:50----------
first step of moving from


---------27:51----------
pre-contemplative to contemplative


---------27:53----------
so you did actually a really good job of


---------27:55----------
that of you know kind of


---------27:57----------
asking open-ended questions i also threw


---------27:59----------
out a lot of traps for you


---------28:01----------
which you dodged really well right you


---------28:04----------
want to tell people what the traps are


---------28:05----------
and what we explain about traps


---------28:09----------
yeah i mean asking me [ __ ] like um do


---------28:11----------
you think i'm attractive like do you


---------28:12----------
think i'm stupid like


---------28:14----------
you know anything where like if i say


---------28:16----------
yes or no i have like


---------28:19----------
i've essentially confirmed something


---------28:21----------
that they believe right


---------28:22----------
and so by kind of avoiding that you know


---------28:25----------
i'm not giving them what they want


---------28:26----------
because a lot of times when people are


---------28:27----------
that pre-contemplative like they just


---------28:29----------
want to be


---------28:30----------
right about what they feel so sure about


---------28:32----------
because like


---------28:33----------
weirdly enough that's like it's kind of


---------28:35----------
ego gratifying and like it kind of makes


---------28:37----------
them


---------28:37----------
even though they feel like [ __ ] all the


---------28:38----------
time like makes them feel better because


---------28:39----------
they're like well i'm right no one can


---------28:40----------
help me so like there's nothing to be


---------28:41----------
done


---------28:42----------
right right so the beautifully said i


---------28:45----------
don't know


---------28:45----------
so pax i thought that was a perfect


---------28:48----------
example


---------28:49----------
summary of what i was projecting


---------28:52----------
which is i want to be right and [ __ ] you


---------28:55----------
and so nothing can be done right i'm i'm


---------28:58----------
helpless i'm hopeless


---------29:00----------
i'm sure i'm helpless and hopeless and


---------29:02----------
there's no way that i'm wrong about


---------29:04----------
being helpless and hopeless


---------29:05----------
and so like when you create confusion


---------29:08----------
that's actually


---------29:09----------
really really good because then like


---------29:12----------
what am i confused about it changes the


---------29:14----------
rigidity of me being hopeless


---------29:17----------
and so you also did a really good job of


---------29:19----------
i said like oh you


---------29:20----------
you think like something about when i


---------29:22----------
was talking about the self-fulfilling


---------29:23----------
prophecy


---------29:24----------
you did a really good job around that


---------29:26----------
too where you were like oh i said


---------29:27----------
something like


---------29:28----------
you think that what did i say


---------29:32----------
do you remember what i'm talking about


---------29:33----------
where like um you kind of um


---------29:36----------
like i said that i felt confused and oh


---------29:38----------
you must think this is all in my head


---------29:40----------
and you did a really really good job of


---------29:42----------
like not


---------29:43----------
stepping into that trap too because you


---------29:46----------
could have said


---------29:46----------
you know because it is all in my head


---------29:48----------
and you know it's all in my head and you


---------29:49----------
could have said


---------29:51----------
it's all yeah like you know


---------29:54----------
sort of like i wonder about that


---------29:56----------
sometimes


---------29:57----------
and and so even though that would have


---------29:59----------
and so i i for people watching so like


---------30:02----------
that was a really really important point


---------30:04----------
for pax because


---------30:05----------
i was moving in the right direction and


---------30:08----------
if pax had agreed with me that i would


---------30:10----------
have gotten super defensive and then


---------30:12----------
like retreated


---------30:13----------
i don't know if you guys were able to


---------30:14----------
follow that but


---------30:16----------
um so so like but when you didn't own


---------30:20----------
that when you were like no i actually


---------30:22----------
don't you didn't say yes or no right you


---------30:23----------
did a good job you're like no i


---------30:25----------
i don't think it's all in your head no


---------30:27----------
it must be so hard for you


---------30:28----------
and like yeah maybe like maybe it is all


---------30:30----------
in your head bro


---------30:31----------
you know and so the more that you


---------30:34----------
were and this is a very like sort of tai


---------30:37----------
chi kind of like manner to you pax which


---------30:39----------
is awesome


---------30:39----------
which is that i'm trying to push you


---------30:41----------
like one way or the other and i'm like


---------30:43----------
it's all in my head right and then


---------30:45----------
you're like i'm not gonna take that bait


---------30:47----------
and the the less bait you take like the


---------30:50----------
further i


---------30:51----------
move in my own exploration because like


---------30:53----------
i have all these patterns in my mind


---------30:55----------
that are gonna snap to judgments


---------30:57----------
and close off kind of like free thinking


---------31:00----------
and so when you don't like let me do


---------31:02----------
that i'm trying to snap either way


---------31:04----------
do you think i'm attractive oh if he


---------31:07----------
says yes


---------31:08----------
oh it's his [ __ ] job to say that like


---------31:09----------
oh he's just lying to me right


---------31:11----------
it's just like my mom and if i say if


---------31:13----------
you say no oh see i knew


---------31:14----------
all right all along in either case i'm


---------31:17----------
moving


---------31:17----------
into completely explored territory that


---------31:19----------
doesn't help me at all


---------31:20----------
and so when you avoid that trap it like


---------31:23----------
forces me to like think about stuff


---------31:25----------
and so confusion in this in this


---------31:27----------
scenario is absolutely like that's what


---------31:29----------
we see in coaching is like


---------31:30----------
people get confused because we start to


---------31:33----------
like


---------31:33----------
work in a way where we don't let them go


---------31:36----------
down like the same old track over and


---------31:38----------
over and over again


---------31:39----------
and if you let me go down that same old


---------31:40----------
track over and over and over again


---------31:42----------
it's gonna be the self-fulfilling


---------31:43----------
prophecy cool thanks a lot pax


---------31:47----------
thank you poggers cool thanks a lot take


---------31:49----------
care


---------31:50----------
all right peace
