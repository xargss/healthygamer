---------00:00----------
so thanks for coming on Jane no worries


---------00:03----------
it's been awhile since we last talked


---------00:05----------
let me do that for the week but ya crazy


---------00:08----------
time since then yeah kid can you fill me


---------00:12----------
in on on so I think the last time we


---------00:15----------
talked you were with Dallas fuel right


---------00:17----------
mhm yeah so I'm still as far as I can


---------00:21----------
announce I'm still with Dallas okay yeah


---------00:25----------
so I am going to be moving to Dallas in


---------00:27----------
November okay and then right now I'm in


---------00:31----------
Toronto for the Team Canada boot camp


---------00:34----------
okay so over active media and Bell


---------00:37----------
Canada sponsored us to come up to


---------00:39----------
Toronto to just a one week before the


---------00:42----------
World Cup to get ready for the


---------00:43----------
tournaments down in Anaheim California


---------00:45----------
there Team USA has had Nvidia as a


---------00:47----------
sponsor the last two or three years and


---------00:50----------
they've had a pretty nice boot camp set


---------00:51----------
up so actually being in person and


---------00:55----------
having the full team there instead of


---------00:56----------
trying to practice remote which is you


---------00:58----------
know usually standard fare especially


---------01:00----------
for not just basically everyone except


---------01:04----------
the league teams practices remotely but


---------01:07----------
it is really quite a big jump up once


---------01:09----------
you are able to get everybody in the


---------01:10----------
same location you know live together eat


---------01:12----------
together practice together that whole


---------01:14----------
thing so yeah the we're on day three the


---------01:17----------
first scrim block starts in about an


---------01:19----------
hour and a half mmm oh yeah so this is


---------01:22----------
day three and then we're gonna have


---------01:23----------
media day tomorrow one final kind of


---------01:25----------
prep day to simulate the actual


---------01:27----------
tournament itself and then we're down to


---------01:29----------
Anaheim t√∫cume to compete at the World


---------01:31----------
Cup that's awesome


---------01:33----------
and how have you been oh I've been doing


---------01:36----------
I've been really really busy there's a


---------01:38----------
you know normally people know me for my


---------01:42----------
twitch of my youtube stuff but pretty


---------01:44----------
much the only social media that I've


---------01:45----------
been active on recently has been Twitter


---------01:48----------
not because I like I'm feeling a lot


---------01:51----------
better I had that I stepped back from


---------01:54----------
social media because I was having a


---------01:56----------
pretty high period of stress I guess you


---------01:58----------
could call it social media earlier in


---------02:01----------
the year but the reason that I haven't


---------02:03----------
fully returned to it yet is yes there's


---------02:05----------
these things with like World Cup where


---------02:07----------
I'm up at the bootcamp but I'm also


---------02:10----------
working on some still secret projects


---------02:12----------
that I want to


---------02:13----------
finish off and hopefully I can announce


---------02:15----------
the some of those in November but yeah


---------02:18----------
looking to return to the actual twitch


---------02:20----------
and YouTube stuff probably late November


---------02:22----------
early December it's one of those things


---------02:25----------
where there's there's a lot of things


---------02:28----------
that can be done in the overwatch


---------02:31----------
ecosystem I suppose the best way to put


---------02:33----------
it you know if you're looking at like


---------02:34----------
the National Hockey League or something


---------02:36----------
like that they're still figuring things


---------02:38----------
out after a hundred years now the


---------02:40----------
overwatch league has sprung into


---------02:42----------
existence we just finished the second


---------02:43----------
year and so while it it's quite large


---------02:46----------
and impressive with a lot of franchise


---------02:48----------
teams there's still a lot of things that


---------02:50----------
need to be done down kind of like the


---------02:51----------
the foundation is the overwatch league


---------02:55----------
you know there's a lot of there's a lot


---------02:58----------
of just checks and balances that aren't


---------03:02----------
in place yet um you know there's no


---------03:04----------
Union for developers of games there's no


---------03:07----------
Players Association and for players


---------03:09----------
whether it's whether you're talking


---------03:10----------
overwatch Blizzard or any Activision


---------03:12----------
game things like that you know the major


---------03:14----------
difference between you have like the NBA


---------03:17----------
where you know anybody like if you play


---------03:20----------
let's take baseball for example if you


---------03:21----------
wanted to go play a game of baseball all


---------03:23----------
you really need is a bat a ball and you


---------03:26----------
know white spray paint in a grass field


---------03:27----------
but overwatch League in any sport really


---------03:30----------
any and every eastward is a little bit


---------03:34----------
different where in order to have the


---------03:35----------
permission to play the game you need to


---------03:36----------
have a license to the game access to the


---------03:38----------
server's which means you need Terms of


---------03:41----------
Service and user license agreements and


---------03:42----------
then those legal protections also extend


---------03:46----------
to the point where companies have


---------03:48----------
control over running tournaments and


---------03:50----------
events


---------03:50----------
you can't like even if you and all of


---------03:53----------
their friends own overwatch at the game


---------03:56----------
technically you can't run a tournament


---------03:59----------
without blizzards permission so there's


---------04:01----------
some differences in legal structures


---------04:03----------
where although we're modeling the


---------04:05----------
overwatch League and we being not me


---------04:07----------
personally but although the overwatch


---------04:09----------
League is being modeled after these


---------04:11----------
large franchise sports leagues there are


---------04:14----------
some very key structural differences


---------04:15----------
which I don't feel you know they haven't


---------04:18----------
been figured out yet we're still you


---------04:20----------
know we're going for broke we're


---------04:22----------
figuring out as we go along but yeah


---------04:25----------
there's there's more to be done


---------04:27----------
that could make the league a lot better


---------04:29----------
yeah so I mean I think you know the last


---------04:32----------
time we talked I got a substantial


---------04:35----------
appreciation for just how different


---------04:38----------
things are in terms of players as well


---------04:40----------
like I didn't realize sort of the


---------04:42----------
cognitive impact of becoming a


---------04:44----------
professional overwatch player at the age


---------04:46----------
of 18 and kind of like what that does to


---------04:49----------
you and I remember kind of at that


---------04:52----------
workshop you know a lot of people were


---------04:53----------
just talking a lot about sort of


---------04:54----------
managing teams and how that's difficult


---------04:57----------
is there is that so generally speaking I


---------05:00----------
guess people on this stream like we tend


---------05:02----------
to try to talk a lot about people's


---------05:03----------
personal experiences because I think


---------05:05----------
that's what people find helpful and you


---------05:08----------
were saying that things have been


---------05:09----------
stressful can you tell us a little bit


---------05:11----------
about what's been stressful


---------05:15----------
[Applause]


---------05:17----------
that's a very blood I mean everything


---------05:20----------
has its own level of stress you're doing


---------05:22----------
yeah you know for you know it's I've got


---------05:25----------
the Team Canada thing going on we're


---------05:26----------
obviously competing on the world stage


---------05:27----------
literally next week I work for Dallas as


---------05:32----------
a coach I'm doing other duties that I


---------05:34----------
haven't announced yet


---------05:35----------
and then there's their stress behind


---------05:38----------
that obviously it's an organization


---------05:39----------
that's trying to make basically the


---------05:42----------
future of sports in general and then on


---------05:44----------
top of that I have my my side project I


---------05:48----------
wouldn't even really call it side


---------05:48----------
projects I start up organization that's


---------05:51----------
trying to support kind of the more


---------05:53----------
semi-professional the path to pro


---------05:55----------
helping people focusing on education


---------05:57----------
through eSports so you know I wear a lot


---------05:59----------
of different hats because I'm super


---------06:00----------
passionate about the stuff and I want to


---------06:02----------
make it better and I want to make it


---------06:04----------
work so is there any specific component


---------06:07----------
of that that you'd like me to delve into


---------06:11----------
it yeah so let's start with this one


---------06:13----------
yeah so like let's let's start with I


---------06:16----------
guess a couple of things one is you know


---------06:19----------
how you balance different things so like


---------06:21----------
there's a particular stress from trying


---------06:22----------
to do more than one thing yeah so so


---------06:29----------
what when you say you're really bad at


---------06:30----------
that what does that mean well


---------06:35----------
like basically that for myself I was


---------06:38----------
operating for quite a long time


---------06:41----------
undiagnosed bipolar - and I didn't


---------06:43----------
realize that that's still something


---------06:45----------
that's relatively new to me and I'm


---------06:46----------
still trying to figure out how to cope


---------06:47----------
with it but whenever I would be on the


---------06:50----------
elevated side of bipolar - you know it


---------06:54----------
wouldn't be like a full-blown mania and


---------06:56----------
you know no delusions of grandeur


---------06:58----------
disassociation nothing like that it was


---------07:00----------
just elevated mood elevated productivity


---------07:03----------
motivation passion like just super


---------07:06----------
energetic all the time and that's one of


---------07:08----------
the reasons that if I just like saw a


---------07:10----------
problem or saw something that I could do


---------07:11----------
I just like jump right into it with with


---------07:14----------
no regard to my health at all


---------07:15----------
you know there's a lot of people I think


---------07:17----------
do that that get really really


---------07:18----------
passionate or really really competitive


---------07:20----------
and you know you do hear about these


---------07:22----------
guys grinding 8 to 12 hours and honestly


---------07:25----------
that's kind of the conservativeness


---------07:27----------
there's definitely people who push kind


---------07:30----------
of like 16 20 hour sessions especially


---------07:31----------
when they're grinding really really hard


---------07:33----------
you know just like the guys here at the


---------07:37----------
Team Canada I was like you know working


---------07:38----------
in person and we're making sure that


---------07:40----------
they're fed and they have asleep and


---------07:42----------
we're all kind of do go to bed at same


---------07:44----------
time but there are some people who play


---------07:46----------
until like 4:00 in the morning or


---------07:49----------
something with that and then they're the


---------07:51----------
first ones up and the first thing to do


---------07:52----------
after they do their morning routine is


---------07:53----------
just hop right back on and keep going so


---------07:56----------
we've got these really intense days


---------07:57----------
where we're doing you know three blocks


---------08:00----------
of overwatch and review and prep and


---------08:02----------
discussions and then they're putting in


---------08:05----------
two different sets of our play sessions


---------08:08----------
before and after not the boot camps


---------08:10----------
completely voluntarily so Jane I've I've


---------08:13----------
got a question for you if I wanted to


---------08:15----------
find


---------08:17----------
I if I had if I wanted to find so


---------08:20----------
there's an average rate of bipolar - in


---------08:23----------
the US population and if I wanted to


---------08:27----------
find a group of people that had a rate


---------08:29----------
of bipolar - three three times the rate


---------08:33----------
of the average do you know where I could


---------08:35----------
look like where am I gonna find people


---------08:37----------
who who are three times more likely to


---------08:40----------
have bipolar - no actually Harvard


---------08:45----------
College really yes


---------08:49----------
that's it think about that for a second


---------08:52----------
yeah it's a like I'm obviously not a


---------08:55----------
professor of psychology but you know


---------08:58----------
it's it comes to myself I was went to


---------09:02----------
the military college and sometimes I see


---------09:04----------
it where people kind of compartmentalize


---------09:06----------
especially in mission oriented tasks


---------09:09----------
like people who you know in the military


---------09:10----------
it's all about the mission it's like you


---------09:11----------
accumulate stress while you're doing


---------09:14----------
your job or doing what was assigned and


---------09:15----------
you do that and then afterwards you kind


---------09:17----------
of like decompress and you can just like


---------09:19----------
try and get yourself back to normal so


---------09:20----------
you can take the same mission and I do


---------09:22----------
see that same kind of drive sometimes at


---------09:27----------
least within the realm of eSports as


---------09:30----------
well and that people especially when


---------09:32----------
they get into the mindset that like they


---------09:35----------
you know they need to win it's not that


---------09:37----------
they want to win it's not like they want


---------09:39----------
to be the best they want to win and


---------09:42----------
that's a never-ending mission to them


---------09:44----------
and they really do you know push


---------09:46----------
themselves well past what anyone would


---------09:48----------
consider healthy at least in terms of


---------09:50----------
physical limitations how do you think


---------09:52----------
that affects their their performance


---------09:54----------
this is one of the things that I'm


---------09:57----------
really interested in is I think that it


---------10:00----------
negatively affects their performance


---------10:01----------
quite a bit you know you had super in


---------10:03----------
Sinatra going on The Tonight Show with


---------10:05----------
Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Fallon did this


---------10:07----------
really brief kind of super


---------10:08----------
commercialized formatted interview with


---------10:10----------
them at the end he asked them if they


---------10:12----------
had any advice for like people who


---------10:14----------
wanted to also become pro gamers and


---------10:16----------
then super as a piece of advice was you


---------10:19----------
know you need to keep your life in


---------10:20----------
balance like you know he had a pretty


---------10:22----------
good answer but then Sinatra kind of


---------10:24----------
added to that he's like yeah but in


---------10:25----------
addition to keeping your life in balance


---------10:27----------
if you really want to be the best need


---------10:28----------
to grind eight to twelve hours a day on


---------10:30----------
top of that and it was like that math


---------10:33----------
just doesn't work out so you're these


---------10:36----------
kids you know like they're you can get


---------10:38----------
into the overwatch League on their 18th


---------10:40----------
birthday and the superstars usually do


---------10:42----------
but that means that these guys have been


---------10:44----------
grinding this game since they were 15


---------10:46----------
and they've been spending you know eight


---------10:48----------
to twelve hours you know you most days


---------10:50----------
of the week grinding to be this good


---------10:53----------
that's before they start getting on


---------10:54----------
teams and it's really all they know and


---------10:56----------
nobody has really taught them life


---------10:58----------
skills or soft skills and especially


---------11:01----------
when you're looking at like a field like


---------11:03----------
aviation you know my background is in


---------11:05----------
the Air Force as a pilot


---------11:07----------
the stat I think the most common staff


---------11:10----------
thrown away is that you would do four


---------11:12----------
hours of prep work for one hour of


---------11:13----------
performance or one hour of flight time


---------11:15----------
and there is this component where you


---------11:18----------
know the eight to 12 hours it's its


---------11:21----------
practice yes but there's also a


---------11:23----------
differences where it's like practice


---------11:25----------
doesn't make perfect perfect practice


---------11:26----------
makes perfect and I think that the


---------11:30----------
efficiency and just the way that people


---------11:35----------
are going about trying to improve at the


---------11:37----------
game is really incredibly inefficient


---------11:39----------
and I feel you know even things like


---------11:43----------
drills review focused practice on


---------11:46----------
specific areas different ways of


---------11:49----------
thinking like paradigm shifts rather


---------11:50----------
than what's the best way to explain this


---------11:53----------
you know I was I've worked with an


---------11:56----------
individual who


---------11:59----------
I didn't finish you know it's kind of I


---------12:02----------
would love to see a statistic it's


---------12:03----------
probably the one statistic the league


---------12:05----------
doesn't really want public but it's the


---------12:07----------
amount of people who either dropped out


---------12:08----------
of high school or who finished high


---------12:09----------
school online it's kind of like you know


---------12:12----------
given either course loads that you can


---------12:14----------
pursue your passion whatever it is


---------12:16----------
that's fine but you know I've had I've


---------12:18----------
worked with pro players who don't know


---------12:20----------
how to take notes things like that you


---------12:22----------
know looking at the game footage and


---------12:24----------
asking them to take notes of things that


---------12:26----------
they want to look after things that they


---------12:27----------
noticed or something and like they don't


---------12:30----------
they can't they don't know how so Jane


---------12:32----------
what what I'm hearing you say is that


---------12:33----------
like people don't know how to learn yes


---------12:37----------
well nobody's taught them you know yeah


---------12:39----------
it's a skill problem-solving is a skill


---------12:40----------
the scientific method wasn't developed


---------12:43----------
until the Enlightenment period before


---------12:44----------
that you know nobody really knew that


---------12:46----------
it's the same sort of thing scientific


---------12:48----------
thinking learning how to learn learning


---------12:50----------
how to fail gracefully learning how to


---------12:52----------
improve all those things are not skills


---------12:56----------
that are taught and right now there is a


---------12:58----------
significant number of people I think who


---------13:01----------
put in so many hours into the game


---------13:03----------
without thinking that they become purely


---------13:06----------
instinctual creatures or machines in the


---------13:08----------
fact that if they can do some pretty


---------13:11----------
incredible things and they'll you know


---------13:13----------
flank at the right time or do some


---------13:14----------
action that's a you know something that


---------13:16----------
I was like I don't see the connection


---------13:18----------
that they saw in order to actually pull


---------13:21----------
that play off but they don't either


---------13:23----------
they just know it was the right thing to


---------13:25----------
do at that time they can't articulate it


---------13:27----------
they can't explain it something about


---------13:29----------
the context of that play made sense in


---------13:31----------
their brain but it wasn't a focused


---------13:34----------
effort in order to figure out a play and


---------13:36----------
practice it through repetition it was


---------13:38----------
just kind of like over the multiple


---------13:40----------
thousands of hours I have in this game I


---------13:42----------
know that this is the right thing to do


---------13:43----------
at this point in time so it's it's very


---------13:46----------
weird kind of working with you know I


---------13:48----------
work in the world where or I worked


---------13:50----------
previous in the world of standard


---------13:52----------
operating procedures and workflows and


---------13:53----------
things like that where you know flight


---------13:55----------
safety if a plane goes down we review


---------13:58----------
all of our procedures and you never


---------13:59----------
assume that the pilot is at fault


---------14:00----------
there's things like your planes


---------14:03----------
themselves or to find no sign to not


---------14:05----------
only be triple redundant but also to fly


---------14:07----------
despite the best intentions of the


---------14:08----------
pilots that's the joke so something


---------14:10----------
fails and something goes wrong we


---------14:12----------
usually blame


---------14:13----------
the training we blame the workflows we


---------14:15----------
blame procedures we blame hardware the


---------14:18----------
last thing we blame as the pilot it's


---------14:20----------
how is that different from esports well


---------14:25----------
it's it's almost the exact opposite in


---------14:26----------
the fact that not only do we not blame


---------14:28----------
the training or anything like that but


---------14:31----------
there is no really defined way or an


---------14:34----------
accepted way of training educating and


---------14:37----------
coaching teams you know at the at the


---------14:39----------
league level sure some people okay what


---------14:42----------
is that what does that blame look like


---------14:44----------
so like let's say that you guys like


---------14:46----------
let's say that there's a team that you


---------14:48----------
know you guys had a disappointing


---------14:49----------
performance or you guys are screaming


---------14:51----------
and things aren't going well or you know


---------14:53----------
during like a particular run or


---------14:54----------
tournament things don't go well how does


---------14:57----------
that how does that look terms of you


---------15:01----------
know when you say like you blame


---------15:02----------
everything in in the Air Force you guys


---------15:05----------
blame everything except for the pilot


---------15:07----------
and in eSports and this has been my


---------15:09----------
experience as well that a lot of blame


---------15:11----------
falls on individuals there are


---------15:13----------
personality conflicts players will blame


---------15:16----------
once again they won't blame the system


---------15:19----------
in which they approach things they'll


---------15:21----------
blame each other organizations will


---------15:24----------
blame players like people will dogpile


---------15:26----------
some players like this is stuff that


---------15:28----------
I've seen like how does that play out


---------15:31----------
I mean you said it yourself all those


---------15:33----------
things have happened I don't want to


---------15:34----------
talk too much about the league level


---------15:36----------
there's any time I talk about the league


---------15:37----------
level people automatically assume that


---------15:38----------
the things that I'm saying are thinly


---------15:41----------
veiled references to the fuel so like I


---------15:43----------
don't mean to avoid topics I've got I've


---------15:45----------
got a lot of friends in both at the


---------15:47----------
player level and staff level for other


---------15:49----------
teams you know it's we talk sit we know


---------15:52----------
what's going on on other teams in terms


---------15:53----------
of like the you know it's not like


---------15:56----------
leaking confidential information or vods


---------15:58----------
or anything like that but you know


---------16:00----------
people know and people are having a


---------16:01----------
rough time or when there's conflict


---------16:03----------
between individuals and it's pretty


---------16:05----------
common yeah so let me ask you this then


---------16:07----------
then and and thanks for letting me know


---------16:09----------
you know what's okay or not okay to talk


---------16:11----------
about because I understand that you know


---------16:12----------
at the end of the day you're working for


---------16:14----------
a team and you're trying to be


---------16:15----------
competitive and you're trying to train


---------16:16----------
them to win then you don't want to you


---------16:17----------
know give up that competitive advantage


---------16:19----------
and or talk trash let me ask you this so


---------16:21----------
when you're dealing like is it can we


---------16:23----------
ask you a little bit about how you deal


---------16:25----------
with that like as a person like if you


---------16:29----------
notice that people are not like so you


---------16:31----------
have this Air Force training and other


---------16:33----------
people are instinctively moving towards


---------16:35----------
like blaming each other how do you how


---------16:38----------
do you try to move people from their way


---------16:42----------
of thinking into this other way of


---------16:44----------
thinking is that we're fronting do you


---------16:48----------
want it do you want this theoretical


---------16:50----------
like how I would do it because


---------16:51----------
technically the league level I'm an


---------16:53----------
assistant so there's you know I don't


---------16:56----------
get to fix things myself is that my way


---------17:00----------
of thinking my military background the


---------17:02----------
way that I would approach these problems


---------17:03----------
is subservient to Aero and the fact that


---------17:06----------
I'm there to assist Aero so sure what he


---------17:08----------
says in his approach to the team goes


---------17:11----------
but then there's times where like to get


---------17:13----------
into the league this is also kind of a


---------17:14----------
an interesting is that a lot of people


---------17:16----------
wow how much of a tangent do I want to


---------17:19----------
go on here go on the tangent baby go for


---------17:21----------
it okay so not far far away there is


---------17:24----------
everybody has a different approach to it


---------17:26----------
some players have different approaches


---------17:28----------
of games some coaches have driven to the


---------17:29----------
plays


---------17:31----------
and think I cut out there didn't I yeah


---------17:36----------
just for a second you're back okay but


---------17:39----------
tier two looking at it sometimes feels


---------17:41----------
almost like a lottery in the fact that


---------17:44----------
you know people try and assemble the


---------17:45----------
best ways that they can but there's a


---------17:47----------
lot of teams at the at the tier 2 level


---------17:50----------
that just kind of end up player coached


---------17:52----------
and then it almost feels like the


---------17:54----------
coaches themselves who are attached to


---------17:56----------
the teams are playing lottery and the


---------17:58----------
fact that when you have eight teams


---------18:00----------
competing one of them has to win and if


---------18:02----------
you're the coach of that you know team


---------18:04----------
that happened to win even if it was a


---------18:06----------
player-coach team you get to take credit


---------18:08----------
for that victory and then the next tier


---------18:10----------
up kind of looks at you so there's it


---------18:11----------
kind of like there's a lot of almost


---------18:14----------
going through the motions and that's


---------18:16----------
largely because there is no one accepted


---------18:19----------
way of coaching a team and any kind of


---------18:21----------
team that does feel like they've figured


---------18:22----------
out how to run a team and how to


---------18:24----------
actually work on player development


---------18:26----------
they're obviously not going to share


---------18:28----------
that information so player development


---------18:31----------
is something that is talked a lot about


---------18:33----------
but in the league and of the


---------18:36----------
semi-professional player it RN at the


---------18:38----------
semi-professional level it feels like


---------18:40----------
people are almost playing the lottery or


---------18:42----------
trading stocks where they're kind of if


---------18:45----------
you're not good enough they'd rather


---------18:46----------
just trade a player for a better player


---------18:48----------
and then instead of trying to work on


---------18:50----------
that player develop them or build them


---------18:52----------
up into order to be you know a dynasty


---------18:55----------
of a team there's very little focus on


---------18:57----------
player development and it's more of like


---------18:59----------
if you're not working and they're good


---------19:00----------
develops interpersonal issues just get


---------19:02----------
them the hell off my team so that we can


---------19:03----------
start again script start again fresh


---------19:06----------
absolutely I this yes this this


---------19:09----------
knowledge just isn't here it's not


---------19:10----------
endemic there's no institutional


---------19:12----------
knowledge you know what that sounds


---------19:15----------
actually a lot like so this sounds a lot


---------19:20----------
like Investment Banking to be completely


---------19:22----------
honest


---------19:22----------
so investment banking it's pretty much


---------19:24----------
what it is investment banking for you


---------19:26----------
guys don't know as a field that has a


---------19:28----------
real problem with retention so like


---------19:30----------
people go into Investment Banking they


---------19:32----------
work crazy hours and I think it's


---------19:34----------
bizarre how similar investment banking


---------19:35----------
is to eSports and is even more similar


---------19:38----------
to eSports than actually real sports so


---------19:41----------
I work with a few NFL players and the


---------19:43----------
NFL is like


---------19:44----------
completely different from esports the


---------19:46----------
first thing is that in the NFL you have


---------19:48----------
physical limitations on how much you can


---------19:51----------
practice right so like people train for


---------19:54----------
like 4 to 6 7 hours a day the people who


---------19:58----------
work really hard will watch a lot of


---------19:59----------
game tape and things like that but it's


---------20:01----------
still like basically like an 8 or 10 or


---------20:03----------
maybe 12 hour day but for some people


---------20:06----------
it's like a four hour day and people


---------20:08----------
train really hard and they're very


---------20:10----------
thoughtful and especially like good


---------20:13----------
quarterbacks will spend a lot of time


---------20:14----------
like reviewing game tape and things like


---------20:16----------
that but what this release and the other


---------20:19----------
thing about the NFL is like you don't


---------20:20----------
have like rampant player trading right


---------20:23----------
so you'll have like people will trade


---------20:25----------
and things like that but generally


---------20:26----------
speaking like you look at you know and


---------20:28----------
the NFL is about building dynasties just


---------20:31----------
like like Jane said Jane's like you know


---------20:32----------
in eSports people don't focus on


---------20:34----------
building dynasties the NBA is like


---------20:36----------
people like it's about building like a


---------20:37----------
cohesive team that you can run with like


---------20:40----------
think about Brady I mean I'm from Boston


---------20:42----------
so Tom Brady and the Patriots is about


---------20:44----------
building like a dynasty like a team of


---------20:46----------
people that will carry you to win title


---------20:49----------
after title after title after title


---------20:52----------
and in investment banking it's actually


---------20:54----------
the complete opposite so what happens is


---------20:56----------
you have a bunch of people who and I


---------20:58----------
think this happens in eSports as well


---------20:59----------
where you basically have an astronomical


---------21:04----------
success curve where like you'll have


---------21:07----------
people who like finish college right and


---------21:10----------
they've like they'll be like they have


---------21:11----------
essentially no net worth and they'll


---------21:13----------
move to New York City and they'll start


---------21:15----------
making like 200 to 250 K a year and


---------21:18----------
within 5 or 7 years they'll be making


---------21:21----------
700 K 800 K and then hopefully within a


---------21:24----------
decade or a little over a decade they're


---------21:26----------
gonna be making like seven figures so


---------21:29----------
just the the the


---------21:31----------
the difference between like 22 and 23 is


---------21:34----------
just astronomic and I see that in


---------21:36----------
eSports as well whereas like you've got


---------21:38----------
this eighteen-year-old kid who's like


---------21:39----------
bailing out a call like school right


---------21:41----------
he's like struggling to graduate because


---------21:43----------
he plays a game all day like whether it


---------21:45----------
be lul or overwatch or whatever and then


---------21:48----------
he lands a contract for like one 25k a


---------21:50----------
year or two 50k a year and this is a kid


---------21:53----------
who like doesn't have expenses like he


---------21:54----------
just sits at home and plays video games


---------21:56----------
and so that has its own stress and then


---------22:00----------
what happens is you start to get this


---------22:01----------
sort of situation where like an


---------22:03----------
investment banking you have a big


---------22:04----------
problem with retention so people feel


---------22:07----------
like they're undervalued or they feel


---------22:10----------
like they're not being treated or


---------22:11----------
utilized correctly and so they move and


---------22:14----------
so banks have a big problem with sort of


---------22:16----------
keeping the good people and losing the


---------22:18----------
bad people so they want to keep all the


---------22:20----------
people they perceive as good but the


---------22:23----------
people they perceive as good or are


---------22:24----------
gonna want to be shopping around a


---------22:26----------
little bit because they feel like they


---------22:27----------
can get a better offer elsewhere and the


---------22:29----------
flip side of it is they'll fire the


---------22:31----------
people who they think are bad but then


---------22:33----------
those people will travel to another


---------22:35----------
organization and either do bad there or


---------22:38----------
they'll find a right team they'll find a


---------22:41----------
different system they'll find a


---------22:42----------
different approach they'll have like a


---------22:44----------
manager who's a little bit more


---------22:45----------
compassionate and works on them as a


---------22:47----------
person and then they'll rise to the top


---------22:50----------
and they'll do really well so there's


---------22:53----------
the kind of this bizarre situation where


---------22:54----------
people are like looking at a system plus


---------22:57----------
a person and they're making a judgement


---------23:00----------
about the person instead of like


---------23:02----------
thinking at all about the system because


---------23:04----------
that is generally speaking in investment


---------23:06----------
banking like people are you know there's


---------23:08----------
a bell curve but like most people are


---------23:10----------
pretty good


---------23:11----------
and I've seen so much variance even


---------23:14----------
within an individual person like if you


---------23:15----------
stick one person their work product on a


---------23:18----------
particular team is gonna be way better


---------23:20----------
than the work product on another team


---------23:22----------
and that's because of the way that the


---------23:25----------
team functions like the way that the


---------23:27----------
reporting structure functions the way


---------23:29----------
that so I'll give you guys just one


---------23:31----------
really simple example so when you have a


---------23:32----------
junior team member


---------23:34----------
sometimes senior people will schedule


---------23:36----------
important meetings without them and one


---------23:39----------
of the simplest things you can do in


---------23:41----------
Investment Banking to get the most out


---------23:42----------
of your junior people is just not leave


---------23:44----------
them out like it's such a simple thing


---------23:46----------
but it like happens so rarely where I


---------23:50----------
was talking and and just include the


---------23:52----------
junior people on your team and then they


---------23:53----------
feel like they're a part of the team


---------23:55----------
instead of feeling like they're like a


---------23:56----------
monkey who's just they're like building


---------23:59----------
financial models in the basement for you


---------24:00----------
and then they're gonna give you that


---------24:02----------
extra mile and your team will do way


---------24:04----------
better but a lot of people in banking


---------24:06----------
just don't think about that they're just


---------24:08----------
like oh I wasn't invited to meetings


---------24:09----------
when I was junior person so I'm gonna


---------24:11----------
ignore my junior person and like and


---------24:13----------
then they start complaining when this


---------24:15----------
person doesn't seem to be doing a good


---------24:16----------
job because you haven't inspired them to


---------24:19----------
work and that sounds a lot like what


---------24:21----------
you're describing where people are in


---------24:24----------
like go ahead no if you can yes yes yeah


---------24:30----------
so I mean I think one thing to just


---------24:31----------
remember which which I really come to


---------24:36----------
appreciate is that if you want to get


---------24:37----------
the most out of a team member or


---------24:39----------
employee just remember that - like


---------24:42----------
people value - things people want to be


---------24:44----------
appreciated and people want to be


---------24:46----------
utilized


---------24:49----------
I think that like one of the biggest


---------24:50----------
problems is that like when people don't


---------24:52----------
feel like they want to be pushed they


---------24:54----------
want to be challenged they want to feel


---------24:56----------
like they're doing like the best work


---------24:57----------
that they can do and they want to be


---------24:58----------
like they want to feel appreciated for


---------25:01----------
doing that and anytime I see like a


---------25:04----------
leader do those two things for their


---------25:05----------
employees they do really really well and


---------25:08----------
when one of those two things is missing


---------25:10----------
ie not not keeping junior people not


---------25:13----------
loving them letting them live up to


---------25:14----------
their potential and then not expressing


---------25:16----------
gratitude leads to problems


---------25:19----------
yeah one of the one of the things it


---------25:22----------
sounds like in your examples and one of


---------25:24----------
the things that I've kind of identified


---------25:26----------
as one of the main problems that causes


---------25:29----------
interpersonal issues to arrive


---------25:30----------
especially on the more competitive teams


---------25:32----------
is just a lack of empathy for teammates


---------25:34----------
that seems to be other case you know


---------25:37----------
it's when you grind ranks so much


---------25:39----------
especially at the higher levels you kind


---------25:41----------
of become psychologically ingrained when


---------25:43----------
you're a professional player to you know


---------25:45----------
be that you are better than every one of


---------25:47----------
your teammates and every one of your


---------25:48----------
opponents and resources need to be


---------25:50----------
funneled into you in order to be


---------25:52----------
successful you know this happens when


---------25:53----------
you have grandmasters tall five hundreds


---------25:55----------
and pro players bidding getting put into


---------25:57----------
games with like masters players or


---------25:59----------
something there's you know when you


---------26:01----------
approach that last edge of the bell


---------26:03----------
curve every little tiny improvement is a


---------26:05----------
massive you know exponential increase in


---------26:07----------
both skill and knowledge and I feel like


---------26:10----------
a lot of pro players and semi-pro


---------26:11----------
players to really really struggle to get


---------26:13----------
out of that mindset because they have


---------26:15----------
put so many hours into the ranked ladder


---------26:17----------
before they actually transition into the


---------26:19----------
competitive mindset on a team and when


---------26:22----------
you do that out of all of the issues out


---------26:25----------
of everything that's gone around when


---------26:26----------
you see kind of teams going up and down


---------26:27----------
swinging dramatically it's usually it


---------26:31----------
comes down to kind of trust


---------26:32----------
communication teamwork and just


---------26:34----------
confidence in the ability to win I


---------26:36----------
thought it was so funny that the Houston


---------26:37----------
outlaws which had like a really really


---------26:39----------
rough year here pretty much as soon as


---------26:41----------
the it was announced that they were


---------26:44----------
being sold like the organization was


---------26:46----------
being sold to immortals they look like


---------26:49----------
won some games and it was to me you know


---------26:53----------
nothing else changed on the team but


---------26:54----------
it's like hey we're being sold maybe to


---------26:57----------
somebody who actually has money like


---------26:58----------
that you know maybe it gave the players


---------27:00----------
hope or confidence and when they were


---------27:02----------
feeling stuck otherwise that but just


---------27:04----------
that kind like mental shift might have


---------27:06----------
been enough to like get them to win some


---------27:07----------
game so now that's complete speculation


---------27:09----------
I don't know anything on the inside but


---------27:10----------
you know that lack of empathy for trying


---------27:13----------
to understand something from another


---------27:14----------
person's perspective especially treating


---------27:17----------
teammates as equals isn't something that


---------27:19----------
is very common it's actually quite quite


---------27:22----------
rare I think within the overwatch League


---------27:25----------
itself that infuriates me like because


---------27:29----------
because that was yeah I mean I like not


---------27:32----------
to


---------27:32----------
I'm not blaming anyone but I think like


---------27:34----------
the thing that infuriates me is that


---------27:35----------
that the theme of I think our or I guess


---------27:37----------
the view that Jane you and I share is


---------27:40----------
that things can be taught and and so I


---------27:45----------
think a big part of of what I do is I


---------27:48----------
try to teach people how to be empathic


---------27:50----------
like I try to teach people and I think


---------27:53----------
this is where you know the Yogi's


---------27:55----------
realize that like just about everything


---------27:58----------
about the mind any Faculty of the mind


---------28:00----------
or anything that a human being can do


---------28:01----------
can be understood and improved so that


---------28:04----------
our capacity for empathy our capacity


---------28:07----------
for creativity our capacity for


---------28:08----------
concentration you're talking about we're


---------28:10----------
not talking absolutely we're also not


---------28:13----------
taught how to concentrate that's just


---------28:15----------
something we just kind of take for


---------28:16----------
granted like oh like I'm having trouble


---------28:19----------
concentrating on studying for this test


---------28:21----------
I guess I'll try again later like no one


---------28:23----------
ever looks at like why am I having


---------28:26----------
trouble concentrating how do you


---------28:28----------
actually concentrate how do you train


---------28:30----------
your mind to focus how do you elicit a


---------28:33----------
flow state how do you learn how to be


---------28:35----------
empathic how do you learn to dissolve


---------28:37----------
your ego so I'm developing that's to


---------28:46----------
teach people especially because you can


---------28:48----------
solve problems that are binary like


---------28:50----------
should we do this yes or no but like the


---------28:52----------
classic problem that always disrupts a


---------28:55----------
team and you know if you as a team that


---------28:58----------
can figure out whether or not it was the


---------29:01----------
composition that is the problem or the


---------29:03----------
execution of that composition so if you


---------29:06----------
kind of if you're coach presents a new


---------29:09----------
composition and you run that composition


---------29:11----------
and you lose the argument always arises


---------29:14----------
whether or not the composition was wrong


---------29:16----------
or whether the execution was wrong and


---------29:18----------
one of the things that it just seems to


---------29:20----------
just not be in people's heads it's all


---------29:22----------
it's what does it call it's not a tooth


---------29:24----------
not to fact your problem but it's it


---------29:26----------
doesn't have to be one or the other both


---------29:28----------
of them can exist but people will always


---------29:30----------
try and you're they're gonna split in


---------29:32----------
it's gonna be tribal to you know we just


---------29:33----------
need to play the comp better or you know


---------29:35----------
we need to change the comp we executed


---------29:37----------
it finally first of all you never


---------29:38----------
executed anything perfectly and even if


---------29:40----------
the composition was good it's gonna


---------29:41----------
change and shift in a week anyway


---------29:43----------
because that's what them that is like


---------29:44----------
while people are developing and


---------29:46----------
I still get a rating on each other's


---------29:47----------
weaknesses yeah Jane you know what the


---------29:49----------
fascinating thing is there there is a


---------29:52----------
very clear neuroscience reason why that


---------29:55----------
happens and there are also very clear


---------29:57----------
neuroscience ways so there's certain


---------30:01----------
circuits in your brain that activate


---------30:04----------
that caused you to be black and white


---------30:06----------
so like when our limbic system in our


---------30:09----------
stress system activates our brain is


---------30:11----------
designed to think in terms of black and


---------30:13----------
white so normally like when we calmly


---------30:16----------
approach a problem like we're talking


---------30:18----------
about this and we're sort of


---------30:18----------
appreciating all these shades of grey


---------30:20----------
and I think your main point is that it's


---------30:22----------
not like strategy or execution they're


---------30:25----------
elements of both right and and but what


---------30:29----------
happens is people say like oh like we


---------30:31----------
had the by composition I assume you mean


---------30:33----------
more general sense strategy right like


---------30:35----------
what your comp is going into the game


---------30:37----------
yes yeah and then in an execution you


---------30:40----------
can maybe think about as tactics or just


---------30:42----------
how people played and so the fascinating


---------30:44----------
thing is when people get stressed out


---------30:46----------
their mind shuts off the ability to


---------30:49----------
appreciate shades of gray and that's


---------30:51----------
actually a survival mechanism so when


---------30:53----------
we're when we're faced with stress our


---------30:57----------
body like thinks were under attack


---------30:58----------
and when it thinks were under attack we


---------31:00----------
don't want to appreciate shades of gray


---------31:01----------
we want to make snap judgments and like


---------31:04----------
go like all in on one thing or another


---------31:06----------
thing like when we're faced with a tiger


---------31:08----------
in the jungle we want to go into do we


---------31:11----------
run or do we fight


---------31:13----------
everything in between is completely


---------31:15----------
irrelevant and for the human beings who


---------31:17----------
sat and appreciated nuance and Shades of


---------31:19----------
Grey when they faced a tiger you know


---------31:21----------
what happened to them absolutely they


---------31:26----------
just they just got gobbled and so what


---------31:29----------
happens is over millions of years of


---------31:30----------
evolution our brain is designed to be


---------31:33----------
like tribal or black-and-white thinking


---------31:35----------
and the cool thing is that there are


---------31:38----------
many ways that you can actually disable


---------31:40----------
that circuit of your brain so one thing


---------31:43----------
you can do is like actually reduce the


---------31:44----------
cortisol level in your body because


---------31:46----------
cortisol is gonna encourage black or


---------31:48----------
white thinking and cortisol is a stress


---------31:50----------
hormone this is also really fascinating


---------31:52----------
so adrenaline is so when when people get


---------31:56----------
heated and they start to argue and they


---------31:57----------
start like saying like oh it was


---------31:59----------
composition oh it was execution so


---------32:01----------
anytime you start arguing your


---------32:03----------
adrenaline level is gonna go up your


---------32:04----------
cortisol level is gonna go up and this


---------32:06----------
is fascinating so adrenaline actually


---------32:09----------
causes your peripheral vision to


---------32:10----------
collapse so our normal field of vision


---------32:13----------
is a hundred eighty degrees when we have


---------32:15----------
adrenaline in our system our field of


---------32:17----------
vision reduces down to thirty degrees


---------32:19----------
like our physically you can't see


---------32:22----------
anything except for what's in front of


---------32:24----------
you and the fascinating thing is that


---------32:26----------
correlates in my opinion there are fewer


---------32:28----------
studies about this to cycle


---------32:30----------
psychologically as well and you're


---------32:32----------
unable to see like your peripheral


---------32:34----------
vision when you get pissed off and you


---------32:36----------
zero in on one problem and you collapse


---------32:39----------
to like a thirty degree field of vision


---------32:41----------
and then all you can see is what's in


---------32:43----------
front of you oh the problem is this


---------32:44----------
other guy and you can't see anything


---------32:47----------
else and the really fascinating thing is


---------32:49----------
when I work with especially groups of


---------32:51----------
people like I also work with resident


---------32:53----------
physicians so this is a class of people


---------32:55----------
that is sort of like you know is the the


---------32:58----------
nuts and bolts of like what's running


---------33:00----------
the hospital so myself and my co


---------33:02----------
residents like we're running like we're


---------33:04----------
the ones who are taking all the call


---------33:05----------
shifts so one of us is working every


---------33:07----------
night or two of us are working every


---------33:09----------
night to cover in 960 bed hospital and


---------33:13----------
so what like there's all kinds of stuff


---------33:14----------
that happens like in terms of the person


---------33:16----------
that you're on with like if you feel


---------33:18----------
like they're not pulling your weight


---------33:19----------
you're gonna feel swamped or if you feel


---------33:22----------
swamped you reverse engineer the answer


---------33:24----------
and you say oh that guy's not pulling


---------33:26----------
his weight because I


---------33:27----------
feel swamped right like there's there's


---------33:30----------
like kind of this dyad and if you feel


---------33:33----------
stressed


---------33:33----------
you're gonna automatically like blame


---------33:35----------
the other person for your stress and


---------33:36----------
then you get into all kinds of other


---------33:39----------
things like if one person calls in sick


---------33:41----------
and that stresses everyone else so


---------33:44----------
there's a fascinating thing that happens


---------33:46----------
in residency that if one person calls in


---------33:49----------
sick it makes everyone else more likely


---------33:53----------
to call in sick because if I have to do


---------33:58----------
extra work because someone else is sick


---------33:59----------
well [ __ ] that I'm gonna call in sick


---------34:02----------
too and it gets to the point the worst


---------34:05----------
thing that I've ever seen is that when


---------34:07----------
when people start calling in sick people


---------34:09----------
start pretending to call in sick to


---------34:11----------
[ __ ] go to concerts that happened


---------34:13----------
once in my class and I was livid when I


---------34:15----------
found out we didn't say anything about


---------34:17----------
it but like someone's like well [ __ ] I


---------34:18----------
got called in so like other people can


---------34:22----------
get called in too it can become super


---------34:25----------
super toxic so fast so what do you do


---------34:29----------
about that Jane sure let's switch gears


---------34:43----------
for a second so I I appreciate that


---------34:45----------
so let me ask you this and if you're if


---------34:48----------
you're comfortable talking about this so


---------34:49----------
you said that you were diagnosed with


---------34:51----------
something like bipolar - yeah yeah so


---------34:55----------
you get like a hundred percent


---------34:57----------
confirmation that that's the case but


---------34:58----------
it's the working theory and it seems to


---------35:00----------
fit pretty well so far yeah so I think


---------35:02----------
that actually a lot of people like


---------35:04----------
resonated with that actually on on


---------35:05----------
twitch at and I was kind of curious what


---------35:08----------
what were you experiencing because I


---------35:10----------
think a big problem that a lot of people


---------35:12----------
face is that you know people think that


---------35:15----------
something that's happening to them is


---------35:16----------
normal and in a sense it is because


---------35:18----------
that's just how they've been their


---------35:19----------
entire life like your entire life I


---------35:21----------
would guess that you've just had periods


---------35:23----------
of time of like superhuman productivity


---------35:26----------
that other people have even been envious


---------35:29----------
of and then your body has had to like


---------35:31----------
tip like there's that balancing effect


---------35:33----------
right so after a period of superhuman


---------35:35----------
productivity you kind of like your body


---------35:38----------
has to crash


---------35:39----------
and that's just who you are it's the way


---------35:42----------
that you've always worked and so people


---------35:45----------
don't realize that like just because


---------35:47----------
you're working that way there's a way to


---------35:48----------
understand that there's a way to


---------35:50----------
actually capitalize on that there's a


---------35:52----------
way to balance that there's a way to


---------35:53----------
optimize it there's a way to take


---------35:56----------
advantage of it and there's a way to


---------35:57----------
like suffer less Oh certainly the like


---------36:00----------
the hypomania side that bipolar too is


---------36:02----------
despite being a mental illness as by


---------36:05----------
definition or something like that it is


---------36:08----------
very beneficial in cases you know it


---------36:10----------
does as you describe it at his


---------36:12----------
superhuman productivity one of the


---------36:14----------
things is that when I was first trying


---------36:16----------
to kind of understand the whole bipolar


---------36:17----------
to nature and you know I'm trying to


---------36:21----------
deal with it just through


---------36:22----------
self-regulation and healthy living


---------36:24----------
instead of I don't want to like medicate


---------36:27----------
myself I want to understand you to


---------36:28----------
understand my brain and all that so


---------36:30----------
but the hypomania side when I was


---------36:32----------
working on it I was having when I


---------36:34----------
stepped back from social media I was


---------36:36----------
having some pretty crippling social


---------36:38----------
anxiety which is really strange because


---------36:39----------
you know I've given thesis presentations


---------36:41----------
in front of the Prime Minister of Canada


---------36:43----------
and like never been nervous about that


---------36:44----------
before so for me to get anxiety and like


---------36:46----------
worry about things it was like this was


---------36:47----------
new it was that's [ __ ] literally an


---------36:50----------
anxious person just pause and


---------36:52----------
appreciating how cool that is


---------36:54----------
there was the military college it wasn't


---------36:55----------
anything that's that's [ __ ] cool man


---------37:00----------
what was your thesis I'm not to derail


---------37:03----------
me but I can't help myself


---------37:05----------
I studied aeronautical engineering at


---------37:07----------
the Royal Military College of Canada and


---------37:08----------
the fourth-year thesis in that program


---------37:11----------
is to design an aircraft so what we did


---------37:13----------
was we took a look at one of the current


---------37:16----------
platforms that the Air Force used and


---------37:19----------
we've redesigned it for modern times in


---------37:20----------
a way that a company could take and


---------37:23----------
actually produce it and I was the


---------37:24----------
aerodynamicist on that project that's


---------37:27----------
cool anyway and now I'm playing eSports


---------37:32----------
yeah so on when I was working with


---------37:34----------
working with my therapist to trying to


---------37:36----------
figure out what was going on with this


---------37:38----------
anxiety one of the things is that I had


---------37:41----------
I had well let's start back I'm like


---------37:43----------
what Beiler bipolar ii looked like to me


---------37:45----------
and why I didn't figure out that I was


---------37:48----------
bipolar like why I couldn't tell and why


---------37:50----------
I never like realize it because it you


---------37:52----------
know I say this to other people


---------37:53----------
like oh yeah that makes sense and like


---------37:55----------
you know people looking at me and me not


---------37:57----------
looking in the mirror it makes sense to


---------37:59----------
them but so I always thought that


---------38:02----------
bipolar as it was described was


---------38:03----------
something where it was like an


---------38:04----------
instantaneous shift of mood like with


---------38:06----------
mid-conversation


---------38:07----------
I always thought that that was why


---------38:08----------
people had trouble dealing with bipolar


---------38:10----------
individuals because in the middle of a


---------38:11----------
conversation they've got really happy


---------38:13----------
you're really sad or something like that


---------38:14----------
I didn't realize that bipolar happened


---------38:16----------
over the course of numerous days or


---------38:19----------
weeks or in some cases months and then


---------38:22----------
you can have these dramatic mood shifts


---------38:23----------
more gradually like that but you have


---------38:27----------
the stress of the overwatch league


---------38:28----------
itself started to compress the frequency


---------38:33----------
of my mood swings quite quite badly so


---------38:35----------
if I compress the frequency let's just


---------38:37----------
let's just pause so what that means is


---------38:39----------
that you started to fluctuate more


---------38:41----------
quickly due to stress yes okay okay and


---------38:46----------
it became a big problem and then so


---------38:49----------
after that whole situation which I'm


---------38:50----------
just gonna skip what did happen is that


---------38:54----------
I was having massive amounts of anxiety


---------38:56----------
and I couldn't figure out watching can I


---------38:58----------
ask you to pause for just one second


---------39:00----------
you're on an awesome rhythm but there's


---------39:02----------
so much that you're talking about which


---------39:04----------
i think is just so it's like a goldmine


---------39:06----------
for people i want to grab just i want to


---------39:09----------
grab like a notebook real quick and I


---------39:11----------
just want to jot down a couple of things


---------39:12----------
which I want to talk or ask about so and


---------39:15----------
it's just too good to pass up so I have


---------39:17----------
to interrupt you even though I feel like


---------39:18----------
that's criminal also I'm gonna just grab


---------39:20----------
something to drink real quick I'll be


---------39:21----------
right back


---------39:22----------
[Music]


---------39:34----------
you


---------39:42----------
[Music]


---------39:44----------
all right because I think like this what


---------39:46----------
you're saying so this is you're


---------39:47----------
absolutely correct about you know people


---------39:51----------
really misunderstand how quickly and how


---------39:54----------
slowly bipolar fluctuates and a lot of


---------39:57----------
people think that bipolar is like


---------40:00----------
someone who has like mood swings but


---------40:02----------
that's not where bipolar is and that's a


---------40:04----------
really important point that I just don't


---------40:06----------
want to lose along with everything else


---------40:07----------
you're saying okay


---------40:11----------
anyway please continue so I was I was


---------40:16----------
when I came back from my break and I


---------40:19----------
started to try and work with Dallas


---------40:21----------
again in stage four I was having anxiety


---------40:24----------
attacks and panic attacks and they were


---------40:25----------
really kind of weird in the fact that I


---------40:27----------
would feel them coming like it's just


---------40:29----------
something I could feel my body chemistry


---------40:31----------
shift and I could be like oh here we go


---------40:33----------
and I'd have to go over to my general


---------40:34----------
manager and be like hey I need to go to


---------40:36----------
my apartment I'm about to have a panic


---------40:37----------
attack


---------40:38----------
or Inc I don't know what the difference


---------40:39----------
between anxiety attack or panic attack


---------40:41----------
is I just know it's like [ __ ] that's


---------40:42----------
what it did so he'd help me we go to my


---------40:45----------
apartment and I kind of wait for it all


---------40:47----------
to blow over but working through the


---------40:48----------
therapist what I what I had realized is


---------40:51----------
basically that I had been kind of locked


---------40:53----------
into the depressive state for a while


---------40:55----------
and I had kind of considered that to be


---------40:58----------
my normal and then when the I step back


---------41:01----------
and I D stressed and I self-regulated


---------41:04----------
again started being healthier my body


---------41:07----------
was trying to go into the hypomanic


---------41:10----------
state move out a diversion but I hadn't


---------41:12----------
been there for so long I was fighting


---------41:15----------
against the mood correction into the


---------41:18----------
positive territory but when you say


---------41:20----------
fighting against what does that mean


---------41:21----------
it's so just a bipolar - I still I'm


---------41:26----------
aware of my mood and in control of my


---------41:28----------
mood so it's not like I ever lost


---------41:30----------
control or awareness over my actions or


---------41:32----------
anything like that and the fact that you


---------41:33----------
know if I was like super happy and


---------41:35----------
excited and I wanted to just dance in


---------41:38----------
the middle of the room like I could just


---------41:39----------
sit there and be like a normal person


---------41:40----------
and pretend to be a professional you


---------41:42----------
know it's like so things of that variety


---------41:44----------
is that you know despite my my body


---------41:48----------
wanting to basically stand up and dance


---------41:50----------
I could force myself to sit in that


---------41:52----------
chair and do work but that's you are


---------41:55----------
having you were having like these like


---------41:56----------
impulses and you would control the


---------41:58----------
release its impulses it doesn't sound


---------42:02----------
like the right bird to me at all it's


---------42:03----------
okay kind of like I would just I had


---------42:05----------
energy okay and I wanted to you know I


---------42:09----------
was energetic and wanted to do something


---------42:10----------
a little bit more stimulating than


---------42:12----------
whatever I was doing it okay basically


---------42:15----------
and then fighting against that is what


---------42:18----------
the therapist suggested might have been


---------42:20----------
causing the anxiety so she suggested


---------42:23----------
that basically I stopped trying to


---------42:25----------
like that and just like you know be okay


---------42:28----------
with whatever state of energy my body


---------42:30----------
wants to be at and so I did the next


---------42:33----------
time I felt an anxiety attack coming on


---------42:35----------
I'm like finally your therapist is very


---------42:36----------
good yeah she is


---------42:38----------
Thank You Dallas but yeah so I just let


---------42:43----------
it ride I let the anxiety attack right I


---------42:45----------
didn't try and fight it I wasn't worried


---------42:47----------
about it and then what had happened is


---------42:49----------
that after that that's the first time


---------42:51----------
that I entered a hypomanic state again


---------42:53----------
and I worked for like 35 hours straight


---------42:57----------
which was not healthy and my therapist


---------42:59----------
did not like that but I was like I was


---------43:01----------
having a blast and I must have gotten


---------43:03----------
like two weeks worth of work done it's


---------43:05----------
like 35 hours and then I basically


---------43:08----------
collapsed physically I gave out mentally


---------43:10----------
I was just wanted to keep working so


---------43:14----------
that was kind of like the first time


---------43:15----------
that was the kind of realizing what the


---------43:16----------
anxiety was it was like my body wanted


---------43:18----------
to be happy but I'd been unhappy for so


---------43:20----------
long that I was fighting against it


---------43:22----------
though and since then like I've been


---------43:24----------
putting a lot of that energy into


---------43:27----------
self-regulating working out eating


---------43:29----------
healthier like you know it is kind of


---------43:30----------
nice when I post a photo on Instagram or


---------43:32----------
like people like wow are you looking


---------43:33----------
good it's like yeah I've got all this


---------43:34----------
energy and I kind of realized that you


---------43:38----------
do look good by the way thank you


---------43:40----------
the last time I saw you yes you look so


---------43:46----------
much better thank you your face has


---------43:49----------
something called orgeous in it oh just


---------43:55----------
something weird is happening


---------43:59----------
can you still hear me yeah so you have


---------44:02----------
something called Oh Jess I don't


---------44:06----------
understand something weird just happened


---------44:08----------
in my twitch chat but uh so gorgeous is


---------44:12----------
like glow is how it gets translated so


---------44:15----------
you have like a glow in your face like


---------44:17----------
and you look it wasn't there last time


---------44:20----------
yeah it's it's been well the last time


---------44:25----------
you saw me was yeah probably right in


---------44:27----------
the middle of that so where was I oh


---------44:31----------
basically like when I am in a hypomanic


---------44:34----------
state and being really productive it


---------44:36----------
feels like I'm a candle burning from


---------44:38----------
both ends and that I can feel the


---------44:40----------
physical toll of being that productive


---------44:43----------
takes on the fact that I'm pretty aware


---------44:45----------
that if I let myself work at maximum


---------44:48----------
capacity that I'd shorten my life span


---------44:50----------
there's no real other way to put it so


---------44:52----------
I've been in order to my way of coal


---------44:56----------
regulating has kind of been putting that


---------44:58----------
energy into keeping myself alive by


---------45:00----------
staying healthy making sure I'm working


---------45:02----------
out and eating and now introspection


---------45:05----------
meditation things like that but it's


---------45:07----------
been an unmarked increase in quality of


---------45:09----------
life yeah so I'm gonna I want to ask you


---------45:13----------
a question but um I need to figure out


---------45:15----------
how do I turn off the sound for gifts


---------45:17----------

---------47:33----------
really excited because I think you're


---------47:34----------
you're doing this in such an awesome way


---------47:36----------
like the way that first of all the way


---------47:38----------
that you discovered this the way that


---------47:40----------
you recognized that this is actually who


---------47:42----------
you've been your entire life and there's


---------47:44----------
so many elements to this like I don't


---------47:46----------
want to cut you off but you were saying


---------47:47----------
that you know people are saying that


---------47:50----------
you're looking better now so so tell us


---------47:52----------
a little bit about how you're doing now


---------47:53----------
oh yeah it's just like so I've been like


---------47:58----------
you know ever since I kind of figured


---------48:00----------
out this and I've actually been able to


---------48:01----------
self-regulate a little bit I haven't


---------48:04----------
actually been on the downside of bipolar


---------48:06----------
since August 18th now so I'm over two


---------48:09----------
months maintaining kind of like positive


---------48:12----------
mood state which is I like it


---------48:14----------
are you hypomanic or you just kind of


---------48:16----------
miss no hypomanic yeah I put my had for


---------48:19----------
two months now yeah how much are you


---------48:21----------
sleeping every night about five hours


---------48:23----------
usually so it does yeah that's always


---------48:25----------
the first question so at first it was


---------48:28----------
down to three hours just because the


---------48:29----------
energy persisted even through dreams


---------48:31----------
which is really weird and wonky but


---------48:33----------
since then since I've been able to


---------48:35----------
actually kind of through meditation be


---------48:37----------
able to self-regulate a little bit more


---------48:38----------
you know five hours five six hours is


---------48:41----------
probably average and then you know if I


---------48:43----------
really push myself then yeah if I like


---------48:45----------
if I exhaust myself then we can sleep


---------48:47----------
for a normal eight hours or so


---------48:49----------
okay so I think


---------48:53----------
a couple of things that I want to ask


---------48:54----------
you so the first is so I'm noticing that


---------48:58----------
you're kind of attached to your bipolar


---------49:00----------
- does that make sense yes because it's


---------49:09----------
been kind of the starting point for me


---------49:11----------
to figure out things that have actually


---------49:13----------
made marked improvements you know it's a


---------49:16----------
I've always been very cautious against


---------49:19----------
self diagnosis you know invests at the


---------49:21----------
same time it's you know that the DSM and


---------49:23----------
diagnostic manuals so I was very kind of


---------49:27----------
honest with my therapist be like you


---------49:28----------
know like what is this what are you


---------49:30----------
thinking like you know don't give me the


---------49:31----------
Coles notes potions like what do you


---------49:32----------
actually they just speak honestly sort


---------49:34----------
of thing but yeah the reason that I kind


---------49:38----------
of refer to bipolar 2 and hypomania as


---------49:39----------
much as I do is just because in looking


---------49:42----------
at how its treated and reading the


---------49:45----------
stories about how other people have


---------49:47----------
managed it I've found clues that have


---------49:49----------
helped me live a better life so it's not


---------49:51----------
like I I don't like to identify I don't


---------49:54----------
think I've ever actually mentioned


---------49:56----------
hypomania on my own social medias before


---------49:58----------
I've mentioned bipolar 2 once in a


---------50:01----------
youtube video and I specifically


---------50:02----------
mentioned then that I didn't want to be


---------50:04----------
known as the guy with bipolar so like I


---------50:06----------
don't make any public references to it


---------50:08----------
this is just because your memoir is why


---------50:11----------
I mention it so much yeah so I'm glad


---------50:14----------
you do because I think the first thing


---------50:15----------
to recognize it's funny so like um you


---------50:18----------
know a guy named Evan Nash by chance I


---------50:20----------
don't know okay so III was he's he's


---------50:23----------
also like uh he was CEO of counter logic


---------50:26----------
gaming a couple of years ago and so it's


---------50:28----------
still like sort of in the esports kind


---------50:30----------
of film but so I was talking to Devin on


---------50:35----------
Friday and the really fascinating thing


---------50:37----------
is that like so we were talking about


---------50:39----------
his sense of inadequacy and he really is


---------50:42----------
attached to a sense of inadequacy


---------50:43----------
because he feels like it's responsible


---------50:45----------
for his success and that his inadequacy


---------50:48----------
fuels him forward because he's never


---------50:51----------
like satisfied with himself in that that


---------50:52----------
causes him to move forward and I think


---------50:55----------
that the really fascinating thing that


---------50:56----------
I've noticed about working with people


---------50:58----------
who have I don't really like to call it


---------51:00----------
mental illness I think it's just a part


---------51:02----------
of them right so like what I work with


---------51:04----------
people with anxiety they - like they


---------51:06----------
don't want to lose


---------51:06----------
their anxiety and the people who are the


---------51:09----------
most attached to their quote-unquote


---------51:12----------
mental illness are actually people with


---------51:13----------
bipolar too because they don't want to


---------51:16----------
give us this there's quite a few people


---------51:18----------
out there who credit hypomania to their


---------51:20----------
success in their field or the career


---------51:22----------
it's not so at least from my own


---------51:25----------
research that's not a unique experience


---------51:27----------
it's this legitimate Lee it does make me


---------51:30----------
more productive not not only is it


---------51:33----------
legitimately that not only is it an


---------51:36----------
uncommon experience I would argue it is


---------51:38----------
like a very common experience and and


---------51:41----------
once again when we're talking about


---------51:42----------
undergrads at Harvard College like they


---------51:46----------
are there because of their bipolar -


---------51:47----------
they are there because they can go two


---------51:50----------
months sleeping four hours a night and


---------51:52----------
study their asses off and enjoy it


---------51:57----------
and enjoy because they feel great and


---------51:58----------
then when the other shoe Falls you know


---------52:00----------
they feel offer awful their productivity


---------52:02----------
drops but they're still able to sustain


---------52:04----------
it just like you have like I'm hearing


---------52:07----------
that you needed to take a break from


---------52:08----------
time to time and it's also sounds like


---------52:10----------
you've been sort of struggling with this


---------52:11----------
cycle for many years and yet you've


---------52:14----------
become overwhelmingly professionally


---------52:17----------
successful like you were in the Air


---------52:18----------
Force you're you know you've been in


---------52:20----------
eSports like you can't you can't drop


---------52:22----------
off the face of the earth for like two


---------52:24----------
months in eSports and have a job when


---------52:25----------
you come back you just can't


---------52:26----------
so you manage the lows or maybe I'm


---------52:29----------
making assumptions but I don't I mean


---------52:30----------
that hasn't been my experience cuz if


---------52:32----------
just I mean the league is two years old


---------52:34----------
so to like drop off the face of things


---------52:37----------
for like five percent of the time that


---------52:38----------
the league has been existence I don't


---------52:40----------
think you can stop yeah I took do it


---------52:42----------
because I'm I'm large enough that you


---------52:45----------
know I can come back it's like my spot


---------52:47----------
isn't okay I know I'm no longer


---------52:49----------
competing for my spot so I literally can


---------52:51----------
disappear off social media for two


---------52:53----------
months and then come back but for you


---------52:55----------
know for most people who are still on


---------52:56----------
the grind I don't listen to myself on


---------52:59----------
the grind anymore and the first thing


---------53:01----------
things to do but I'm not competing


---------53:02----------
against others at this point yeah so


---------53:04----------
that's that's actually a wonderful


---------53:06----------
stress-free sort of way at looking at


---------53:08----------
things that's something that I'd like to


---------53:11----------
dive into but I just have too many


---------53:12----------
things written down in my notebook so


---------53:15----------
the first thing that I kind of want to


---------53:17----------
let people understand is that a lot of


---------53:19----------
the negative things we experience in our


---------53:22----------
mind and a lot of the things that


---------53:23----------
actually cause us suffering and


---------53:25----------
difficulty actually like help us out in


---------53:27----------
a very important way so you know anxiety


---------53:30----------
in a weird way is like a protective


---------53:33----------
mechanism right because it keeps you


---------53:34----------
from getting hurt so like if you're


---------53:37----------
giving a presentation let's say to the


---------53:39----------
Prime Minister of Canada and you have


---------53:40----------
social anxiety you don't want to look


---------53:42----------
like an idiot in front of the Prime


---------53:43----------
Minister of Canada so you don't speak


---------53:45----------
but in a weird way like that's actually


---------53:47----------
helping you out like it's protecting you


---------53:49----------
from looking like an idiot in front of


---------53:50----------
the Prime Minister Minister of Canada


---------53:51----------
for people who have bipolar to their


---------53:54----------
periods of hypomania allow them to work


---------53:56----------
for 35 35 hours at a stretch really


---------53:59----------
sounds a little bit more like mania but


---------54:00----------
the standard the standard you know


---------54:03----------
bipolar to sort of pattern is like


---------54:05----------
sleeping five hours a night and being


---------54:07----------
like pretty damn productive while you're


---------54:09----------
awake


---------54:10----------
right so normally like most human beings


---------54:12----------
and some people can get get by with like


---------54:14----------
4 to 6 hours of sleep but but most human


---------54:17----------
beings need a solid 8 hours and if they


---------54:19----------
get less than that their productivity


---------54:20----------
really drops so the first thing I want


---------54:23----------
people to understand is that like in the


---------54:25----------
same way that that Jane and I were


---------54:27----------
talking about black and white thinking


---------54:28----------
like is bizarre as the sounds I'm not


---------54:30----------
saying that mental illness is a good


---------54:32----------
thing in any way but at the same time


---------54:34----------
understand that a lot of your negative


---------54:36----------
mental patterns are doing something for


---------54:39----------
you even if we look at something like


---------54:41----------
video game addiction video game


---------54:43----------
addiction is doing something for you


---------54:45----------
that's why you do it so much right


---------54:47----------
people who are addicted to video games


---------54:49----------
and escape from the world through


---------54:51----------
playing video games like that's what


---------54:52----------
it's doing it's protecting you from the


---------54:55----------
consequences of the real world and so


---------54:57----------
the first thing in in Devon's inadequacy


---------54:59----------
is fueling him towards material success


---------55:02----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------55:04----------
you know we classify mental illness is


---------55:07----------
all bad and I I'm not saying that people


---------55:09----------
should go around trying to be bipolar


---------55:10----------
I'm not saying that I think you can be


---------55:12----------
free from anxiety like that so what I


---------55:13----------
work towards and at the same time


---------55:16----------
understand that it's like not all a


---------55:18----------
negative thing and that it's usually


---------55:19----------
doing something for in some cases like


---------55:22----------
schizophrenia or you know really bad


---------55:24----------
depression I find it hard to understand


---------55:25----------
exactly what it's doing for you um but


---------55:28----------
you know for a lot of people like if you


---------55:31----------
have some kind of mental pattern like we


---------55:32----------
had someone else on a couple weeks ago


---------55:34----------
who is talking about how they always end


---------55:37----------
up dating someone who's emotionally like


---------55:39----------
oh sorry like so who's someone like


---------55:42----------
their their parents and they're sort of


---------55:44----------
like emotionally unavailable and that


---------55:45----------
can be the kind of thing that feels


---------55:47----------
painful and causes suffering and is


---------55:49----------
actually doing something for so what I


---------55:51----------
really like about your story Jane is


---------55:53----------
that you're acknowledging that like even


---------55:55----------
though this has been a struggle for you


---------55:57----------
and it's been hard and not that it's


---------55:58----------
good but that you recognize that there


---------56:00----------
are parts of this that you really don't


---------56:02----------
want to give up right yes so I'm getting


---------56:06----------
also a lot of questions about you know


---------56:10----------
what's true bipolar versus mood swings


---------56:12----------
and I think you opened up with this


---------56:13----------
which was awesome so people toss around


---------56:17----------
the word bipolar and you were saying


---------56:20----------
that you know you didn't realize that


---------56:21----------
bipolar is something that happens


---------56:23----------
mood shift happens over the course of


---------56:25----------
days or even weeks you were kind of


---------56:28----------
envisioning someone who's like really


---------56:29----------
happy one minute and is like throwing


---------56:31----------
[ __ ] the next minute yeah and I was


---------56:34----------
envisioning also somebody who is hard to


---------56:36----------
communicate with or was like socially


---------56:37----------
awkward and I do not consider myself


---------56:39----------
that kind of person so that was another


---------56:41----------
reason at least in my head I was like


---------56:43----------
all of you have mood swings that must


---------56:44----------
make you like you know not very much fun


---------56:46----------
at parties or you know yes perhaps in


---------56:48----------
the work environment or things like that


---------56:49----------
but no that's a great point right so we


---------56:53----------
also have conceptions of what mental


---------56:55----------
health looks like and since we don't


---------56:58----------
feel like the stuff on TV looks we think


---------57:03----------
that that's not really what's going on


---------57:05----------
so like even when you look at like


---------57:07----------
schizophrenia for example on on TV like


---------57:10----------
it's perceived in a very particular way


---------57:12----------
or like you know even stuff like


---------57:15----------
addiction is like perceived in like a


---------57:17----------
very like kind of almost like glamorous


---------57:20----------
way like it's like really high highs and


---------57:22----------
really low lows and like this really


---------57:24----------
like noble struggle against addiction


---------57:26----------
whereas for the most part addiction is


---------57:28----------
like a slaw it's like just really


---------57:30----------
[ __ ] boring okay if you made a TV


---------57:32----------
show about someone with addiction it


---------57:34----------
would be like them waking up maybe going


---------57:35----------
to a job maybe not going to a job coming


---------57:37----------
home and then feeding their addiction


---------57:39----------
and it's like just like West Wing it's


---------57:42----------
yeah so it's not Leo McGarry for us from


---------57:45----------
West Wing right like oh yeah no no


---------57:47----------
because Leo McGarry is like he's like


---------57:48----------
it's a noble it's a noble like they


---------57:51----------
don't actually show him so if you want


---------57:53----------
to really see that's a great example so


---------57:55----------
if you want to see the real like what


---------57:57----------
addiction really looks like it would be


---------57:59----------
six seasons of West Wing where Leo


---------58:02----------
McGarry is sitting in a room and


---------58:04----------
drinking alcohol every episode that's


---------58:06----------
what real addiction looks like Leo


---------58:09----------
McGarry is a noble guy who's productive


---------58:11----------
and has this kind of romanticized


---------58:13----------
struggle with addiction where they show


---------58:15----------
this really powerful scene where he's


---------58:17----------
like drinking and relapses and stuff


---------58:19----------
like that and his friends kind of come


---------58:21----------
in and support him real addiction is


---------58:23----------
just [ __ ] boring to watch


---------58:24----------
just [ __ ] bore


---------58:27----------
I think about people who are addicted to


---------58:29----------
video games like that's not glamorous


---------58:30----------
you just wake up every day and you start


---------58:32----------
like you're queueing for overwatch and


---------58:33----------
you just play overwatch all day and then


---------58:35----------
like you switch to dota and you switch


---------58:36----------
to loll then you go to sleep and then


---------58:38----------
you wake up and you do it the next day


---------58:39----------
it's not romanticized at all


---------58:40----------
in that same way so it kind of I think


---------58:44----------
I've sorry for going off on a tangent


---------58:45----------
but what I wanted to share with people


---------58:47----------
is like so so one of the biggest things


---------58:49----------
that I think Jane learned which is very


---------58:51----------
important to understand is that bipolar


---------58:52----------
doesn't mean mood swings so a lot of


---------58:54----------
people like I hear people that come into


---------58:56----------
my office and they'll say like oh my my


---------58:59----------
son is bipolar so it'll be like a parent


---------59:01----------
and bipolar that means that he'll be


---------59:03----------
like playing video games one minute and


---------59:04----------
the next minute he's like throwing [ __ ]


---------59:06----------
because they like unplug his internet


---------59:07----------
that's not bipolar that's not so bipolar


---------59:11----------
doesn't mean mood swings so mood


---------59:13----------
reactivity is a different thing so there


---------59:16----------
are some people who have like very high


---------59:18----------
degrees of mood reactivity so their mood


---------59:20----------
can swing from like one one thing to


---------59:23----------
another thing over the course of 5


---------59:24----------
minutes or an hour 2 hours


---------59:26----------
bipolar in depression is persistent


---------59:31----------
periods of mood that lasts in the case


---------59:33----------
of bipolar one week or more like pretty


---------59:36----------
much most days all day everyday kind of


---------59:39----------
thing or in the case of depression like


---------59:40----------
two weeks at a stretch so if you're


---------59:43----------
super depressed for a weekend and are


---------59:45----------
fine on Monday morning like that's not


---------59:47----------
major depressive disorder that's not


---------59:49----------
clinical depression that's not really


---------59:51----------
bipolar so true depression or bipolar


---------59:54----------
involved periods of mood that lasts days


---------59:56----------
at a time or even weeks or even months


---------59:58----------
up to about a year in the case of


---------60:01----------
depression that's one thing so mood


---------60:03----------
swings different the second thing that I


---------60:06----------
wanted to point out is that it sounds


---------60:08----------
like you've had this pattern for your


---------60:10----------
entire life and also that certain things


---------60:12----------
use the word stress from overwatch


---------60:15----------
compressed the swings that's okay


---------60:20----------
something that you know I don't know if


---------60:24----------
there was any other sort of


---------60:25----------
physiological changes that cause the the


---------60:29----------
fluctuations to accelerate but that's at


---------60:32----------
least as far as I can tell what caused


---------60:35----------
it to accelerate there so yeah it's go


---------60:39----------
ahead I'm going to just say this


---------60:41----------
once and I'll say it a thousand more


---------60:42----------
times if you think something is going on


---------60:45----------
chances are you're right


---------60:48----------
so one of the biggest lessons that I've


---------60:50----------
learned as a psychiatrist is I can train


---------60:52----------
as much as I want to I can read as many


---------60:54----------
books or studies as much as I want to


---------60:55----------
and if a patient walks into my office


---------60:57----------
and they say I think this is what's


---------61:00----------
going on like 90% chance that's what's


---------61:02----------
going on


---------61:04----------
and so like sure there could be like


---------61:06----------
weird neuroscience or physiologic things


---------61:08----------
but because what I realized is that most


---------61:11----------
people like actually like have a good


---------61:12----------
instinct for like what's going on with


---------61:14----------
themselves


---------61:16----------
and so stress absolutely does cause


---------61:18----------
these things to worsen and in terms of


---------61:22----------
worsen there are a couple of different


---------61:24----------
dimensions in which stress can cause


---------61:26----------
things stores and one is that it can


---------61:28----------
make your lows lower it can make your


---------61:31----------
highs higher it can make them more


---------61:34----------
calcified and harder to move or it can


---------61:37----------
accelerate the the cycling process and


---------61:41----------
the cycling process is essentially like


---------61:43----------
an attempt to balance and if you think


---------61:47----------
about like you know if you let's say


---------61:49----------
like you're you're like sailing a boat


---------61:51----------
and then you get hit by a huge wave


---------61:54----------
which is like a stress and then your


---------61:56----------
boat starts to rock and if you try to


---------61:58----------
like overcompensate you're gonna make


---------61:59----------
things worse and then you're


---------62:01----------
overcompensating again and it's almost


---------62:03----------
like you know when people say that if


---------62:05----------
you lose control of a car you should let


---------62:07----------
go in the direction of the skin because


---------62:09----------
if you if you go against the skid you're


---------62:12----------
gonna just like you're gonna fishtail


---------62:14----------
and you're gonna like actually end up


---------62:16----------
worse right so the really fascinating


---------62:19----------
thing is when our when our body goes


---------62:21----------
under a period or a brain goes under a


---------62:23----------
period of stress sometimes our body


---------62:25----------
tries too hard to overcompensate we try


---------62:28----------
too hard to control things and it just


---------62:29----------
makes things worse which is why I think


---------62:31----------
that your therapist is so [ __ ]


---------62:33----------
brilliant because what she said is that


---------62:35----------
like your anxiety or panic is actually


---------62:37----------
coming is a manifestation of


---------62:40----------
inappropriately dealing with something


---------62:43----------
else that you have this excessive energy


---------62:47----------
which needs to come out and you're not


---------62:50----------
letting it come out and since it can't


---------62:52----------
go out one way it's gonna blow a gasket


---------62:54----------
somewhere over here so like I want you


---------62:57----------
guys so I want you guys to envision so


---------63:01----------
envision Jane like a closed system that


---------63:04----------
has pressure building up and he's got


---------63:06----------
this impulse like he's got this pressure


---------63:08----------
valve on this one side which is to get


---------63:10----------
up and dance and that's what he wants to


---------63:11----------
do


---------63:13----------
and if you don't open that pressure


---------63:14----------
valve and the pressure and the system


---------63:16----------
keeps building up like what's gonna


---------63:18----------
happen Jane increased heart rate you


---------63:22----------
know you're gonna start fidgeting you're


---------63:24----------
gonna start having frantic thoughts yeah


---------63:26----------
and your system is gonna blow a gasket


---------63:28----------
somewhere else like if you don't let


---------63:30----------
that pressure out it's gonna manifest


---------63:32----------
somewhere else


---------63:33----------
and I'll give you guys like another


---------63:35----------
great example of this so I I had a one


---------63:40----------
of my teachers once taught me something


---------63:42----------
really awesome about depression which is


---------63:44----------
that the source of depression is anger


---------63:46----------
turns against the self


---------63:50----------
and that that depression really like


---------63:52----------
finds its roots and like anger towards


---------63:55----------
yourself and when you can't express that


---------63:58----------
anger towards yourself when you can't


---------63:59----------
metabolize or process that anger about


---------64:02----------
yourself it transforms into depression


---------64:04----------
and in your case go ahead I just tell


---------64:08----------
you the cause of mine you know I keep


---------64:10----------
talking about being a pilot in the Air


---------64:11----------
Force but in my final year of university


---------64:14----------
I was hit by a car at night it was a


---------64:16----------
hit-and-run I got injured and I ended up


---------64:18----------
pushing out in my last year and then


---------64:21----------
because I was at the military college


---------64:23----------
not only did that lose my trade but also


---------64:26----------
my degree so that was kind of the cause


---------64:28----------
of you know it was and I was angry at


---------64:30----------
myself for having failed Yeah right


---------64:33----------
because it mine yeah which is which is


---------64:35----------
crazy because like you got hit by


---------64:37----------
someone right and yet somehow you you


---------64:41----------
get angry at yourself and that anger


---------64:43----------
sort of like in an alchemical process


---------64:46----------
like gets transmuted into depression and


---------64:49----------
so something about sort of this internal


---------64:51----------
energy that you had got like


---------64:53----------
alchemically transmuted into anxiety


---------64:59----------
so yeah like I said this is just pure


---------65:01----------
gold for me so the next thing is is you


---------65:04----------
were saying like you're not sure what


---------65:05----------
the difference between anxiety and panic


---------65:07----------
is so I'm gonna just talk for a second


---------65:09----------
about that


---------65:10----------
so anxiety is generally like worrying


---------65:13----------
about stuff so when I think about


---------65:16----------
anxiety like I think like I so my


---------65:18----------
classic question for whether someone has


---------65:20----------
anxieties I just ask them are you a


---------65:22----------
worrier so Jane are you a worrier no I


---------65:26----------
don't mean warrior I mean like wor ril


---------65:30----------
are know yeah so if you worry about


---------65:35----------
stuff then chances are you're gonna be


---------65:38----------
prone to anxiety yeah oh oh warrior is


---------65:42----------
different warrior and would it be if I


---------65:45----------
use the accent it is easier to


---------65:47----------
understand and so what we think about is


---------65:52----------
panic is usually discrete episodes so


---------65:56----------
like people who have anxiety generally


---------65:58----------
like worry all the time like you were


---------65:59----------
talking about social anxiety right so


---------66:01----------
like those like if you're if you become


---------66:03----------
socially anxious like if you're in the


---------66:04----------
right setting like your mind is just


---------66:06----------
gonna be worrying somewhat constantly


---------66:08----------
does that make sense


---------66:08----------
whereas panic is usually like a discrete


---------66:11----------
episode of you know can last an hour


---------66:15----------
maybe even to of like highly elevated


---------66:18----------
heart rate like sweating stuff like that


---------66:19----------
you can get that in social anxiety as


---------66:21----------
well but panic is sort of like episodic


---------66:23----------
in nature and anxiety is generally like


---------66:25----------
is a more general like experience over a


---------66:28----------
prolonged period of time


---------66:30----------
um


---------66:34----------
yeah so that's what I that's that's


---------66:36----------
that's what I got yeah so from from that


---------66:39----------
definition it would have been social


---------66:41----------
anxiety just general tolerant and then


---------66:44----------
it it would have been panic attacks yeah


---------66:46----------
absolutely so I think I think the word


---------66:49----------
attack is actually really good because


---------66:50----------
that implies like an episode so when


---------66:52----------
people talk about it I think they're


---------66:53----------
having panic attacks yeah so it's like a


---------66:56----------
discrete period of you know really


---------67:00----------
strong like overwhelming emotions in


---------67:03----------
that moment so I'm gonna ask so Jane


---------67:06----------
anything else you want to mention or any


---------67:08----------
questions that you have I mean it's a


---------67:11----------
the story spans months so you know it's


---------67:15----------
wherever you want to go so I was


---------67:17----------
actually thinking maybe we could do some


---------67:19----------
Q&A and we'll see if people have


---------67:20----------
questions for you or me sure and the


---------67:24----------
other thing that I want to do is is


---------67:27----------
I want to teach some meditation today


---------67:30----------
and I just let me I've got


---------67:35----------
I got 13 minutes okay perfect so let's


---------67:38----------
do questions yeah so I'm gonna say well


---------67:42----------
so let's see if people have questions


---------67:43----------
for Jane let's start there


---------67:46----------
and then I'll do meditation afterward


---------67:48----------
and thanks for coming on by the way my


---------67:50----------
pleasure you know it's something like


---------67:52----------
this that happens me I just know that


---------67:53----------
I'm not unique in this regard and I I


---------67:57----------
see a world where we are giving these


---------67:59----------
young kids you don't know much about the


---------68:02----------
world don't have soft skills aren't


---------68:03----------
learning psychology aren't you know


---------68:05----------
being introspective or really kind of


---------68:07----------
caring about themselves that either


---------68:08----------
they're gonna go through these


---------68:10----------
breakdowns and similar struggles or


---------68:12----------
they're gonna leave the league and


---------68:14----------
something like you know maybe they have


---------68:15----------
one really successful year and they


---------68:17----------
sacrificed everything to get where they


---------68:18----------
are and then you know I don't know what


---------68:20----------
this dive in with the NBA of all the


---------68:21----------
players going bankrupt after they left


---------68:23----------
but I do think that you know I've been


---------68:26----------
almost using the term dream Harvester


---------68:28----------
it's kind of like you know people are


---------68:30----------
sacrificing a lot for their dreams and


---------68:32----------
even when they get them it might not be


---------68:34----------
what's good for them so I want to kind


---------68:37----------
of make sure that mental health


---------68:38----------
especially in eSports is something


---------68:39----------
that's talked more about and that you


---------68:42----------
know so that when people do kind of run


---------68:44----------
into these sort of times in their lives


---------68:48----------
that they are either more well prepared


---------68:51----------
for it or at least have resources that


---------68:52----------
they can go to to try and self educate


---------68:56----------
um what is molding me mad plus balding


---------69:01----------
put together


---------69:03----------
someone is I think someone is trolling


---------69:05----------
you yes be modeling to be a good coat


---------69:10----------
yes it helps hi


---------69:15----------
it sounded like a troll kind of question


---------69:17----------
but I wasn't sure what it meant but it's


---------69:18----------
a good of an illegitimate question I'm


---------69:21----------
the knight sir it's a common slang it's


---------69:22----------
being thrown around - just like mess


---------69:25----------
with the balding streamers I think


---------69:28----------
yeah but I mean that's dick man that's


---------69:32----------
dick it's the Internet


---------69:35----------
yeah


---------69:37----------
um okay so so risker asks why do you


---------69:43----------
think that players burn out so quickly


---------69:45----------
in eSports compared to other stuff


---------69:54----------
but it's like there's a long which


---------69:56----------
there's a long list of reasons that I


---------69:58----------
could answer here but each did every


---------70:00----------
single one because you know everybody's


---------70:01----------
different everybody's gonna burn out for


---------70:03----------
a different reason


---------70:03----------
I think think that


---------70:09----------
I'm gonna go with a little bit of a


---------70:11----------
weird one one that I think is actually


---------70:14----------
really impactful but nobody is talking


---------70:15----------
about and I think it's the lack of role


---------70:18----------
models for the players in that the


---------70:21----------
players themselves are role models but a


---------70:22----------
lot of them don't have role models of


---------70:24----------
their own you know some players have


---------70:26----------
very supportive parents and that's good


---------70:28----------
but probably the majority of parents are


---------70:31----------
not supportive or are not involved in


---------70:34----------
the eSports athletes you know career


---------70:36----------
choice especially when you're having


---------70:37----------
Korean players come over to America or


---------70:40----------
Europe you know not only are they


---------70:42----------
separated from their parents and also


---------70:44----------
but from their culture you have some


---------70:46----------
people who started playing video games


---------70:47----------
because they had a rocky relationship


---------70:49----------
with their parents so you're having this


---------70:51----------
situation where these people are the


---------70:53----------
best in the world and they're being


---------70:55----------
looked up to by kind of the next


---------70:56----------
generation they're expected to kind of


---------70:58----------
be perfect be a good example but


---------71:00----------
nobody's taught them how to do those


---------71:01----------
things and that pressure can really get


---------71:04----------
to people so I think I think it's going


---------71:05----------
to be the lack of role models that the


---------71:08----------
current professional players have that


---------71:13----------
is a fantastic answer


---------71:15----------
that's brilliant what are some of the


---------71:17----------
other things that kind of come to your


---------71:19----------
mom


---------71:20----------
some people just want to play games and


---------71:23----------
get paid for them they don't actually


---------71:25----------
want to be the best so when they get to


---------71:28----------
the league they stop trying and then


---------71:30----------
another one is that people's motivations


---------71:32----------
to be the best is to be better than


---------71:34----------
other people rather than be better than


---------71:35----------
themselves and both of those are also


---------71:37----------
pretty catastrophic once you make it to


---------71:39----------
the league yeah so


---------71:46----------
so that a couple of things so one is


---------71:49----------
just want to pay and play and get paid I


---------71:52----------
think that's something that I don't


---------71:55----------
a really interesting observation as far


---------71:58----------
as people wanting to be better than


---------72:01----------
others and not better than themselves


---------72:03----------
that's actually something that I think


---------72:05----------
once again there's a lot of psychology


---------72:07----------
neuroscience and actual interventions


---------72:09----------
that you can do to fix so right now I'm


---------72:12----------
trying to develop two years ago I


---------72:14----------
developed sort of an evidence-based or


---------72:18----------
scientifically based meditation regimen


---------72:20----------
for addiction so we have like we know


---------72:23----------
from like different kinds of fMRI


---------72:25----------
studies and things like that that


---------72:26----------
there's some deficiencies or


---------72:28----------
vulnerabilities in the brain of people


---------72:30----------
who have addictions and we also know


---------72:32----------
that meditation affects the brain in


---------72:33----------
different ways so can we sort of look at


---------72:35----------
what we understand about the brain and


---------72:37----------
develop a meditation regimen that


---------72:39----------
specifically targets the weaknesses for


---------72:42----------
people who have addiction and the answer


---------72:44----------
is yes and now actually what I'm working


---------72:46----------
on because I think this is actually way


---------72:47----------
more fascinating is a regimen to target


---------72:50----------
narcissist in ego


---------72:53----------
and my experience has been that like


---------72:56----------
when you target narcissism and ego it


---------72:58----------
cultivates so it gets rid of that sort


---------73:01----------
of my value or my sense of self is based


---------73:05----------
on a relationship to others the second


---------73:08----------
thing it gets rid of or the second thing


---------73:09----------
it does is it starts to cultivate


---------73:10----------
empathy because if you think about like


---------73:13----------
your an identity that's based on a


---------73:15----------
relationship to others it's all like


---------73:17----------
very egocentric and so you don't the


---------73:20----------
only reason that you think about other


---------73:22----------
people is not to like think about what


---------73:24----------
their experience is like their value in


---------73:27----------
your life is to use as a measuring stick


---------73:29----------
for yourself you don't really think


---------73:31----------
about them as human beings you just


---------73:33----------
think about them as like objects to beat


---------73:35----------
they become milestones instead of people


---------73:38----------
and and I think it's really fascinating


---------73:40----------
because this this is also very prevalent


---------73:42----------
and investment-banking


---------73:44----------
because everyone is sort of like you


---------73:45----------
have bonuses right so people get


---------73:47----------
salaries which is like 50% and then


---------73:49----------
people get bonuses of like you know


---------73:51----------
anywhere between a hundred and like a


---------73:53----------
million dollars a year and when you when


---------73:56----------
you're sort of fake figuring out how


---------73:57----------
much you're value do you compare your


---------73:59----------
bonus to other people


---------74:01----------
and as long as you're kind of doing that


---------74:03----------
that can be very hard on your ego it can


---------74:05----------
be very like fueling for your ego and it


---------74:07----------
can cause a lot of suffering I think


---------74:09----------
that's huge in terms of you know don't


---------74:12----------
try to be better than anyone else


---------74:13----------
because that's sort of like an


---------74:14----------
egotistical kind of thing and like there


---------74:16----------
are ways to dissolve that ego which I


---------74:17----------
think at the same time is going to


---------74:19----------
improve empathy it's a fascinating any


---------74:22----------
other thoughts so you mentioned lack of


---------74:24----------
rome role models some people just want


---------74:25----------
to play and they want to get paid and


---------74:27----------
then people who want to be better than


---------74:29----------
others as opposed to better than


---------74:30----------
themselves those are probably the main


---------74:35----------
three that yeah yeah you know there's


---------74:38----------
obviously like not caring about your


---------74:40----------
physical health or thinking that


---------74:41----------
physical health has no bearing on a game


---------74:45----------
performance like I don't know why that


---------74:47----------
myth still exists yeah it's a very


---------74:49----------
common it's like you know if you sleep


---------74:51----------
and drink water and work out you're


---------74:55----------
gonna play better


---------74:55----------
and people are like no I just need to


---------74:57----------
play yeah you know you know why they


---------74:59----------
think that Jane because they've never


---------75:02----------
cared about their physical health and


---------75:04----------
look how far they got yeah no kidding


---------75:06----------
right right so I once heard a great


---------75:10----------
there's a great kind of quote about the


---------75:12----------
NBA so I think the hardest moment in a


---------75:17----------
coach's life is when you go into a


---------75:19----------
championship game at halftime or maybe


---------75:22----------
this is the NFL you go into the champion


---------75:23----------
you go to the Super Bowl at halftime and


---------75:25----------
tell your team that the strategy is you


---------75:28----------
so you're down at halftime in the Super


---------75:30----------
Bowl the hardest speech a coach has ever


---------75:32----------
had to give is going into the the locker


---------75:34----------
room at halftime of the Super Bowl when


---------75:36----------
you're down and telling your team the


---------75:38----------
strategy that got you to this point is


---------75:40----------
not working


---------75:44----------
I feel like why don't they prioritize


---------75:46----------
his physical health because I haven't


---------75:48----------
had to yeah subsisting off of Doritos


---------75:52----------
Pizza and Mountain Dew has gotten them


---------75:53----------
this far


---------75:56----------
why would they change


---------75:58----------
um so I guess so a question to Jane so


---------76:03----------
cannabis asks you talked about people


---------76:05----------
being inefficient learners how would you


---------76:07----------
suggest people learn people approach


---------76:09----------
learning over watch


---------76:19----------
run towards the fear is the phrase that


---------76:22----------
I really like in that there's a lot of


---------76:26----------
pros who actually don't know how some of


---------76:28----------
the characters in the game work and I


---------76:29----------
don't understand how that's acceptable


---------76:32----------
or even becomes a thing but what running


---------76:36----------
towards the fear means is that if


---------76:39----------
something annoys you or frustrates you


---------76:41----------
or you think it's overpowered or or


---------76:44----------
underpowered for example learning the


---------76:46----------
extremes or the things that kind of


---------76:47----------
stick out to you like it's no zenyatta


---------76:50----------
players for example people who one trick


---------76:53----------
heroes like Zenyatta for example they


---------76:55----------
become very susceptible to being killed


---------76:57----------
by flankers for example and they as any


---------76:59----------
other player is always going to think


---------77:01----------
that Genji and tracer and Sombra are


---------77:04----------
overpowered pieces of [ __ ] but what you


---------77:08----------
should do is if you're are playing that


---------77:10----------
hero and you're you know you hate that


---------77:12----------
thing you fear that thing it just didn't


---------77:14----------
always you with frustrates you just play


---------77:17----------
those heroes and try and assassinate


---------77:19----------
Zen's and you'll learn from the other


---------77:21----------
perspective what it looks like it


---------77:23----------
becomes it gains you the ability to


---------77:25----------
empathize with your opponent and empathy


---------77:28----------
doesn't have to be a good thing but


---------77:29----------
there's also the way that people


---------77:31----------
approach a game psychologically in terms


---------77:32----------
of winning competitive battles


---------77:34----------
one-on-one 66's because they always try


---------77:36----------
to force always try to force something


---------77:38----------
to happen and they never try and coax


---------77:40----------
then ever trying to coax the opponent


---------77:42----------
into doing something that they want to


---------77:44----------
in the absence of force and in order to


---------77:46----------
properly coax an opponent you need to be


---------77:49----------
able to empathize with them


---------77:51----------
that's that's awesome Joe um that is a


---------77:54----------
another principle which I haven't talked


---------77:56----------
about yet but I work with a lot which is


---------77:58----------
the difference between creation and


---------78:00----------
cultivation so I think our our society


---------78:04----------
has has gotten to the point where we


---------78:06----------
always try to create something and we've


---------78:08----------
forgotten the value of cultivate


---------78:11----------
and a lot of the change that I advocate


---------78:13----------
or is not is not for people to create


---------78:15----------
change in their life but to cultivate


---------78:17----------
change and I think what you just said


---------78:20----------
about forcing versus coaxing is to


---------78:22----------
understand that like some of the best


---------78:24----------
ways to do things in life are not to


---------78:26----------
actually like zero in and shoot for it


---------78:29----------
gung-ho which is sort of what our


---------78:30----------
society kind of propagates but to like


---------78:33----------
let things grow


---------78:37----------
anyway I think we're at time for today


---------78:41----------
so thanks for coming on Jane and


---------78:45----------
you know any any closing thoughts that


---------78:47----------
you have no I just I hope everyone


---------78:50----------
enjoyed it and yeah I mean I think it


---------78:53----------
was awesome I think people are loving it


---------78:54----------
everybody saying you is that your next


---------78:56----------
level wise and a smart guy I appreciate


---------79:00----------
that but if I was the you know also also


---------79:04----------
you got us a hundred gift subs from Lodi


---------79:07----------
p.m. so that was I mean I've never seen


---------79:09----------
that I literally thought someone was


---------79:11----------
getting hacked that's funny but no like


---------79:14----------
one of the one of the most important


---------79:17----------
things that I would encourage anyone to


---------79:19----------
do is think about how you're thinking


---------79:21----------
and learn how to learn that's the number


---------79:24----------
one piece of advice I'd give anyone who


---------79:25----------
wants to improve it something or become


---------79:27----------
a master of any task


---------79:30----------
completely agree man so thank you so


---------79:31----------
much for coming on you know good luck


---------79:33----------
with everything you're doing with Team


---------79:35----------
Canada and Dallas fuel and then you know


---------79:38----------
if there's any way that that we can


---------79:40----------
support you in terms of any of this


---------79:42----------
stuff I know we talked a little bit


---------79:44----------
about like eSports stuff but if you guys


---------79:47----------
want to like learn meditation I just let


---------79:49----------
me know and then the last thing is you


---------79:51----------
know when when you are ready to reveal


---------79:52----------
things in terms of your secret projects


---------79:55----------
if there's any way any way that we can


---------79:57----------
support you or help spread the word or


---------79:59----------
think like that um you know I started


---------80:01----------
streaming on Twitch about a month ago


---------80:02----------
but things are growing slowly and


---------80:05----------
steadily and so if there's any way that


---------80:07----------
we can help you because I I mean I agree


---------80:09----------
a hundred percent with your missions I


---------80:10----------
think that that's I mean what I loved


---------80:13----------
about going to India and studying to


---------80:14----------
become a monk is that like Yoga is the


---------80:17----------
system that teaches you how your mind


---------80:19----------
works like it teaches you like where new


---------80:22----------
desires come from why do thoughts happen


---------80:24----------
where how do behaviors function like how


---------80:27----------
does all this stuff inside you work it's


---------80:29----------
like a formal class on the self and so


---------80:32----------
of anything to support that mission of


---------80:34----------
helping people like learn how they think


---------80:36----------
and to think how about their thinking


---------80:41----------
and to learn about how they learn is


---------80:42----------
something that I'm 100% in favor


---------80:46----------
but thanks a lot man thanks for having


---------80:48----------
me on enjoy the rest year stream take


---------80:50----------
care good luck right now


---------80:54----------
