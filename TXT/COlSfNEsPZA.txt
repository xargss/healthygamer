up on september 4th so really excited we


---------00:10----------
have we've had eight coaches that we

started training back in november that


---------00:13----------
started working


---------00:14----------
in like april the coaches don't focus on


---------00:18----------
treating like depression or anxiety or


---------00:19----------
anything like that it's more about like


---------00:20----------
helping you find motivation


---------00:22----------
helping you get unstuck helping you find


---------00:24----------
purpose in life


---------00:25----------
um sort of overcoming unhealthy habits


---------00:28----------
to like get


---------00:29----------
unstuck so a lot of times that involves


---------00:30----------
video games uh but other things as well


---------00:33----------
and so the results seem to be like


---------00:35----------
pretty good and i'll share those in a


---------00:36----------
second


---------00:37----------
um and so since it seems to be working


---------00:39----------

---------00:44----------
coaches that'll go live on september 4th


---------00:49----------

---------01:01----------

---------01:05----------
and thanks for coming on um yeah thanks


---------01:08----------
for having me i don't know uh


---------01:10----------
i'm pretty anxious right now especially


---------01:12----------
the weight like to get on the show so i


---------01:14----------
think i'll i think i'll do better once


---------01:15----------
we kind of settle into things


---------01:17----------
yeah what are you anxious about just


---------01:19----------
like


---------01:22----------
i don't know i lost i lost some i lost a


---------01:24----------
lot of sleep last night which is


---------01:25----------
probably


---------01:26----------
i mean no that's not good yeah whenever


---------01:29----------
i have like


---------01:30----------
this is this i'm awake earlier than i


---------01:32----------
expected to be


---------01:34----------
so i had like three separate dreams


---------01:36----------
about being late to this interview


---------01:38----------
well i'm the one who's late i was like


---------01:41----------
yeah well


---------01:42----------
that kind of makes me feel a little


---------01:43----------
better so it's all right it's all right


---------01:45----------
cool yeah i just have an incredible


---------01:47----------
amount of scrutiny on me


---------01:49----------
that's like it's really stressful you


---------01:51----------
know yeah i've kind of become this meme


---------01:54----------
uh and they're i've been harassed for


---------01:57----------
like three months


---------01:58----------
straight now like every day i get


---------02:00----------
harassed about


---------02:01----------
about the the things like


---------02:05----------
that happened three months ago you know


---------02:06----------
it was just like all the clips that were


---------02:08----------
taken there were like from


---------02:11----------
from uh from like two days uh and


---------02:14----------
people haven't really heard anything


---------02:15----------
from me since and i'm still getting


---------02:17----------
harassed for it so i'm like that sounds


---------02:19----------
hard yeah it's it's it's hard i don't


---------02:22----------
think anyone could act could be prepared


---------02:24----------
for it


---------02:25----------
yeah i mean it sounds really awful to be


---------02:27----------
continuously harassed for


---------02:30----------
i don't even know what they would harass


---------02:32----------
you for


---------02:34----------
like uh like my identity


---------02:37----------
like they they want me to be fired they


---------02:40----------
are


---------02:41----------
upset at me being trans um they


---------02:44----------
think i identify as a deer i i don't i'm


---------02:47----------
a human


---------02:48----------
i identify as a furry but um


---------02:51----------
that was one of the things like like


---------02:53----------
generally generally how i see


---------02:55----------
i i don't i don't think i said anything


---------02:58----------
wrong


---------02:58----------
um and i'm willing to like challenge


---------03:00----------
that like i don't even


---------03:02----------
i mean i have some regrets about like my


---------03:03----------
phrasing for assumptions


---------03:05----------
but i think my head was in the right


---------03:08----------
place


---------03:08----------
um yeah for sure


---------03:12----------
yeah for sure can i just lay out a


---------03:15----------
little bit about like


---------03:16----------
what this is and kind of like what we


---------03:19----------
tried to do here


---------03:20----------
yeah sure um so i i think steph you know


---------03:23----------
i


---------03:23----------
we try to treat everyone basically the


---------03:25----------
same and and it's a chance for us to


---------03:28----------
hopefully actually benefit from what


---------03:30----------
your experience is your experiences


---------03:31----------
sound


---------03:32----------
it sounds actually really awful in terms


---------03:34----------
of being harassed and trying to


---------03:36----------
authentically represent yourself


---------03:38----------
and either i mean turning getting


---------03:40----------
yourself turned into a meme i think is


---------03:42----------
part of the job description you know so


---------03:44----------
i i don't know how much


---------03:46----------
we can really blame people for doing


---------03:47----------
that because that's what happens on


---------03:49----------
twitch


---------03:50----------
you know we're all meme farming and it's


---------03:52----------
it's our greatest source of sustenance


---------03:55----------
and at the same time it it does sound


---------03:56----------
like a lot of what happened


---------03:58----------
happens to you or what has happened to


---------03:59----------
you sounds really stressful


---------04:01----------
and i'm just hoping to understand um


---------04:04----------
yeah sure


---------04:05----------
and and so can you tell us a little bit


---------04:07----------
because i i saw like


---------04:08----------
like is part of you know i watched


---------04:11----------
like a very brief clip um but i'd love


---------04:14----------
to understand more about like what it


---------04:16----------
means to identify as a


---------04:18----------
furry what it means to uh you know like


---------04:21----------
i


---------04:21----------
like please educate us because that's


---------04:23----------
kind of this the stream is about


---------04:24----------
learning and sharing knowledge and like


---------04:26----------
growing as a community from it


---------04:28----------
um if you feel like you want to talk


---------04:30----------
about the stress and stuff like that if


---------04:32----------
there's some way that i can help you


---------04:33----------
with that i would love to


---------04:35----------
sometimes you know part of the aoe


---------04:37----------
healing of the stream comes from helping


---------04:39----------
an individual person with something that


---------04:40----------
they're dealing with


---------04:42----------
um yeah sure and so if there's something


---------04:44----------
in particular that you want to talk


---------04:46----------
about or some way that i can be of


---------04:47----------
service to you please let me know


---------04:49----------
i think i think it might be helpful for


---------04:51----------
me to talk a little bit about like the


---------04:52----------
timeline


---------04:53----------
of my harassment and what i've been i'd


---------04:55----------
really love that because i really don't


---------04:57----------
know


---------04:57----------
so okay so i got accepted i accepted


---------05:00----------
this position for the twitch trust and


---------05:02----------
safety


---------05:03----------
uh the safety advisory council okay


---------05:06----------
um and that position is i'm one of eight


---------05:10----------
people


---------05:10----------
four streamers and we are


---------05:14----------
uh we're supposed to talk to twitch we


---------05:17----------
have meetings with twitch


---------05:18----------
where we kind of discuss and uh what the


---------05:21----------
terms of service of twitch should be or


---------05:22----------
the community guidelines of twitch


---------05:24----------
should be and kind of


---------05:25----------
um put our perspective into the mix


---------05:29----------
in terms of trying to advise like twitch


---------05:31----------
on what what direction


---------05:32----------
they should go with those things um


---------05:35----------
we're kind of just like uh


---------05:37----------
we're like a think tank like we're uh


---------05:41----------
um i'm not like i'm not twitch staff


---------05:45----------
and i don't actually have any like


---------05:46----------
direct control over


---------05:48----------
what's going to happen all i can do is


---------05:50----------
put my voice in and be like here's what


---------05:52----------
i wish would happen


---------05:54----------
um part of my blurb


---------05:57----------
part of my blurb was like about about me


---------06:00----------
about you know the fact that i'm trans


---------06:03----------
and


---------06:04----------
about how i um


---------06:07----------
have an opinion that voice chat in video


---------06:10----------
games


---------06:11----------
is uh anti-inclusivity


---------06:14----------
that is a non-inclusive feature


---------06:18----------
um and and that's


---------06:20----------
that go ahead can you help me understand


---------06:23----------
that


---------06:24----------
that yeah so the idea is


---------06:27----------
that in a competitive game you either


---------06:31----------
if you let me let me let me collect my


---------06:34----------
thoughts a little sorry sure i'm like


---------06:36----------
stuttering a bit


---------06:37----------
and uh


---------06:41----------
if you're uncollected i have a really


---------06:42----------
good tweet


---------06:45----------
i'd love to hear you when you're


---------06:46----------
collected because i think you sound


---------06:48----------
great right now


---------06:49----------
oh thank you that's really sweet


---------06:51----------
seriously i'm not


---------06:52----------
i mean i don't think you've come across


---------06:54----------
as unclear at all


---------06:56----------
oh well you know i've been it's been a


---------06:59----------
long few months


---------07:00----------
so i'm trying to be very deliberate with


---------07:02----------
my voice and like


---------07:03----------
you know it's very much unrelaxed to me


---------07:07----------
i guess you could say


---------07:09----------
um where is that sounds like you give a


---------07:12----------
lot of attention and scrutiny to your


---------07:14----------
thoughts and how they translate


---------07:16----------
into words and i i mean it hasn't really


---------07:20----------
been


---------07:21----------
that way like that's


---------07:25----------
that's that's the consequence of like


---------07:26----------
i'm like running these simulations of


---------07:28----------
how are people going to


---------07:30----------
spin my words and how are people like


---------07:32----------
how like


---------07:33----------
and that and that's what they're looking


---------07:35----------
for too you know like people i feel like


---------07:37----------
people are looking to


---------07:38----------
cause you know if they can frame me in


---------07:41----------
an inflammatory way they


---------07:43----------
benefit with clicks um


---------07:47----------
and that's like really that's really


---------07:48----------
scary and that's the game that's being


---------07:49----------
played like i haven't


---------07:51----------
i think my voice has been twisted so


---------07:53----------
much to things


---------07:54----------
that like because people


---------07:58----------
are looking for ways to make me sound


---------07:59----------
bad yeah that's frustrating


---------08:02----------
so steph uh you know honestly what that


---------08:04----------
sounds like to me is actually kind of


---------08:06----------
traumatic


---------08:07----------
so like when when human beings you know


---------08:10----------
choose their words really carefully


---------08:12----------
it's a sign that your mind recognizes


---------08:15----------
that you can be


---------08:16----------
punished for saying a particular thing


---------08:19----------
yep right and and so


---------08:23----------
it's interesting because like that kind


---------08:24----------
of scrutiny honestly reminds me of


---------08:26----------
people that i've worked with with trauma


---------08:28----------
where they're so careful about what they


---------08:29----------
say because if they say the wrong thing


---------08:32----------
or do the wrong thing they're gonna get


---------08:34----------
hurt


---------08:35----------
yeah i mean i i


---------08:38----------
i i hesitate to describe


---------08:41----------
what i felt as as traumatic because


---------08:44----------
even that can be used against me you


---------08:46----------
know because because all of a sudden


---------08:48----------
um if i if i complain i'm doing it for


---------08:51----------
you


---------08:52----------
oh thanks i appreciate you


---------08:55----------
[Laughter]


---------08:57----------
thanks dr k thanks um


---------09:00----------
okay so i couldn't find the thread i've


---------09:03----------
got a really good thread on it i'm sure


---------09:04----------
someone hopefully someone just give us


---------09:06----------
what you've got steph


---------09:07----------
that's all that i can do it okay yeah no


---------09:09----------
problem


---------09:10----------
um the idea is that voice chat using


---------09:13----------
voice chat is a competitive advantage


---------09:15----------
in competitive games you if you use your


---------09:17----------
voice


---------09:18----------
or you hear other people using their


---------09:20----------
voice that's like the that's like the


---------09:21----------
most


---------09:22----------
information data dense way to


---------09:24----------
communicate


---------09:26----------
you know tactical call-outs people love


---------09:28----------
it it's like super important


---------09:30----------
um the the problem arises when you're


---------09:33----------
playing is specifically in pickup groups


---------09:35----------
where you're with other random people


---------09:36----------
and you're trying to climb a competitive


---------09:38----------
ladder


---------09:39----------
if you speak they're they're you're


---------09:42----------
you're giving up your linguistic profile


---------09:44----------
which is like


---------09:45----------
it it carries so many identifiers about


---------09:48----------
your identity


---------09:49----------
your gender even if you have like a


---------09:52----------
speech impediment or a lisp or or a


---------09:54----------
stutter there's so many things


---------09:56----------
that can um


---------10:00----------
that can can open you to


---------10:02----------
disproportionate abuse and harassment


---------10:04----------
from from your peers um


---------10:07----------
or from you know from the other people


---------10:09----------
in the match and i think because of this


---------10:11----------
because we have so


---------10:13----------
there's so many social biases against uh


---------10:15----------
female gamers or


---------10:17----------
sounding voices i think


---------10:20----------
that's one of the main reasons why you


---------10:22----------
see more


---------10:23----------
men in competitive team games and


---------10:27----------
there's a greater diversity in


---------10:30----------
single-player


---------10:31----------
titles like like a woman won the


---------10:34----------
hearthstone finals


---------10:35----------
at blizzcon recently and


---------10:38----------
um but but you know it's harder to see


---------10:42----------
that diversity


---------10:43----------
in in other teams yeah


---------10:46----------
like in in team games okay


---------10:49----------
that's really interesting um


---------10:52----------
let me just make sure i understand you


---------10:54----------
so you're saying that like


---------10:57----------
voice communication basically exposes


---------11:00----------
parts of identity that are


---------11:03----------
disproportionately


---------11:05----------
reacted to in terms of like bias


---------11:09----------
and toxicity yep yep


---------11:12----------
and there's like it's not just toxicity


---------11:14----------
you know it


---------11:15----------
you also can have these like subtle


---------11:17----------
biases like your calls won't be listened


---------11:19----------
to as much and that's like a


---------11:20----------
lot harder to prove trump but just some


---------11:22----------
voices are less respected and


---------11:24----------
they've the person with that voice can't


---------11:26----------
really control that yeah so so


---------11:28----------
and then you're saying that as a result


---------11:30----------
since some people's voices are


---------11:32----------
more or less respected than others we


---------11:35----------
should


---------11:36----------
take voice chat completely off the table


---------11:40----------
false i don't believe that i mean that's


---------11:42----------
that's what people think i mean


---------11:44----------
yeah that's what i think yeah sure uh i


---------11:47----------
just think it's unfair


---------11:48----------
i think it's important that we raise


---------11:49----------
awareness that it's unfair like like


---------11:51----------
something that we should talk about it's


---------11:53----------
something that a lot of people deny


---------11:54----------
and i think this the strongest thing to


---------11:56----------
do is to


---------11:58----------
try to increase the data density


---------12:01----------
of uh other non-voice communications so


---------12:04----------
people


---------12:05----------
that feel like their voice puts them at


---------12:07----------
a disadvantage are


---------12:08----------
at less of a disadvantage because they


---------12:10----------
can use pings and prefabricated voice


---------12:12----------
lines


---------12:13----------
and i see you know so so what you're


---------12:16----------
saying so thanks for clarifying right


---------12:17----------
because at the beginning


---------12:18----------
you had said something about voice and


---------12:20----------
you know competitive


---------12:21----------
advantage so like you think voice chat


---------12:24----------
should stay in the game


---------12:25----------
it's just we should be careful because


---------12:28----------
since there is a bias within the voice


---------12:30----------
chat we can start to think about


---------12:32----------
other more resilient


---------12:36----------
communication methods that are less open


---------12:38----------
to bias


---------12:40----------
correct thanks for clarifying


---------12:43----------
because yeah sure i mean that's


---------12:45----------
something that's a little difficult


---------12:46----------
because like i say that it's unfair


---------12:48----------
and people i think people jump to she


---------12:50----------
wants it gone


---------12:52----------
um but you know life is unfair there's a


---------12:53----------
lot of unfair things in life


---------12:55----------
and the best we can do is try to make


---------12:57----------
these uh systems more inclusive


---------12:59----------
uh instead of like you know taking them


---------13:02----------
away


---------13:03----------
yeah i mean i i think i tend to have a


---------13:05----------
different sort of


---------13:06----------
flavor there um i'm not


---------13:09----------
necessarily disagreeing with anything


---------13:11----------
you're saying i just think that if like


---------13:12----------
the problem is toxicity like


---------13:14----------
that's what you have to deal with right


---------13:16----------
like everything else to me feels


---------13:18----------
honestly a little bit like a band-aid


---------13:20----------
and and begs the question like why do


---------13:22----------
women in games get treated differently


---------13:24----------
and like what's going on there


---------13:26----------
and if we can figure that out and target


---------13:28----------
like the toxicity at its roots


---------13:30----------
then that's sort of that that tends to


---------13:32----------
be what i tend to focus on


---------13:35----------
which is yeah i'm not saying it's right


---------13:36----------
or wrong it's just as a


---------13:38----------
individual clinician like i work with


---------13:40----------
individuals


---------13:41----------
and i tend to think about the individual


---------13:43----------
level so how can we change someone being


---------13:45----------
toxic


---------13:46----------
like how can we change one person's


---------13:48----------
toxicity in a game


---------13:49----------
and then i think because i think like


---------13:50----------
you said voice comms are awesome


---------13:53----------
and i i felt like i kind of disagree


---------13:54----------
with you a little bit if we were talking


---------13:56----------
about


---------13:56----------
handing voice comms just because they


---------13:58----------
are more open to bias


---------14:01----------
but your nuanced view i think makes a


---------14:02----------
lot of sense


---------14:05----------
thank you um it's interesting i wish


---------14:09----------
yeah i i think i think it would move


---------14:11----------
society and like gamer culture in


---------14:12----------
general if more women


---------14:14----------
were like winning competitive titles


---------14:18----------
yeah and so i kind of see that as like


---------14:20----------
the goal is if we can make these games


---------14:22----------
more inclusive


---------14:23----------
can i toss out a troll we're going to


---------14:25----------
see yeah sure


---------14:26----------
okay so like dates are all good but so


---------14:28----------
there's a troll inside me


---------14:30----------
okay and you have to please let me know


---------14:31----------
if you take this the wrong way but like


---------14:33----------
you know there's a troll inside me and i


---------14:35----------
don't actually believe this but that's


---------14:36----------
that sort of says like well if women


---------14:38----------
were better they would win more


---------14:39----------
right and i don't think that that's


---------14:41----------
actually fair but it's kind of


---------14:43----------
it's an interesting i just noticed that


---------14:45----------
reaction within myself and i was just so


---------14:47----------
surprised by that conditioning


---------14:48----------
what do you think yeah i mean i feel


---------14:52----------
i i hear that i've heard that troll a


---------14:54----------
lot yeah


---------14:55----------
and i don't think that troll is real i


---------14:57----------
don't think that like i don't think


---------14:58----------
that's the problem


---------14:59----------
i think i think the troll is real i


---------15:02----------
don't think that trolls analysis


---------15:04----------
the problem is real right that's what


---------15:06----------
i'm that's what i mean but the troll


---------15:07----------
even within myself i was really


---------15:09----------
surprised to have that reaction


---------15:11----------
because i'm such a understanding and


---------15:13----------
open-minded person but i have that troll


---------15:15----------
there's something inside me that's like


---------15:16----------
kicking and trying to feel people


---------15:19----------
and it's weird i mean it's a difficult


---------15:21----------
it's a difficult thing to be


---------15:22----------
in a competitive environment like you're


---------15:24----------
trying to play on a team


---------15:26----------
with four other guys and they see you as


---------15:28----------
a woman and


---------15:29----------
and you kind of feel like you have to be


---------15:32----------
better than your you have to you have to


---------15:35----------
prove yourself kind of above


---------15:37----------
and beyond your male counterparts for


---------15:40----------
the absolutely trying out for the team


---------15:42----------
and like because otherwise like if


---------15:44----------
you're not demonstratively better


---------15:46----------
then they aren't going to take the risk


---------15:48----------
with you because you're gonna


---------15:50----------
make some amount of the people on the


---------15:52----------
team a little bit more uncomfortable


---------15:54----------
just because you're different um


---------15:57----------
yeah it's and and that extra pressure


---------16:00----------
can


---------16:01----------
can break you too because you're trying


---------16:03----------
to be


---------16:04----------
at the top point zero one percent and


---------16:07----------
trying to trying to


---------16:08----------
be better than is possible is is


---------16:11----------
not going to help you get on the spot


---------16:13----------
yeah i've been


---------16:14----------
thinking a lot about uh women in pro


---------16:17----------
gaming


---------16:18----------
and also indian people in pro gaming


---------16:21----------
because there are a billion of us out


---------16:22----------
there and there's like there are no


---------16:24----------
very few indian programmers there are a


---------16:26----------
couple out there


---------16:27----------
but um actually maybe there are a fair


---------16:30----------
amount now that i think about it


---------16:31----------
may just be a bias on my end but i i you


---------16:34----------
know i would love steph i've been


---------16:35----------
thinking about this a lot i would love


---------16:37----------
to like take a a group of


---------16:39----------
promising female gamers and help them


---------16:41----------
like handle their stress


---------16:43----------
and like make it pro because if there's


---------16:46----------
if yeah if you're saying that there's


---------16:48----------
there are stresses that are additional


---------16:50----------
to like the regular stresses of going


---------16:52----------
pro


---------16:53----------
i wonder how we can sort of fix that so


---------16:55----------
that like we can have more women in pro


---------16:56----------
gaming because i


---------16:57----------
i don't see a biological reason why


---------17:00----------
women


---------17:00----------
like you know if the nfl it's a


---------17:02----------
different story or like yep


---------17:04----------
you know but in pro gaming i don't i


---------17:06----------
don't get it


---------17:07----------
but let's go back to the timeline um so


---------17:09----------
you were saying so yeah can you tell us


---------17:11----------
about the timeline sorry i went off on


---------17:13----------
the team


---------17:14----------
no thank you it was a good tangent um


---------17:17----------
so so that that that left a sour taste


---------17:20----------
in a lot of gamers mouths because that


---------17:22----------
was like the first that was like their


---------17:24----------
first taste of me is like steph's


---------17:26----------
this this this trans girl and she thinks


---------17:29----------
that


---------17:30----------
voice chat is bad and we need to ban it


---------17:32----------
um


---------17:34----------
and then um and then some really really


---------17:38----------
scary stuff started happening


---------17:40----------
uh i got the attention of a really


---------17:44----------
a really scary website uh that i don't i


---------17:46----------
don't wanna i don't wanna say their name


---------17:49----------
um but they uh


---------17:53----------
built a like portfolio on me


---------17:56----------
uh and they started working to doxx me


---------17:59----------
and


---------18:00----------
um threaten my life uh


---------18:03----------
[ __ ] yeah and they um


---------18:08----------
yeah and it was it was super scary i


---------18:10----------
just i all i could do was have


---------18:12----------
my i had some i had some my moderators


---------18:14----------
like watching the thread


---------18:15----------
um and just they just kept getting


---------18:17----------
closer to my address


---------18:19----------
and they were just kept like and what's


---------18:22----------
what's your understanding of why they


---------18:24----------
would do that what did you do to


---------18:26----------
evoke this is it just that you were on


---------18:28----------
the safety advisory council


---------18:30----------
or you made statements


---------18:33----------
they are a transphobic and


---------18:36----------
uh white supremacist website they are


---------18:40----------
anti they are they're like


---------18:43----------
radically right aligned from what i can


---------18:45----------
gather and they are


---------18:46----------
i am i am their enemy by identity alone


---------18:52----------
and so they were


---------18:55----------
uh so um


---------18:58----------
[Music]


---------19:00----------
and that was just one those is one


---------19:01----------
website i saw


---------19:03----------
i know of later or maybe around the same


---------19:06----------
time


---------19:07----------
um some of the chan boards


---------19:10----------
were were getting were were starting to


---------19:13----------
like


---------19:13----------
take note of me and um organized


---------19:16----------
harassment against me


---------19:17----------
so what does that mean i like harassment


---------19:21----------
like threads were made on these off-site


---------19:24----------
websites


---------19:25----------
with the purpose of um trying to find


---------19:29----------
and like like gather


---------19:32----------
gather hatred against me and like send


---------19:33----------
people my way or like


---------19:35----------
you know how does that feel go ahead uh


---------19:38----------
it's


---------19:41----------
um you know i've been streaming for like


---------19:44----------
four and a half years i've been out and


---------19:46----------
proudly trans for the whole time


---------19:49----------
i've faced a lot of harassment and it


---------19:54----------
this was a whole new level of like


---------19:58----------
like hundreds hundreds of people coming


---------20:00----------
in harassing me


---------20:01----------
my stream was usually like a hundred and


---------20:03----------
now i was getting


---------20:05----------
like like several thousand viewers


---------20:09----------
and i could not tell how many of them


---------20:13----------
were just there to harass me but a


---------20:15----------
significant portion were there just just


---------20:17----------
to hurt me


---------20:17----------
um and i think and it's


---------20:21----------
it


---------20:25----------
it's a complicated feeling um


---------20:30----------
i want i really want to make a safe safe


---------20:34----------
place on the internet like i


---------20:35----------
i've i


---------20:41----------
care a lot about the direction of the


---------20:43----------
internet is going and i


---------20:44----------
and and i really want a space where


---------20:47----------
people


---------20:48----------
can become better people and all this


---------20:50----------
harassment has made me question whether


---------20:52----------
or not


---------20:53----------
i'm capable of


---------20:56----------
having and maintaining a space like that


---------21:02----------
and and


---------21:06----------
that's that's been really hard it just


---------21:09----------
it hurts it hurts a lot


---------21:11----------
what hurts about it


---------21:20----------
like like i've been forced


---------21:24----------
to change my behavior and i've


---------21:27----------
compromised on like


---------21:30----------
my what what i value my space for has


---------21:34----------
been


---------21:35----------
like compromised against my control


---------21:38----------
like my voice has been taken from me and


---------21:41----------
[Music]


---------21:42----------
by your voice has been taken from you


---------21:44----------
you mean that when you speak out


---------21:46----------
you were met with a certain kind of


---------21:51----------
response


---------21:54----------
yeah that like well i've kind of i've i


---------21:58----------
well if i if i feel myself becoming more


---------22:00----------
defensive


---------22:01----------
and like even just kind of interacting


---------22:03----------
with with trolls


---------22:05----------
that in a way feels like my voice has


---------22:07----------
been taken from me because like my


---------22:08----------
content


---------22:09----------
my my chat interaction has been taken


---------22:11----------
from me


---------22:12----------
because i have to i have to be something


---------22:15----------
different i have to react


---------22:16----------
to this and i have to be in the mind of


---------22:19----------
these of these trolls i have to like


---------22:21----------
try to understand where they're coming


---------22:23----------
from to to


---------22:25----------
try to understand them i can't just like


---------22:28----------
not read and assess uh


---------22:31----------
what what's been coming at me


---------22:37----------
can i think for a second sure


---------22:52----------
so i i have kind of a weird question and


---------22:54----------
and is it like


---------22:55----------
me please let me know steph if i ask


---------22:57----------
something that you find to be


---------22:59----------
offensive or challenging in some way i'm


---------23:00----------
gonna sort of challenge a particular


---------23:02----------
viewpoint that you've shared is that


---------23:03----------
okay yeah okay


---------23:06----------
so and this is just more for broader


---------23:09----------
education


---------23:09----------
so a couple of disclaimers here so i had


---------23:13----------
a patient once


---------23:14----------
who kept on saying that people were


---------23:16----------
doing


---------23:17----------
treating him a certain way because of


---------23:18----------
his money


---------23:20----------
and he's like oh this person is jealous


---------23:22----------
like they're treating me this way


---------23:23----------
because i have so much more money than


---------23:24----------
they do


---------23:25----------
it's like possible right


---------23:28----------
certainly possible and then at some


---------23:31----------
point like i started wondering like is


---------23:32----------
this actually like are you being treated


---------23:34----------
the way that you're treated because of


---------23:36----------
your money are you being treated the way


---------23:37----------
that you're treated because of your


---------23:38----------
options


---------23:40----------
so like part of it is like sometimes we


---------23:42----------
get judged for what we


---------23:43----------
represent and sometimes we get judged we


---------23:45----------
do


---------23:47----------
and it sounds to me like what you're


---------23:48----------
describing is really scary and i don't


---------23:50----------
think that that's a fair way of judgment


---------23:52----------
i mean if we're talking about people who


---------23:53----------
are like


---------23:54----------
like truly transphobic and or hating on


---------23:56----------
you and stuff like that because of what


---------23:58----------
you represent


---------23:59----------
then that's there are people out there


---------24:01----------
like that


---------24:02----------
what i'm curious about is that like i i


---------24:04----------
think a lot of people in our community


---------24:06----------
feel like they are judged because of


---------24:08----------
some attribute


---------24:10----------
of theirs right like i get um like let's


---------24:12----------
think about the insult community for


---------24:14----------
example they say like oh i am judged


---------24:16----------
because of this like particular


---------24:18----------
thing that is outside of my control


---------24:20----------
about who i am


---------24:21----------
i am a beta i am a simple therefore


---------24:24----------
dot dot dot and what i'm curious about


---------24:27----------
is like


---------24:29----------
i'm not saying that these people aren't


---------24:30----------
transphobic or that they're not hateful


---------24:32----------
toward you because of your your trans


---------24:33----------
nature but what i'm curious about is


---------24:35----------
how does someone know whether the


---------24:37----------
judgment that is face


---------24:39----------
placed upon them is a genuine question


---------24:41----------
okay


---------24:42----------
how do i know whether


---------24:46----------
someone is doing something because i'm


---------24:48----------
rich or they're treating me a particular


---------24:50----------
way because i'm an [ __ ]


---------24:53----------
how does an individual like know the


---------24:55----------
difference of


---------24:56----------
unfair judgment versus fair judgment


---------25:00----------
um


---------25:04----------
that's a really good question and


---------25:10----------
you have to i mean people have to reveal


---------25:14----------
themselves


---------25:15----------
through context and i think if you if


---------25:17----------
you


---------25:18----------
judge someone for like if i if i judge


---------25:22----------
someone for being transphobic


---------25:24----------
before they reveal that they're


---------25:26----------
transphobic


---------25:27----------
then i have judged them unfairly


---------25:31----------
sure um but


---------25:35----------
when several of my other harassers


---------25:38----------
or say a whole scary website yeah


---------25:42----------
that's you know like i know some amount


---------25:47----------
of my harassers are


---------25:50----------
are transphobic are attacking me for the


---------25:53----------
wrong reasons


---------25:55----------
um do you get attacked for the right


---------25:57----------
reasons


---------25:58----------
i don't


---------26:02----------
i don't think so okay i don't i don't


---------26:05----------
know what i


---------26:05----------
like


---------26:08----------
i think i think a lot of i think


---------26:12----------
i've been by some by some people i've


---------26:15----------
been framed in a way


---------26:16----------
that um


---------26:20----------
people hate me but if they got to know


---------26:23----------
me they wouldn't hate me


---------26:25----------
and i think there's some people that


---------26:27----------
hate me


---------26:28----------
and if they got to know me they would


---------26:30----------
still hate me


---------26:31----------
[Laughter]


---------26:36----------
so yeah uh


---------26:42----------
and that and that kind of gets to this


---------26:44----------
this so there's


---------26:45----------
this kind of if you don't mind it's kind


---------26:47----------
of a segue into timeline point number


---------26:49----------
two


---------26:50----------
which is one of my first my first


---------26:52----------
streams back


---------26:53----------
uh i was trying to play celeste and it


---------26:56----------
was a mess i've


---------26:58----------
what i did is i put my sub only mode on


---------27:01----------
for a while


---------27:02----------
i'm confused when you said first stream


---------27:04----------
back what what


---------27:05----------
can i lost you there oh like let's just


---------27:08----------
say the first stream since the trust and


---------27:11----------
safety council announcement it was


---------27:12----------
either the first or


---------27:13----------
oh so so it was just the announcement


---------27:15----------
that got people


---------27:16----------
like targeting you just that you were on


---------27:18----------
the trust and safety council


---------27:20----------
100 we're not even we're not even at any


---------27:23----------
of the clips


---------27:23----------
i've said i'm already i'm already


---------27:26----------
harassed how are you and how getting


---------27:28----------
chosen for the trust and safety council


---------27:31----------
do you know i'm not entirely sure i


---------27:34----------
think i


---------27:35----------
i yeah i don't


---------27:39----------
um there's a there's yeah i don't know


---------27:42----------
the process i was just approached


---------27:44----------
by um two lovely people okay i'm kind of


---------27:48----------
curious like can i toss that another


---------27:49----------
little caller's thought


---------27:51----------
and let me except if i overstepped in


---------27:52----------
any way do you feel like i'm being


---------27:53----------
disrespectful or


---------27:54----------
or anything it's not you've been fine


---------27:56----------
okay and i'll i'll do my best to let you


---------27:58----------
know if yeah


---------27:59----------
please let me know so i sometimes find


---------28:01----------
that like challenging


---------28:02----------
people's assumptions is something that


---------28:04----------
we do on stream and just so we can


---------28:05----------
clarify our understanding


---------28:08----------
but there's a part of you that says like


---------28:09----------
you know the trust and safety council if


---------28:10----------
we really want to understand like how to


---------28:12----------
manage twitch


---------28:13----------
and if we wanted to be representative


---------28:15----------
twitch there's got to be a flaming in


---------28:17----------
cell on there


---------28:20----------
right uh


---------28:23----------
yeah yeah i think that that probably


---------28:25----------
would have helped you know


---------28:26----------
i mean are you being happy i'm really


---------28:28----------
curious what do you think you know it


---------28:29----------
was


---------28:31----------
no i think that i would have helped with


---------28:32----------
my harassment i don't know if it would


---------28:34----------
have helped the


---------28:35----------
well i would have helped the council


---------28:37----------
more perspectives broader perspectives


---------28:38----------
the better


---------28:39----------
and like yeah i have some


---------28:42----------
weird well i don't know weird isn't


---------28:44----------
really the word i'm i'm willing to speak


---------28:46----------
my mind and have


---------28:47----------
have inflammatory perspectives like this


---------28:49----------
voice chat thing which is something i've


---------28:51----------
stood up for i know i think that's part


---------28:52----------
of why i was


---------28:54----------
selected for this council is because i


---------28:57----------
will


---------28:58----------
speak my perspective and like that's


---------28:59----------
awesome even i


---------29:01----------
i feel like i'm guided by my own moral


---------29:03----------
compass


---------29:04----------
um that that


---------29:08----------
i think it's awesome that you speak so


---------29:10----------
thank you


---------29:11----------
yeah thank you anyway so sorry for


---------29:13----------
derailing you again so it sounds like


---------29:15----------
trusting the safety council happened


---------29:18----------
uh you know the internet started going


---------29:22----------
am i doing that right yeah yeah and if i


---------29:24----------
can be just a little bit salty


---------29:26----------
yeah yeah go for it all


---------29:29----------
this this the announcement came


---------29:32----------
before our first meeting um


---------29:36----------
which i think is just it's frustrating


---------29:39----------
because i feel like


---------29:41----------
i feel like i i feel like it would have


---------29:42----------
been more impactful if


---------29:44----------
the council had met a few times if we


---------29:46----------
had accomplished something if we could


---------29:47----------
bring something to the table


---------29:49----------
but instead i think twitch was really


---------29:50----------
excited to feel like here's a new


---------29:52----------
initiative


---------29:53----------
um and it's just part of my personal


---------29:56----------
philosophy


---------29:57----------
and i think a lot of other people's


---------29:58----------
philosophies too that like


---------30:00----------
when you talk about something you're


---------30:02----------
going to do or something you're working


---------30:04----------
on or planning like i think it


---------30:06----------
you're less likely to follow through on


---------30:08----------
it because you're kind of cashing in on


---------30:09----------
the idea before it like reaches fruition


---------30:13----------
yeah i'm with you 100 we literally talk


---------30:16----------
i i mentioned that


---------30:17----------
concept on stream actually last week and


---------30:20----------
and you know in in the hindu and


---------30:22----------
buddhist traditions there's this


---------30:24----------
practice called


---------30:25----------
mantra or mantra and it's like you chant


---------30:28----------
something


---------30:29----------
and but you keep it secret and one of


---------30:31----------
the key things about mantra practice is


---------30:33----------
if you disclose your mantra to other


---------30:34----------
people it diminishes its power


---------30:37----------
and that that's sure airing things


---------30:39----------
actually diminishes


---------30:41----------
their power which is useful in the case


---------30:43----------
of trauma


---------30:44----------
because you're airing things that are


---------30:45----------
eating you up inside and it diminishes


---------30:48----------
their power to eat you up but if you


---------30:50----------
have something good and you air it out


---------30:52----------
then it diminishes its power and you're


---------30:54----------
just kind of bragging and you're all


---------30:56----------
talk


---------30:56----------
and no walk there's something definitely


---------30:59----------
there


---------31:00----------
okay so so you were salty because this


---------31:02----------
is kind of a sign


---------31:03----------
yeah okay so then yeah so we went back


---------31:07----------
to streaming


---------31:08----------
it went back to streaming we went back


---------31:10----------
to streaming and i'm trying to talk to


---------31:12----------
my chat


---------31:13----------
and uh


---------31:16----------
um i i mean i say a lot of things in


---------31:19----------
that stream


---------31:20----------
and i i mean that of course


---------31:23----------
well i'm just like i'm interacting with


---------31:25----------
my with my viewers i'm engaging


---------31:27----------
with my trolls i'm i'm saying that like


---------31:30----------
the volume of words okay


---------31:33----------
the volume of words i am producing is is


---------31:36----------
great


---------31:37----------
okay um which is kind of maybe the first


---------31:40----------
problem is that like


---------31:42----------
now people have their like pick of what


---------31:44----------
they can clip out of context


---------31:47----------
for me um and then the


---------31:50----------
the first thing that really goes viral


---------31:52----------
is i say


---------31:54----------
you know i think a lot of you gamers are


---------31:57----------
white supremacists


---------31:58----------
and i think i think most people saw that


---------32:01----------
clip


---------32:02----------
um and uh


---------32:06----------
that that was that was in response


---------32:10----------
to to the previous i mean the stresses


---------32:13----------
i've talked about


---------32:14----------
and to you know comments of of people


---------32:19----------
um you know


---------32:22----------
arguing for ethnostates in my chat like


---------32:24----------
it was like i was actually


---------32:27----------
reading uh nazi ideology in in my chat


---------32:30----------
room at the time


---------32:31----------
um what's that but


---------32:35----------
it's it's like it's like absurd


---------32:38----------
it's like and i think that's that's


---------32:40----------
where a lot of this like


---------32:42----------
there's like it's weird because it's so


---------32:44----------
inflammatory


---------32:46----------
it's so terrible and


---------32:50----------
a lot of people say that i stutter every


---------32:54----------
time i say a lot now by the way because


---------32:55----------
i like crutch


---------32:56----------
on the word a lot like i use it a lot


---------32:59----------
for me to mean like attention you know


---------33:04----------
um and uh


---------33:10----------
some people love to speak


---------33:14----------
they they use they use nazi symbolism


---------33:16----------
and speak nazi ideology


---------33:18----------
to get a reaction they like to they do


---------33:22----------
that to troll and i'm


---------33:23----------
i'm willing to i'm willing to think and


---------33:25----------
i want to think


---------33:27----------
that the majority of people um


---------33:30----------
that are using like say say nazi words


---------33:34----------
and use nazi


---------33:35----------
symbolism are doing it to troll and


---------33:38----------
don't really believe it


---------33:39----------
but i also know that some amount


---------33:44----------
are serious and


---------33:47----------
when you leave room for jokes you


---------33:52----------
leave room for people to be radicalized


---------33:55----------
and like actually get exposed


---------33:58----------
to these interests right ideas yeah


---------34:01----------
every joke and you know it kind of it's


---------34:05----------
kind of


---------34:05----------
it's like a weird spectrum and it kind


---------34:07----------
of percolates up to this idea


---------34:08----------
that i think the most mainstream kind of


---------34:12----------
uh uh ideology


---------34:16----------
how i don't know


---------34:19----------
words um this idea that some people


---------34:23----------
in society are like invalid of existing


---------34:25----------
in that society


---------34:27----------
and people um feel this


---------34:30----------
in different ways but like like there


---------34:32----------
are plenty of people that think


---------34:34----------
that disabled individuals should just


---------34:37----------
not exist like if you can't have a job


---------34:40----------
if you're poor if you're on welfare you


---------34:43----------
are


---------34:44----------
better off dead uh and and i think uh


---------34:48----------
way too many people believe this either


---------34:50----------
consciously or


---------34:51----------
subconsciously um and there's lots of


---------34:54----------
reasons why they do


---------34:56----------
and i think it's really it's really


---------34:57----------
scary and that's something that like


---------35:00----------
trans trans people face all the time i


---------35:03----------
mean one of the largest things i hear is


---------35:04----------
that i'm


---------35:05----------
mentally ill and therefore should kill


---------35:08----------
myself um


---------35:09----------
sorry i should have i feel like i should


---------35:11----------
have had a content warning before saying


---------35:12----------
that i forget there's like a chat and


---------35:14----------
everything here


---------35:15----------
um i'm confused


---------35:19----------
uh a casual reference of of suicide is


---------35:23----------
uh can be a bit much for people i guess


---------35:25----------
okay


---------35:26----------
and not i guess it is um


---------35:29----------
so uh but i mean i hear that a lot and


---------35:32----------
it's


---------35:32----------
it's


---------35:36----------
this so and anyway i guess i just went


---------35:39----------
on another tangent


---------35:42----------
um


---------35:45----------
i think they give us a lot of color


---------35:49----------
um i'm kind of i'm kind of curious you


---------35:51----------
know it's interesting because you say


---------35:52----------
like


---------35:53----------
some people talk about other people not


---------35:55----------
being allowed to exist i wonder


---------35:57----------
so it's i i've certainly seen that in


---------35:59----------
terms of hatred towards a particular


---------36:01----------
ethnicity


---------36:02----------
or gender identity or or sexuality or


---------36:05----------
whatever


---------36:05----------
i'm curious what do you think about


---------36:07----------
nazis should they be allowed to exist


---------36:14----------
um i think


---------36:18----------
there is a paradox of tolerance that


---------36:22----------
to be tolerant you need to be intolerant


---------36:26----------
of intolerance um


---------36:29----------
some real five-head stuff dude


---------36:33----------
yeah it's interesting so uh


---------36:36----------
yes i would say um but you know i think


---------36:40----------
i think we should judge each person um


---------36:43----------
kind of on their impact on others and if


---------36:47----------
if someone is


---------36:49----------
hurting many other people um i don't


---------36:52----------
think they should like not exist but i


---------36:54----------
think they should get help and they


---------36:55----------
should


---------36:56----------
be in a place where they aren't able to


---------36:58----------
hurt as many people or


---------37:01----------
you know de-platformed for example


---------37:05----------
they should be deep platform yes yeah


---------37:08----------
i'm with you


---------37:08----------
okay thanks for it was that an okay


---------37:10----------
question yeah


---------37:12----------
yeah i think it really helps me


---------37:14----------
understand kind of what your viewpoint


---------37:16----------
is


---------37:17----------
um okay so kind of going back to the


---------37:19----------
timeline so it sounds like you started


---------37:21----------
getting a lot of hate


---------37:22----------
then you made this statement that most


---------37:25----------
are you gamers or


---------37:26----------
oh you did it okay but see see


---------37:29----------
that's you you did the thing where


---------37:32----------
people think i said most gamers


---------37:33----------
are white supremacists or all gamers or


---------37:36----------
the majority of gamers


---------37:38----------
but the actual quote is i think a lot of


---------37:41----------
you


---------37:41----------
gamers yeah so so if you pay attention


---------37:44----------
to what i did i


---------37:45----------
tossed out two or three different


---------37:46----------
phrases because i wasn't sure exactly


---------37:48----------
what the quote was


---------37:50----------
uh-huh so i said you gamers or most


---------37:52----------
gamers or i was going to ask you


---------37:53----------
actually like what was the actual shirt


---------37:55----------
again


---------37:56----------
sorry to interrupt you but uh i mean


---------37:58----------
it's just that's like here all the time


---------38:00----------
i mean like


---------38:00----------
like when when i enter a new room or


---------38:03----------
something and people


---------38:04----------
um this this is an anecdote from vr chat


---------38:08----------
actually i'm on vr chat quite a bit


---------38:10----------
uh i had a uh you know people sometimes


---------38:13----------
figure out who i am


---------38:14----------
and they're like oh my gosh she's the


---------38:15----------
one she's the one that said all gamers


---------38:17----------
are white supremacists and i'm like


---------38:19----------
no i was i was just trying to call out


---------38:22----------
some of the people in my chat like i was


---------38:24----------
trying to


---------38:24----------
say how i saw it two people in in my


---------38:27----------
chat


---------38:28----------
and and uh but because i used the word


---------38:31----------
phrase a lot


---------38:33----------
uh i was i opened myself up to the


---------38:36----------
subjective


---------38:38----------
idea of what a lot means and that


---------38:41----------
that gave people the power to write


---------38:44----------
and create hate content that made it out


---------38:48----------
that i


---------38:48----------
that i thought most gamers or the


---------38:50----------
majority of gamers


---------38:52----------
then that like permeated this like


---------38:54----------
public consciousness that like i


---------38:56----------
had said most many or all


---------39:00----------
yeah and and just to be clear so i want


---------39:03----------
to point this out so


---------39:04----------
i i think that's just what happened


---------39:06----------
between you and i


---------39:08----------
right so like i said you said you gamers


---------39:10----------
or most gamers and maybe the vaude will


---------39:12----------
crucify me but i think


---------39:14----------
what i'm noticing is that you picked out


---------39:17----------
a particular thing that i said


---------39:19----------
and judged my statement based on that


---------39:22----------
piece of it which is normal


---------39:24----------
by the way does that make sense right


---------39:29----------
i was stumbling along trying to recall


---------39:32----------
what exactly your phrasing was right and


---------39:35----------
so i said something like i think in


---------39:37----------
the vaude show maybe it's a perception


---------39:39----------
of memory error on my part but i was i


---------39:41----------
remember


---------39:42----------
kind of thinking what i thought in the


---------39:43----------
moment was like i don't remember exactly


---------39:44----------
what the phrasing was like you or most


---------39:47----------
and the second i said most your mind


---------39:49----------
kind of picked up on it and then you


---------39:50----------
kind of jumped in and you said you see


---------39:52----------
you just did it


---------39:53----------
and to which i would say yeah absolutely


---------39:55----------
i may have done that


---------39:56----------
because i my perception could have been


---------39:58----------
incorrect i may have just


---------39:59----------
judged you based on an i may have made


---------40:03----------
a nuanced argument collapse into a


---------40:05----------
simple judgment


---------40:07----------
but at the same time i think that's


---------40:08----------
exactly what you did to me


---------40:11----------
because i was actually looking for the


---------40:13----------
right word and then what your mind


---------40:14----------
latches onto which is normal by the way


---------40:16----------
i'm not trying to blame you for it


---------40:18----------
i think it's just a really common


---------40:19----------
principle that we tend to do


---------40:21----------
which is part of the reason why the


---------40:22----------
internet is the way that it is is that


---------40:24----------
once we get burned by something we start


---------40:27----------
looking for it


---------40:28----------
which is like normal like so like it's


---------40:30----------
evolutionary that if i get bit by a


---------40:32----------
snake


---------40:33----------
i'm going to be paranoid about ropes


---------40:36----------
yeah and but yeah there's a there i


---------40:39----------
think there's a significant difference


---------40:41----------
between saying


---------40:41----------
there's a lot of white supremacists in


---------40:44----------
my chat which isn't i mean that isn't


---------40:46----------
the


---------40:47----------
direct quote but just just for for


---------40:49----------
example to say there's a lot you know


---------40:51----------
that can that can mean that can mean 10


---------40:54----------
like 10 is a lot


---------40:55----------
but when you when you change that


---------40:57----------
phrasing to


---------40:58----------
most most absolutely


---------41:01----------
more than 50 more than 50


---------41:05----------
and it also becomes something that's


---------41:07----------
larger than my chat itself


---------41:09----------
which is important for for like framing


---------41:12----------
how


---------41:13----------
how people have been attacking me what


---------41:15----------
do you mean by that


---------41:17----------
it means it's it's been it's it becomes


---------41:20----------
something that i'm not just referring to


---------41:21----------
my chat anymore


---------41:22----------
i'm referring to all gamers got it


---------41:26----------
um so yeah i i i'm sorry for jumping on


---------41:29----------
that


---------41:29----------
but it is no no i think it's good that


---------41:31----------
you did i think it's fine


---------41:33----------
i think it's normal to jump on it


---------41:35----------
because i've been trying to defend


---------41:36----------
myself


---------41:37----------
on this since the start it would be a


---------41:39----------
different thing if i misspoke


---------41:41----------
if i said most but i didn't and i think


---------41:43----------
that there's a huge difference


---------41:44----------
um and i think a big part of why people


---------41:47----------
have


---------41:48----------
been attacking me is because they


---------41:52----------
think on a personal level that i have


---------41:55----------
called them


---------41:56----------
a white supremacist unfairly


---------42:00----------
i see um and what is it like


---------42:03----------
to be


---------42:06----------
so misunderstood or being judged for


---------42:11----------
being judged in for something that you


---------42:13----------
didn't say


---------42:16----------
um it is exhausting in a word


---------42:19----------
it is i have to


---------42:22----------
i'm constantly trying to correct myself


---------42:25----------
and


---------42:26----------
um it feels like my voice has been taken


---------42:28----------
away


---------42:29----------
um if you've watched a youtube video


---------42:31----------
about me


---------42:32----------
uh any anyone in my chat i'm sorry i


---------42:34----------
said my chat this is a reflex your chat


---------42:38----------
i'm not stealing your chat okay


---------42:41----------
i like the way you said my trolls


---------42:43----------
earlier like it's like you have these


---------42:45----------
little


---------42:45----------
trolls hanging out in here


---------42:49----------
it's not my chat it's not your chat


---------42:51----------
stuff it's twitching right


---------42:54----------
yeah that's that's that's the truth if


---------42:57----------
any of y'all have seen a video


---------42:59----------
of me no no not a single one of those


---------43:03----------
youtube creators


---------43:04----------
asked for my opinion asked for my voice


---------43:09----------
or properly looked into context for me


---------43:12----------
none of them cared to hear


---------43:15----------
me um they wanted to make me look as bad


---------43:19----------
as possible


---------43:20----------
to generate clicks and revenue for


---------43:22----------
themselves


---------43:24----------
or they just were trying to


---------43:28----------
you know do the best job they could i


---------43:30----------
mean i guess that's


---------43:31----------
that's that's the most kind way i could


---------43:34----------
see it


---------43:35----------
um but even then i don't think they did


---------43:37----------
a very good job because they didn't


---------43:39----------
listen to me or hear me out


---------43:42----------
yeah so steph there's something that i'm


---------43:43----------
trying to like understand


---------43:45----------
which is like there's something oh god


---------43:47----------
this is gonna get so taken out of


---------43:48----------
context


---------43:49----------
there's something like incredibly juicy


---------43:51----------
and succulent about you as a target


---------43:55----------
like there's something about either what


---------43:58----------
you say or what you do or your


---------44:00----------
appearance or your identity i don't know


---------44:01----------
what it is


---------44:03----------
but there's something about you that


---------44:04----------
people like seem to really love to hate


---------44:07----------
what's your understanding of that


---------44:10----------
i think i am unashamed to be


---------44:13----------
authentically me


---------44:15----------
i am different i


---------44:20----------
um i mean


---------44:25----------
ah jeez if we move down the timeline you


---------44:27----------
might you might understand a little bit


---------44:28----------
yeah


---------44:28----------
so let's do that then maybe we can table


---------44:30----------
that question we'll get to our answer


---------44:33----------
sure um


---------44:37----------
sorry steph i keep on derailing you from


---------44:39----------
your timeline i really oh i


---------44:40----------
i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm here it's great this


---------44:44----------
is great we're like going through it


---------44:45----------
together


---------44:45----------
and i like that we're doing this in like


---------44:47----------
chronological order it's


---------44:49----------
it's nice um so


---------44:52----------
well the thing is i was


---------44:58----------
i was a little bit i guess provocative


---------45:00----------
is the word on my on my next stream


---------45:03----------
um because i was frustrated uh i was i


---------45:06----------
was frustrated that i was being taken


---------45:07----------
out of context


---------45:08----------
and that kind of thing um


---------45:12----------
and uh people were were spreading this


---------45:14----------
this misinformation


---------45:16----------
that i was i was a deer or i believed


---------45:18----------
that i was a deer


---------45:20----------
um uh i am i'm


---------45:23----------
i'm just a furry i think that it


---------45:26----------
it's uh


---------45:30----------
i am like


---------45:34----------
i'm trying to i'm trying to describe


---------45:36----------
that uh because furry can mean a lot of


---------45:38----------
things but i feel


---------45:39----------
i've in general i feel very welcome in


---------45:41----------
the furry community especially the furry


---------45:43----------
community in vr chat


---------45:45----------
i have an affinity for for gear i think


---------45:48----------
deer are really cute


---------45:49----------
and and pretty they make me go aw a lot


---------45:52----------
uh on some level i wish i had fur and a


---------45:56----------
tail


---------45:56----------
like like if i could choose my body if i


---------45:59----------
could be like


---------46:00----------
some kind of avatar uh you know i would


---------46:03----------
in a transhumanist kind of way like i


---------46:06----------
would love to make those modifications


---------46:08----------
what does that mean right i still don't


---------46:11----------
understand what a furry is and i


---------46:12----------
certainly don't know what transhumanist


---------46:14----------
means uh transhumanist is like


---------46:18----------
if you like it it can be a furry thing


---------46:23----------
but maybe it's more easily


---------46:24----------
understood as like kind of like a


---------46:26----------
cyberpunk


---------46:27----------
future kind of way would also be


---------46:29----------
transhumanist so the idea like i wish i


---------46:31----------
had a mechanical arm that did


---------46:34----------
all these things or if i if i had the


---------46:35----------
ability to have a mechanical arm


---------46:38----------
that had had special powers like deus ex


---------46:41----------
i would do it or um i have


---------46:44----------
i have a friend who uh


---------46:48----------
is so like becoming a feels like she's


---------46:51----------
in


---------46:52----------
yeah like becoming a cyborg you're like


---------46:54----------
is that a transhumanist


---------46:56----------
yeah okay so someone has like a


---------46:59----------
prosthetic leg does that make them


---------47:01----------
transhumanist


---------47:03----------
by by some by some definitions yeah i


---------47:05----------
would okay


---------47:06----------
so is someone who's transhumanist no


---------47:09----------
longer human


---------47:10----------
or what does that mean no


---------47:14----------
no they're like they're like upgrading


---------47:16----------
their their biological


---------47:18----------
they're still human but they're like


---------47:20----------
upgrading their form in some way


---------47:22----------
they're like yeah it's like it's like a


---------47:24----------
transformation into something better and


---------47:26----------
like an idealized transformation


---------47:28----------
which um you can see there's a there's a


---------47:31----------
lot of overlap


---------47:31----------
within the trans community and these


---------47:34----------
these other things you know we


---------47:36----------
i i i've transitioned i have


---------47:40----------
you know which is largely because i have


---------47:42----------
a preference for estrogen it works


---------47:43----------
better for my brain


---------47:45----------
um but it's like


---------47:48----------
changed my physical form and that kind


---------47:50----------
of thing and


---------47:52----------
um in a way that is


---------47:56----------
ah i really i don't i don't have i don't


---------48:00----------
have like super nuanced uh


---------48:02----------
answers to your questions but i hope you


---------48:04----------
know where i'm getting that with that


---------48:05----------
well yes okay can you tell me what it


---------48:07----------
means to be a furry


---------48:10----------
i think i don't want to represent the


---------48:12----------
entire furry community


---------48:13----------
i don't i don't want to like i


---------48:15----------
especially don't want to misrepresent


---------48:16----------
them


---------48:16----------
but i think to be a furry you would you


---------48:20----------
wish your body had


---------48:23----------
animal attributes um


---------48:26----------
hold on like ish


---------48:30----------
your body


---------48:33----------
head


---------48:36----------
okay keep going thanks for pausing uh


---------48:39----------
like


---------48:39----------
like fur or a tail and i think people


---------48:42----------
can have


---------48:43----------
like uh dysphoria about that too um


---------48:46----------
like you know feeling like they should


---------48:49----------
have a tail


---------48:49----------
or they are sad that they don't have one


---------48:53----------
etc uh there's also furry


---------48:56----------
furry feelings of like uh furries


---------48:59----------
in my experience are also and kind of


---------49:02----------
myself included are trying to be


---------49:04----------
kind of more uh in touch with


---------49:07----------
their natural animalistic side like kind


---------49:10----------
of i guess the


---------49:11----------
the inverse of being civilized like


---------49:12----------
whatever whatever you feel like


---------49:14----------
civility is you know do we really need


---------49:17----------
that


---------49:17----------
can we just make yeah primal primal


---------49:20----------
noises


---------49:21----------
primal primal expressions of emotion and


---------49:24----------
that kind of thing and trying to get in


---------49:25----------
touch with that is also


---------49:27----------
uh something that you see in the furry


---------49:30----------
community


---------49:31----------
okay um and the furry community is also


---------49:34----------
like uh


---------49:37----------
is is kind of like a safe space and and


---------49:41----------
in for for queer people and a lot of


---------49:42----------
queer people go to the queer community


---------49:44----------
in the queer community


---------49:46----------
like the queer community and the furry


---------49:48----------
community are very


---------49:49----------
very intermax in intermingled because


---------49:51----------
they're both


---------49:53----------
societally like outcast in in some


---------49:55----------
regards they're


---------49:56----------
allies the enemy of my enemy is my


---------49:58----------
friend


---------50:00----------
yeah yeah and what is it what does it


---------50:02----------
mean to be clear


---------50:05----------
uh queer is


---------50:09----------
um you know that's


---------50:14----------
i don't think i've ever been asked that


---------50:16----------
and and it should be an easy question


---------50:18----------
but it's uh it's it's a lot of things to


---------50:20----------
be queer to me is like


---------50:22----------
it's like the largest of the umbrella


---------50:23----------
terms like if trans is an umbrella


---------50:26----------
and and gay is an umbrella like queer is


---------50:28----------
the umbrella of umbrellas


---------50:30----------
so what is it an umbrella for uh


---------50:33----------
any sexual or


---------50:37----------
uh any sexuality or identity


---------50:40----------
or gender identity that is outside of


---------50:42----------
the norm


---------50:44----------
nor meaning heteronormative and cis


---------50:46----------
gendered hetero


---------50:47----------
yeah yeah right


---------50:50----------
okay so so


---------50:53----------
queer is anything that is not


---------50:56----------
heterosexual


---------50:57----------
or assistant straight yes cisgender


---------51:01----------
heterosexual correct thanks thanks for


---------51:03----------
clarifying some of these terms because


---------51:04----------
like yeah


---------51:05----------
my definition of queer comes from the


---------51:07----------
toxic internet


---------51:08----------
which is that it's something that you


---------51:09----------
call your teammates when they disappoint


---------51:11----------
you in video games when you make a


---------51:12----------
mistake


---------51:14----------
right right right that's not and yeah


---------51:17----------
i i personally i don't consider queer


---------51:19----------
slur i think it's


---------51:20----------
it's just a lovely large umbrella yeah


---------51:23----------
yeah


---------51:24----------
some people said what i'm saying is that


---------51:26----------
like the reason i'm asking for a


---------51:27----------
clarification is because


---------51:28----------
words get used a lot by people who


---------51:32----------
mean something entirely different like


---------51:35----------
when i feed in my lane and dota my


---------51:38----------
experience of the word queer is that's


---------51:39----------
when i get called


---------51:41----------
but that's not i don't think that's what


---------51:44----------
it's supposed to mean


---------51:46----------
and i actually really appreciate you


---------51:48----------
redefining what the norm is


---------51:50----------
because i think it's better for people


---------51:52----------
to say that you know


---------51:53----------
uh yeah so thank you yeah i'm with you


---------51:56----------
there


---------51:57----------
you're you're welcome i suppose it's the


---------51:59----------
right answer


---------52:01----------
um so so when when you kind of say like


---------52:03----------
when you identify as authority and i get


---------52:05----------
that you don't represent the entire


---------52:06----------
community because i think a big part of


---------52:07----------
what we do here is that


---------52:09----------
the assumption that we're talking to one


---------52:10----------
person right and and what we try to do


---------52:12----------
here is understand


---------52:14----------
what about this person or what about


---------52:16----------
this conversation applies to me like


---------52:18----------
that's the whole


---------52:19----------
foundation of aoe healing that we can


---------52:22----------
have one conversation with an individual


---------52:24----------
person


---------52:24----------
something about that person can resonate


---------52:26----------
with everyone else who's watching


---------52:28----------
so can you just tell us what it means to


---------52:30----------
you to be a furry


---------52:33----------
uh yeah well i would like to get more in


---------52:35----------
touch with my


---------52:37----------
with my primal side i think when i'm


---------52:38----------
really comfortable i make a lot of


---------52:40----------
uh immediate like impulse


---------52:43----------
noises to emotional stimulus um


---------52:46----------
especially when i'm feeling safe and


---------52:48----------
that's something i want to foster and


---------52:49----------
get better at because i feel like that


---------52:51----------
helps the people i love understand me


---------52:55----------
and


---------52:55----------
and like know know how i'm feeling like


---------52:58----------
immediately i feel like


---------53:00----------
stuff like that we've we've lost um


---------53:04----------
and but does that make you different


---------53:06----------
from other people


---------53:07----------
like making primal noises when you feel


---------53:10----------
emotionally safe isn't that like just


---------53:12----------
part of being human


---------53:15----------
or am i missing something there i think


---------53:17----------
that's that's it i think it is


---------53:19----------
but i think a lot of people repress that


---------53:21----------
so i don't think that necessarily makes


---------53:22----------
me afraid but like maybe it makes me


---------53:24----------
a human furry in the sense that like


---------53:29----------
i am uh trying to be more of a human


---------53:33----------
animal


---------53:33----------
instead of like this civilized


---------53:37----------
you know idea of what a human should be


---------53:40----------
okay interesting okay that that's


---------53:42----------
helpful so you think like a lot of


---------53:44----------
civilization is


---------53:46----------
restrictive yeah yeah


---------53:49----------
and we engineering underwear instead of


---------53:52----------
freaking


---------53:54----------
yeah sure so totally totally


---------53:57----------
yeah and uh well and i think a lot of


---------54:00----------
these systems like


---------54:01----------
it's it's a shame i i think a lot of


---------54:03----------
people are more


---------54:04----------
have are way more beautiful than they


---------54:07----------
know and they're they are trying to be


---------54:09----------
something else


---------54:10----------
that is not themselves and i really wish


---------54:12----------
to inspire authenticity into people


---------54:14----------
um and that's something that like is


---------54:18----------
something i like about being trans you


---------54:20----------
know um


---------54:21----------
because my my off i wear my authenticity


---------54:25----------
in that sense like i know i'm trans


---------54:27----------
i know i'm a woman like i know this


---------54:29----------
transition was right for me


---------54:31----------
um and hopefully that can help inspire


---------54:33----------
other people to


---------54:34----------
take on whatever whatever transition


---------54:37----------
they're looking for in their life and


---------54:38----------
like


---------54:39----------
and make make the change to be more them


---------54:42----------
i know we have a timeline to get through


---------54:44----------
but man do i have so many questions so


---------54:45----------
let's do the timeline


---------54:47----------
and then i would love to hear your


---------54:49----------
perspective about what it means to be


---------54:50----------
trans and how would someone know if


---------54:52----------
they're trans


---------54:53----------
but let's get to the timeline can i


---------54:55----------
table that get to that


---------54:58----------
yeah okay yeah okay yeah so


---------55:01----------
let's go um


---------55:05----------
finish the timeline i mean it's ongoing


---------55:07----------
we got it


---------55:09----------
okay i mean we've gone for two days


---------55:13----------
or so like two or three days okay i'm


---------55:15----------
not going to respond


---------55:16----------
go i should stay silent i shall let you


---------55:19----------
reclaim your voice


---------55:20----------
staff oh thank you you've been you've


---------55:22----------
been you've been great dr k


---------55:24----------
thank you so much for having me on um


---------55:27----------
so okay i mean that is sort of


---------55:29----------
authoritarian isn't it i will let you


---------55:31----------
reclaim it once


---------55:32----------
interesting right as if it's mine to let


---------55:36----------
you yeah


---------55:38----------
the very opposite of anyway i promise


---------55:40----------
i'll be quiet


---------55:41----------
let me just put it back you know you


---------55:42----------
don't have to be where


---------55:44----------
where were we okay so uh yes there's the


---------55:47----------
second comment


---------55:48----------
and then yeah day three so i get a


---------55:50----------
little i get a little trolley on


---------55:52----------
on the third the third event and this is


---------55:54----------
this is something i kind of regret


---------55:56----------
and i was talking about people taking


---------55:58----------
things out of context


---------55:59----------
and i was trying to make a point uh like


---------56:02----------
a


---------56:02----------
like a tangible point about how things


---------56:04----------
are taken out of context and i


---------56:07----------
say that like i i preface what i'm about


---------56:11----------
to do


---------56:11----------
with you know watch this get taken out


---------56:13----------
of context too


---------56:14----------
and then i say something along the lines


---------56:17----------
of


---------56:18----------
uh like i'm a deer i think i'm a deer i


---------56:21----------
love to prance outside my backyard


---------56:23----------
and eat grass and and then i say okay


---------56:27----------
like that was a joke like i don't mean


---------56:29----------
that and of course


---------56:31----------
of course i knew what was going to


---------56:33----------
happen


---------56:35----------
i poked it anyway i poked that universe


---------56:38----------
anyway and i just let it happen


---------56:43----------
i made it happen but in a way it was


---------56:45----------
empowering


---------56:46----------
but in a way it was totally the wrong


---------56:48----------
wrong thing to do


---------56:49----------
i don't i still don't know i kind of


---------56:52----------
maybe things that are empowering are the


---------56:54----------
wrong thing to do


---------56:57----------
yeah yeah


---------57:00----------
so what happened everywhere


---------57:03----------
everywhere some like prominent some i


---------57:06----------
don't i don't want to like


---------57:07----------
i don't i don't want to shout out some


---------57:10----------
especially some prominent like


---------57:12----------
right-wing personalities especially a


---------57:16----------
specific


---------57:16----------
uh very popular radio talk show host


---------57:20----------
aired that clip on on their show


---------57:23----------
talking about how ridiculous the


---------57:28----------
leftist media and twitch has gotten to


---------57:31----------
hire


---------57:31----------
a person who believes they're a deer on


---------57:34----------
their


---------57:35----------
uh advisory council and uh


---------57:39----------
oh my gosh i underestimated how


---------57:42----------
poor journalistic integrity is these


---------57:45----------
days


---------57:47----------
because if anyone had looked into it


---------57:49----------
right if anyone had you been i'm like so


---------57:51----------
steph i don't think you underestimated i


---------57:53----------
know i'm supposed to shut up but i can't


---------57:54----------
help myself


---------57:55----------
you don't underestimate journalistic


---------57:57----------
integrity you


---------57:58----------
you underestimated the succulents


---------58:02----------
of you the succulents of me


---------58:05----------
that's the best word you just you just


---------58:07----------
titled my autobiography


---------58:09----------
right like i mean you can't give the


---------58:12----------
dankest


---------58:13----------
memers in the universe


---------58:16----------
something so juicy it's not it's not


---------58:19----------
about journaling like what do you think


---------58:20----------
these people are right


---------58:22----------
you're right you're right dank is so


---------58:24----------
sweetest


---------58:25----------
highest quality it's delicious it is i


---------58:28----------
gave them what they want to say


---------58:29----------
you gave them exactly yes i gave them


---------58:32----------
exactly what they can't expect them not


---------58:33----------
to eat it come on


---------58:38----------
but at least i said at least i said like


---------58:41----------
you're gonna eat this


---------58:42----------
you know at least no way like that gave


---------58:43----------
me that gave me some strength to be like


---------58:46----------
yeah you want this


---------58:50----------
boy do they want it they do


---------58:54----------
and then okay so what happened next


---------58:57----------
uh i mean that's oh


---------59:00----------
okay and then and then kind of


---------59:03----------
simultaneously


---------59:04----------
um this is i'm just getting into more of


---------59:07----------
my like


---------59:08----------
oh yeah so that's that's event two out


---------59:11----------
of three if there's a third event


---------59:13----------
that i think i have i have you know in a


---------59:16----------
little bit of a way avoid it because


---------59:17----------
it's


---------59:18----------
um it's more it's more personal


---------59:21----------
um but i reached the top


---------59:24----------
of live stream fails


---------59:29----------
oh yeah multiple top


---------59:32----------
live stream fails finishes thank you i


---------59:35----------
actually maybe there's a speed run


---------59:37----------
any percent


---------59:40----------
first place or so i guess it's 100 uh


---------59:43----------
live stream fails um for some really old


---------59:47----------
content of me getting head scritches


---------59:50----------
by my lovely partner


---------59:53----------
um and making i was


---------59:57----------
it was it was a cozy stream it was


---------60:00----------
disclaimered and it was mature


---------60:01----------
although i don't believe i i


---------60:04----------
nothing about it was sexual um where


---------60:08----------
i was lying on some pillows just here in


---------60:10----------
this room


---------60:11----------
and my partner was giving me gentle


---------60:13----------
touches on my on my scalp and head and i


---------60:16----------
was


---------60:17----------
trying to be as primal as possible and


---------60:20----------
and making noises of enjoyment um


---------60:25----------
i that was never sexual i was i was


---------60:28----------
never aroused


---------60:29----------
it was just an intimate moment between


---------60:31----------
me and my partner that i wanted to


---------60:33----------
demonstrate for the world


---------60:35----------
uh but that became the infamous


---------60:38----------
deergasm um that was


---------60:42----------
high quality juicy cringe content for


---------60:45----------
the world


---------60:45----------
um so thank you for your noble sacrifice


---------60:50----------
stuff


---------60:52----------
you know i hope i know i i i can't not


---------60:55----------
even i hope


---------60:56----------
i know i know i know it awakened some


---------60:58----------
things in some people


---------60:59----------
yeah damn right it's okay yeah yeah


---------61:02----------
i wonder about like you know all the


---------61:04----------
deergasm whether that's some amount of


---------61:05----------
projection


---------61:06----------
which is when they insert their own


---------61:08----------
feelings into what you see in another


---------61:09----------
person


---------61:10----------
just kind of curious definitely and


---------61:14----------
it's like you know it's like wow


---------61:18----------
i don't know like that it's just so


---------61:20----------
clearly not an orgasm


---------61:22----------
by like my like but


---------61:26----------
it's uh it's just


---------61:29----------
it's funny it's funny in that way it's


---------61:31----------
funny in that way because


---------61:32----------
um i think it's obviously not an orgasm


---------61:36----------
or anything sexual


---------61:37----------
but i think to the uninformed eye or


---------61:41----------
most of twitch has never experienced an


---------61:43----------
orgasm so they don't know what one looks


---------61:45----------
like


---------61:46----------
thank you dr k i didn't want to say it


---------61:57----------
it's too easy it's too easy deep within


---------62:00----------
me is a troll as well and i just can't


---------62:02----------
help


---------62:02----------
i can't help myself sometimes it's the


---------62:05----------
bait is just too succulent


---------62:07----------
but that's me


---------62:11----------
so so what happened after that


---------62:14----------
um well that's that's


---------62:17----------
that's uh that's like the whole reason


---------62:19----------
the internet's mad at me dr k


---------62:20----------
we're we're like we're there and we're


---------62:22----------
just three months later i'm seeing


---------62:24----------
um i see a lot of yeah i see a lot of


---------62:28----------
subtle death threats


---------62:29----------
uh there's a lot of there's a lot of


---------62:31----------
there's a lot of people


---------62:32----------
posting deer hunter memes you know if


---------62:35----------
you're a deer


---------62:36----------
then it's illegal for me to kill you in


---------62:37----------
hunting season i've heard that probably


---------62:40----------
a close upwards of 500 times um


---------62:44----------
and there's been some serious


---------62:48----------
serious death threats uh my that's


---------62:50----------
terrible


---------62:52----------
my address has been leaked i have been


---------62:55----------
doxed


---------62:56----------
um i want to move i want to get out of


---------62:59----------
here because


---------63:00----------
it just takes one person to want to come


---------63:03----------
and kill me


---------63:04----------
to kill me and you're not


---------63:07----------
saying a lot of scary stuff but you're


---------63:08----------
smiling a little bit


---------63:10----------
yeah because i'm trying to like channel


---------63:12----------
the absurdity of it and trying to make


---------63:14----------
light of it and you know everything's


---------63:16----------
kind of a joke to me


---------63:17----------
um i mean that's it's just a coping


---------63:20----------
mechanism


---------63:21----------
really um


---------63:24----------
and it's also something that like while


---------63:27----------
yeah


---------63:28----------
it's traumatic and it's like ongoingly


---------63:30----------
traumatic


---------63:31----------
um thank you for helping me like say


---------63:33----------
that by the way


---------63:35----------
uh it's


---------63:39----------
in a way i'm detached from it uh because


---------63:41----------
for my own sanity like in a way it's


---------63:43----------
it's


---------63:44----------
it's not it's not right now i think if


---------63:46----------
you if we actually had that interview


---------63:48----------
several months ago


---------63:49----------
uh it would have been you know it would


---------63:51----------
have been still fresh


---------63:52----------
but now it's something that i'm like


---------63:54----------
settling into is like it has a fact of


---------63:56----------
my existence like


---------63:59----------
it's it's absurd in a lot of ways so


---------64:02----------
i mean you use the word detached like it


---------64:04----------
feels a little bit almost dissociated


---------64:06----------
you know because yeah that's what


---------64:08----------
happens when we get traumatized it's


---------64:10----------
like we just say like oh this


---------64:11----------
can't be real yeah and you can't


---------64:14----------
you you can't sit with the thought of


---------64:18----------
what you're actually facing because that


---------64:19----------
would destroy you as a person


---------64:22----------
i would not be able to function so yeah


---------64:25----------
and you know 2020 sucks for for for most


---------64:28----------
people too


---------64:28----------
like it's a so it's a rough year for all


---------64:30----------
of us disassociating is the mood


---------64:33----------
into our into our nightmare rectangles


---------64:35----------
that's that's my name for a phone


---------64:37----------
ah nightmare i don't think i coined it


---------64:39----------
but yeah


---------64:41----------
um so that's that's sort of the


---------64:44----------
i i mean i couldn't tell if that was


---------64:46----------
sort of the end of the timeline because


---------64:47----------
the timeline's not over yet


---------64:49----------
um but you know you were kind of saying


---------64:52----------
that like that was like the third point


---------64:53----------
so now you're still sort of dealing with


---------64:55----------
this stuff


---------64:56----------
it seems like it's persistent but not


---------64:58----------
quite


---------64:59----------
as acute as it was when you skyrocketed


---------65:03----------
to the top of lsf


---------65:05----------
yep um yeah thanks for sharing that


---------65:09----------
sounds really rough


---------65:11----------
yeah thanks thank you for giving me the


---------65:14----------
ability to


---------65:15----------
like it feels really good to be able to


---------65:17----------
speak


---------65:18----------
um can i um


---------65:22----------
ask a couple of questions sure


---------65:25----------
so can you tell us uh what it means to


---------65:27----------
be trans


---------65:30----------
you help me understand that concept


---------65:33----------
yeah to be to be trans um


---------65:37----------
generally is a feeling of dysphoria


---------65:41----------
for your gender identity or your


---------65:44----------
gendered expression


---------65:45----------
or a feeling of euphoria for


---------65:49----------
your preferred gender identity and


---------65:52----------
gender expression


---------65:54----------
or or both um


---------65:58----------
uh to me um so what does dysphoria mean


---------66:03----------
dysphoria means a feeling of like


---------66:05----------
uncomfortability with your body it's


---------66:07----------
kind of like your brain is expecting


---------66:09----------
your body to be one thing and


---------66:12----------
gender dysphoria or dysphoria in general


---------66:14----------
that's just that's dysphoria in


---------66:17----------
general oh so so you're so you're


---------66:20----------
saying that dysphoria is something about


---------66:22----------
the physical form


---------66:24----------
a feeling about the physical yeah okay


---------66:26----------
yes


---------66:27----------
yeah it's like a it's like and that


---------66:29----------
manifests like a disappointment when you


---------66:30----------
look in the mirror or you know when you


---------66:32----------
see your body or that kind of thing it's


---------66:34----------
like an


---------66:34----------
incongruence with what you wish you were


---------66:36----------
seeing or


---------66:37----------
or your mental expectation


---------66:40----------
to uh reality


---------66:44----------
so what is you foreign euphoria would be


---------66:48----------
a feeling of of it would be like the


---------66:52----------
opposite it would be feeling like


---------66:53----------
joy at like what you're seeing or


---------66:56----------
what you look at when you so


---------67:00----------
so my understanding is that that's like


---------67:01----------
that's gender dysphoria or gender


---------67:03----------
euphoria


---------67:06----------
so sure but that euphoria is just


---------67:09----------
feeling good yeah yeah but like if


---------67:12----------
so if a trans euphoric yeah but also


---------67:16----------
a trans woman often putting on a skirt


---------67:18----------
and doing a twirl is euphoric


---------67:20----------
yeah and that means you have gender


---------67:22----------
euphoria because you have


---------67:25----------
presented femininely and it feels good


---------67:27----------
and that is enough


---------67:28----------
in my mind to to transition uh you know


---------67:32----------
we all should be which is kind of


---------67:35----------
a little bit contentious some people


---------67:36----------
believe that you have to feel bad


---------67:38----------
to transition but i think we should all


---------67:40----------
be choosing


---------67:41----------
our best lives and like trying to


---------67:44----------
chase happiness um wherever we go


---------67:49----------
and so so if i'm understanding you


---------67:51----------
correctly like so to be trans is to


---------67:54----------
have a dissatisfaction with when you


---------67:57----------
look at yourself in the mirror


---------67:59----------
and to have a satisfaction when your


---------68:02----------
outward appearance


---------68:05----------
or your body mirrors something of your


---------68:08----------
mental expectation


---------68:10----------
yeah okay thanks a lot for explaining


---------68:13----------
that


---------68:14----------
i'm gonna is it okay if i share like my


---------68:16----------
some of my experiences working with


---------68:17----------
trans people and how they've described


---------68:19----------
it to me


---------68:21----------
yeah and there's i mean there's


---------68:22----------
definitely more i could say oh yeah so


---------68:24----------
please say more


---------68:26----------
um i mean i think there's also it's also


---------68:29----------
a hormonal thing


---------68:30----------
often um so it can be it can also be a


---------68:33----------
dissatisfaction


---------68:34----------
or with testosterone or satisfaction


---------68:36----------
with testosterone and


---------68:38----------
and the inverse um i found myself


---------68:42----------
disliking how testosterone felt in me


---------68:44----------
and that was


---------68:45----------
one of the largest drives for me to try


---------68:49----------
estrogen and try blocking testosterone


---------68:52----------
and um


---------68:53----------
that that was kind of the doorway to


---------68:56----------
opening up my trans identity


---------68:58----------
but i come from i actually come from a


---------69:00----------
biochemistry background


---------69:02----------
so that was kind of like i looked at it


---------69:04----------
tried to look at it in like a very


---------69:05----------
chemical kind of way


---------69:07----------
like you know and i feel like my brain


---------69:09----------
was always meant


---------69:10----------
to be on estrogen like that was just


---------69:12----------
better for me and and i


---------69:14----------
haven't how did you feel on testosterone


---------69:18----------
um i felt you know it it's a little bit


---------69:21----------
difficult because it's you know it's


---------69:23----------
been so long ago it's like a whole


---------69:24----------
different person to go i've like gone


---------69:25----------
through a different i've gone through a


---------69:27----------
second puberty


---------69:28----------
and now i have emerged a totally


---------69:31----------
different entity


---------69:31----------
than than the me on testosterone


---------69:35----------
i feel um and uh


---------69:39----------
i i felt like i didn't have


---------69:42----------
as much emotional resolution um


---------69:45----------
and i kind of feel like i should


---------69:47----------
disclaim this like you know


---------69:49----------
when you accept yourself and transition


---------69:51----------
at the same time it can be kind of hard


---------69:53----------
to


---------69:53----------
differentiate what is what is


---------69:58----------
from accepting yourself and


---------69:59----------
understanding your mental state better


---------70:01----------
and what is from


---------70:02----------
these hormones you're taking um and it's


---------70:05----------
like


---------70:06----------
you know it's it's both uh but i felt


---------70:10----------
i felt like um but also estrogen has


---------70:14----------
increased my sensitivity


---------70:15----------
to lights sounds tastes and smells


---------70:19----------
um and i feel like i have a greater


---------70:22----------
emotional


---------70:23----------
bandwidth like uh like sadness is


---------70:26----------
many different colors instead of just


---------70:28----------
you know a generalized feeling of


---------70:31----------
being sad now i i feel like i can


---------70:33----------
understand a lot more of the nuance


---------70:36----------
um sounds like a hack


---------70:40----------
sounds like an emotional yeah


---------70:43----------
sounds like i mean we're like we're here


---------70:46----------
living i choose your own hormone


---------70:48----------
adventure you know all you need


---------70:49----------
to justify transition is the any


---------70:52----------
transition


---------70:53----------
in my mind is a feeling beyond a


---------70:56----------
reasonable doubt that it's


---------70:58----------
gonna be what what's good what's


---------71:01----------
it's gonna improve your life it's gonna


---------71:03----------
make you feel better okay


---------71:07----------
so um is it okay if i share kind of my


---------71:10----------
perspective


---------71:10----------
so what i'd like to do is like sure ask


---------71:13----------
a couple of questions which may come


---------71:15----------
across as challenging but i want to


---------71:16----------
share


---------71:17----------
my perspective of understanding


---------71:19----------
transgender


---------71:21----------
and sort of get your thoughts on that so


---------71:23----------
here's the first thing


---------71:25----------
um so i had a couple of


---------71:28----------
people that i worked with that really


---------71:29----------
explained this to me well so


---------71:31----------
i think my best understanding of


---------71:34----------
transgender


---------71:35----------
really what i think helped me as a cis


---------71:37----------
male understand transgender


---------71:39----------
is to like take your cis


---------71:42----------
so let's take cis men okay so like most


---------71:45----------
i guess


---------71:46----------
i do think that 51 of twitch hat is


---------71:49----------
cisgendered men um statistically


---------71:52----------
i could be wrong here i don't really


---------71:54----------
know and so like you know go


---------71:56----------
buy a pair of high heels and go buy a


---------72:00----------
dress


---------72:01----------
your choice if you want to get makeup


---------72:02----------
and jewelry and whatnot


---------72:04----------
and put those on and the second you put


---------72:07----------
those on


---------72:08----------
you are going to feel intensely


---------72:09----------
uncomfortable look at yourself in the


---------72:11----------
mirror and it's going to feel


---------72:13----------
icky it's going to be feel weird it's


---------72:15----------
going to feel awkward


---------72:17----------
now that is the way that a transgender


---------72:20----------
person feels before they transition


---------72:22----------
every single day yes


---------72:26----------
how's that for a description


---------72:31----------
i think it's the best way that i've come


---------72:32----------
to understand what it's like to


---------72:34----------
empathize with a transgender person


---------72:37----------
um the first time i got brave enough to


---------72:41----------
go to a thrift store


---------72:42----------
and find a dress it wasn't even i mean


---------72:46----------
it's it's not like the it's not a very


---------72:47----------
pretty dress even


---------72:49----------
um and like it's not even it wasn't even


---------72:51----------
like a great dress but i


---------72:53----------
i managed to get a dress and i put it on


---------72:56----------
and i


---------72:57----------
loved how i looked so much i wore as


---------73:00----------
much as i possibly could for like


---------73:02----------
four days i was just jumping around my


---------73:04----------
apartment because i felt


---------73:06----------
finally liberated and free and that part


---------73:09----------
of me that like i had


---------73:10----------
repressed for so long like at some point


---------73:13----------
i learned


---------73:14----------
that me wearing a dress was wrong that


---------73:16----------
me expressing femininity was wrong


---------73:18----------
and that was like locked away until


---------73:21----------
until i finally was able to like


---------73:23----------
overcome that


---------73:24----------
um and it was it was amazing


---------73:28----------
yeah um so so you know that's the best


---------73:31----------
way i can


---------73:32----------
understand it in terms of like the


---------73:34----------
intense


---------73:35----------
on discomfort you feel in the relief


---------73:38----------
that you feel when you get out of those


---------73:39----------
clothes


---------73:40----------
is sort of like what a transgender


---------73:42----------
person feels like


---------73:44----------
now i i have a couple questions for you


---------73:47----------
so like let's say that i


---------73:49----------
when i look at myself in the mirror i


---------73:51----------
have a feeling


---------73:52----------
that my nose looks wrong


---------73:56----------
and then i decide to have surgery to


---------74:00----------
fix my nose what do you think about that


---------74:05----------
um i think


---------74:13----------
i think that uh if your nose looking


---------74:17----------
wrong or your discomfort your nose


---------74:19----------
severely impacts your mental health that


---------74:22----------
you should


---------74:23----------
get surgery or you know try to


---------74:26----------
try to improve your perception of


---------74:28----------
yourself


---------74:29----------
either through surgery or yeah


---------74:32----------
i mean i i'm down so i think you should


---------74:35----------
i'm gonna disagree with you is that okay


---------74:37----------
for me to do yeah that's fine


---------74:39----------
so i come from kind of honestly stuff


---------74:41----------
i'm i'm really conflicted about some of


---------74:43----------
this stuff because i see two sides of a


---------74:45----------
coin


---------74:46----------
on the one hand like it really helps me


---------74:48----------
understand like the trans person's


---------74:49----------
perspective and like i said that's the


---------74:51----------
that's the perspective that helped me


---------74:53----------
understand trans the best and the one


---------74:55----------
that made the most sense to be


---------74:56----------
and it makes a lot of sense that like


---------74:58----------
you know if you just feel like you're in


---------74:59----------
the wrong skin


---------75:01----------
to get into the right skin the


---------75:04----------
the the confusion that i have because


---------75:08----------
this is an internal disagreement it's


---------75:09----------
not that i disagree with you it's that i


---------75:11----------
disagree with parts of myself because i


---------75:12----------
understand that like that's


---------75:14----------
i get what i just explained i this other


---------75:16----------
part that comes from like


---------75:18----------
more of an eastern tradition of like


---------75:20----------
yoga and meditation and stuff like that


---------75:22----------
which actually posits that our sense of


---------75:25----------
identity


---------75:26----------
on the whole is actually like false


---------75:29----------
and that what truly makes us human is


---------75:32----------
not gender


---------75:33----------
is not letters after my name is not a


---------75:36----------
particular age


---------75:38----------
and that there is some sort of


---------75:39----------
inescapable humanness that is our truest


---------75:42----------
form of self


---------75:43----------
and that the more that you peel back


---------75:46----------
identity the closer you become to your


---------75:48----------
true self


---------75:49----------
and so i get a little bit conflicted


---------75:51----------
because also as a psychiatrist


---------75:53----------
i've been trained that some people have


---------75:55----------
something called body dysmorphia


---------75:58----------
and and so like you know homosexuality


---------76:01----------
used to be a psychiatric illness


---------76:03----------
i probably to a certain degree


---------76:05----------
transgenderism used to be a psychiatric


---------76:08----------
illness


---------76:08----------
now we describe something called gender


---------76:10----------
dysphoria which kind of focuses on the


---------76:12----------
dis


---------76:13----------
or gender identity disorder it doesn't


---------76:16----------
necessarily mean that


---------76:17----------
gender identity is disordered it means


---------76:20----------
that some people


---------76:21----------
have a pathology associated with gender


---------76:24----------
identity


---------76:25----------
right it's like the disorder is not


---------76:27----------
doesn't define


---------76:28----------
it's not that your gender identity or


---------76:30----------
gender identity can cause


---------76:32----------
a disorder but it can also not cause a


---------76:35----------
disorder


---------76:36----------
and so what i kind of struggle with is


---------76:37----------
that like what i'm hearing you say


---------76:39----------
and i understand like one side of it


---------76:41----------
right just kind of like i explained


---------76:43----------
but what i'm kind of confused by is like


---------76:45----------
at what point do we let


---------76:46----------
feelings determine identity


---------76:50----------
you know so that there's a part of me


---------76:51----------
for like my yogic training actually


---------76:53----------
tells me that feelings should be the


---------76:55----------
last thing


---------76:56----------
to determine identity because feelings


---------76:59----------
are just feeling in who i am is who i am


---------77:01----------
and my feelings do not define me as a


---------77:03----------
human being


---------77:05----------
i'm curious what do you think about that


---------77:08----------
um


---------77:11----------
how do you feel about happiness


---------77:16----------
like is is is happiness something that


---------77:19----------
we should


---------77:20----------
pursue how do you define happiness


---------77:24----------
um uh dopamines


---------77:29----------
serotonins no uh i don't think that's


---------77:31----------
something we should pursue


---------77:33----------
okay interesting right so like if i


---------77:37----------
believed that


---------77:38----------
dopamine was worth pursuing for its own


---------77:40----------
sake i would be okay with cocaine use


---------77:43----------
i'm not okay with cocaine use huh


---------77:46----------
yeah right i mean me neither


---------77:50----------
but um that's a


---------77:53----------
real quick shot of dopamine right there


---------77:57----------
it is it is but it's incredibly harmful


---------77:59----------
to long-term


---------78:01----------
dopamine generation you know you gotta i


---------78:04----------
should like min max your dopamine


---------78:06----------
farming


---------78:07----------
yeah but i i know for sustainability


---------78:11----------
yeah go ahead so i i don't even think


---------78:13----------
that's a good idea


---------78:15----------
so yeah so so like this is where i think


---------78:17----------
happiness like what is happiness


---------78:19----------
is it the chasing of like positive


---------78:22----------
feelings


---------78:22----------
no i think what we should chase is like


---------78:26----------
calmness tranquility contentment and


---------78:28----------
peace


---------78:29----------
which is not necessarily happiness right


---------78:32----------
right i definitely am in the camp of


---------78:34----------
like we should be chasing


---------78:35----------
chasing happiness and um but i think you


---------78:39----------
can definitely


---------78:41----------
get happiness from


---------78:44----------
you know calmness tranquility and like


---------78:46----------
meditation is like an important


---------78:48----------
part of of being a happy being um


---------78:52----------
and i mean we should all be


---------78:55----------
we shall be looking for better but i


---------78:57----------
think


---------79:00----------
a quest to pursue


---------79:04----------
happiness is is worth it on its own


---------79:08----------
and i i


---------79:14----------
i feel like i i i have a personal


---------79:17----------
philosophy that people


---------79:19----------
if people pursued if people were maybe a


---------79:22----------
little more selfish


---------79:23----------
and pursued their happiness more they


---------79:26----------
could


---------79:27----------
um they could live better lives


---------79:30----------
and and make changes to like improve


---------79:33----------
where they're at


---------79:34----------
and to a point like i feel like there's


---------79:37----------
so much like accepting a bad situation


---------79:40----------
and being at peace with your bad


---------79:41----------
situation uh


---------79:43----------
at what point do you like try to


---------79:45----------
manifest change


---------79:46----------
for better so i think that accepting


---------79:49----------
your bad situation is the first step to


---------79:51----------
manifesting change


---------79:53----------
i don't think that the two are mutually


---------79:55----------
exclusive i think actually a lot of the


---------79:57----------
problems that we run into


---------79:59----------
in terms of why people are stuck is


---------80:01----------
because they don't accept where they are


---------80:03----------
they focus too much on where they want


---------80:05----------
to be


---------80:06----------
they focus too much about finding


---------80:08----------
happiness


---------80:09----------
if dot dot dot i would be happier


---------80:12----------
if dot dot dot if i was


---------80:16----------
in you know a different place


---------80:20----------
if i had a girlfriend if i had more


---------80:21----------
money if i was promoted


---------80:23----------
if i was this if i was that if i was in


---------80:26----------
a different body


---------80:28----------
right so like a lot of what you


---------80:30----------
described makes sense to me in terms of


---------80:31----------
like


---------80:32----------
feelings and and identity and dysphoria


---------80:35----------
like when i look at myself in the mirror


---------80:37----------
i imagine that i would be happier if i


---------80:39----------
did not have my dad bod with my dad gun


---------80:42----------
i look at myself and i i strive and want


---------80:45----------
to be


---------80:45----------
more physically in shape


---------80:49----------
and i'm not so sure i think it's fine to


---------80:51----------
exercise i think it's good to exercise


---------80:53----------
personally i i'm a little bit conflicted


---------80:55----------
because at the same time


---------80:58----------
i think that like chasing after a


---------81:00----------
particular external thing


---------81:02----------
and especially when i work with people


---------81:04----------
with body dysmorphia which i do believe


---------81:06----------
is actually an illness


---------81:07----------
or illness really isn't the right word i


---------81:09----------
do think it causes a lot of suffering


---------81:11----------
let me put it that way


---------81:13----------
yeah and so i'm curious what do you


---------81:15----------
think about like body dysmorphia and i'm


---------81:17----------
happy to define it if you


---------81:19----------
want go ahead yeah so it's like you know


---------81:23----------
generally we think about people who


---------81:25----------
look at themselves in the mirror or and


---------81:27----------
are unsatisfied with what they see


---------81:29----------
and go to great lengths to change things


---------81:34----------
and sometimes even on an objective


---------81:35----------
measure so like the most difficult


---------81:37----------
patients i've ever had to deal with


---------81:39----------
in my history as a psychiatrist is male


---------81:41----------
bodybuilders with body dysmorphia


---------81:45----------
they're every time they look in the


---------81:46----------
mirror they're unsatisfied with what


---------81:48----------
they see


---------81:49----------
and it's it's you know they make


---------81:51----------
progress and they're still unsatisfied


---------81:53----------
and so i really struggle with


---------81:56----------
the concept the yogic side of me so i


---------81:59----------
like i understand the transgender


---------82:01----------
example because that sort of just makes


---------82:02----------
sense to me and on the flip side the


---------82:04----------
yogic side of me


---------82:05----------
struggles because i i don't really


---------82:08----------
understand


---------82:09----------
something feels wrong to me about


---------82:11----------
letting your feelings determine who you


---------82:13----------
are as a person


---------82:17----------
right because something is feels wrong


---------82:19----------
to me when someone has been like


---------82:21----------
raised in an abusive household and they


---------82:24----------
feel like they're


---------82:25----------
bad people and those are determined by


---------82:28----------
the way that they feel i do not believe


---------82:29----------
that their identity is accurately


---------82:31----------
determined by the way that they feel


---------82:34----------
sure yeah whether it be narcissism


---------82:37----------
or low self-worth


---------82:41----------
i i'm just not sure


---------82:45----------
what do you think about that i


---------82:49----------
agree with you you're certainly giving


---------82:50----------
me something to think about like i


---------82:54----------
uh


---------83:04----------
um


---------83:06----------
it's tricky because i think if someone


---------83:08----------
is like if maybe we can go back to the


---------83:10----------
nose example


---------83:11----------
if if someone is


---------83:15----------
is is fixating on the fact that they


---------83:17----------
don't don't like their nose


---------83:20----------
intensely if it's like distracting them


---------83:22----------
from their day-to-day if it's


---------83:23----------
a mental handicap for them to to to have


---------83:28----------
have something that they could and and


---------83:30----------
they have the ability


---------83:32----------
to change that i think that they should


---------83:36----------
to better their mental health and


---------83:38----------
especially like


---------83:39----------
if you're talking about trans people


---------83:41----------
that you know taking different hormones


---------83:44----------
could liberate so many mental processes


---------83:48----------
that they're not that are are


---------83:51----------
spent um being uncomfortable with their


---------83:55----------
body


---------83:55----------
or spent like


---------83:59----------
spent on these feelings um


---------84:02----------
then i think like i


---------84:05----------
i fundamentally think that you you


---------84:07----------
should act on


---------84:08----------
on feelings but maybe not maybe not all


---------84:10----------
feelings


---------84:12----------
so i have i mean i certainly have to


---------84:14----------
think about um


---------84:19----------
yeah yeah it's certainly something for


---------84:21----------
me to meditate on


---------84:22----------
yeah i mean it's something that i


---------84:25----------
struggle with because like


---------84:26----------
you know on on one hand of the spectrum


---------84:28----------
like i sort of


---------84:30----------
you know so my daughter loves to wear an


---------84:32----------
elsa dress


---------84:34----------
you know she like really loves like


---------84:36----------
sometimes she'll just change at random


---------84:38----------
times like she'll like


---------84:40----------
get ready for the day and then like 3 30


---------84:41----------
i'll roll around and she's like i feel


---------84:44----------
like being a princess


---------84:45----------
she'll go upstairs and she'll just like


---------84:47----------
change into her house address


---------84:49----------
and you know there's a part of me that


---------84:50----------
that's kind of like okay like you do you


---------84:52----------
right like so we want to support kids


---------84:54----------
and let them be like who they are and if


---------84:55----------
you want to be a princess then like by


---------84:57----------
all means go for


---------84:58----------
it there's another part of me that sort


---------84:59----------
of wonders a little bit though like


---------85:01----------
there's there's some


---------85:02----------
parts of me that are concerned one is


---------85:03----------
that like ultimately what i'm


---------85:06----------
teaching my daughter is that her


---------85:07----------
happiness is dependent on the kind of


---------85:09----------
clothing she wears


---------85:11----------
or her perception of her identity or how


---------85:13----------
she looks on the outside


---------85:15----------
that's not something i actually want to


---------85:17----------
instill in my daughter


---------85:19----------
like there's a part of me that wants


---------85:20----------
like she asks for princess things and as


---------85:22----------
a parent i'm like absolutely go for it


---------85:24----------
like you do you


---------85:25----------
and then like i'm conflicted because


---------85:26----------
then there's another part of me like


---------85:27----------
what am i teaching her


---------85:30----------
that the clothing that you wear in the


---------85:31----------
way that you look on the outside


---------85:33----------
determines who you are because that i


---------85:36----------
wouldn't agree with at all


---------85:37----------
like i just don't know right you know so


---------85:40----------
i i just want to


---------85:42----------
yeah i would say that her enjoyment has


---------85:44----------
has value


---------85:45----------
right her her positive feelings you know


---------85:48----------
she's she wants she wants to enjoy this


---------85:50----------
she feels good


---------85:52----------
completely


---------86:00----------
i i think i think if you if you like


---------86:04----------
you kind of you're maybe running the


---------86:06----------
risk of like


---------86:09----------
hurting her enjoyment of a thing


---------86:13----------
to you know when you remind her that


---------86:16----------
like


---------86:16----------
this shouldn't matter in in that sense


---------86:19----------
that like


---------86:23----------
uh absolutely so i think that's really


---------86:25----------
tricky


---------86:26----------
are you feeling okay by the way is it


---------86:27----------
okay that we're having this discussion


---------86:29----------
yeah we're in a difficult we're in


---------86:31----------
difficult and kind of existential places


---------86:33----------
but i


---------86:33----------
i feel good i'm comfortable uh do you


---------86:36----------
feel attacked or


---------86:37----------
well anyway no okay no so so


---------86:41----------
i'm with you there too because like i


---------86:42----------
kind of get what you're saying that


---------86:45----------
you know i i bock at the word should


---------86:48----------
like that she should be something right


---------86:50----------
and so to sacrifice enjoyment for the


---------86:52----------
sake of what she should be


---------86:53----------
because that i think is a whole


---------86:55----------
different problem that i also


---------86:58----------
react very negatively against right that


---------87:00----------
we tell people that


---------87:02----------
you're not allowed to be happy unless


---------87:04----------
you are


---------87:05----------
what i think you should be that's a


---------87:07----------
whole i mean that's how


---------87:09----------
you know gender identity discrimination


---------87:13----------
started right with that concept


---------87:16----------
so i i i take issue with that and at the


---------87:18----------
same time i also kind of have this other


---------87:20----------
side of the coin and this is really why


---------87:21----------
i struggle with this stuff


---------87:23----------
is you know to


---------87:27----------
to chase good feelings i think is also


---------87:31----------
problematic from the yogic side


---------87:34----------
right because to say that like hey if it


---------87:37----------
if you feel


---------87:38----------
happier doing it go for it


---------87:42----------
right because because then you kind of


---------87:44----------
get back to like the trolls of the


---------87:45----------
internet because


---------87:46----------
like are we saying that they should


---------87:48----------
sacrifice their trollish enjoyment for


---------87:50----------
the sake of what we think they should be


---------87:53----------
or are we saying like actually


---------87:55----------
satisfying your enjoyment because of the


---------87:57----------
way that you feel


---------88:00----------
and if you're like if i'm a nazi and it


---------88:02----------
satisfies my sense


---------88:03----------
like it gratifies my feelings


---------88:08----------
to act behave or even portray myself in


---------88:11----------
a particular way like let's say i get a


---------88:12----------
tattoo


---------88:14----------
then like how do we navigate like i i


---------88:16----------
just rub up against this issue of like


---------88:18----------
feelings determining identity and


---------88:21----------
chasing


---------88:22----------
good feelings


---------88:26----------
it's like an emotional there's like an


---------88:29----------
emotional maturity


---------88:30----------
and like emotional intelligence side of


---------88:32----------
this of like


---------88:33----------
not trying to hurt other people like it


---------88:36----------
feels good


---------88:37----------
to help other people and um


---------88:40----------
if you if you're chasing good feelings


---------88:44----------
in a self-harming way i don't think


---------88:47----------
that's a good thing for you to be doing


---------88:49----------
if you're chasing feelings in a way that


---------88:51----------
hurts other people


---------88:52----------
that makes other people's lives worse i


---------88:55----------
don't think


---------88:56----------
you're you're you're doing


---------88:59----------
doing the right thing either so


---------89:02----------
agree i think that the tricky thing


---------89:03----------
though is like this kind of comes back


---------89:05----------
to your succulents


---------89:06----------
i think something about you


---------89:09----------
really like gets at people and i'm not


---------89:12----------
saying that's bad


---------89:13----------
but i think like something about you


---------89:15----------
like really rubs people the wrong way


---------89:17----------
right and it could be because you're


---------89:19----------
challenging things that need to be


---------89:20----------
challenged


---------89:22----------
but it's kind of interesting because


---------89:23----------
like i don't know


---------89:25----------
why when they look at you like it's


---------89:27----------
[ __ ] crazy stuff like why are they


---------89:29----------
doxxing you what did you do


---------89:31----------
because there's no way that you said


---------89:34----------
something it just doesn't


---------89:35----------
it doesn't compute in my mind that you


---------89:38----------
have the power


---------89:41----------
to say anything that evokes the response


---------89:44----------
that you've got


---------89:46----------
yeah right well i think right i agree


---------89:49----------
with you i mean


---------89:50----------
it hasn't i've been around for a long


---------89:51----------
time and it hasn't gotten this bad until


---------89:53----------
like


---------89:53----------
twitch endorsed me in the sense of


---------89:56----------
hiring me


---------89:57----------
definitely assumed like i wasn't


---------90:00----------
as soon as as soon as twitch the entity


---------90:04----------
gave me their endorsement it became an


---------90:07----------
issue that i was


---------90:09----------
this way that i am who i am did i say


---------90:12----------
what i say


---------90:14----------
yeah so i mean i think this is where


---------90:16----------
like i once again i'm kind of conflicted


---------90:18----------
because that makes a lot like it just


---------90:19----------
doesn't make sense that you're deserving


---------90:21----------
of what happened to you and at the same


---------90:23----------
time


---------90:23----------
i feel like their reactions have some


---------90:26----------
kind of dysphoria based on who you


---------90:29----------
are and in my experience a lot of anger


---------90:32----------
and hatred actually stems from hurt


---------90:34----------
more than anything else that like if you


---------90:37----------
look at the insult community like i


---------90:38----------
think there are a lot of people who have


---------90:39----------
been hurt


---------90:41----------
and that hurt somehow transforms into


---------90:43----------
hatred and now i get really confused


---------90:45----------
because then it's like


---------90:46----------
it's kind of like you know is that woman


---------90:48----------
responsible for hurting


---------90:50----------
that that dude because i i that doesn't


---------90:52----------
feel right to me


---------90:54----------
yeah and and so so i i think it just


---------90:57----------
it gets really confusing for me because


---------90:59----------
i don't really know how to navigate okay


---------91:00----------
so


---------91:01----------
you know gratifying your own feelings at


---------91:03----------
the expense of others


---------91:06----------
sounds bad but now we get to this


---------91:09----------
ridiculous situation where your


---------91:11----------
existence


---------91:13----------
hurts other people right because that's


---------91:16----------
what you said like you said


---------91:17----------
like they're like they're just


---------91:18----------
transphobic and then like


---------91:21----------
yeah i'm just i'm confused i don't i


---------91:23----------
don't really know like how to


---------91:25----------
sort through this because i have these


---------91:26----------
two really strong conflicting kind of


---------91:28----------
views


---------91:29----------
one is and i can lay those out to you


---------91:32----------
one is that like feelings


---------91:34----------
the yogic part of me says that feelings


---------91:36----------
should not determine identity in fact


---------91:38----------
the more that you let your feelings


---------91:40----------
determine identity the more suffering


---------91:42----------
you'll lead and the more


---------91:43----------
false identity you'll build that's what


---------91:46----------
sort of yoga and buddhism sort of says


---------91:47----------
that if i like determine


---------91:49----------
my identity based on a feeling of pride


---------91:51----------
because i'm


---------91:52----------
ceo of xyz or i have a particular net


---------91:55----------
worth


---------91:56----------
that's going to cause problems how


---------91:59----------
how do how are trans people like just in


---------92:02----------
general how do they reconcile their


---------92:04----------
existence


---------92:05----------
to to that you're the that's fine


---------92:09----------
i don't know because i understand the


---------92:11----------
perspective i understand the perspective


---------92:13----------
of like


---------92:14----------
you know if i if i like put on high


---------92:16----------
heels in a dress that would feel really


---------92:17----------
[ __ ] uncomfortable


---------92:18----------
and it makes perfect sense to me that


---------92:23----------
if i was in that if i was in the


---------92:24----------
position where i was waking up every day


---------92:26----------
and society told me to wear


---------92:28----------
high heels in a dress i would completely


---------92:31----------
get behind someone who says i don't want


---------92:33----------
to wear high heels in a dress


---------92:34----------
i want to wear jeans and a t-shirt and i


---------92:36----------
would support a person 100


---------92:39----------
makes perfect sense to me and it's


---------92:41----------
conflicting with this other thing


---------92:44----------
all right yeah sure well uh


---------92:52----------
um i mean we're all


---------92:54----------
we're all out here trying to do our best


---------92:56----------
right that's like i'm not


---------92:57----------
and and i don't think life is something


---------92:59----------
to just drift


---------93:01----------
drift through in the sense of like you


---------93:04----------
know


---------93:05----------
mitigate i don't think we should be


---------93:07----------
mitigating


---------93:08----------
emotions i mean you're you're the expert


---------93:12----------
on like this


---------93:13----------
this philosophy that like i'm trying to


---------93:15----------
quickly you know


---------93:16----------
integrate and like understand but


---------93:20----------
um you know i think i think


---------93:23----------
life the we're gonna get


---------93:26----------
really deep i think


---------93:30----------
i think one of the fundamental purposes


---------93:33----------
of


---------93:33----------
of what one of the fundamental joys of


---------93:37----------
existing


---------93:37----------
in life and and that kind of thing is


---------93:39----------
appreciating art


---------93:41----------
in in moments in in the present


---------93:44----------
or just you know what other humans have


---------93:47----------
made i think that's something that's


---------93:48----------
like


---------93:49----------
cool fundamentally awesome about the


---------93:52----------
human consciousness that like we can


---------93:54----------
make and share art uh


---------93:58----------
and feel feel feel things


---------94:02----------
about it not just not just good things


---------94:04----------
but all things


---------94:05----------
and i think i think in that way feelings


---------94:08----------
give my life purpose


---------94:12----------
uh they're like they're they're very


---------94:14----------
important


---------94:15----------
and they can be destructive and they can


---------94:18----------
be


---------94:18----------
dangerous and you know like


---------94:22----------
uh new like new relationship energy is


---------94:26----------
something


---------94:26----------
i love because it makes me feel really


---------94:28----------
good


---------94:29----------
but i have to be very careful about like


---------94:32----------
you know


---------94:33----------
uh about like not hurting people along


---------94:36----------
the way when i go if i go and date and


---------94:38----------
flirt with someone new


---------94:39----------
like it's super exciting and fun and


---------94:41----------
like i get all


---------94:42----------
joyous and i jump around i have energy


---------94:44----------
i'm happy


---------94:45----------
and and i like that i like being happy


---------94:48----------
and i


---------94:48----------
want to continue chasing those feelings


---------94:51----------
um because i feel like they


---------94:52----------
make me the kind of person that can also


---------94:55----------
share that happiness with others


---------94:58----------
um which is something i


---------95:02----------
fundamentally like want to do is make


---------95:04----------
other people happy


---------95:05----------
and i think some of that boy brain


---------95:08----------
tangence


---------95:09----------
i mean some of that is definitely coming


---------95:11----------
from like


---------95:13----------
uh old feeling of like trying to find


---------95:15----------
worth in


---------95:17----------
uh a family that like


---------95:20----------
you know like like i wasn't i wasn't as


---------95:23----------
academically gifted as my older brother


---------95:25----------
for instance


---------95:25----------
and um you know so i found i found value


---------95:29----------
in like making puns


---------95:30----------
i've got a huge pun brain by the way i


---------95:32----------
don't i don't


---------95:33----------
i like don't i actually like suppress


---------95:37----------
my my punliness i'm really good at


---------95:39----------
making puns but don't do it


---------95:42----------
why is it sad because i think the best


---------95:45----------
part of what you have to offer the world


---------95:46----------
may be puns


---------95:48----------
if it's what your brain was made for


---------95:51----------
then give it to us dude


---------95:54----------
yeah sure but i mean there's


---------95:58----------
they're they're they're funnier jokes


---------96:01----------
and puns have a place in time and it


---------96:03----------
should not be used as a substitute for


---------96:05----------
conversation


---------96:06----------
in my opinion and some people like


---------96:10----------
instead of having a real conversation


---------96:12----------
kind of it was it was a behavior


---------96:14----------
for me that was distracted destructive


---------96:16----------
in the sense that like okay


---------96:19----------
instead of yeah anyway um


---------96:23----------
so i think i'm worth way more than my


---------96:26----------
puns dr


---------96:26----------
k um


---------96:31----------
but uh yeah so like i have the strive to


---------96:35----------
make people happy and


---------96:37----------
it is it does feel existentially


---------96:39----------
fulfilling when i have a stream and


---------96:40----------
i make people's day and you know they're


---------96:43----------
going through something and like


---------96:44----------
i can help them feel better like that is


---------96:47----------
why i turn on the camera


---------96:49----------
every time that i do that's why i'm like


---------96:51----------
driven to streaming


---------96:52----------
as much as i am it's like wanting to


---------96:54----------
heal heal people


---------96:56----------
and help them feel better


---------97:00----------
interesting okay so i mean i'm hearing


---------97:02----------
you kind of share my dichotomy


---------97:04----------
because you're kind of saying that like


---------97:05----------
you know flirtation and stuff


---------97:07----------
makes you feel good and i i don't know


---------97:09----------
if you quite said this but


---------97:11----------
that maybe that's not necessarily a


---------97:13----------
healthy thing to chase


---------97:16----------
do you have to be careful yeah you can't


---------97:18----------
just chase


---------97:19----------
happiness absolutely not yeah so i think


---------97:23----------
that's kind of the the struggle and i'm


---------97:24----------
just kind of thinking about the people


---------97:26----------
who are watching and like one of the


---------97:27----------
things that i really struggle with


---------97:30----------
you know when i work with our community


---------97:32----------
is like how do they know


---------97:34----------
which are the feelings to give into and


---------97:37----------
which are the ones


---------97:38----------
to overcome right which feelings do you


---------97:42----------
chase


---------97:43----------
and which feelings do you set aside like


---------97:45----------
how do you know like and we get to this


---------97:47----------
very like the best example i can think


---------97:48----------
of is quitting


---------97:50----------
how do you know when like quitting is


---------97:52----------
the right move and for you to say like


---------97:54----------
okay this actually isn't gonna work i


---------97:57----------
should drop out


---------97:58----------
of college or i'm i'm going for like i'm


---------98:02----------
trying to become a pro gamer and like


---------98:03----------
now it's time to quit


---------98:05----------
like it's enough yeah is enough


---------98:08----------
you know and when do you give in to that


---------98:10----------
sense of wanting to give up


---------98:12----------
and when do you say to yourself okay


---------98:14----------
even though i have these feelings


---------98:17----------
i'm not going to let them define me as a


---------98:19----------
person


---------98:21----------
because the really tricky thing and this


---------98:22----------
is the dichotomy that i run into is like


---------98:24----------
on the one hand i'm with you


---------98:26----------
right like but there isn't always a


---------98:29----------
clear answer there are some times where


---------98:31----------
letting your feelings and this kind of


---------98:32----------
goes back to your


---------98:35----------
you know something really rubbed me the


---------98:36----------
wrong way with the way that you defined


---------98:38----------
a furry which was something about


---------98:39----------
you know your identity is based on the


---------98:41----------
wish that your body had


---------98:43----------
animal attributes and


---------98:46----------
and i i don't know if i i i've missed


---------98:48----------
the first couple words of that


---------98:50----------
definition


---------98:50----------
but there's just something that feels


---------98:52----------
like scary to me about like having your


---------98:55----------
identity be defined by your wishes


---------98:58----------
like that just doesn't i feel like what


---------99:00----------
makes people human


---------99:02----------
is not what they wish for it's like what


---------99:04----------
they are


---------99:06----------
right right so like you know and and


---------99:07----------
maybe this just comes from medicine but


---------99:09----------
i'm specifically thinking about it


---------99:10----------
you know a kid with pediatric cancer and


---------99:13----------
like


---------99:14----------
boy there are a lot of wishes in the


---------99:15----------
room but that's not yeah


---------99:19----------
yeah and who they are is is


---------99:22----------
very different from what they wish for


---------99:26----------
and so i just kind of struggle with like


---------99:28----------
you know when do you let your feelings


---------99:29----------
determine who you


---------99:30----------
are like if you're an incel


---------99:34----------
you say like okay i feel like i'm


---------99:35----------
unlovable and so


---------99:37----------
that's who i i am an insult they claim


---------99:40----------
this identity based on feelings


---------99:43----------
and and that there's a part of me that


---------99:44----------
like understands where they're coming


---------99:46----------
from but there's a part of me that's


---------99:47----------
that just grates against me and even


---------99:49----------
when you talk about phrase i'm not


---------99:51----------
trying to be


---------99:52----------
not understanding or challenge them or


---------99:54----------
things like that


---------99:55----------
um but but there is just something that


---------99:57----------
like rubs me the wrong way from a yoga


---------99:59----------
perspective that even like describing


---------100:01----------
myself as a male


---------100:02----------
is a yogic mistake and


---------100:05----------
and describing myself as an anything is


---------100:08----------
a mistake because you are not


---------100:10----------
determined by


---------100:13----------
and sorry if i'm talking too much but


---------100:14----------
like i'll offer one last example


---------100:16----------
which is like i i sometimes think about


---------100:18----------
when i became a doctor


---------100:20----------
and it's not when i got an md after my


---------100:22----------
name


---------100:23----------
right like who you are is not determined


---------100:25----------
by how you


---------100:26----------
look or this is what i i sort of at the


---------100:28----------
end of the day this is what robs me the


---------100:30----------
wrong ways like i feel like who i am is


---------100:31----------
not determined by the fact that i have a


---------100:33----------
penis


---------100:34----------
or that i'm a doctor or that i'm indian


---------100:37----------
or that i'm a male


---------100:38----------
that my humanity actually transcends all


---------100:40----------
of those qualities


---------100:43----------
yeah i i would and i would agree with


---------100:46----------
that


---------100:46----------
i mean we are all individuals and in a


---------100:49----------
lot of ways labels


---------100:51----------
labels help us identity labels help us


---------100:53----------
understand each other in broad strokes


---------100:55----------
but ultimately to like know somebody you


---------100:58----------
have to


---------100:59----------
know them as a human outside of outside


---------101:02----------
of those


---------101:06----------
so any idea like if you had to give


---------101:08----------
people concrete advice people who are


---------101:10----------
thinking about


---------101:11----------
quitting because they feel a certain way


---------101:14----------
any thoughts about like what you would


---------101:16----------
tell them because you've struggled


---------101:18----------
a lot with like who you are and what


---------101:20----------
your feelings tell you


---------101:21----------
and it sounds like you've come to a


---------101:22----------
place of like peace and contentment and


---------101:25----------
tranquility around that


---------101:29----------
and sorry for coming on the spot but


---------101:30----------
does that make sense like because you've


---------101:31----------
walked


---------101:32----------
it does yeah well you're i mean you a


---------101:35----------
folk


---------101:36----------
you evoked quitting like esports


---------101:39----------
and and that kind of thing quitting in


---------101:41----------
competitive


---------101:43----------
i i in a lot of ways i would say that


---------101:51----------
quitting is difficult because i think


---------101:53----------
people subject themselves to a lot of


---------101:54----------
harm before


---------101:55----------
they decide that it's time to quit


---------101:57----------
because it's really hard to give up


---------101:59----------
on an investment that you've put


---------102:01----------
yourself into and admit


---------102:02----------
that something was was not healthy for


---------102:06----------
you


---------102:06----------
or is now not healthy for you um


---------102:10----------
and i think i think it's important to


---------102:14----------
um


---------102:17----------
appreciate appreciate the journey for


---------102:19----------
what it is and the path


---------102:21----------
and be proud of yourself for trying as


---------102:22----------
hard as as hard as you did


---------102:24----------
but uh i think


---------102:28----------
if you if it's time to quit


---------102:31----------
i feel like in a lot of ways you already


---------102:33----------
know that you just haven't


---------102:34----------
accepted it yet that like you've you've


---------102:37----------
been


---------102:39----------
feeling bad for a while and persisting


---------102:43----------
none persisting anyway and that


---------102:47----------
um


---------102:50----------
uh and if that isn't trans that isn't if


---------102:54----------
you're not if that's not changing into


---------102:55----------
something that's healthier for you


---------102:57----------
like like the thing you're looking for


---------102:59----------
the the wish that you're actually a pro


---------103:01----------
gamer the wish that you're on the team


---------103:03----------
um you you have two choices really and


---------103:06----------
it's to either like


---------103:07----------
how i see it anyway it's either to


---------103:08----------
double down and try harder


---------103:10----------
or to stop and


---------103:14----------
let it be and you know


---------103:18----------
try to find something else to do um


---------103:21----------
and so if you're on that precipice and


---------103:23----------
doubling down if that's not an option


---------103:25----------
you know i think that's the first that's


---------103:27----------
what people really look at is like can i


---------103:29----------
can i do better can i really


---------103:30----------
can i push myself harder um


---------103:33----------
but uh


---------103:37----------
yeah thanks for so much for that


---------103:40----------
perspective steph i really appreciate it


---------103:43----------
we kind of we've been kind of at this


---------103:44----------
for a little while how are you how are


---------103:46----------
you holding up


---------103:47----------
i'm pretty tired and you get more water


---------103:50----------
yeah do you want to


---------103:51----------
um should we go ahead and wrap up or you


---------103:53----------
want to try meditating or take


---------103:55----------
i'm kind of spent too to be honest i


---------103:57----------
think why don't we why don't we why


---------103:59----------
don't we wrap up


---------104:00----------
i mean if you'd have me on again i'd be


---------104:02----------
happy too


---------104:03----------
yeah i'm kind of curious actually a


---------104:04----------
little bit about we didn't really get


---------104:05----------
into like what


---------104:06----------
your you mentioned a little bit about


---------104:08----------
your brother and what your upbringing


---------104:09----------
was like and i'd i'd love to hear


---------104:11----------
more about that at some point um yeah


---------104:14----------
sure


---------104:15----------
you know forget about sort of the drama


---------104:18----------
and your gender identity and all that


---------104:19----------
kind of stuff which we kind of focused


---------104:21----------
on today and just


---------104:22----------
talk about like you irrespective of your


---------104:27----------
you know whether you're a furry or other


---------104:29----------
cancer


---------104:31----------
you know i don't really care about any


---------104:33----------
of that stuff


---------104:34----------
um yeah i'm i'm not another kin but


---------104:38----------
yeah um so so


---------104:41----------
how do you feel about meditation


---------104:44----------
i i like meditating okay i don't i i


---------104:48----------
don't often um i wish i did more but


---------104:51----------
um so there's a particular you said


---------104:54----------
you're going to go get you want to get


---------104:55----------
some water


---------104:56----------
yeah go get some water yeah can you get


---------104:59----------
something to eat as well


---------105:02----------
yeah sure okay yeah just get some small


---------105:04----------
amount of food to eat


---------105:05----------
and youtube to a chat we're gonna do a


---------105:08----------
meditation


---------105:13----------
yeah i mean you know so i i know that


---------105:17----------
i mean we i don't know how to say this


---------105:19----------
but like so


---------105:20----------
i think it's okay to disagree with staff


---------105:22----------
right like i disagree with stuff like i


---------105:24----------
mean the last 30 minutes has been


---------105:26----------
on some level me disagreeing with staff


---------105:31----------
i don't think i mean i would hope that


---------105:32----------
chad is so you know these are not


---------105:35----------
how can i say this the stream is not


---------105:37----------
about people being right and y'all being


---------105:39----------
wrong


---------105:42----------
right it's like it's not about you being


---------105:45----------
right and them being on it's about like


---------105:47----------
listening to someone else's perspective


---------105:48----------
and you're welcome to disagree with it


---------105:50----------
i'd encourage you to disagree with it


---------105:51----------
i'd encourage you to disagree with us


---------105:54----------
and that's okay like it's just about


---------105:55----------
hearing another person's perspective


---------106:02----------
yeah so that if steph i was trying to oh


---------106:05----------
she can't hear yet um


---------106:08----------
yeah i mean so then like this is the


---------106:10----------
kind of sorry stuff i was interacting


---------106:12----------
with chat for a moment


---------106:13----------
and i was trying to get a sense of like


---------106:15----------
what chat has been like and it seems


---------106:16----------
like i mean i've been glancing over from


---------106:18----------
time times pretty okay to me


---------106:20----------
but apparently that some people are are


---------106:23----------
you know being a little bit toxic


---------106:24----------
towards you which i guess is not


---------106:27----------
unexpected as


---------106:28----------
you come to expect and at the same time


---------106:31----------
i'm just really curious about like


---------106:33----------
why they have to treat like i'm just


---------106:35----------
curious like what about


---------106:37----------
you know it goes back to your succulents


---------106:39----------
like what what is it about you that they


---------106:41----------
have to


---------106:42----------
hate and attack like why do they care so


---------106:44----------
much


---------106:45----------
to come and spew you know i i just don't


---------106:49----------
understand like i genuinely do not


---------106:50----------
understand it


---------106:52----------
like what you know why not do something


---------106:54----------
more productive with their day


---------106:56----------
then come here and try to talk trash


---------107:00----------
um i'm not


---------107:03----------
it's not a rhetorical question i don't


---------107:06----------
have any questions like what do


---------107:07----------
what do people gain right so they're


---------107:09----------
chasing a feeling too


---------107:11----------
or they're chasing an identity and a


---------107:13----------
feeling that comes from attacking you in


---------107:15----------
some way


---------107:16----------
it's like what is that are they like


---------107:19----------
making the world a better place


---------107:20----------
by calling someone trash and


---------107:24----------
twitch chat like are they solving the


---------107:25----------
world's problems and standing up for


---------107:28----------
injustice


---------107:30----------
um yeah that's that's not my question to


---------107:33----------
answer


---------107:34----------
yeah i i really don't but steph i think


---------107:36----------
honestly part of the problem with


---------107:38----------
the way that we treat the internet is


---------107:39----------
that we don't actually talk to the


---------107:40----------
people who are toxic


---------107:42----------
which i know is a really dangerous game


---------107:44----------
but it's something that i'm


---------107:46----------
i hope to do more of how do you feel


---------107:48----------
about that i do i've i mean i've talked


---------107:50----------
to a lot of my harassers to try to


---------107:52----------
understand them


---------107:53----------
yeah they have how's that sound


---------107:56----------
not well i suggest


---------108:00----------
usually well oh really cool can yeah


---------108:03----------
most i mean most people that have a


---------108:05----------
dialogue with me


---------108:07----------
um feel better about me by the end of


---------108:10----------
the dialogue


---------108:10----------
as i don't have enough there's not


---------108:12----------
enough stuff to go around


---------108:15----------
um and uh


---------108:19----------
uh usually people think a lot of


---------108:23----------
very very prominent thought is that i


---------108:25----------
have mental illness


---------108:27----------
and i'm invalid as a human that should


---------108:30----------
like


---------108:31----------
exist and speak and have my my


---------108:33----------
perspectives are in some way like


---------108:35----------
dangerous toxic and like i should be


---------108:38----------
quarantined away


---------108:39----------
and that's that's why a lot of them want


---------108:42----------
to hurt me


---------108:44----------
um others are on the bandwagon want


---------108:46----------
someone to bully


---------108:48----------
i am a valid target for bullying


---------108:51----------
in their brain and uh they get some


---------108:54----------
enjoyment out of that they don't know


---------108:55----------
who it's okay to be mean to


---------108:57----------
so when they find someone when it's like


---------109:00----------
they have the target


---------109:02----------
they're like okay with it


---------109:06----------
i guess you're contagious your


---------109:10----------
transgenderism is contagious is that


---------109:13----------
what they're afraid of


---------109:14----------
i don't think it's that but maybe maybe


---------109:17----------
partially


---------109:18----------
my whole it's like it's like because


---------109:21----------
it's just like this


---------109:22----------
right so when people use it yeah


---------109:23----------
quarantined i think of the word


---------109:24----------
contagious


---------109:26----------
yeah maybe it's just like my radical


---------109:28----------
self-acceptance


---------109:29----------
is super dangerous and like my


---------109:32----------
acceptance of other people is


---------109:34----------
dangerous and i i don't like


---------109:37----------
it's kind of unfair to like have me


---------109:41----------
be the one who


---------109:45----------
answers for my trolls yeah i can only


---------109:48----------
kind of say what


---------109:50----------
i kind of see but they're all


---------109:51----------
individuals that have their own personal


---------109:54----------
reasons and when i paint them in broad


---------109:55----------
strokes they just get more angry


---------109:57----------
it's unfair it's unfair to ask you to do


---------109:59----------
that


---------110:00----------
yeah yeah okay so let's talk about


---------110:02----------
meditation


---------110:04----------
so you grab something to nibble on i


---------110:07----------
have a nibble


---------110:08----------
okay awesome so i want you to yeah oh go


---------110:11----------
and open it up


---------110:15----------
and twitch chat you guys grab something


---------110:16----------
as well


---------110:19----------
we're gonna have a zen moment with


---------110:21----------
twitch chat and everyone i like this


---------110:23----------
zen i don't not twitch chat come on


---------110:25----------
stuff


---------110:27----------
i i want to forget if i'm projecting


---------110:29----------
we're gonna


---------110:30----------
we're gonna see if we can get by the


---------110:32----------
next couple of minutes without


---------110:34----------
you know creating a dank meme that's the


---------110:36----------
best we can hope for


---------110:38----------
the sad moment happens it happens but


---------110:40----------
okay so i want you to sit up straight


---------110:42----------
at some some somewhere in twitch chat


---------110:44----------
people are having a set moment with us


---------110:46----------
there's always that is represented too


---------110:49----------
so sit up straight and go and close your


---------110:51----------
eyes


---------110:53----------
and feel the person that you are


---------111:02----------
just try to i know this is going to


---------111:04----------
sound weird


---------111:06----------
but how do you know


---------111:09----------
you exist you don't have to answer


---------111:15----------
and try to figure out like what is it


---------111:17----------
that lets you know


---------111:19----------
that you exist


---------111:27----------
and so that starts with sort of the


---------111:29----------
sense of


---------111:31----------
you yeah go ahead


---------111:42----------
so just feel the person that you are


---------111:44----------
there's something there that is doing


---------111:46----------
some kind of experiencing right you may


---------111:47----------
feel your body


---------111:49----------
a lot of times people can feel their


---------111:51----------
breath


---------111:53----------
you may notice your thoughts


---------112:05----------
so somewhere in there is you


---------112:12----------
and sometimes people have a perception


---------112:15----------
that


---------112:16----------
what they are is to be shamed


---------112:20----------
or to be proud of


---------112:24----------
but i encourage you if you feel anything


---------112:26----------
either positive or negative just notice


---------112:28----------
that that is a feeling


---------112:32----------
it is an emotion that goes across


---------112:36----------
the screen of yourself


---------112:41----------
that feelings fluctuate with time


---------112:45----------
and at the end of the day no matter what


---------112:47----------
the feeling itself is or the thought is


---------112:50----------
that there is an experiencer of those


---------112:52----------
thoughts and feelings


---------112:54----------
there's a backdrop under which thoughts


---------112:57----------
and feelings exist


---------113:04----------
now try to get a sense of the person who


---------113:07----------
experiences the feelings


---------113:11----------
are you the feelings or are you the


---------113:13----------
experiencer of feelings


---------113:19----------
and are your thoughts you or are your


---------113:22----------
thoughts


---------113:22----------
thought by


---------113:28----------
try to just get a sense of like sit with


---------113:30----------
the person that you are for a moment


---------113:45----------
now i want you to think about the ways


---------113:47----------
in which you identify yourself


---------113:51----------
whether it be gender or job


---------113:55----------
or location or name


---------113:59----------
gamer troll


---------114:04----------
genius


---------114:07----------
kind compassionate


---------114:11----------
good person


---------114:16----------
or shame worthless


---------114:24----------
a ball of envy


---------114:27----------
a ball of fantasy hope


---------114:31----------
longing wishing


---------114:34----------
that you are something else


---------114:37----------
whatever it may be


---------114:41----------
pride accomplishment


---------114:45----------
however you think of yourself


---------114:51----------
and now take a bite of your nibble


---------115:01----------
and then ask yourself who is it that's


---------115:04----------
doing the


---------115:05----------
tasting as you taste this thing


---------115:10----------
is this person accomplished are they


---------115:12----------
shameful


---------115:14----------
are they a man are they a woman


---------115:18----------
are they a streamer


---------115:23----------
what is this person then tunnel down


---------115:26----------
into this


---------115:27----------
experience precisely where is the gender


---------115:31----------
in this


---------115:37----------
where is the accomplishment where is the


---------115:39----------
shame those things may exist


---------115:42----------
somewhere within you but in this moment


---------115:46----------
you're just someone is eating


---------115:51----------
and focus on the taste that is left in


---------115:53----------
your mouth


---------115:54----------
maybe the sensations of little crumbs or


---------115:57----------
whatever there may be


---------116:02----------
and try to ask yourself where is the


---------116:04----------
gender here


---------116:08----------
where is the joy where is the happiness


---------116:10----------
where is the hatred where is the shame


---------116:12----------
where is the gamer


---------116:16----------
what is this person


---------116:22----------
and as best as you can notice that


---------116:24----------
underneath all of these qualities


---------116:28----------
whether it be age or name


---------116:32----------
or a sense of bank account or


---------116:34----------
accomplishment or lack of accomplishment


---------116:36----------
there's just


---------116:37----------
you


---------116:41----------
that there may be some things that


---------116:43----------
fluctuate within you but at the end of


---------116:45----------
the day there's


---------116:46----------
just you on a good day


---------116:49----------
on a bad day yesterday today tomorrow


---------117:01----------
and take solace in who you are whether


---------117:04----------
what's on the inside is good or bad


---------117:06----------
because that changes are days that you


---------117:10----------
can forget


---------117:11----------
and days that you remember strongly


---------117:15----------
but if that's true then neither of those


---------117:17----------
things can truly be you it can feel like


---------117:19----------
you


---------117:20----------
you can be one with infused with what's


---------117:23----------
on the inside


---------117:29----------
but at the end of the day you are just


---------117:30----------
you


---------117:34----------
that you may have feelings you may have


---------117:36----------
desires


---------117:38----------
you may have questions you may have


---------117:39----------
confusion


---------117:42----------
but that you are what you are and


---------117:44----------
there's actually nothing wrong with you


---------117:47----------
even if there's unhappiness that


---------117:49----------
unhappiness can just be a shade of who


---------117:51----------
you are


---------117:55----------
and there's nothing right you are what


---------117:58----------
you


---------118:04----------
are


---------118:10----------
and when you're ready let steph come


---------118:13----------
back


---------118:16----------
allow her back in advocate


---------118:20----------
champion


---------118:24----------
villain


---------118:30----------
all of those things that's that


---------118:35----------
right and so be it like step is a cool


---------118:37----------
person it doesn't have to be you


---------118:43----------
and no matter what you feel or how


---------118:46----------
people treat you theft


---------118:47----------
no one can take what you are away from


---------118:50----------
you


---------118:51----------
they can just make you feel a certain


---------118:52----------
way but they can't take you away from


---------119:00----------
you


---------119:04----------
sorry did you say something i i didn't


---------119:08----------
oh what's up i said thank you oh you're


---------119:10----------
welcome


---------119:12----------
how do you feel what was that like does


---------119:13----------
that make sense i can never tell


---------119:16----------
because i can't actually read your mind


---------119:19----------
yeah


---------119:19----------
no it made sense it was it was nice it


---------119:22----------
was good to take it


---------119:22----------
take a moment to kind of deconstruct


---------119:26----------
uh existence and experience


---------119:29----------
i a good way to put it we are


---------119:32----------
we are a lot of things i am i am a lot


---------119:36----------
of brain


---------119:37----------
i am not just my taste buds but i can be


---------119:41----------
just my taste buds they're in the right


---------119:44----------
in in the right mind state so


---------119:48----------
yeah so oddly enough if i can give you a


---------119:50----------
direction


---------119:52----------
is that okay so i'd encourage you to


---------119:55----------
you know you can do this practice or


---------119:57----------
breathing practices or whatever


---------119:58----------
and when you say i'm a lot of things


---------120:02----------
i would really check because i think


---------120:06----------
that is the statement that i disagree


---------120:08----------
with the most and this is the one i'm


---------120:10----------
confident about


---------120:12----------
that you are none of those things


---------120:16----------
staff may be a lot of things but you are


---------120:19----------
none of those things


---------120:21----------
and so see which of those things you


---------120:23----------
actually are


---------120:30----------
yeah i know it doesn't make sense don't


---------120:31----------
worry about it


---------120:35----------
yeah my microphone doesn't it seems to


---------120:37----------
not want to work as well all of a sudden


---------120:40----------
i'll lean in maybe it's because we've


---------120:42----------
gotten we've gotten all quiet


---------120:43----------
yeah well thanks a lot for coming on


---------120:48----------
i i this was i didn't know you know what


---------120:50----------
people were expecting or what you were


---------120:52----------
expecting


---------120:53----------

---------120:56----------

---------120:58----------
