---------00:00----------
I can be as I could train or study as


---------00:02----------
much as I want to and like what do I


---------00:03----------
know about your life like I don't know


---------00:05----------
anything about your life right but I had


---------00:07----------
a question about how to keep the


---------00:08----------
relationship flame going I mean I so I


---------00:12----------
think that people need to understand


---------00:13----------
that you don't have to have like a


---------00:14----------
particular problem to go to therapy


---------00:16----------
he can get there and you can to that I


---------00:19----------
think is a very important lesson right


---------00:20----------
that's the final boss when the final


---------00:22----------
boss shows up you don't just like say oh


---------00:24----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] this I'm done with that so


---------00:27----------
that's [ __ ] twitches problem right is


---------00:30----------
that like half y'all or giver uppers


---------00:32----------
this is the other thing is that a lot of


---------00:34----------
people live their life based on the


---------00:37----------
imagined emotions of other people but


---------00:40----------
sometimes I feel I can do everything and


---------00:42----------
someday soon I feel I can't because I


---------00:43----------
have a fear of failure how do I deal


---------00:45----------
with this right it's just not meditation


---------00:48----------
to remove yourself from the negative


---------00:51----------
it's meditation to remove yourself from


---------00:54----------
the positive too


---------00:58----------
uh what about listening to music while


---------01:00----------
doing intent doing brain intensive work


---------01:03----------
like studying coding algorithm questions


---------01:05----------
I like to listen to techno while doing


---------01:07----------
coding practice but recently I've


---------01:08----------
started to experiment with not listening


---------01:10----------
to music to see if it will help me focus


---------01:12----------
better so I think here's the thing so oh


---------01:15----------
wow thank you for the the gifted subs


---------01:16----------
confused monkey and keep our scam train


---------01:18----------
going guys so I think the key thing so


---------01:25----------
this person saying like I listen to


---------01:26----------
techno while I'm doing coding practice


---------01:28----------
but recently I've started to experiment


---------01:29----------
with not listening to music to see if it


---------01:33----------
will help me focus better what do you


---------01:35----------
think um so I think the more most


---------01:37----------
important thing is that you experiment


---------01:39----------
right like the it's not about what I


---------01:41----------
think is right or wrong so like you guys


---------01:43----------
have to understand this okay so people


---------01:45----------
come to the stream and they think that


---------01:47----------
this is about expertise right but it's


---------01:50----------
not like I can be as I could train or


---------01:53----------
study as much as I want to and like what


---------01:54----------
do I know about your life like I don't


---------01:55----------
know anything about your life right not


---------01:58----------
true um when it really comes down to it


---------02:01----------
it's like you guys should experiment


---------02:02----------
with the stuff that I do like don't take


---------02:04----------
what I say is gospel like this isn't


---------02:06----------
that's not what we're trying to do here


---------02:07----------
like the goal is to give you guys


---------02:09----------
options for you to experiment and then


---------02:12----------
like figure out what works for you so


---------02:15----------
I'm the same way sometimes I like to


---------02:17----------
work while doing music I tend to work


---------02:19----------
really well in some ways some kinds of


---------02:22----------
cognitive activity I think go well with


---------02:23----------
music other kinds of cognitive activity


---------02:25----------
I like silence or I work best in silence


---------02:28----------
and so you know I think you should


---------02:32----------
experiment for yourself like so when I'm


---------02:34----------
writing some kinds of stuff I like music


---------02:36----------
or I like silence when I'm doing other


---------02:38----------
kinds of work like if I'm building a


---------02:39----------
to-do list I like to do it in silence I


---------02:41----------
listen to something upbeat if I'm


---------02:43----------
feeling low and especially if I'm gonna


---------02:46----------
do something like stream or teach so


---------02:48----------
when I put on like a stage presence


---------02:50----------
and when I sort of need to be in the


---------02:53----------
zone I'll like listen to some kind of


---------02:54----------
upbeat music I have like a playlist of


---------02:56----------
like stuff like das mala Fitz


---------03:00----------
and it sort of depends so I think kind


---------03:03----------
of figure out what works for you


---------03:07----------
question for doctor came yeah now the


---------03:10----------
disclaimers over y'all can y'all can


---------03:13----------
just ahead how high my doctor came my


---------03:18----------
name is Sabina


---------03:18----------
hello Sabina I live in Europe so I watch


---------03:21----------
your streams after they are done airing


---------03:22----------
cuz sleep good for you but I had a


---------03:24----------
question about how to keep the


---------03:25----------
relationship flame going okay I moved to


---------03:29----------
Germany for my girlfriend and we are


---------03:31----------
together now for six months and it's


---------03:33----------
just perfect respect trust time to


---------03:35----------
ourselves going on dates being able to


---------03:37----------
chill together at the moment I feel like


---------03:39----------
I have the perfect relationship we want


---------03:41----------
to move in together after she is done


---------03:42----------
with school the summer do you have any


---------03:44----------
tips on how to keep a relationship


---------03:45----------
really good after moving in or generally


---------03:48----------
after being together for long I watch


---------03:50----------
all of your streams so if you include


---------03:51----------
the question I would be very grateful


---------03:52----------
thanks for helping me procrastinate less


---------03:55----------
by the way really helped okay so first


---------03:57----------
thing is I don't know if this question


---------03:59----------
applies to many other people who are


---------04:00----------
watching right so like how do you keep a


---------04:04----------
relationship good or keep it going is


---------04:07----------
probably going to be confusing for most


---------04:09----------
of the people who are watching so and


---------04:13----------
yeah sorry I can't help myself so you


---------04:15----------
guys know I love y'all right and I


---------04:17----------
actually do respect you and I know many


---------04:18----------
of you guys are in relationships but


---------04:20----------
let's be clear like I'm envisioning so


---------04:22----------
just so you guys know in my mind when I


---------04:25----------
picture my viewer I picture myself at


---------04:28----------
the age of 19 like that's who I'm


---------04:30----------
talking to and at that point if you guys


---------04:32----------
want to hear a super cringe story I'll


---------04:34----------
tell you guys the most cringe thing that


---------04:37----------
I've ever done in terms of asking a girl


---------04:39----------
out or actually not even asking a girl


---------04:40----------
out I'll tell you guys on Valentine's


---------04:42----------
Day so remind me to tell the story most


---------04:44----------
mortifying thing I still get emotional


---------04:47----------
about it when I think about it so let's


---------04:51----------
say answer this question though so okay


---------04:54----------
so how do you keep things good in a


---------04:56----------
relationship so the first thing to


---------04:58----------
understand is that you know I'd be


---------04:59----------
really curious how old this person is


---------05:01----------
but the thing to remember is that like


---------05:04----------
relationships are gonna change over time


---------05:06----------
and people are gonna change over time so


---------05:08----------
if you're trying to preserve what you


---------05:10----------
have now that's not going to work the


---------05:13----------
first thing to understand right so


---------05:14----------
people are gonna change people are gonna


---------05:16----------
grow so it sounds like you're dating a


---------05:17----------
student right now and that person soon


---------05:19----------
may not be a student so their life is


---------05:21----------
gonna change their pressures are gonna


---------05:22----------
change their stress is gonna change


---------05:24----------
they're gonna be exposed to different


---------05:25----------
people so I think the best way to keep a


---------05:27----------
healthy relationship is to understand


---------05:30----------
what's happening in your relationship


---------05:31----------
and also not try to hold on to it so


---------05:35----------
don't try to hold on to a particular


---------05:36----------
thing because understand that people are


---------05:38----------
going to change over time and that your


---------05:40----------
relationship is going to change over


---------05:42----------
time and that you have to like kind of


---------05:43----------
roll with the punches so as as your as


---------05:46----------
demands on each of y'all changes you


---------05:48----------
guys grow as people like be really


---------05:50----------
proactive about it


---------05:51----------
because I think what the the reason that


---------05:53----------
relationships fail over time is because


---------05:56----------
people are growing and changing without


---------05:58----------
actually talking about it or realizing


---------06:01----------
it and then like five years down the


---------06:02----------
road you're like in this situation where


---------06:04----------
you've been engaged for three years and


---------06:06----------
neither of y'all is really sure if you


---------06:07----------
want to get married but you have so much


---------06:09----------
momentum you just kind of stay in the


---------06:10----------
relationship he's saying the


---------06:12----------
relationship out of momentum instead of


---------06:14----------
like growing together and then over time


---------06:17----------
you start to resent each other because


---------06:20----------
you're not the person that they used to


---------06:21----------
be they're not you're not the person


---------06:23----------
that you used to be they're not the


---------06:24----------
person they used to be and that's okay


---------06:26----------
it's just the more you guys are aware of


---------06:28----------
how you guys change and like if you


---------06:30----------
share that with your partner they can


---------06:32----------
kind of you guys can like work through


---------06:33----------
it you don't end up in as a situation


---------06:35----------
where you're like 40 married with a


---------06:36----------
couple of kids and one he wakes up one


---------06:38----------
day and it's like I want an open


---------06:39----------
relationship because I want to sleep


---------06:42----------
with other people like that's just if


---------06:44----------
you get to that point without all of the


---------06:46----------
discussion that's happened then just


---------06:50----------
understand that like you're kind of like


---------06:52----------
it's gonna be really tough at that point


---------06:54----------
right so most people wait until


---------06:56----------
relationships are on the verge of like


---------06:59----------
having real problems before trying to go


---------07:02----------
to marriage counseling or things like


---------07:03----------
that which sort of make sense but I


---------07:05----------
think you should be really proactive


---------07:06----------
about understanding how your how your


---------07:10----------
relationship is evolving and as long as


---------07:13----------
you continue to have conversations like


---------07:15----------
every six months or every year about


---------07:16----------
okay where are you going where am I


---------07:18----------
going where are we going what's working


---------07:20----------
for us what isn't do I need to make


---------07:22----------
certain sacrifices for you do you need


---------07:23----------
to make certain sacrifices for me so


---------07:25----------
like I had those thankfully


---------07:26----------
those conversations with my wife sort of


---------07:28----------
automatically because after I finished


---------07:30----------
college she was still in Austin and I


---------07:32----------
had the opportunity to like move to


---------07:33----------
Boston to do research and so we kind of


---------07:36----------
talked about what that meant for us and


---------07:37----------
like whether she was gonna come or


---------07:38----------
whether we gonna try a long-distance and


---------07:40----------
then she eventually moved to New York


---------07:42----------
because her her company got acquired and


---------07:44----------
then we were kind of like long-distance


---------07:45----------
in Boston New York and then like that


---------07:46----------
was another conversation like when are


---------07:48----------
you gonna move when are you not gonna


---------07:49----------
move like do we want to be together how


---------07:52----------
long do we want to do this and then she


---------07:54----------
was basically like I'll move if you put


---------07:55----------
a ring on it and I was like okay so then


---------07:57----------
it was kind of up to me and so I put a


---------08:01----------
ring on it


---------08:01----------
and then she moved and we're at not


---------08:05----------
really that happily-ever-after part but


---------08:07----------
we're pretty happy right now so okay


---------08:11----------
okay so I think it's reasonable right so


---------08:20----------
if you have demands and things that you


---------08:22----------
want in a relationship you should share


---------08:23----------
them with someone demands doesn't sound


---------08:26----------
right but okay so so how do I know if I


---------08:31----------
should seek therapy for a specific


---------08:33----------
problem


---------08:33----------
I just turned 24 and I haven't had a


---------08:35----------
girlfriend I've been with girls but I


---------08:37----------
just can't seem to be able to build a


---------08:38----------
relationship what do you think reckful I


---------08:41----------
got this okay so I really critically


---------08:46----------
thinking that answer I just spit out was


---------08:47----------
Jim spit out dude


---------08:50----------
okay so the nice thing about therapy is


---------08:54----------
you you'll have all these thoughts going


---------08:55----------
through your head back and forth of like


---------08:57----------
am i doing the right thing here am i


---------08:58----------
doing the right thing here maybe this is


---------09:00----------
bad maybe that's bad but then you'll


---------09:02----------
just say all your thoughts and then the


---------09:03----------
therapist old would kind of lead you in


---------09:05----------
a healthy direction maybe give you a few


---------09:06----------
options still but this is the healthier


---------09:08----------
one so you could cut out the ones that


---------09:09----------
aren't healthy so it's like you're


---------09:11----------
playing Who Wants to Be a Millionaire


---------09:11----------
there's ABCD I just thought of this


---------09:13----------
analogy and then you do the 50/50 thing


---------09:14----------
the therapist gives you the 50/50 thing


---------09:16----------
instead of you picking four four options


---------09:17----------
and then it's your whole life seem a lot


---------09:19----------
simpler so it sounds like you think this


---------09:22----------
person should go to therapy for this


---------09:25----------
yeah yeah I agree so first of all


---------09:29----------
reckful beautifully beautiful analogy


---------09:31----------
there and I mean I so I think that


---------09:36----------
people need to understand that you don't


---------09:37----------
have to have like a particular problem


---------09:39----------
to


---------09:40----------
go to therapy because part of what


---------09:41----------
therapy is about is like reckful said


---------09:43----------
helping you narrow down like what the


---------09:45----------
issues are right so if you're 24 and you


---------09:47----------
don't have a girlfriend is it because


---------09:48----------
you just have had bad locker because you


---------09:50----------
don't leave the house or because you're


---------09:52----------
like so it sounds like you've been with


---------09:54----------
girls and so you date but you may have


---------09:55----------
some other kinds of psychological issues


---------09:58----------
kind of going on that prevent you from


---------10:00----------
going getting into a relationship and


---------10:02----------
also like it could just be that you just


---------10:03----------
haven't met someone that you think is


---------10:05----------
worth having a relationship with right


---------10:07----------
so I think going to therapy is like a


---------10:09----------
great idea if you're if there's some if


---------10:11----------
there's some place in your life where do


---------10:13----------
you feel stuck and you're not quite sure


---------10:14----------
why or how to move forward I think


---------10:17----------
therapy is a great option so I mean I I


---------10:23----------
understand what you all mean so I think


---------10:24----------
the question is would it have been more


---------10:26----------
productive if he was not on psilocybin


---------10:28----------
so first of all we don't know what he


---------10:29----------
was on or what he wasn't done right so


---------10:31----------
let's just be clear about that that we


---------10:32----------
perceived something and we can have a


---------10:34----------
hypothesis and we can have a pretty good


---------10:36----------
a high likelihood of I don't know how to


---------10:41----------
do that okay anyway I don't know how to


---------10:46----------
do that but so so we can have a


---------10:49----------
hypothesis but then the other thing that


---------10:51----------
I want to share with you guys is like so


---------10:53----------
be patient right with yourselves and and


---------10:56----------
with him and that we take we take people


---------10:59----------
like the way that they are on stream and


---------11:00----------
that can mean happy that can mean sad


---------11:02----------
that can mean what I mean unless it


---------11:04----------
becomes like a really problematic but I


---------11:07----------
I think the other thing that was so I


---------11:08----------
here's so you could say like I could


---------11:11----------
have gotten upset right I could have


---------11:12----------
said oh like like he's [ __ ] high like


---------11:14----------
it's this is a waste of time he keeps on


---------11:16----------
getting distracted that's really easy to


---------11:18----------
do and there's a good reason you could


---------11:19----------
do that you could sort of say like hey


---------11:21----------
if you're not gonna take this seriously


---------11:22----------
like whatever you could do all of that


---------11:24----------
stuff but I don't think that's what


---------11:26----------
we're here for right we're here because


---------11:28----------
sometimes people show up and they're not


---------11:30----------
on their a-game and when they're not on


---------11:32----------
their a-game or he may think he's on his


---------11:34----------
a game I don't know so you guys decide


---------11:36----------
what what's a game and what isn't but


---------11:39----------
like that's how you aren't like


---------11:41----------
sometimes you're not on your a game and


---------11:43----------
like you should cut yourself some slack


---------11:44----------
and like don't give up on yourself or


---------11:46----------
don't give up on someone else for not


---------11:48----------
showing their aching


---------11:50----------
you take people where they are you meet


---------11:53----------
people where they are that's where you


---------11:55----------
start you don't expect them to be what


---------11:56----------
they are not right that's not like help


---------12:00----------
is not conditional based upon someone


---------12:05----------
being where you want them to be or


---------12:07----------
someone being where they should be like


---------12:10----------
you meet people where they are that's


---------12:11----------
the only way that change happens so do I


---------12:14----------
think it's productive absolutely so I


---------12:16----------
think like we learned an important


---------12:18----------
lesson today right which now I'm gonna


---------12:21----------
sound arrogant but I hope you guys


---------12:23----------
everyone who's judging him for being the


---------12:25----------
way that he was that you can be


---------12:26----------
productive if you stick with it that you


---------12:29----------
should not give up because I think that


---------12:32----------
everyone would have been fine if I said


---------12:34----------
if I cut off the interview after 15


---------12:35----------
minutes I said hey this is just not


---------12:37----------
working like everyone would have been


---------12:38----------
fine with that right so like put like be


---------12:44----------
patient


---------12:45----------
it's not about perseverance it's not


---------12:47----------
necessarily about never giving up


---------12:48----------
because I think you know at some point


---------12:50----------
things are futile but be patient be


---------12:53----------
patient with people be patient with


---------12:54----------
yourselves most of all and like


---------12:57----------
understand coz what do you guys do like


---------12:59----------
when you don't show up with your a-game


---------13:01----------
for yourself in your own life how do you


---------13:03----------
treat yourself you cheat yourself


---------13:04----------
terribly you give up on yourself so


---------13:06----------
easily you beat the crap out of yourself


---------13:08----------
you're lazy you're stupid you're


---------13:10----------
undisciplined not stupid because you


---------13:12----------
guys think you're smart right you're


---------13:14----------
lazy so don't do that don't give up on


---------13:17----------
yourself it can be productive be patient


---------13:21----------
give yourself a chance and despite any


---------13:24----------
amount of like stuff that's floating


---------13:25----------
around in your brain like you can


---------13:28----------
actually find a productive something at


---------13:30----------
the end of it if you just stick it


---------13:31----------
through so I mean I think another


---------13:38----------
version of this question is that like do


---------13:40----------
I think the session would have been


---------13:41----------
different or arguably more productive


---------13:43----------
absolutely right so if someone's not


---------13:45----------
distracted but like dealing with


---------13:47----------
distraction is like actually really


---------13:48----------
important so on the other hand like just


---------13:50----------
the fact that you can I mean despite


---------13:53----------
everything that was stacked against us


---------13:55----------
in terms of emotions ADHD a dude doing


---------13:59----------
[ __ ] construction he can get there


---------14:01----------
and you can too that I think is a very


---------14:03----------
important less


---------14:04----------
right that's the final boss when the


---------14:06----------
final boss shows up you don't just like


---------14:07----------
say oh [ __ ] [ __ ] this I'm done when the


---------14:10----------
final boss shows up you [ __ ] you


---------14:12----------
level up and you rise to the challenge


---------14:14----------
and whether it be construction or


---------14:16----------
psilocybin or emotions or trauma or


---------14:18----------
whatever the [ __ ] it is you do what you


---------14:19----------
showed up to do


---------14:22----------
that's what you got to do so don't


---------14:25----------
[ __ ] give up okay how do you grow up


---------14:34----------
from being emotionally neglected for a


---------14:37----------
long time so I think you it takes time


---------14:42----------
so the first thing is yes so someone


---------14:47----------
saying i'ma give up er yeah like that so


---------14:50----------
that's [ __ ] twitches problem right is


---------14:53----------
that like half y'all or giver uppers and


---------14:55----------
when I say half of y'all what I'm


---------14:57----------
thinking of once again is my 19 year old


---------14:59----------
self I was definitely give up er like I


---------15:02----------
was a giver-upper and be patient with


---------15:04----------
yourself because it took me eight years


---------15:06----------
from being on academic probation to


---------15:08----------
starting med school like eight years


---------15:11----------
eight years is a long-ass time like long


---------15:15----------
long long time and starting med school


---------15:18----------
by the way was ten years ago


---------15:20----------
so starting med school is eight years


---------15:22----------
after being a giver-upper


---------15:23----------
and then it takes another decade to get


---------15:26----------
to where I am today 18 years of my life


---------15:29----------
have been spent on this journey so don't


---------15:32----------
judge yourself for [ __ ] around for


---------15:33----------
two or three like two or three is


---------15:38----------
nothing man give yourself time stick it


---------15:41----------
through to the end so how do you grow up


---------15:45----------
from being emotionally neglected for a


---------15:47----------
long time so I think it happened slowly


---------15:50----------
okay and I think that unfortunately like


---------15:56----------
you can't fix all of the emotional


---------15:58----------
neglect yourself I think what you can


---------16:01----------
fix is like if you have so emotional


---------16:04----------
neglect is going to result in certain


---------16:06----------
patterns that affect your current


---------16:07----------
relationships the real solution is to


---------16:10----------
not be emotionally neglected right to


---------16:12----------
engage in relationships there's no


---------16:14----------
substitute for love so if you weren't


---------16:16----------
like appropriately loved what


---------16:18----------
you were growing up like you can't just


---------16:19----------
be a pillar by yourself like human


---------16:21----------
beings need love so you have to engage


---------16:24----------
in a relationship where you like a


---------16:26----------
healthy relation to be romantic but it


---------16:28----------
can be like with a mentor or a friend or


---------16:30----------
even like you can adopt or have a kid or


---------16:32----------
whatever like you can there are all


---------16:34----------
kinds of healthy relationships through


---------16:35----------
which you can undo emotional neglect the


---------16:39----------
real challenge is that as a result of


---------16:42----------
that emotional neglect you are going to


---------16:44----------
exhibit certain behaviors and have


---------16:46----------
certain cognitive biases that are gonna


---------16:49----------
make it hard for you to successfully


---------16:51----------
engage in a healthy relationship so your


---------16:55----------
job is to understand yourself go to


---------16:59----------
therapy learn to meditate do some yoga


---------17:01----------
do all of the above and notice those


---------17:04----------
patterns notice the way that you solve


---------17:06----------
sabotage because when you're emotionally


---------17:08----------
neglected you're going to sabotage


---------17:10----------
relationships not all the time but like


---------17:13----------
that's what happens for a lot of people


---------17:14----------
and then that's really the problem so


---------17:17----------
once you stop the self-sabotage then the


---------17:19----------
relationships will naturally grow


---------17:20----------
because generally speaking I don't care


---------17:21----------
what you think about yourself like most


---------17:23----------
human beings are actually pretty cool


---------17:25----------
like I don't know if you all realize


---------17:27----------
this but like most people are actually


---------17:28----------
pretty cool and like all you have to do


---------17:30----------
is like hang out with someone to sort of


---------17:31----------
realize that most people are pretty cool


---------17:32----------
and so if you just give yourself some


---------17:36----------
time and some space like it'll work out


---------17:38----------
well so really work on those behaviors


---------17:44----------
and how your emotions influence the


---------17:46----------
things that you do


---------17:51----------
okay


---------18:10----------
okay so I hate to hurt people how do you


---------18:13----------
break up with someone you genuinely care


---------18:15----------
for and you're the reason they get hurt


---------18:17----------
I hate to hurt people I love how do you


---------18:23----------
break up with someone you genuinely care


---------18:24----------
for and you're the reason they get hurt


---------18:27----------
okay that's an interesting question so I


---------18:37----------
mean so I I think your compass should


---------18:41----------
not as bizarre as the sounds whether you


---------18:45----------
do something or don't do something


---------18:46----------
should not necessarily be dictated by


---------18:49----------
another person's feelings that's my


---------18:52----------
short answer right so if I don't like my


---------18:57----------
job but I respect my boss and he was


---------19:00----------
loyal to me and if I left that would


---------19:03----------
have hurt his feelings it doesn't mean


---------19:05----------
that I should stay in his job right so


---------19:07----------
like I this is gonna sound really


---------19:09----------
dangerous so I don't want you guys want


---------19:11----------
you guys to really listen carefully to


---------19:12----------
what I'm saying so I mean hurt feelings


---------19:15----------
are a part of life does that mean that


---------19:17----------
you should go around and be an [ __ ]


---------19:18----------
no but that also means that like it's


---------19:21----------
not your responsibility really at the


---------19:23----------
end of the day like you can't control


---------19:25----------
the way that someone else feels if the


---------19:27----------
relationship is not working for you I


---------19:29----------
think it's reasonable to end the


---------19:32----------
relationship and do it as


---------19:33----------
compassionately as possible and do your


---------19:36----------
entire by in the relationship right so


---------19:37----------
like don't just like be an [ __ ] to


---------19:39----------
them and leave them hanging but let them


---------19:41----------
know but I think honestly I mean if


---------19:42----------
you're in a relationship with someone I


---------19:44----------
think part of your Dharma is to like


---------19:46----------
give that person the opportunity to be


---------19:48----------
in a relationship with someone who wants


---------19:50----------
to be in a relationship with them and if


---------19:53----------
that involves a little bit of pain along


---------19:54----------
the way I think that's fine I think it's


---------19:56----------
a far bigger sin to stay in a


---------19:58----------
relationship that you don't want to and


---------20:01----------
have them be in a relationship with


---------20:03----------
someone who doesn't want to be with them


---------20:05----------
like that's gonna breed way more subtle


---------20:08----------
resentment passive-aggressive stuff and


---------20:10----------
all kinds of crap that's like incredibly


---------20:12----------
toxic and under the surface so I think


---------20:16----------
that


---------20:16----------
you just got a you know I understand


---------20:18----------
that you hate to hurt people that you


---------20:20----------
love but I think sometimes you have to


---------20:21----------
do things that they may find hurtful


---------20:23----------
this is the other thing is that a lot of


---------20:26----------
people live their life based on the


---------20:29----------
imagined emotions of other people just


---------20:32----------
think about this for a second right you


---------20:33----------
don't know what they're actually going


---------20:36----------
to experience but the reason that you


---------20:38----------
stay in the relationship is because when


---------20:39----------
you imagine their reaction you imagine


---------20:42----------
that hurt and you're actually living


---------20:44----------
your your life based on your imagination


---------20:47----------
of someone else's reaction like what the


---------20:52----------
actual [ __ ] is that that is no way to


---------20:54----------
live life


---------20:55----------
you are controlled by hypothetical


---------20:58----------
emotions in future human beings like so


---------21:08----------
what's up with that right so this is


---------21:11----------
something that I work on a fair amount


---------21:13----------
this is part of our curriculum by the


---------21:14----------
way that I'm developing because this is


---------21:16----------
a common thing right so this is a quote


---------21:18----------
from like a lecture or a class or


---------21:22----------
something I'm putting out a series of


---------21:23----------
lectures that a lot of people live based


---------21:27----------
on the imagined emotions of others and


---------21:30----------
that's actually how you live your life


---------21:32----------
on the imagine you live your life based


---------21:36----------
on hypotheticals so don't do that right


---------21:38----------
we'll explore like how that what that's


---------21:40----------
about and I can talk more about that but


---------21:43----------
you know also understand that like


---------21:44----------
people can be disappointed and be hurt


---------21:46----------
and also be happy for you because people


---------21:48----------
are multi-dimensional like if you tell


---------21:49----------
someone hey I just don't think this is


---------21:51----------
the right relationship I love you a lot


---------21:52----------
but I just don't see us together like


---------21:54----------
long-term and I'm sorry like I've been


---------21:57----------
trying to not be in this room


---------21:59----------
I've been trying to not do this because


---------22:00----------
I care about you so much and I don't


---------22:01----------
want to hurt you


---------22:02----------
but at the same time like I just don't


---------22:04----------
think it's fair to you for me to


---------22:07----------
actually say in this relationship out of


---------22:09----------
loyalty and I think we should end things


---------22:10----------
and then you listen to what they say and


---------22:12----------
if they have like really good arguments


---------22:13----------
for you to stay or they want to give it


---------22:15----------
another shot and they want to give it


---------22:16----------
three months and see where it goes like


---------22:17----------
you can have that conversation my point


---------22:19----------
is that like that conversation needs to


---------22:21----------
be had


---------22:22----------
right so you break up with someone and


---------22:28----------
you you be honest with them because they


---------22:30----------
deserve your honesty they don't deserve


---------22:32----------
your like obfuscation and you hiding


---------22:36----------
your feelings and and if you have some


---------22:39----------
if there's some reason that the


---------22:40----------
relationship isn't working out like


---------22:41----------
that's the way you repair it you start


---------22:43----------
with a conversation you want to break up


---------22:46----------
with them for a particular reason right


---------22:47----------
but you that's got to come out in the


---------22:49----------
open because if you have a grievance you


---------22:50----------
have to give them a chance to solve it


---------22:51----------
that's otherwise the relationships not


---------22:53----------
gonna work okay how do you deal with


---------22:57----------
self-doubt sometimes I feel I can do


---------22:58----------
everything and someday soon I feel I


---------23:00----------
can't because I have a fear of failure


---------23:02----------
how do I deal with this okay


---------23:04----------
so how do you deal with self-doubt


---------23:06----------
sometimes sometimes I feel I can do


---------23:08----------
everything and someday soon I feel I


---------23:10----------
can't because I have a fear of failure


---------23:12----------
how do I deal with this okay so there's


---------23:15----------
like a short answer and there's a long


---------23:17----------
it so the first is that you actually


---------23:19----------
fail is that you just fail right because


---------23:22----------
if you fail and if you survive and you


---------23:25----------
get used to failure it's kind of like


---------23:27----------
reckful right he's actually okay with


---------23:28----------
rejection


---------23:29----------
he gets okay handling rejection he's


---------23:31----------
gotten good at it just fail and survive


---------23:34----------
and then like you fail a couple times


---------23:37----------
and you fail a couple more times and you


---------23:38----------
fail a couple more times so I had


---------23:40----------
something like a hundred forty


---------23:42----------
rejections from med school before I got


---------23:43----------
accepted the first five hurt a lot


---------23:47----------
the next twenty hurt a lot the next ten


---------23:50----------
not so much and then the next year the


---------23:53----------
first five so like forty forty through


---------23:55----------
forty five hurt a lot and then they


---------23:58----------
heard a lot and they heard a lot and


---------23:59----------
they heard a lot and then he get used to


---------24:02----------
it and then you just keep going so oddly


---------24:04----------
I think the the the solution to fear of


---------24:08----------
failure it's like how do you overcome a


---------24:10----------
fear of heights or a fear of dogs is


---------24:12----------
like exposure therapy right like you go


---------24:14----------
and you hang out with a dog you manage


---------24:16----------
your fear you see that you're alive you


---------24:18----------
go to the Empire State Building and you


---------24:20----------
look down and you feel like oh my god


---------24:21----------
that's so scary and then you look out of


---------24:23----------
your airplane window and things like


---------24:24----------
that you do things in a safe manner but


---------24:26----------
you expose yourself to your fear and you


---------24:27----------
begin to realize that actually just like


---------24:30----------
reckful the fear of rejection


---------24:32----------
is more dangerous than rejection itself


---------24:35----------
and that generally is true like fear of


---------24:37----------
things is actually like worse often


---------24:40----------
times than the thing itself you know


---------24:42----------
obvious caveats like that's not


---------24:43----------
blanketly true like I think it I mean


---------24:45----------
I'd rather be afraid of cancer than get


---------24:47----------
cancer right so like it's not like


---------24:48----------
blanketly true but generally speaking


---------24:51----------
fear of a thing is worse for us than the


---------24:55----------
thing itself fear is absolutely the mind


---------24:58----------
killer right Frank Herbert so the the


---------25:05----------
longer think there's more to this


---------25:07----------
question though because I want I want to


---------25:09----------
point something out to you guys


---------25:10----------
fear of failure and failing is like one


---------25:12----------
solution although that's a potential


---------25:15----------
challenge right because you don't want


---------25:17----------
to just run around failing everything


---------25:18----------
like that's not good but I want to point


---------25:21----------
something else to you guys how can I can


---------25:25----------
I copy this okay I'm gonna just which


---------25:30----------
this this is gonna be our last question


---------25:30----------
by the way okay so what I want to do is


---------25:40----------
just I want to point something out to


---------25:43----------
you guys okay very important not to


---------25:46----------
score


---------25:47----------
Street labs not street lives here we go


---------25:55----------
[Music]


---------25:59----------
how do you deal with self-doubt some


---------26:04----------
time we're gonna just add some grammar


---------26:07----------
okay


---------26:08----------
in punctuation I feel I can do


---------26:11----------
everything and someday soon I feel I


---------26:18----------
can't because I have


---------26:28----------
so let's start with this so the first


---------26:31----------
thing is what is this what's that what


---------26:39----------
do you guys think what does that mean


---------26:50----------
yeah colors right it's great right so


---------26:59----------
people are saying fear right so this in


---------27:01----------
and of itself is not necessarily true so


---------27:03----------
we can see that this person has a


---------27:06----------
complex in their mind some scar right a


---------27:10----------
cognitive bias that failure is


---------27:12----------
inevitable and they have this pattern


---------27:14----------
where they feel like they're doing


---------27:16----------
everything right and it's all going to


---------27:17----------
come crashing down very common pattern


---------27:20----------
do you guys see that


---------27:21----------
it's like success 6x success and failure


---------27:24----------
they feel like the failure is inevitable


---------27:27----------
so this pattern needs to be dealt with


---------27:29----------
because this isn't necessarily true like


---------27:32----------
you can just like this this sentence


---------27:36----------
right here actually speaks to a lot of


---------27:38----------
like cognitive bias about how this


---------27:41----------
person deals with the world


---------27:42----------
this is their self-doubt the next thing


---------27:46----------
is that this this problem is not going


---------27:52----------
to be fixed until this portion goes away


---------27:59----------
so the pathology here is not that


---------28:02----------
failure is inevitable but that they they


---------28:05----------
actually like they don't stay stable


---------28:08----------
they like they have high highs and they


---------28:09----------
have low lows so you feel like you're on


---------28:12----------
top of the world and you're amazing and


---------28:14----------
everything is great and then you


---------28:16----------
everything crashes and that's because


---------28:18----------
like this feeling is gonna end because


---------28:21----------
that's not how real life is right you


---------28:23----------
can't feel like you're gonna do


---------28:25----------
everything like that feeling is gonna


---------28:27----------
come with like the other side of the


---------28:29----------
coin which is like the feeling of


---------28:31----------
failure so interestingly enough what


---------28:34----------
this person needs to do is be a little


---------28:36----------
bit more even and what they try to do is


---------28:39----------
they deal with the self cottan


---------28:41----------
self-doubt right but if


---------28:42----------
you guys want some real 5head [ __ ] what


---------28:45----------
the question should be is how do I deal


---------28:49----------
with unrealistic overconfidence do you


---------28:59----------
guys see that you can't have one without


---------29:02----------
the other


---------29:04----------
so in a subtle subtle but important way


---------29:08----------
this is the big problem because I think


---------29:10----------
this is why they've failed because they


---------29:12----------
haven't correctly diagnosed the problem


---------29:13----------
because they keep on focusing on fear


---------29:15----------
and self-doubt


---------29:16----------
they don't actually realize that like


---------29:18----------
this is a problem and this is a problem


---------29:20----------
because if you have unrealistic


---------29:22----------
overconfidence your hopes are gonna be


---------29:24----------
dashed right so you have to see that and


---------29:28----------
so what this person needs to do is not


---------29:30----------
meditate when they're feeling doubtful


---------29:32----------
right so the other thing we're about


---------29:34----------
reckful is it's not just meditating


---------29:36----------
through bad emotions I want you guys to


---------29:37----------
understand this does anyone understand


---------29:39----------
why so I don't know if you got caught


---------29:40----------
this but like when he asked me to say


---------29:42----------
[ __ ] POG why did I say it does anyone


---------29:48----------
understand this okay so I think so so


---------29:56----------
you guys for those of you who think that


---------29:57----------
I'm trying to distract him from the


---------29:58----------
negative emotions that is partially


---------30:01----------
right okay the other reason that I said


---------30:05----------
it is that I wanted to teach him to


---------30:07----------
breathe through the highs and the lows


---------30:10----------
right it's just not meditation to remove


---------30:14----------
yourself from the negative it's


---------30:16----------
meditation to remove yourself from the


---------30:18----------
positive - it's finding equilibrium in


---------30:22----------
face of the highs and in space of the


---------30:24----------
loads because reckful - suffers this


---------30:26----------
thing where he gets super excited and


---------30:28----------
then super let down so detachment or


---------30:31----------
vital yeah which is the Sun Squidward is


---------30:33----------
about being detached from the good and


---------30:35----------
detached from the bad and so I trained


---------30:40----------
myself for the moment where there's this


---------30:43----------
thing called match day what do you


---------30:44----------
figure out where you're gonna do your


---------30:45----------
residency training and I went there and


---------30:48----------
I sort of knew I knew I had a pretty


---------30:50----------
good shot of getting into Mass General


---------30:52----------
Hospital in HM at Harvard Medical


---------30:54----------
and I trained myself for that moment and


---------30:56----------
I meditated and I said whatever this


---------30:58----------
piece of paper says I'm not gonna feel a


---------31:00----------
latent and I'm not gonna feel


---------31:01----------
disappointment both of them are off the


---------31:03----------
table I do not want either one the paper


---------31:05----------
says what it is going to say and that


---------31:08----------
will determine my future so be it I'm


---------31:10----------
gonna do the best that I can no matter


---------31:11----------
what the piece of paper says and then


---------31:13----------
you open the piece of paper and then I


---------31:15----------
saw a Mass General Hospital McLean


---------31:17----------
Hospital Harvard Medical School I smiled


---------31:19----------
yay


---------31:21----------
my wife was overjoyed everyone else was


---------31:23----------
overjoyed it was like great so be it so


---------31:26----------
be it tranquility and equilibrium


---------31:29----------
through the positive and the negative


---------31:31----------
because if you get disrupted on the on


---------31:33----------
the top end you're gonna face the low


---------31:35----------
end tranquility is not just about


---------31:38----------
avoidance of negative emotions it's


---------31:40----------
about avoidance not I mean it's not


---------31:42----------
avoidance of negative or positive its


---------31:44----------
tranquility in the face of both so you


---------31:47----------
should meditate when you're happy and


---------31:48----------
you should meditate when you're sad you


---------31:50----------
should meditate during all of these


---------31:51----------
different times and be able to find that


---------31:54----------
place within yourself it is not just an


---------31:56----------
avoidance of pain right does that make


---------32:00----------
sense so it is being with yourself and


---------32:06----------
this is how you really develop


---------32:08----------
confidence because if you can be


---------32:10----------
tranquil within yourself and not be


---------32:13----------
buffeted by the winds of success then


---------32:16----------
you also will not be buffeted by the


---------32:18----------
winds of failure the problem is that


---------32:22----------
everyone tries to use meditation is a


---------32:24----------
treatment to avoid negative emotion and


---------32:26----------
they're missing the point is a treatment


---------32:28----------
to avoid attachment to all emotion to be


---------32:31----------
able to live life in a tranquil state


---------32:33----------
and enjoy what comes at you no matter


---------32:35----------
what comes to be able to face it no


---------32:37----------
matter what comes whether the person


---------32:39----------
that you're trying to talk to is high on


---------32:41----------
psilocybin or not high on psilocybin you


---------32:43----------
are there for a reason and you do the


---------32:44----------
work that you need to do whether they


---------32:47----------
break down in 15 minutes and make


---------32:49----------
inflate your ego because that's what


---------32:50----------
everyone wants to see or they don't


---------32:52----------
break down in 15 minutes you are there


---------32:53----------
to do what you want to do so be tranquil


---------32:57----------
within yourself meditate in face of the


---------33:01----------
good and the bad and don't just chase


---------33:03----------
success and don't try to avoid faith


---------33:05----------
failure both of those things are eat


---------33:07----------
bad do the best that you can do what you


---------33:10----------
showed up to do and like just that's the


---------33:12----------
goal and success will come should you


---------33:15----------
strive to accomplish absolutely but


---------33:18----------
don't get caught up in it
