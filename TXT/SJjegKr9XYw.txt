---------00:00----------
but I think the main thing here is that


---------00:01----------
the work is not just what we do together


---------00:03----------
it's what you do in your mind after we


---------00:07----------
talk


---------00:11----------
there we go hello you got a haircut yeah


---------00:15----------
you like it looks good man clean


---------00:19----------
I'll make I have to make it so bright


---------00:21----------
for you to see me see it's blowing out


---------00:23----------
okay because we could go like this or


---------00:26----------
something all right


---------00:29----------
you I want you to see my body language


---------00:31----------
really well you know this is this better


---------00:32----------
than the previous angle yeah doesn't


---------00:35----------
really matter to you just the straight


---------00:37----------
chest no previous dreams I mean I I like


---------00:42----------
both of them


---------00:43----------
okay I think I actually like the other


---------00:45----------
one a little bit more just because the


---------00:47----------
microphone isn't in the way of your face


---------00:49----------
but don't worry about it let's just I


---------00:50----------
can move it yeah okay because how you


---------00:52----------
been man amazing really good and I think


---------00:58----------
it's pretty much thanks to you I think


---------00:59----------
everything started working out as soon


---------01:01----------
as we started talking it's not a


---------01:04----------
coincidence just everything in my life


---------01:05----------
is just working all the time um feel


---------01:10----------
very confident uh a bunch of girls


---------01:15----------
started liking me all of a sudden uh-huh


---------01:18----------
yeah didn't I didn't I guess I'm


---------01:22----------
different somehow


---------01:23----------
yes but doing a little better with


---------01:29----------
trading which I've always been good at


---------01:31----------
but now I'm actually really doing well


---------01:33----------
but the markets also being are crazy


---------01:36----------
okay not necessarily better with like


---------01:44----------
business deals cuz of everything


---------01:47----------
everything else that's about the same


---------01:49----------
maybe actually when I'm more sad I do


---------01:53----------
those better because I don't get excited


---------01:55----------
it's important not to show any emotion


---------01:57----------
if I get show that I'm getting excited


---------02:00----------
or not or upset in a business


---------02:04----------
transaction it seems good to pokerface


---------02:07----------
it okay right and I


---------02:12----------
I got worse I think from being happier


---------02:15----------
that's the only thing in my life that


---------02:17----------
got worse so what do you mean by happier


---------02:20----------
I wake up and I don't want to kill


---------02:25----------
myself


---------02:26----------
thanks to you pretty service yeah yeah I


---------02:31----------
mean that's a plus I I don't I don't


---------02:33----------
know so I I appreciate that you know you


---------02:36----------
feel I'm somewhat responsible for this


---------02:39----------
I'm grateful for that I think is I tell


---------02:42----------
most people you know we spend


---------02:45----------
we've spent one hour a week together


---------02:46----------
over the last what is it two months like


---------02:51----------
on average like we've spent like a total


---------02:53----------
of six hours together over a two-month


---------02:56----------
period right yeah so I I just don't


---------03:00----------
think that like as a scientist I don't


---------03:02----------
think that six hours invested in one


---------03:08----------
what do you think has been your hand in


---------03:10----------
this I mean I've definitely done stuff


---------03:13----------
but you see you have you being there to


---------03:15----------
guide me in the right direction even if


---------03:16----------
you just talk to me for five minutes I


---------03:17----------
could end up dwelling in thinking about


---------03:19----------
it for one thing you say I could think


---------03:21----------
about for a hundred hours right for the


---------03:23----------
whole every waking hour of the week I


---------03:26----------
could think about it okay um so I got 16


---------03:32----------
waking hours a day 78 plus forty two


---------03:34----------
hundred twelve hours right 112 hours of


---------03:38----------
therapy happening from one thing you say


---------03:42----------
I take it through the with me through


---------03:44----------
whole week kind of thing yeah but that's


---------03:46----------
the key thing so that I all except in a


---------03:48----------
moment I mean I'll agree with that but I


---------03:52----------
think the main thing here is that the


---------03:53----------
work is not just what we do together


---------03:55----------
it's what you do in your mind after we


---------03:59----------
talk that's where the real money is


---------04:01----------
right that's where and this is what I've


---------04:04----------
seen reckful like and I've worked with a


---------04:07----------
lot of people is like some people take


---------04:10----------
what we do together and they implement


---------04:12----------
it and they think about it and they


---------04:13----------
reflect on it in between our sessions


---------04:16----------
and those are the people that get


---------04:17----------
dramatically better so I want to commend


---------04:21----------
you while I'm getting dramatically


---------04:22----------
better yeah so I mean but like if you


---------04:25----------
think about where


---------04:26----------
the grind happen it's like I may give


---------04:29----------
you the dps rotation but then you're the


---------04:31----------
one who's practicing it out yeah I'm


---------04:33----------
really good I'm really good at doing the


---------04:35----------
max DPS once I have the revision yeah


---------04:37----------
you're and so I think I think you should


---------04:39----------
give yourself a pat on the back man why


---------04:44----------
do i why do you think it's important for


---------04:49----------
me to not necessarily deflect your


---------04:51----------
appreciation but try to add some color


---------04:55----------
to it or context you one you want me to


---------05:00----------
feel like I'm doing well working on


---------05:02----------
myself I think it's more than that so


---------05:05----------
it's not just that I want you to feel


---------05:06----------
that way it's that I want you to really


---------05:08----------
understand that I do believe that you


---------05:12----------
are instrumental in changing your life


---------05:16----------
like I don't think it's an external


---------05:18----------
force that can create the kind of change


---------05:20----------
that you're talking about I just don't


---------05:21----------
believe that about people like it can it


---------05:24----------
can be an influence absolutely it can be


---------05:26----------
a playbook absolutely I mean it's a


---------05:28----------
matter of semantics it's an influence


---------05:31----------
sure but sure that your input without


---------05:34----------
what's an example here so


---------05:46----------
in my own head thinking about what is


---------05:51----------
the correct path of action to solve a


---------05:54----------
certain problem I have mm-hmm and I'm


---------05:56----------
going between 1020 options maybe okay


---------06:00----------
and every day as a struggle deciding


---------06:03----------
which one and then I pick one and I see


---------06:05----------
how it goes if it goes well sometimes


---------06:08----------
I'm like maybe that was just random that


---------06:10----------
it went well try it again and it's kind


---------06:13----------
of like this game of uh what do they


---------06:17----------
call the method where you just try


---------06:18----------
things and see if they work out brute


---------06:21----------
force no yeah but no trial and error


---------06:25----------
John they're just a trial and error of


---------06:27----------
twenty options on how to deal with a


---------06:30----------
mental problem and then when you give me


---------06:33----------
two options like I was saying previous


---------06:36----------
stream of the one before it makes it so


---------06:38----------
much easier I'm just seeing the lines


---------06:40----------
right and I'm just like oh I'll take


---------06:42----------
this one yeah


---------06:43----------
if you you cut out like the eighteen bad


---------06:45----------
options for me and I'm just picking and


---------06:47----------
everything is working great man I'm


---------06:51----------
happy to hear and that's whatever you


---------06:53----------
want to call it influence or whatever


---------06:55----------
but it was a key thing that changed me


---------06:59----------
completely everything in my life's


---------07:02----------
better okay well awesome man I'm I'm


---------07:06----------
glad I was able to influence you or I'm


---------07:09----------
glad you found our time helpful yeah


---------07:12----------
keep suggesting yeah


---------07:16----------
can we talk for a second about like


---------07:19----------
what's going well and and maybe why you


---------07:21----------
think it's going well our friend


---------07:28----------
okay I won't talk about her too much


---------07:29----------
constrained to be better not to ok she's


---------07:32----------
like super highly successful person


---------07:35----------
which I


---------07:37----------
find very attractive like we missed the


---------07:45----------
boat chat our chances our chances are


---------07:47----------
over that's I could still day you on the


---------07:50----------
side you know I think but you made this


---------07:58----------
statement that women are finding you


---------08:00----------
like more attractive now yeah it's true


---------08:05----------
it happened all of a sudden how does


---------08:08----------
that repeat there's a more confident and


---------08:11----------
they like confident is whatever right


---------08:13----------
that's part of it absolutely why does


---------08:16----------
they keep auto adjusting it's triggering


---------08:18----------
me stupid camera do it I want everything


---------08:20----------
manual hold on


---------08:27----------
listen to me camera I need to see the


---------08:30----------
other side sorry the quality got worse


---------08:34----------
okay that was weird


---------08:35----------
I'm I'm obsessive about this kind of


---------08:39----------
stuff I'm sorry I like photography [ __ ]


---------08:43----------
I don't want to deal with it right now


---------08:44----------
it's a really bad time and it keeps auto


---------08:46----------
adjusting miss don't you agree okay okay


---------08:49----------
so just it's fine so so reckful I agree


---------08:53----------
that you know there's the whole


---------08:53----------
confidence thing okay sorry I'm trying


---------08:57----------
to focus it's just really choice but it


---------08:59----------
brights it lights up the whole screen


---------09:00----------
it's very distracting good okay go ahead


---------09:04----------
I just think you're ascending into


---------09:06----------
heaven like every like 30 seconds but so


---------09:10----------
I think that there's another piece of it


---------09:12----------
which is your perception right your


---------09:15----------
perception of how attractive what you


---------09:17----------
perceive so I would I wouldn't be


---------09:19----------
surprised I should say that your person


---------09:22----------
you know you say Oh women find me like


---------09:24----------
attractive because I'm confident now and


---------09:26----------
I'm feeling better but like it's very


---------09:28----------
possible that they find you attractive


---------09:30----------
as well during your low times but that


---------09:32----------
maybe you're not able to see that what


---------09:33----------
do you think about that no well they


---------09:41----------
might but then if they do I ruin it when


---------09:43----------
I'm because when I'm during my low times


---------09:45----------
I'm very needy and I'll just like huh a


---------09:49----------
girl will like me it'll be obvious they


---------09:51----------
like me but then I'll spam her a wall of


---------09:53----------
text okay which I actually feel like I


---------09:57----------
need to do he's like no need I respond


---------10:00----------
at that moment because I feel like I'm


---------10:02----------
gonna explode in my brain I don't need


---------10:05----------
to hang out I just need like a someone


---------10:07----------
to talk to me okay


---------10:08----------
you don't talk to me and I've previously


---------10:11----------
dated a lot of like gamer girls who are


---------10:13----------
the terrible responding the worst ever


---------10:17----------
get I realized this was every gamer girl


---------10:18----------
I talk to now they're all better


---------10:19----------
responds I'm so happy to not be dating a


---------10:21----------
gamer girl no they're really bad at


---------10:25----------
responding is they're always playing


---------10:26----------
something and they're never gonna


---------10:28----------
respond so I'd always liked white text


---------10:30----------
like [ __ ] actually 50 times I'm like


---------10:32----------
I'm like dude please I'm losing my mind


---------10:34----------
like I need to talk Simon


---------10:35----------
hello like you please it just sounds so


---------10:39----------
desperate and bad and even if they liked


---------10:42----------
me originally then they don't I know I


---------10:45----------
don't sir like I need that right now


---------10:47----------
yeah yeah so so I mean I just want to


---------10:49----------
clarify so it sounds like people still


---------10:51----------
you know like you it's it sounds like


---------10:53----------
some of the feelings that you have


---------10:55----------
translated into behaviors which kind of


---------10:57----------
pushes people away when you're not


---------11:00----------
feeling well


---------11:01----------
some of the feelings I have translate


---------11:03----------
into behaviors which push people away


---------11:05----------
yes mm-hmm okay so if you're feeling if


---------11:12----------
you're feeling well right now is that


---------11:15----------
like emotionally well or like more


---------11:18----------
holistically well holistically well I


---------11:21----------
feel like everything in my life is


---------11:22----------
coming together and it actually feels


---------11:25----------
like a cheat codes on it just feels like


---------11:26----------
everything's working every time it feels


---------11:31----------
too easy everything's working all


---------11:33----------
anything I do just works and then before


---------11:36----------
everything was really hard because a


---------11:39----------
year ago my mom and I were talking about


---------11:43----------
doing a suicide pact and both dying and


---------11:46----------
now like everyone's happy


---------11:49----------
I'm happy my mom is happier now


---------11:52----------
I think she's happier cuz I'm happy a


---------11:55----------
chain reaction you guys sound close


---------11:58----------
sounds like close emotionally but we


---------12:03----------
don't talk all the time hmmm yeah so


---------12:14----------
reckful is there something in particular


---------12:15----------
that you'd like to talk about today no


---------12:18----------
okay then let me offer like one or two


---------12:23----------
things so I'd like to help us understand


---------12:25----------
a little bit about how you're doing


---------12:27----------
better and if there are certain emotions


---------12:31----------
that you feel that sometimes change your


---------12:33----------
behaviors and tend to drive people away


---------12:36----------
is there some way that we can help you


---------12:39----------
so if your overall like feeling well


---------12:41----------
sort of like spiritually there gonna be


---------12:44----------
days where you know every day you'd be


---------12:46----------
happier that awesome I'm using it as a


---------12:49----------
I'm using a guidance waking up I really


---------12:51----------
like that guy Harris


---------12:53----------
yeah he's [ __ ] awesome he's got like


---------12:57----------
him yeah I like Samaras okay so I just


---------13:02----------
want to help us understand like if


---------13:04----------
you're doing well right now and your


---------13:05----------
emotions cuz your emotions are gonna


---------13:07----------
fluctuate over time right you're gonna


---------13:09----------
have something's gonna happen and then


---------13:11----------
like your neurons I think will be good


---------13:13----------
all the time dr. kay already talking so


---------13:16----------
so when when that happens how can we


---------13:19----------
sort of buffer against those periods of


---------13:22----------
time because I think the issue now for


---------13:24----------
you reckful down that you're on an


---------13:25----------
upward trajectory is like if stocks


---------13:28----------
going down soon dude this is the peak


---------13:30----------
we're scared that's your thing this


---------13:36----------
isn't the peak no no no buddy this is


---------13:38----------
the beginning of the elevator this is


---------13:39----------
the beginning of the the elevation oh


---------13:41----------
we're in an upward trend we're just


---------13:44----------
getting started


---------13:44----------
are you sure my happiness is


---------13:48----------
got hired from here yes no way you're


---------13:53----------
just starting to live life man wait I


---------13:56----------
could get happier than this sort of yeah


---------14:01----------
everything's perfect right now


---------14:04----------
damn that's great if I really can well I


---------14:07----------
mean I don't know about happier because


---------14:09----------
that sort of quantifies it but what I'm


---------14:12----------
saying is that like you're living like


---------14:13----------
you're living like a finding it I like


---------14:15----------
quantifying everything is any numbers


---------14:17----------
guy you notice I mean yeah so so this is


---------14:21----------
what and I I don't think actually I need


---------14:25----------
to stop doing that I need to just let's


---------14:26----------
start living like a cuz I don't when you


---------14:29----------
think it sucks I realized I was I was at


---------14:32----------
a club and I realized I'd never enjoyed


---------14:34----------
a club in my life and I'm gonna [ __ ]


---------14:36----------
meditate in the club dude like with my


---------14:37----------
eyes open and I'm just gonna like enjoy


---------14:40----------
this experience


---------14:40----------
with no thoughts and then I loved it


---------14:43----------
there was that people were dancing it


---------14:44----------
like moving their bodies and the lights


---------14:46----------
were nice and then I actually danced you


---------14:51----------
know I was like damn I could see why


---------14:52----------
people like this but I've always been


---------14:53----------
thinking too much to enjoy it yes yes


---------14:58----------
reckful you're getting it man this is


---------15:01----------
just the start


---------15:02----------
this isn't me like being paranoid and


---------15:04----------
don't shatter this thing this is saying


---------15:06----------
that you are on a particular trajectory


---------15:08----------
and there are going to be waves that hit


---------15:12----------
you from side to side what I want to


---------15:14----------
help you do is figure out how can you


---------15:15----------
buffer those waves because the waves are


---------15:17----------
gonna calm down on their own there's


---------15:19----------
gonna be like a storm that happens and


---------15:21----------
then the storm will pass the main issue


---------15:23----------
now is that how do we keep you stable


---------15:26----------
enough to when that storm hits to not


---------15:30----------
forget that this is still the upward


---------15:32----------
trajectory that we will you want to go


---------15:33----------
because if you can just get through the


---------15:34----------
storm you're gonna get back to this


---------15:36----------
place if I treat my happiness like a


---------15:38----------
stalk maybe I'll be able to handle


---------15:39----------
because I don't have an emotions


---------15:40----------
attached to investing when things go up


---------15:42----------
like it when things go down no the thing


---------15:43----------
is everyone else I know they're always


---------15:45----------
freaking out I'm just like yeah that's


---------15:47----------
fine you know


---------15:49----------
maybe I could do the analogy with my


---------15:51----------
emotions where I know the emotions are


---------15:54----------
gonna come and go happiness and sadness


---------15:56----------
and overall though I'm fine yes


---------16:02----------
whatever company I [ __ ] invest in is


---------16:03----------
fine Byron's fine - exactly so that is


---------16:06----------
something in sanskrit called Vairagya or


---------16:09----------
detachment d'etat yeah it's fine


---------16:12----------
right like things are gonna happen and


---------16:14----------
it's not like a good thing right like


---------16:16----------
you can lose money and you can


---------16:18----------
experience while you're talking ability


---------16:20----------
you can try - you're gonna have days


---------16:23----------
where you're gonna feel bad and you're


---------16:25----------
gonna have days where you lose money


---------16:26----------
those are all negative outcomes me


---------16:29----------
looking honey you sure no I don't know


---------16:34----------
yeah of course I have to have it and and


---------16:39----------
and so what you need to do is just


---------16:41----------
remember that that that's just you know


---------16:44----------
it's just part of what happens like so


---------16:46----------
negative emotions are gonna be a part of


---------16:48----------
life and they don't necessarily signal


---------16:51----------
that your life is falling apart or is


---------16:53----------
going amazing


---------16:54----------
his bazaars the sounds they have


---------16:57----------
emotions the signal my life is falling


---------16:59----------
apart of going amazing I can see that


---------17:00----------
because today when I woke up with after


---------17:01----------
really bad dreams even though


---------17:02----------
everything's perfect in my life I was


---------17:04----------
actually feeling negative for a second


---------17:05----------
I felt like 30 minutes and I was like


---------17:07----------
wait everything's absolutely perfect but


---------17:09----------
I don't feel good that's just weird


---------17:11----------
but then I I as the day progressed and I


---------17:14----------
stopped feeling similar to the dreams


---------17:17----------
where I'm dying then I thought I was


---------17:21----------
okay I wish I remembered my dreams


---------17:23----------
better to tell you but I'm always dying


---------17:26----------
what was dying in a dream I wake up you


---------17:31----------
have recurrent dreams of you dying yeah


---------17:35----------
die alot are they different deaths


---------17:39----------
usually falling bhavas have dreams of


---------17:44----------
falling do you actually die or you just


---------17:46----------
hit the bottom and then you wake I never


---------17:48----------
actually see myself die I just wake up


---------17:51----------
yeah that's normal


---------17:54----------
yeah for people of your Ayurvedic


---------17:57----------
Constitution yeah for people of my


---------17:59----------
Constitution was I mean Ayurvedic


---------18:01----------
Constitution if we not talk about Vata


---------18:02----------
yet I wish I could remember the terms


---------18:07----------
better if it was all English I remember


---------18:09----------
it better I am so so petha is one of the


---------18:11----------
three like elements so all human beings


---------18:15----------
have


---------18:15----------
three kinds of elements in them and some


---------18:18----------
people have higher levels of you know a


---------18:20----------
particular element so Vata is


---------18:22----------
represented by wind and ether and so if


---------18:26----------
other people like the word ether


---------18:28----------
what does ether mean ether is the space


---------18:32----------
between things so it's kind of like the


---------18:35----------
backdrop so it's also void is a space


---------18:39----------
between things yeah it's like the space


---------18:42----------
within which other stuff exists like so


---------18:45----------
space is not like methane right so but


---------18:49----------
in which things exist is the ether yeah


---------18:52----------
that's how generally speaking


---------18:53----------
traditionally those can I see what let


---------18:56----------
me see what Google says so like you


---------18:59----------
exist within a space but that space is


---------19:02----------
like it's a thing but it's not a thing


---------19:03----------
right you were smelling colorless


---------19:06----------
volatile liquids in a sauna for the


---------19:07----------
clear sky the upper regions of air


---------19:09----------
beyond the clouds okay yeah I see so


---------19:16----------
ether ether is a cool word I have some


---------19:21----------
eath etherium cerium is it based on


---------19:24----------
ether I certainly think so yeah cuz it's


---------19:30----------
based on empty space let's do it I think


---------19:34----------
I'm doing really well on it okay rekkles


---------19:38----------
focus my god all right I'm sorry


---------19:41----------
so people like Vata or like the wind so


---------19:48----------
they tend to get interested in things


---------19:49----------
quickly they also tend to get bored with


---------19:51----------
things quickly they tend to be like


---------19:53----------
kites but tell me this no I mean yeah I


---------19:58----------
get bored of things really quickly yeah


---------19:59----------
yep so you're about that I'm Vata too so


---------20:01----------
the other features of Ava's or that


---------20:03----------
their eyes are bigger than their son is


---------20:05----------
a type person yeah personality yeah


---------20:09----------
includes personnel also includes


---------20:10----------
physical things also includes mental


---------20:12----------
characteristics


---------20:13----------
we're both vodka and how many are there


---------20:15----------
total just three dart framing


---------20:16----------
three there are three types of


---------20:18----------
personalities one's about that there are


---------20:20----------
three elements and then people have


---------20:21----------
different levels of each element and


---------20:23----------
that sort of determines your personality


---------20:25----------
types so some people are like equal


---------20:27----------
parts of two of


---------20:29----------
but you and I are both of fatah your


---------20:32----------
secondary element to spit up by the way


---------20:35----------
so that's fire B water yeah your Vata


---------20:38----------
Pitta i'm iron what any mire in water so


---------20:42----------
if it does fire and water no no your


---------20:45----------
first organism area and a secondary yep


---------20:47----------
your primary element is wind your


---------20:49----------
secondary element is fire we my


---------20:52----------
primaries wind yes I'm so okay I'm wind


---------20:56----------
absolutely and then secondaries water is


---------20:58----------
fire fire is cool I like this wait wait


---------21:01----------
did you say fire fire and water yeah so


---------21:04----------
each each this is why it is one this is


---------21:06----------
what's confessing shot yeah so that so


---------21:10----------
people have all three doshas and then


---------21:13----------
each Dora is composed of two elements


---------21:15----------
okay but let me just tell you a little


---------21:19----------
bit about vodka okay so people who have


---------21:22----------
high levels of otha also are like a TD


---------21:24----------
their mind tends to wander very once


---------21:26----------
again bata is the wind one yes the wind


---------21:29----------
one just imagine me yeah imagine a mind


---------21:32----------
like the wind blowing really hard in one


---------21:33----------
direction Oh what is my theory I'm doing


---------21:36----------
right now blowing in this direction oh


---------21:37----------
let me fix my camera over here let me do


---------21:39----------
this over here over here over here over


---------21:42----------
here over here right so other features


---------21:45----------
of Vata their eyes are bigger than their


---------21:47----------
stomachs so I would guess that you get


---------21:49----------
very very hungry but then it doesn't


---------21:50----------
take a whole lot of food to actually


---------21:52----------
like fill you up yes I ordered way too


---------21:55----------
much food and I've realized that so


---------21:56----------
stuff so that's another Vata


---------21:58----------
characteristic vodkas tend to be what we


---------22:00----------
call people with fast metabolism so you


---------22:02----------
can eat a lot and you don't won't really


---------22:04----------
gain weight easily sometimes I've gained


---------22:08----------
weight a few times but yeah mostly well


---------22:10----------
sometimes I eat like a crazy person my


---------22:12----------
shame is seeing it yeah so so highly


---------22:18----------
fluctuate a petit SAR also consistent


---------22:20----------
with vodka and taking all this


---------22:24----------
information yeah and so I actually want


---------22:28----------
to hear okay I want to hear about the


---------22:29----------
other ones okay so bit des is like fire


---------22:32----------
is fire and water soap it does tend to


---------22:35----------
be driven focused argumentative my


---------22:38----------
textbook question for pizzas or do you


---------22:40----------
have a low intolerance for the idiot


---------22:42----------
see of others hmm when they do and bit


---------22:46----------
does have well like they're just


---------22:49----------
intolerant of the idiocy of others well


---------22:51----------
sorry I I I wonder if I could change


---------22:53----------
their view with just words because the


---------22:55----------
way I think about it is the people who


---------22:56----------
are really dumb just got very bad


---------22:58----------
orangey and we're born that way I really


---------23:01----------
believe it or either we're born that way


---------23:02----------
or their environment sucked and then I


---------23:05----------
just thought their fault yeah but


---------23:07----------
sometimes I'll see a really stupid


---------23:10----------
person and someone I'm with will be like


---------23:11----------
like we have to deal with this person


---------23:13----------
someone with us like oh my god this is


---------23:15----------
so [ __ ] annoying I hate like like


---------23:17----------
this person's [ __ ] sucks I hate them


---------23:20----------
that person is more bitter than you are


---------23:22----------
yeah and then I'll say you should feel


---------23:25----------
bad for that person dude he gets so


---------23:27----------
unlucky but the brain does not work yes


---------23:30----------
so but but so that's that's like do you


---------23:32----------
see how their classes of people who are


---------23:35----------
tolerant of that in classes of people


---------23:38----------
yeah I'm not sure if I'm on board yet


---------23:40----------
because I feel like I could slowly


---------23:42----------
convince a bit sure that's lutely yeah


---------23:46----------
yeah so I'm not talking about what do


---------23:48----------
you become a button no he wouldn't come


---------23:49----------
become a Vata in the same way that a bit


---------23:51----------
that can keep you focused by like


---------23:56----------
focusing you so they can exert their


---------23:59----------
influence on you and cause you to change


---------24:01----------
in the moment but you still have a


---------24:03----------
natural predisposition to be like the


---------24:06----------
wind and they have a natural


---------24:07----------
predisposition to be more argumented I


---------24:10----------
do noticed these natural predispositions


---------24:12----------
and people yeah thing but I mean it


---------24:15----------
could be attributed to it could be if


---------24:18----------
it's changeable you don't believe in it


---------24:20----------
being changeable no no it is changeable


---------24:22----------
so so we have an option going from one


---------24:25----------
to the you don't believe in it being


---------24:26----------
changed believe in it changing within


---------24:28----------
the spectrum of still being fire water


---------24:29----------
but not fire water becoming wind okay so


---------24:33----------
this is important to understand okay so


---------24:34----------
each person has a door shot a door Shai


---------24:37----------
is a level of Vata Pitta and kapha


---------24:39----------
you're you have an inherent door show


---------24:43----------
which is called a prakruti and then your


---------24:45----------
door shuts there levels can change based


---------24:48----------
on your environment and diet and other


---------24:50----------
things so it's kind of like like


---------24:54----------
things yeah so like let's say your Vata


---------24:56----------
is naturally attend your bitthe is not


---------24:59----------
rly a six in your Gotha is naturally a


---------25:01----------
for when you get my firewater one up to


---------25:04----------
a nine if I change some things


---------25:06----------
absolutely and you can also always be


---------25:09----------
higher not necessarily so over the line


---------25:13----------
I could become higher than the wind I


---------25:14----------
could stop being the wind uh you could


---------25:17----------
in theory have a dominant other door


---------25:20----------
siya yes in theory I just it sounds kind


---------25:24----------
of academic but generally speaking


---------25:26----------
you're always gonna be the wind right


---------25:28----------
like so you're gonna have and so this is


---------25:30----------
by the way borne out in genetics so


---------25:32----------
people have done genetic analyses of


---------25:34----------
people who are like vadas fit doesn't


---------25:35----------
guffaws and it found that they actually


---------25:37----------
share like groups of genes it's specific


---------25:40----------
places yes you and I yeah okay so if you


---------25:48----------
looked at our genetic analysis like for


---------25:50----------
example we're gonna share a remarkable


---------25:52----------
number of gene alleles release because


---------25:55----------
it's not really jeans but alleles deals


---------25:58----------
what's an allele allele is a particular


---------26:01----------
variant of a gene at a gene list four


---------26:04----------
letters no Leal is like so so like hair


---------26:10----------
color is an allele at the hair color and


---------26:14----------
when you're in certain learn about


---------26:15----------
dominant recessive is an allele like


---------26:18----------
brown is an allele and yes yes exactly


---------26:20----------
right so if you had double recessive you


---------26:23----------
actually passes on right so so a gene is


---------26:27----------
actually like one location within the


---------26:29----------
genome that governs a particular thing


---------26:31----------
so like we have a hair color gene and


---------26:34----------
then some people will have a particular


---------26:36----------
allele at that gene other people have a


---------26:38----------
different allele at that gene and so


---------26:41----------
what people have people have done


---------26:42----------
analysis genomic analysis on Ayurveda


---------26:45----------
yeah I really want you to say hi to my


---------26:46----------
friend sorry I'm windy I got ideas


---------26:48----------
dragon table say how did dr. K come here

---------27:13----------

---------27:19----------
has it has development on Neverland


---------27:21----------
going it's going great we're very happy


---------27:23----------
with how are things progressing you know


---------27:34----------
I want to talk to like alright like


---------27:56----------

---------28:03----------
time okay how could you


---------28:06----------

---------28:09----------
visiting I like um been my friend years


---------28:12----------
we still together actually more than 10


---------28:15----------
years


---------28:16----------
yeah no it's 20 20 MLG was 2009 oh okay


---------28:27----------
maybe 10 okay sorry


---------28:34----------
so reckful look I'm gonna have to get


---------28:38----------
going in about ten minutes just because


---------28:39----------
I okay I'm sorry I have another


---------28:42----------
appointment but um so I just want to


---------28:44----------
kind of so first of all I want to say


---------28:46----------
awesome that you're feeling better I'm


---------28:49----------
really glad you're feeling better I'm


---------28:50----------
glad that you felt like I was


---------28:52----------
instrumental or influential in your


---------28:54----------
change it's been awesome to be a part of


---------28:56----------
your journey I want to still talk a


---------28:59----------
little bit about and I'm happy to help


---------29:01----------
you out you know after we talked today


---------29:03----------
on stream and stuff like that if you


---------29:04----------
want to continue talking and things but


---------29:07----------
I just want you to know that like so be


---------29:10----------
careful because I want right now it


---------29:12----------
seems like your feelings and your


---------29:15----------
current situation in life are very


---------29:17----------
closely tied they're entangled and and


---------29:21----------
that's it makes sense like as you start


---------29:23----------
to feel better as you become more


---------29:24----------
confident you know the world becomes a


---------29:27----------
rosier place what I would really like to


---------29:30----------
help you do is is first of all


---------29:31----------
understand that you're gonna have days


---------29:33----------
of like negative emotion where something


---------29:36----------
could happen interpersonally something


---------29:38----------
could happen at everland you could just


---------29:39----------
wake up on the wrong side of the bed


---------29:41----------
like it could be all kinds of stuff that


---------29:43----------
could happen and then in those moments


---------29:45----------
your neurons may go back to like oh my


---------29:49----------
god like that was all an illusion like


---------29:51----------
it doesn't feel like that's the feeling


---------29:53----------
I have so I'll tell you yeah like every


---------29:55----------
time I get sad again I think that that's


---------29:58----------
the reality is that the base reality is


---------30:01----------
sadness and that I was just streaming


---------30:04----------
exactly what you said my instinct is as


---------30:07----------
soon as I feel sad for a moment when I


---------30:09----------
woke up today after the death dreams I


---------30:10----------
was like oh this is this is what it is


---------30:13----------
this is what I am I'm this person the


---------30:16----------
sad [ __ ] who wants to die this


---------30:18----------
is me and then I slowly got out of it


---------30:21----------
today though living life and being


---------30:24----------
around my friends but I keep waking up


---------30:26----------
in that reality trying to not yeah


---------30:31----------
really so I think you did awesome


---------30:33----------
meditating at the club I want you to


---------30:36----------
meditate yeah in in the same way when


---------30:39----------
you're feeling in that sadness right and


---------30:41----------
see if you can that's not the real you


---------30:45----------
but that's


---------30:46----------
also not the fake you the other crazy


---------30:48----------
thing is this you is not the real you


---------30:49----------
reckful the happy the happy you is


---------30:53----------
actually just as false [ __ ] okay there's


---------30:57----------
there's someone it's the person


---------31:00----------
underneath all that stuff there's


---------31:02----------
someone who's not independent of the


---------31:05----------
emotions they're independent promotions


---------31:07----------
there's a consciousness there's me yeah


---------31:10----------
and I think that's the person that you


---------31:12----------
actually found at the club right because


---------31:16----------
that wasn't about emotions it was like


---------31:20----------
I'm starting to believe in this [ __ ]


---------31:22----------
about note when you don't [ __ ] think


---------31:24----------
and you just are conscious there's a lot


---------31:28----------
to experience it's just like when you're


---------31:29----------
describing the strawberry taste I don't


---------31:31----------
can't say it in words what it tastes


---------31:32----------
like unless I was really good at


---------31:34----------
describing it but I can can't say it's


---------31:37----------
about the wait what did you where's the


---------31:39----------
word the word for knowing what yah yah


---------31:44----------
yah yah yah yah that's so cool I need to


---------31:49----------
I need to just live in the experiences


---------31:52----------
more than less than sorts I've been


---------31:54----------
holding me back


---------31:55----------
I keep getting in loops of thoughts that


---------31:56----------
are bad and thoughts really hold me back


---------31:59----------
so rattled


---------32:00----------
yes and now you need to be careful


---------32:03----------
because you need to detach from the


---------32:06----------
feeling good as well you don't want to


---------32:08----------
build it because this is this is


---------32:10----------
dangerous because what you're doing is


---------32:11----------
you're building this castle around your


---------32:13----------
life right now which is reckful feeling


---------32:15----------
good and this is real and that was false


---------32:17----------
and then like if you build this castle


---------32:19----------
around yourself this is still shaky


---------32:22----------
ground


---------32:22----------
you're right usually someone wouldn't


---------32:24----------
want to hear this because they're in a


---------32:25----------
happy state so they don't want to be


---------32:27----------
told to settle down but I know you're


---------32:30----------
right like yes and in the thing is


---------32:33----------
happiness is actually underneath all of


---------32:35----------
this bliss Anand is actually happiness


---------32:39----------
as an emotion but underneath that is


---------32:41----------
tranquility in bliss and peace and I


---------32:43----------
think you found that at the club right


---------32:47----------
because at the club you had thoughts you


---------32:49----------
had emotions you had this prior


---------32:51----------
experience which which was dictated by


---------32:54----------
your thinking and once you get


---------32:56----------
underneath thinking there's just this


---------32:57----------
kind of like chill sort of purse


---------32:59----------
and even below excitement I want you to


---------33:03----------
find the same person just get really


---------33:07----------
good at finding the person underneath


---------33:09----------
underneath the sadness underneath the


---------33:11----------
happiness underneath it all there's just


---------33:13----------
the real something there there's Matsui


---------33:16----------
I've never seen I've never felt in touch


---------33:20----------
with that just like you were saying I


---------33:22----------
don't have a self-worth last time


---------33:28----------
yeah I'm attached to the emotions I'm if


---------33:31----------
I'm happy I love that from jad oh this


---------33:34----------
is who I am I'm the sad person but I'm


---------33:36----------
not I haven't experienced what it's like


---------33:38----------
to just be alive exactly so the the the


---------33:43----------
unfortunate thing reckful is if you


---------33:45----------
attach yourself to the high points that


---------33:47----------
attachment is gonna stick is your mind


---------33:51----------
fluctuates back to the low you got it


---------33:54----------
make sense one of the hardest things


---------33:57----------
that I have to teach people when I'm


---------33:58----------
teaching them how to meditate is to be


---------34:00----------
detached so everyone comes in and says I


---------34:02----------
want you to teach me out of meditate


---------34:03----------
because I don't want to feel anxious I


---------34:04----------
don't want to feel depressed I don't


---------34:06----------
want to feel sad I don't want to feel


---------34:07----------
all these negative things I don't want


---------34:09----------
to feel shame the hard part is teaching


---------34:12----------
them to detach from the positive because


---------34:15----------
then you're detaching from the entire


---------34:17----------
phenomenon hmm I'm trying right now good


---------34:24----------
I can see that


---------34:31----------
I just want to become a


---------34:34----------
komm unattached to the emotions


---------34:40----------
feel cool ok so I'm very attached for


---------34:43----------
the emotions so close your eyes and once


---------34:47----------
again worried ok I'll Express first that


---------34:50----------
I'm a little worried about the timing if


---------34:51----------
you go really soon can I get it in my


---------34:53----------
head how soon the four minutes yeah five


---------34:55----------
minutes okay a little stressful but I'll


---------34:58----------
try to detach from that emotion too good


---------35:00----------
excellent now you're learning so the


---------35:04----------
first step of detachment reckful is


---------35:05----------
acknowledgement of what you feel now you


---------35:07----------
feel the pressure right the pressure


---------35:10----------
creates thoughts


---------35:11----------
it creates expectations it creates like


---------35:14----------
concerns good so now close your eyes


---------35:17----------
find the moment where inhalation becomes


---------35:19----------
exhalation


---------35:27----------
you


---------35:37----------
I love you dr. K good so feel that


---------35:41----------
emotion right so you feel that


---------35:43----------
tranquility that peace where did that


---------35:45----------
thought come from good I think I think


---------35:50----------
we're getting there good right so feel


---------35:57----------
that now return find the moment where


---------36:00----------
inhalation becomes exhalation and now


---------36:17----------
reckful oh no we're running out of time


---------36:18----------
oh my goodness if you found it yet look


---------36:22----------
at that mm-hmm look at that right cuz


---------36:25----------
earlier yours it stuck oh my god how


---------36:27----------
much long do we have how long do we have


---------36:30----------
now how do you feel right now what


---------36:34----------
emotions do you feel this feeling of not


---------36:39----------
thinking very much does it feel good


---------36:44----------
yeah yeah does it feel good I'm trying


---------36:52----------
to good as an emotion may be beautiful


---------36:55----------
right so it feels like peaceful but it's


---------36:59----------
like not it's not an on an emotional on


---------37:03----------
your character sheet there's a like


---------37:05----------
there's a there's a place for status


---------37:08----------
effects and those are temporary things


---------37:11----------
and emotions that you feel are under the


---------37:13----------
status affected box but what you were


---------37:15----------
experiencing right now doesn't go in


---------37:16----------
that box does that make sense character


---------37:19----------
I'm just playing the character doesn't


---------37:20----------
matter if the status effect is sad or


---------37:22----------
happy at the moment or nervous or


---------37:23----------
whatever


---------37:24----------
I am the character you're just something


---------37:27----------
underneath and it's just like it's just


---------37:28----------
you words are not used to describe it


---------37:33----------
right I get it I actually get it the


---------37:36----------
status effect thing it was good analogy


---------37:40----------
I'm happy that was an emotion though no


---------37:45----------
no no no so now we come to so I think


---------37:48----------
what you are now so this is there's a


---------37:49----------
word for this anand bliss so this isn't


---------37:53----------
an emotion it's like kind of this weird


---------37:55----------
thing that would the describes that's


---------37:57----------
like not quite an emotion it's sort of


---------38:00----------
like a stability yeah actually yes


---------38:04----------
yes right so this is a glimpse of


---------38:07----------
Nirvana see I like it


---------38:13----------
good strong work man I'm so happy for


---------38:17----------
you


---------38:17----------
that's quick so the other thing other


---------38:19----------
thing reckful is that you know you talk


---------38:21----------
about how good I am if you've been


---------38:24----------
[ __ ] meditating every day every day


---------38:27----------
that's that's good that's why you feel


---------38:31----------
this way I was listening navall and he


---------38:34----------
says he meditates for an hour every


---------38:35----------
single day and he says it changes his


---------38:37----------
perception of time which and now I
