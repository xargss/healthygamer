---------00:00----------
technical problems aside let us begin I


---------00:02----------
don't know what we're so uh first of all


---------00:05----------
what do i what what do I call you what


---------00:07----------
do you go by


---------00:08----------
uh I guess a lot of people call me pokey


---------00:12----------
okay you want it to be very personal and


---------00:15----------
call me by my name


---------00:16----------
it's Iman Iman okay what what do you


---------00:22----------
prefer


---------00:24----------
um I guess I've always kind of felt like


---------00:28----------
poki is fine for whatever situation but


---------00:31----------
if someone's going to try to be very


---------00:33----------
personal with me like me the person then


---------00:36----------
I guess


---------00:37----------
Iman makes more sense okay so then what


---------00:40----------
would you prefer I do do you want me to


---------00:42----------
be personal do you want to be personal I


---------00:48----------
think I enjoy I like talking with people


---------00:51----------
instead of characters in general so I


---------00:58----------
think I'm leaning towards Iman but at


---------01:00----------
the same time I don't know if you want


---------01:03----------
to be Iman today or you want to be poki


---------01:05----------
today I think I should be Iman I feel


---------01:08----------
like it only makes sense both of us are


---------01:11----------
really quiet I'm sorry can you say that


---------01:14----------
again I think it makes sense to be Iman


---------01:18----------
okay so then let's let's talk to you Mon


---------01:23----------
so can you tell me a little bit is there


---------01:25----------
something in particular that you wanted


---------01:26----------
to talk about today or something that we


---------01:30----------
can help you with and I say we because


---------01:34----------
twitch chat is actually pretty good at


---------01:35----------
this by now oh that's really cute I


---------01:38----------
think you have a lovely community and


---------01:41----------
you do a really good job of moderating


---------01:42----------
them I think from what I've seen at


---------01:44----------
least I don't think there's really


---------01:48----------
anything in particular because I feel


---------01:51----------
like all my issues are very convoluted


---------01:55----------
okay yeah together that's what we're


---------02:00----------
here for so so I think that that's


---------02:02----------
actually what I think what we do what I


---------02:05----------
try to do is just untangle things for


---------02:06----------
people because I think most people are


---------02:08----------
pretty good at problem-solving they're


---------02:10----------
intelligent they're capable and and it's


---------02:12----------
just it's really ignorant


---------02:14----------
and not understanding that tends to be


---------02:16----------
the problem for most people so when you


---------02:19----------
say your issues like that's like a heavy


---------02:21----------
word like what what do you mean by


---------02:22----------
issues first starters do you know how I


---------02:26----------
can prevent myself from crying during


---------02:29----------
this absolutely whoo uh maybe actually


---------02:33----------
hold on okay do you let me start with


---------02:36----------
this what's wrong with crying I've just


---------02:40----------
been crying a lot okay so but what's


---------02:45----------
wrong with that where did you get the


---------02:49----------
idea that you're not allowed to cry hear


---------02:51----------
that crying is bad I guess just in


---------02:55----------
moments where it feels like it doesn't


---------02:56----------
make sense okay like now okay so let's


---------03:02----------
just pause for a second what are you


---------03:04----------
feeling there is actually a really funny


---------03:17----------
um picture meme on the subreddit I think


---------03:22----------
I can make me motivated


---------03:24----------
if anyone either was watching my


---------03:27----------
streamer has seen it or it's like


---------03:29----------
therapist asks you to open up and then


---------03:32----------
it's like this um glass panel and inside


---------03:34----------
there's a bunch of dishes that are like


---------03:36----------
so close to falling out and you're like


---------03:39----------
I can't and they're like why and then


---------03:41----------
it's just a picture of that hmm


---------03:44----------
but it sounds like that's not what


---------03:46----------
you're experiencing it sounds like it's


---------03:47----------
the opposite right that the dishes your


---------03:50----------
panel is so high and the dishes are


---------03:51----------
starting to spill over the top yeah I


---------03:54----------
guess what are you feeling right now do


---------03:57----------
you do you know I guess the nervousness


---------04:07----------
and I don't know why especially for the


---------04:08----------
last like two weeks I feel like just


---------04:15----------
like very sensitive and like on the


---------04:19----------
verge of crying very often and I don't


---------04:22----------
know okay yeah and in the crying is a


---------04:26----------
bad crying let's start there so so I


---------04:30----------
mean I'm not the kind of person that is


---------04:33----------
of the opinion that like crime is a bad


---------04:34----------
thing I often feel like it's really good


---------04:36----------
and like cathartic or like therapeutic


---------04:40----------
and it kind of like allows you to let


---------04:41----------
your emotions out but it almost feels


---------04:43----------
like I can never get to that point where


---------04:45----------
they're all out


---------04:46----------
either that or like they're just like


---------04:50----------
continuously we're generating yeah oh


---------04:52----------
yeah oh man that sounds rough so what


---------04:56----------
I'm what I'm hearing from you is that


---------04:57----------
you're not you're not opposed to feeling


---------05:00----------
feelings it's just it seems like there's


---------05:02----------
a never-ending well of like negative


---------05:04----------
feelings and even if you let yourself


---------05:06----------
cry like you can cry for a while but


---------05:10----------
then like at some point the crying's


---------05:12----------
supposed to like make you feel better


---------05:13----------
and you're supposed to stop right like


---------05:14----------
it's not just like I've experienced yeah


---------05:18----------
it's like what the [ __ ] it's not like


---------05:20----------
that I was told at some point that this


---------05:22----------
would get better yeah and everyone says


---------05:25----------
that once you let it out then it's out


---------05:27----------
but you're like but then it's back like


---------05:30----------
two hours later yeah so so what I'm


---------05:33----------
hearing from you is that you don't have


---------05:34----------
a bucket that's full of water you have a


---------05:36----------
faucet yeah that sounds rough I guess


---------05:43----------
maybe I I don't really know why cuz I


---------05:47----------
haven't really experienced this before


---------05:51----------
and that's why I like I guess that's


---------05:54----------
like it's like my first question right


---------05:56----------
off the bat and I I saw it like oh this


---------05:59----------
will be fine maybe I will tear up at


---------06:01----------
some point so I don't know why like I


---------06:03----------
literally just say hello and I feel like


---------06:05----------
crying yeah


---------06:11----------
I think for a second okay so my first


---------06:22----------
thought actually can you think for like


---------06:24----------
another second sure


---------06:26----------
I'm gonna guess some tissues I was not


---------06:28----------
prepared


---------06:48----------
you


---------07:02----------
I'm sorry how do you pronounce your name


---------07:04----------
again Iman Iman do you feel lonely let


---------07:12----------
me rephrase actually do you feel alone I


---------07:18----------
don't know I guess it's not really


---------07:20----------
something that I think about because I


---------07:25----------
am like physically not alone because I


---------07:27----------
have like my roommates and stuff and I


---------07:31----------
do have like good friends that I can


---------07:34----------
vent to when need be so in that aspect I


---------07:38----------
feel like it's not like I don't really


---------07:41----------
feel alone in that way maybe in more


---------07:45----------
complicated ways that I do for example


---------07:48----------
like in terms of the things that I have


---------07:55----------
issues with I maybe sometimes feel like


---------07:59----------
I deal with those alone or that there


---------08:05----------
aren't like people in similar situations


---------08:08----------
yeah it can be really confusing when you


---------08:11----------
feel a certain way that you're not


---------08:13----------
supposed to feel yeah or I think


---------08:19----------
especially one of the reasons I was


---------08:21----------
nervous to talk to you today with


---------08:23----------
because I feel like a lot of things I'm


---------08:27----------
um I like shouldn't be justified in


---------08:31----------
feeling because I am also like very


---------08:34----------
privileged and lucky to be in the


---------08:37----------
position that I'm in and that's also I


---------08:40----------
like initially many weeks or months ago


---------08:43----------
when we were talking about potentially


---------08:45----------
doing this sort of thing I just feel


---------08:47----------
like people don't want to hear someone


---------08:50----------
like me complain like understandably so


---------08:55----------
I think that's part of it


---------09:01----------
I'm gonna think about how so yeah so I'm


---------09:05----------
gonna just say what I said again which


---------09:07----------
is it can be confusing to feel things


---------09:09----------
that you're not supposed to feel right


---------09:13----------
so so what I'm getting from you is so


---------09:16----------
the first thing I'm gonna say is that


---------09:17----------
I'm here and I'm with you


---------09:21----------
and at least for a little while


---------09:24----------
you're not gonna be alone and I'm okay


---------09:28----------
with who you are and I don't really care


---------09:30----------
that you have privilege like I don't I


---------09:32----------
mean part of the advantage of being a


---------09:33----------
boomer I mean I know who you are I know


---------09:35----------
you are but I also don't I you know I


---------09:39----------
come from worlds I feel like I'm an


---------09:41----------
alien on Twitch because they're all of


---------09:44----------
these you know they're yeah they're


---------09:48----------
they're all these things that I've done


---------09:49----------
derstand about you guys and twitch and


---------09:52----------
like you know I identify with pieces of


---------09:54----------
it but but there's a lot of stuff that I


---------09:56----------
don't understand so the first thing that


---------09:57----------
I want to talk to you about is because I


---------10:02----------
think this is this is the problem right


---------10:04----------
is that that you you shouldn't be alone


---------10:07----------
but you are I I like what I'm getting


---------10:12----------
from you is like a sense of like shoulds


---------10:14----------
like it's a case of the shuds like you


---------10:16----------
shouldn't feel this way because you're


---------10:17----------
privileged but the interesting thing is


---------10:20----------
that like when Wood Wood Buddha but the


---------10:24----------
whatever said that all human beings are


---------10:29----------
entitled to two things and those things


---------10:31----------
are suffering and death and that's like


---------10:33----------
really really interesting because you


---------10:39----------
know we have this idea that we say money


---------10:42----------
doesn't buy happiness but it you know


---------10:45----------
sure as hell helps but at the same time


---------10:48----------
like I mean I've worked with a lot of


---------10:49----------
people who are very successful and very


---------10:51----------
privileged and the one thing that I've


---------10:52----------
seen is that like I don't think that


---------10:54----------
being privileged or successful is makes


---------10:58----------
you invulnerable to suffering and


---------10:59----------
somewhere along the way we started


---------11:02----------
judging people who have things that we


---------11:04----------
don't have and we started gatekeeping


---------11:06----------
suffering for them and I think that's


---------11:10----------
actually really really toxic


---------11:13----------
right it says that like just because you


---------11:15----------
have something that I don't have you're


---------11:17----------
not allowed to suffer and this is a


---------11:20----------
tango that we all started playing


---------11:22----------
especially the people who are the halves


---------11:24----------
and the people who are have-nots it's


---------11:26----------
one that we both do


---------11:27----------
but in my experience like I hate to


---------11:29----------
break it to you Iman Iman right I hate


---------11:33----------
to break it to you Mon but you know no


---------11:35----------
amount of privilege power Fame or money


---------11:38----------
is going to be an antidote to your


---------11:41----------
suffering and in fact that's exactly


---------11:42----------
what would they learned so he was


---------11:45----------
wealthy powerful either jokes earlier


---------11:47----------
about people in chat said Queen when


---------11:51----------
they referred to you and I think it's


---------11:52----------
actually really bizarre because that's


---------11:54----------
that's literally what what the was like


---------11:56----------
whoo there was a king and he woke up one


---------11:58----------
day yeah it was like tired of his


---------12:01----------
privilege I wanted to see what it was


---------12:03----------
like to live otherwise and I think he


---------12:07----------
became really poor yeah so I don't know


---------12:10----------
that he wanted to see what it was like I


---------12:12----------
think he actually woke up one day and


---------12:14----------
felt exactly the way that you do which


---------12:17----------
is that he cried and then the next day


---------12:19----------
he cried in the next day he cried and


---------12:22----------
the next day he cried and he didn't know


---------12:24----------
why it wouldn't stop and then he's like


---------12:27----------
things are supposed to make this better


---------12:30----------
and then he looked around at him and he


---------12:32----------
said okay like maybe having more


---------12:34----------
followers on Twitter will make me feel


---------12:36----------
better maybe being able to eat tastier


---------12:39----------
food will make me feel better maybe


---------12:41----------
having a more loving marriage but he had


---------12:43----------
all those things so he was kind of


---------12:45----------
[ __ ] in a way that very few people are


---------12:47----------
is he had everything I don't know if you


---------12:49----------
have everything or not it sounds like


---------12:50----------
you have a lot but there may be some


---------12:53----------
some things in your mind that you tell


---------12:55----------
to tell yourself like I don't know in


---------12:56----------
terms of you know if you have kids or


---------12:57----------
relationships or things like that and


---------12:59----------
what you think about that but a lot of


---------13:01----------
times you know people who are privileged


---------13:05----------
or successful in some way like they look


---------13:06----------
at that like that dimension of their


---------13:08----------
life where they're lacking and they say


---------13:09----------
this is what's gonna bring me happiness


---------13:11----------
but booth does uniquely yeah not gonna


---------13:15----------
work


---------13:15----------
hate to break it to you yeah I'm very


---------13:18----------
much a problem solver brain and I also


---------13:20----------
agree it's probably not gonna work yeah


---------13:22----------
I actually think it gets really bad


---------13:24----------
because I become very like kind of


---------13:27----------
compulsive about those issues yeah it


---------13:30----------
doesn't really make a difference at the


---------13:32----------
end of the day cuz I'll just become


---------13:32----------
compulsive about something else


---------13:35----------
once one thing you stall with brilliant


---------13:39----------
so let's I can keep talking about Buddha


---------13:42----------
but I can't let that slide so where does


---------13:46----------
that compulsivity come from


---------13:47----------
why are you compulsive helped us


---------13:49----------
understand that I think I just have a


---------13:52----------
problem-solver brain and it's served me


---------13:55----------
for so many years I can't really turn it


---------13:58----------
off what does that mean problem-solver


---------14:01----------
brain help us understand that um I may


---------14:08----------
think that it spawns from the wrong


---------14:10----------
thing but I always thought that I came


---------14:11----------
from like like having a strong love for


---------14:15----------
mathematics and going into engineering


---------14:18----------
and I mean my life was school and so it


---------14:23----------
was always about like problem solving


---------14:24----------
min maxing trying to be as productive as


---------14:28----------
possible trying to do my best in all


---------14:30----------
aspects et cetera et cetera


---------14:32----------
and I feel like when it comes to content


---------14:34----------
creation what makes a content creator


---------14:38----------
really successful is a lot of being able


---------14:42----------
to problem-solve


---------14:43----------
and being able to min/max and learning


---------14:47----------
what works and doesn't and changing and


---------14:48----------
evolving etc and so because it has


---------14:51----------
served me for so many years it's


---------14:53----------
something it's it's a part of me that is


---------14:55----------
kind of hard to turn off but I have


---------14:57----------
noticed especially as of late that it's


---------14:58----------
more so like not trying to like fix good


---------15:04----------
problems per se or or helpful problems


---------15:07----------
it's just like being obsessive about the


---------15:10----------
next thing that I can fix it make better


---------15:17----------
you you thought that slot hmm you've


---------15:23----------
thought about this a lot


---------15:27----------
very insightful so let's let's let's so


---------15:31----------
let's try to take the next step okay so


---------15:34----------
when you don't problem-solve


---------15:38----------
how do you feel what does that mean not


---------15:46----------
problem so exactly alright so you've got


---------15:50----------
to learn exactly what would they learned


---------15:52----------
okay and so the good news is that you


---------15:55----------
can get better I think it's just gonna


---------15:57----------
happen you're gonna have to do something


---------15:59----------
that you've never done before which is


---------16:01----------
to not try right literally I don't know


---------16:05----------
how to do that yeah so we'll try to help


---------16:08----------
you we'll try to help you not try so


---------16:13----------
let's let's talk about this for a second


---------16:14----------
so you said so let me okay I'm gonna ask


---------16:17----------
you about the tangled stuff okay so so


---------16:20----------
like when you say things are tangled can


---------16:22----------
you help me understand like what like


---------16:24----------
when you wake up and you're crying on a


---------16:26----------
particular day like what kind of


---------16:28----------
thoughts are you having or what kind of


---------16:29----------
feelings are you having it's just you


---------16:40----------
know when something is so tangled it's


---------16:41----------
like where do you start


---------16:42----------
sure yeah just give me something


---------16:44----------
anything yeah I think a lot of it has to


---------16:46----------
do with like like if my personal life is


---------16:54----------
going well like with my friends or like


---------16:57----------
my relationships people in my life then


---------17:00----------
it's like okay well then I need to


---------17:01----------
problem-solve in terms of like work and


---------17:04----------
then I'll just like think about its


---------17:11----------
so hard not to cry you haven't fixed


---------17:12----------
this freak so let's stop and think about


---------17:17----------
that for a second the first thing that


---------17:20----------
you come on here and say is you say


---------17:22----------
problem solve for me fix something for


---------17:25----------
me help me not cry when you when you


---------17:30----------
notice when you set a problem for


---------17:32----------
yourself and in Iman says I don't want


---------17:34----------
to cry and then you start crying how do


---------17:38----------
you feel about yourself like what's that


---------17:39----------
like we saw frustration right like ah


---------17:42----------
you were supposed to [ __ ] help me


---------17:44----------
with this why is it so happening


---------17:47----------
I mostly frustrated with myself


---------17:50----------
absolutely why are you tell me about


---------17:53----------
that how do you how do you feel about


---------17:57----------
yourself I feel like I'm doing something


---------18:07----------
that I shouldn't and that's not


---------18:10----------
something that um works with the kind of


---------18:14----------
person that I am like I really don't


---------18:19----------
like to do things that I actively feel


---------18:21----------
are things I shouldn't do ever okay but


---------18:25----------
doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes


---------18:26----------
obviously but like when I know something


---------18:28----------
is like very clearly like right or wrong


---------18:32----------
and I feel like in this situation like


---------18:35----------
it just does not compute to be cry and


---------18:37----------
so to see myself react that way it's


---------18:40----------
very frustrating okay so what I'm


---------18:44----------
noticing is like I'm just gonna tell you


---------18:46----------
what I heard okay so look at it with me


---------18:48----------
can okay so you have a should Iman


---------18:53----------
shouldn't be crying right now I don't


---------18:56----------
know if it can you hear crying in the


---------18:57----------
background you guys hear that huh never


---------18:59----------
right okay my kid is crying she's having


---------19:04----------
a little meltdown so there is a should


---------19:10----------
and you are not that should and that


---------19:14----------
frustrates you so I think if you want to


---------19:18----------
get to the bottom of this we have to


---------19:19----------
start with like do you remember a time


---------19:24----------
when you were younger where you felt


---------19:26----------
like you should be something and you


---------19:28----------
weren't that thing I think only to give


---------19:40----------
some context basically like my parents


---------19:46----------
immigrated from Morocco to Canada when I


---------19:50----------
was like about four and I think my whole


---------19:54----------
life I've kind of just like grown up


---------19:56----------
with this feeling that I am like a very


---------19:59----------
indebted to them for that because they


---------20:02----------
did they did it to give me and my


---------20:04----------
brother about her life and so a lot of


---------20:08----------
my life has just been like trying to


---------20:10----------
make my parents proud and that's


---------20:12----------
something that means a lot to me and


---------20:16----------
that also goes hand in hand with the


---------20:19----------
like you know doing the right thing sort


---------20:22----------
of thing and that's I like things that I


---------20:26----------
generally feel like my parents would


---------20:28----------
disapprove of like I just can't bring


---------20:31----------
myself to do I don't drink I don't do


---------20:33----------
drugs like I I just like generally try


---------20:36----------
to stay away from stuff that could ever


---------20:37----------
result in them being disappointed in me


---------20:40----------
but I think also that has probably


---------20:42----------
prevented me from ever like like going


---------20:45----------
out and experiencing much in life I also


---------20:48----------
feel like now I am very indebted to like


---------20:52----------
my community and to my viewers for


---------20:57----------
giving you the life that I have and so


---------20:59----------
frequently it just feels like I have all


---------21:04----------
these


---------21:05----------
like telling me what they expect from me


---------21:09----------
and also the problem is the problem


---------21:14----------
solver Amy has created like a system


---------21:19----------
around me that depends on me like as you


---------21:25----------
continue your years in being a content


---------21:28----------
creator you start like delegating things


---------21:30----------
you get a PA you have an agent you have


---------21:32----------
manager you Beauvoir and so I feel like


---------21:34----------
there's all these people that rely on me


---------21:35----------
to do what I need to do in order for


---------21:38----------
them to do what they need to do and I


---------21:41----------
guess recently I've just been thinking a


---------21:43----------
lot about all the all those things and


---------21:45----------
maybe it's starting to feel a bit


---------21:47----------
overwhelming okay so I feel like this


---------21:59----------
should and should not come from a lot of


---------22:03----------
different angles and even now doing this


---------22:08----------
in front of you although like you know I


---------22:11----------
am trying not to look at chat and have


---------22:13----------
this just be an experience between us


---------22:15----------
too it's very nerve-wracking because it


---------22:18----------
feels like anything I do there will be


---------22:21----------
like some way to twist it negatively and


---------22:25----------
that is another reason why crying is so


---------22:27----------
frustrating cuz it's like I mean being


---------22:32----------
vulnerable in and of itself isn't easy


---------22:34----------
but also everyone that's just gonna


---------22:35----------
think that I am a fake crying Amon


---------22:38----------
Amarth


---------22:39----------
are you mean how far are you from


---------22:42----------
perfect fairy do you want to be perfect


---------22:50----------
um I don't think that's possible


---------22:55----------
why do you strive for it because does


---------23:02----------
life makes sense any other way than to


---------23:04----------
try to be I guess your best self


---------23:12----------
my friend yeah because here's the crazy


---------23:15----------
thing okay I'm gonna say something you


---------23:18----------
may not make any [ __ ] sense you are


---------23:20----------
perfect what do you think about that I


---------23:25----------
feel like that's the kind of thing like


---------23:28----------
you say to someone and you like


---------23:29----------
everyone's unique the way they are like


---------23:33----------
you're perfect the way you are I guess


---------23:34----------
that's what I hear


---------23:35----------
yeah absolutely right because I don't


---------23:37----------
think you understand that but I want you


---------23:40----------
to just think about this and I do say


---------23:42----------
[ __ ] like that but it's not it's not


---------23:43----------
because I'm trying to be positive it's


---------23:46----------
not positive I'm not I'm not trying to


---------23:48----------
prop you up I'm trying to talk about


---------23:51----------
what you are now not what you could be


---------23:55----------
like the only thing that exists in this


---------23:58----------
world is what is right so like take a


---------24:01----------
look at your tissue look at your tissue


---------24:04----------
is it a good tissue is it a good tissue


---------24:08----------
or a bad tissue or is it it's a good


---------24:11----------
tissue but why it's it's like got some


---------24:14----------
gunk on it right it's like wet it can't


---------24:16----------
absorb what it should be able to absorb


---------24:19----------
right it did its job no but but it's not


---------24:24----------
perfect because if you if you crime or


---------24:26----------
of someone else cries more like they


---------24:28----------
can't use that tissue so the question is


---------24:33----------
did you do your job like you're not


---------24:36----------
perfect right I'll accept that but did


---------24:39----------
you do your job did you do what you can


---------24:40----------
do did you do the best that you could I


---------24:45----------
feel like I don't know what that is yes


---------24:49----------
no for me to say like what is enough


---------24:54----------
absolutely and and this is the thing


---------24:56----------
you've got to understand what is enough


---------24:58----------
is exactly what you are right so like


---------25:01----------
when you look at the tissue you say it's


---------25:03----------
enough it did it did what it was


---------25:04----------
supposed to I'm content with it is it


---------25:08----------
completely dry no can it hold its


---------25:12----------
maximum amount of tears no but it's held


---------25:15----------
what's what it's needed to for now and I


---------25:17----------
don't blame it for not being drier when


---------25:20----------
it's gonna sound [ __ ] weird okay so


---------25:22----------
if I lose you let me know and if you


---------25:23----------
want to prime or let me know


---------25:25----------
I'm trying to be a little bit


---------25:27----------
philosophical and help you understand


---------25:29----------
this intellectually because I think your


---------25:31----------
your mathematical mind is something we


---------25:33----------
have to leverage that's one of your


---------25:35----------
strengths and in the idea like if you


---------25:38----------
think about an equation like an equation


---------25:40----------
can only kind of be what it is right


---------25:41----------
actually that's not true that's a bad


---------25:44----------
example you could derive the equation


---------25:47----------
and you could turn you to another


---------25:48----------
equation yeah or or I mean we can't say


---------25:50----------
one plus one is three because that's


---------25:52----------
wrong that actually reinforces the idea


---------25:54----------
of should and objective truth so what I


---------25:58----------
actually want you to be able to do is


---------25:59----------
look at your life and say one plus one


---------26:01----------
is three that what you are even though


---------26:03----------
it's not enough what the [ __ ] is my spot


---------26:10----------
if I randomly decided to turn on so did


---------26:18----------
anyway I I'm gonna bring you there


---------26:20----------
hopefully but I just put you to think


---------26:22----------
about this idea that like like you know


---------26:24----------
the only thing that can exist is like


---------26:26----------
what you are like you can't be anything


---------26:28----------
else like I can't make you so like some


---------26:31----------
people like feel like they should be an


---------26:32----------
inch taller right and they're like oh


---------26:35----------
I'm short and it's like yeah man I get


---------26:39----------
that like I get that you have good


---------26:40----------
reasons for wanting to be taller even


---------26:42----------
that you should be taller or that being


---------26:44----------
short sucks but like you literally can't


---------26:47----------
be any height but what you are right and


---------26:52----------
it's not just height that is determined


---------26:54----------
by like our karma in our biology


---------26:57----------
it's like circumstance and you kind of


---------27:02----------
feel like you should do certain things


---------27:03----------
and like I just think that that's wrong


---------27:06----------
I don't think you should do anything I


---------27:07----------
think that you are I know [ __ ] that I


---------27:11----------
say but I mean really it's not that


---------27:14----------
you're perfect it's that you are like if


---------27:16----------
I say you know the pen is here and we


---------27:21----------
can say that this pen is perfect because


---------27:22----------
it's it's exactly where it is it can't


---------27:24----------
be anywhere else I get like it literally


---------27:25----------
cannot be anywhere else that that


---------27:27----------
existence is is it's not could be like


---------27:35----------
the pen can't be anywhere else like it's


---------27:37----------
here and like now it's


---------27:39----------
here like it can't be back over here it


---------27:42----------
is here right the possibility of the pen


---------27:45----------
being here is like is not a real thing


---------27:47----------
because I move it over here but like


---------27:48----------
where's the pen it should be here or


---------27:50----------
shouldn't be it's stupid it's here it's


---------27:52----------
here and in your mind


---------27:55----------
somewhere along the way and I get I get


---------27:57----------
that I think it's brilliant that you you


---------27:59----------
know discovered that it's adaptive for


---------28:00----------
you that it helps you it supports you to


---------28:03----------
strive for perfection is responsible for


---------28:05----------
your success and okay really anyway um


---------28:19----------
so I think what we've got to get to is


---------28:21----------
like the the bottom of like where you


---------28:23----------
get this idea that you should be


---------28:27----------
something and my hypothesis and we'll


---------28:30----------
look for this okay so like oftentimes my


---------28:32----------
hypotheses are wrong so I'll say my


---------28:34----------
first hypothesis is that somewhere along


---------28:36----------
the way you felt like you were something


---------28:39----------
and someone and you really knew what you


---------28:42----------
were and that someone important to you


---------28:46----------
told you that you shouldn't be that and


---------28:50----------
then what happened is like you


---------28:53----------
calibrated away from yourself and


---------28:55----------
towards that thing and then over time


---------28:57----------
you calibrated towards should should


---------28:59----------
should should should and that's what you


---------29:01----------
that's what you kind of like set your


---------29:04----------
you know your zero towards that became


---------29:06----------
your true north and then somewhere along


---------29:08----------
the way like you got left behind is you


---------29:12----------
became pokey Eamon got left behind I can


---------29:22----------
see what you meet and where you're


---------29:25----------
coming from I think it's kind of hard


---------29:28----------
for me to think of a moment or like I


---------29:30----------
for sure like knew what I wanted to be


---------29:35----------
I've been thinking about it recently and


---------29:38----------
I do know that for quite some time I


---------29:42----------
kind of try to separate the two but


---------29:46----------
mainly in order to like um protect


---------29:49----------
myself kind of like


---------29:52----------
people would theorize or say like or try


---------29:56----------
to try to twist a lot of stuff like a


---------30:02----------
publicly I'd be like oh like all they


---------30:05----------
see is like pokey like they don't know


---------30:08----------
me personally and I'm like that's kind


---------30:11----------
of how I separated the two to kind of


---------30:14----------
like make myself feel better but um the


---------30:18----------
kind of theory that I came to recently


---------30:20----------
is more so that not that like I know or


---------30:25----------
knew what I wanted to be but that I just


---------30:27----------
haven't given myself time to like


---------30:30----------
identity develop because I've spent man


---------30:49----------
that's that that makes perfect sense to


---------30:55----------
me like that's that's like literally


---------30:56----------
what I'm saying is that like so a long


---------30:58----------
time ago and I think you've been doing


---------31:00----------
this way longer than you realize or I


---------31:02----------
mean I think you do realize it but like


---------31:03----------
way longer than before I mean how long


---------31:05----------
have you in streaming on Twitch six or


---------31:09----------
seven years and it is it okay to ask


---------31:12----------
people how old they are on Twitter is


---------31:14----------
that not okay yeah okay I also think


---------31:17----------
about that I'm 23 and it's like some of


---------31:20----------
the most formative years of my life I've


---------31:22----------
spent like working to the point of


---------31:25----------
giving myself health issues and just


---------31:27----------
stressing about like pleasing others and


---------31:31----------
what others think and not accusing


---------31:34----------
myself anytime to just like live life


---------31:36----------
and figure out who the [ __ ] I want to be


---------31:39----------
or I'm happy with mmm


---------31:42----------
yeah man I think


---------31:44----------
that [ __ ] figured out all on your own


---------31:48----------
but I've only gotten not far and I've


---------31:51----------
only gotten that far from freaking


---------31:52----------
crying for a week straight


---------31:54----------
good for you so let's think about this


---------32:02----------
right so what I'm hearing is also a


---------32:04----------
subtle should that I should have spent


---------32:10----------
more time on identity to develop yeah


---------32:12----------
that that - it's not like oh I can just


---------32:16----------
like look at myself and Vic oh this is


---------32:18----------
just like how I've ended up it's that is


---------32:24----------
like I feel like talking to pokey and


---------32:29----------
Iman and I think the point here is that


---------32:32----------
pokey doesn't let Iman grow and you're


---------32:36----------
beating yourself up for being pokey too


---------32:38----------
much but that in and of itself is pokey


---------32:40----------
talking right I mean the thing is like I


---------32:45----------
don't see it as like I don't know I


---------32:50----------
don't like see it as an alter ego or


---------32:52----------
really if you like the problem


---------32:58----------
no go for it I'm just gonna say I feel


---------33:01----------
like that problem solver part of me


---------33:04----------
isn't necessarily like only part of like


---------33:07----------
my work side or yeah no no no no it's


---------33:13----------
it's it's not it's not part of your work


---------33:15----------
only like as this what I'm saying like


---------33:17----------
your your tendency to gravitate towards


---------33:20----------
should started way before he started


---------33:22----------
streaming on Twitch and I think you're


---------33:24----------
spot on that you know I didn't realize


---------33:26----------
how young you were but I mean if you


---------33:29----------
started streaming on Twitch at the age


---------33:30----------
of sixteen you're damn right that like a


---------33:32----------
lot of identity development is gonna be


---------33:34----------
kind of you know like stunted to be


---------33:36----------
blunt right so like like 16 to 23 is


---------33:39----------
when when you know people go to college


---------33:42----------
and like I don't know who the [ __ ] I was


---------33:43----------
until I was like 28 least two years yeah


---------33:51----------
and and so like you know so I think it's


---------33:54----------
okay to not know who you are at the age


---------33:56----------
of 23 like people think that 23


---------33:58----------
is adults but like not really I mean


---------34:00----------
people are like developmentally younger


---------34:02----------
because I think the challenges that we


---------34:04----------
face are likely far more complex what


---------34:06----------
we're is what are we're psychology and


---------34:08----------
brains are assaulted by on a daily basis


---------34:10----------
growing up has changed like it's not


---------34:12----------
like we're living in the woods and like


---------34:13----------
it's the same [ __ ] [ __ ] every day you


---------34:16----------
know it's like it's issues of identity


---------34:18----------
and confusion and and what the world is


---------34:21----------
like my grandmother did not know that


---------34:22----------
other places existed it gets a bizarre


---------34:25----------
thing to think about but like she like


---------34:27----------
literally did not know that other


---------34:28----------
locations were real things like she grew


---------34:31----------
up in her village and she had heard of


---------34:33----------
places but they were like Neverland or


---------34:35----------
stories like Bombay was like a place


---------34:39----------
that people went like it was a story


---------34:41----------
like she had conceptualized that it was


---------34:43----------
actually a geographical location where


---------34:45----------
there are stairs and doorways and cars


---------34:47----------
and people and that the world was like a


---------34:49----------
place it was like a myth but now the


---------34:53----------
world has become a real place and


---------34:54----------
they're in it like even compared to you


---------34:56----------
know 20 years ago the opinions that you


---------35:00----------
had to deal with were like localized to


---------35:02----------
the people that you met but enter the


---------35:05----------
internet where now you can get judged by


---------35:07----------
hundreds of thousands of people are


---------35:10----------
millions of people and you used to deal


---------35:12----------
with the judgment of the kids in school


---------35:14----------
it's like the same thirty [ __ ] kids


---------35:16----------
and now you have millions of people who


---------35:19----------
can judge you know much about preteens


---------35:22----------
and teens in this day and age the other


---------35:26----------
father mental health yeah they're


---------35:29----------
they're really it's it's bad and it's


---------35:32----------
gonna get worse and anyway but so this


---------35:36----------
is this is the thing you want III think


---------35:38----------
I think even the way that you beat


---------35:41----------
yourself up for not having developed


---------35:44----------
your identity is another shot so we got


---------35:46----------
to get to the bottom of the should and


---------35:48----------
you're absolutely right that should is


---------35:49----------
adaptive okay so oddly enough I feel


---------35:52----------
like I'm well equipped to help you


---------35:55----------
because the people that I work with in


---------35:57----------
my day job I think have very similar


---------35:59----------
problems to you which is that they've


---------36:02----------
flagellated themselves into success and


---------36:05----------
they're like they wake up one day and


---------36:08----------
they're they're you know you're


---------36:09----------
apparently Twitter oil tea and


---------36:11----------
and you know in their case they're like


---------36:13----------
managing director at like Goldman Sachs


---------36:15----------
or they're like a physician at Harvard


---------36:18----------
Medical School and and they wake up huh


---------36:21----------
and they say the same thing they're like


---------36:24----------
but I am all of these things like why do


---------36:26----------
I deserve like why am i crime guy


---------36:28----------
shouldn't be [ __ ] crime and then I


---------36:30----------
tell them like well maybe you should


---------36:31----------
like stop flagellating yourself and stop


---------36:33----------
trying to be better and they're like I


---------36:35----------
don't know how to do that I don't know


---------36:37----------
what that looks like


---------36:38----------
that's that's me smiley yeah right like


---------36:42----------
I don't know what acceptance and this is


---------36:45----------
another one of those you know yoga


---------36:48----------
calendar flower kind of things like


---------36:51----------
accept yourself man no but like you


---------36:54----------
literally like that's not like a thing


---------36:56----------
on a yoga calendar that's something that


---------36:58----------
you literally it's like the pen right


---------37:00----------
like you can't be anything but what are


---------37:02----------
its like silly like you literally you


---------37:05----------
can't be an inch taller you can't be


---------37:07----------
more developed in terms of an identity


---------37:11----------
perspective you can't be any of those


---------37:13----------
things because you are what you are you


---------37:14----------
the past is what it is you know we're


---------37:16----------
talking about engineering and


---------37:17----------
mathematics like if you build a


---------37:19----------
structure in a particular way that


---------37:20----------
structure can either bare away or it


---------37:23----------
can't bear weight like you can't what


---------37:25----------
should bear is actually completely


---------37:27----------
irrelevant because either it's capable


---------37:29----------
or it's incapable it's a fact but you


---------37:32----------
don't view yourself as a fact you view


---------37:34----------
yourself as a fiction you view yourself


---------37:36----------
as a should you're not a building you're


---------37:41----------
an architectural diagram you're like a


---------37:43----------
building who looks at an architectural


---------37:45----------
diagram like a different building and


---------37:47----------
says I shouldn't be that but that's like


---------37:48----------
it's like little like a building can't


---------37:49----------
be visas anything about what it is but I


---------37:52----------
also feel like I'm a building but I am


---------37:56----------
the architect of the building that is me


---------37:58----------
so I can change myself to ideally be


---------38:00----------
what I would like to be but I know that


---------38:03----------
isn't really feasible in a lot of


---------38:05----------
aspects but in some of them no because


---------38:09----------
it's it's a reasonable ocean so it's a


---------38:11----------
reasonable thing to think because you've


---------38:13----------
done that right you've been a building


---------38:16----------
who says I want to be one-story taller


---------38:18----------
and then you figured out how to like get


---------38:20----------
people to build you another story and


---------38:22----------
then you said I want to be one-story


---------38:23----------
taller


---------38:24----------
and you figured out how to do that you


---------38:25----------
figured out how to do that so the funny


---------38:27----------
thing is that you've actually given


---------38:28----------
yourself evidence to believe that you


---------38:30----------
can be something that you are not and I


---------38:33----------
still think this goes all the way back


---------38:35----------
to like I mean so


---------38:43----------
I'm thinking about how to say this tell


---------38:47----------
me about your indebtedness to your


---------38:48----------
parents could I also mention one other


---------38:51----------
thing sure um when I think about I guess


---------38:58----------
all of the stuff we've talked about


---------39:00----------
namely I guess um my lack of like giving


---------39:07----------
myself a break over all these years


---------39:09----------
maybe one of the reasons I cry so much


---------39:12----------
is like I feel like I'm mourning over


---------39:15----------
that I was like it's it's so weird I


---------39:20----------
don't really know how to explain it but


---------39:22----------
like I feel really sad for myself yes


---------39:29----------
absolutely because in what I'm telling


---------39:32----------
you I stopped at 17 18 19 20 21 22 it's


---------39:37----------
that's a brilliant of this I'm telling


---------39:40----------
you like so I'm I'm gonna go back to


---------39:41----------
this this idea right so like there was a


---------39:43----------
Mon when you were very young and and


---------39:46----------
there was something that you knew you


---------39:48----------
were and I'm not talking about like you


---------39:50----------
knew you were you know wanted to be an


---------39:52----------
engineer like and then like there was


---------39:55----------
like something that someone told you


---------39:56----------
like hey you should be something


---------39:58----------
different and then you you went towards


---------40:01----------
that thing and then like a little voice


---------40:03----------
inside you said like hey that's not who


---------40:05----------
I am and then this other boy said no no


---------40:07----------
but that's not me you should like you


---------40:09----------
shouldn't be what you are you should be


---------40:10----------
what these people tell you to be and


---------40:12----------
then you went further and further and


---------40:14----------
further and further and further away


---------40:15----------
from that voice and I think what you


---------40:18----------
feel right now is pity you feel pity


---------40:20----------
towards yourself you're mourning because


---------40:23----------
like there was like a little girl in


---------40:25----------
there who like had feelings that were


---------40:29----------
completely fair and legitimate and pokey


---------40:32----------
told her to shut the [ __ ] up and sit in


---------40:35----------
the closet because we have [ __ ] to do


---------40:38----------
and so morning morning is exactly what


---------40:41----------
you have to do and let's just think


---------40:43----------
about what mourning means right


---------40:45----------
because mourning is not about should


---------40:47----------
like let's just think about what is


---------40:49----------
mourning if we think about acceptance


---------40:51----------
and and should


---------40:53----------
what does mourning mean when do we more


---------40:57----------
I know it's so kind of weird has like


---------41:02----------
died or passed yeah but just think about


---------41:06----------
that like when I'm so my dad passed away


---------41:09----------
a few years ago and and I remember like


---------41:12----------
mourning him yeah it's all good please


---------41:13----------
I'm cool with that he's cool with it


---------41:19----------
yeah so sorry I mean I appreciate the


---------41:24----------
sentiment but you know so if we think


---------41:27----------
about that like if I'm mourning do I


---------41:31----------
think to myself he should still be alive


---------41:33----------
today I guess okay so when I've


---------41:41----------
completed morning do I think that to


---------41:43----------
myself


---------41:45----------
you've accepted exactly because should


---------41:50----------
is the opposite of morning like should


---------41:53----------
as saying that this person should not be


---------41:55----------
dead but they [ __ ] are right and so


---------41:59----------
you can tell yourself that they should


---------42:01----------
be alive and it's like you can say it's


---------42:03----------
a it is a tragedy and you can say like


---------42:05----------
they should be alive but like should


---------42:07----------
cannot exist with morning and morning is


---------42:10----------
the process of taking should to


---------42:12----------
acceptance so you should absolutely be


---------42:15----------
doing that I think it's awesome that


---------42:17----------
that's the way that you feel because


---------42:18----------
that means you're doing it right so give


---------42:22----------
yourself a pat on the back you're doing


---------42:23----------
exactly what you shouldn't be doing good


---------42:26----------
job I'm on a plus I don't want


---------42:28----------
validation from that though I don't want


---------42:30----------
validation from just feeling like I'm


---------42:32----------
doing what I should be doing I think


---------42:35----------
every everyone's aware of that right so


---------42:38----------
the way so it's good that like yeah


---------42:42----------
because I mean yeah because I'm giving


---------42:46----------
you the A+ and I'm laughing at it and


---------42:49----------
then you're noticing the absurdity of it


---------42:51----------
and then you're saying I don't want


---------42:52----------
validation from it and I'm giving you a


---------42:54----------
caricature a hyperbole a validation


---------42:56----------
because I'm giving you a [ __ ] A+


---------42:58----------
which is what you wanted all your life


---------42:59----------
and therein we see that the beast within


---------43:02----------
you is fed so Imani I said this a lot of


---------43:08----------
times about my frustrations with taunts


---------43:11----------
creation which is that there is no


---------43:13----------
rubric and like you know my whole life


---------43:15----------
I've just loved school and it's just all


---------43:17----------
about rubrics and finally feeling like


---------43:20----------
okay when I score at 90 or above like


---------43:22----------
that means I did good I did my job and I


---------43:24----------
can go play video games and rest at


---------43:26----------
night but you know when I'm stuck in a


---------43:30----------
position where there is like numbers


---------43:32----------
don't stop there is no you've done


---------43:36----------
enough and I don't know how to set that


---------43:38----------
for myself at all even though and I am


---------43:42----------
DubLi who's that's how you pronounce the


---------43:44----------
word or EE frustrated with myself


---------43:46----------
because I know it's do we okay perfect


---------43:50----------
I'm DubLi frustrated with myself because


---------43:55----------
it's something that I've known for a


---------43:57----------
long time but it's just a problem not


---------43:58----------
like I don't know how to solve yeah so


---------44:01----------
so it's actually doubly and the way that


---------44:04----------
you solve it is by using the word DubLi


---------44:09----------
cuz that's you can't you're not allowed


---------44:12----------
to say w so like literally really like


---------44:16----------
the way good you should [ __ ] say it


---------44:18----------
that way because it's wrong I'm English


---------44:24----------
what was the second language I learned


---------44:26----------
and there are so many words that I just


---------44:27----------
like can't properly pronounce like that


---------44:29----------
so my bad but no no you're missing the


---------44:32----------
point


---------44:33----------
no English is a second let me let me


---------44:37----------
repeat back to you what you said and you


---------44:39----------
tell me which statement is wrong right


---------44:41----------
you correct your homework so you get an


---------44:43----------
a-plus English is the second language I


---------44:46----------
learned it's hard for me to pronounce


---------44:49----------
all words correctly my bad


---------44:53----------
which widget where's the problem say


---------44:56----------
many Mon my bad or the whole the whole


---------45:02----------
thing really just a my bad right you're


---------45:07----------
doing it wrong go [ __ ] yourselves I'm


---------45:11----------
doing it do bleep like that's that's how


---------45:19----------
you learn it right by telling that part


---------45:22----------
of you that's like hey you should be


---------45:23----------
something else you're like now


---------45:25----------
I'm gonna do this today and that's what


---------45:30----------
acceptance is it's there we could go


---------45:34----------
back and talk about your past but like


---------45:36----------
you know that's what you've got to do


---------45:37----------
you've got to like like think like think


---------45:38----------
about this like think about the thing


---------45:39----------
that you should be doing right whether


---------45:42----------
it's like you pick something and then


---------45:44----------
you don't do it and then you you look at


---------45:48----------
that beast because here's the thing look


---------45:50----------
what happens when you feed a beast


---------46:01----------
beautiful what have you been doing -


---------46:06----------
should your entire life feeding if that


---------46:10----------
grows and it grows and it grows and now


---------46:13----------
you've hit your breaking point because


---------46:16----------
this thing has grown so big it's this


---------46:18----------
it's like a wolf that's the size of an


---------46:19----------
elephant and you just can't feed it


---------46:21----------
enough anymore and it's hungry and it's


---------46:24----------
saying Eamon it's not enough I'm still


---------46:26----------
hungry you should eat better and you're


---------46:28----------
like how how much better do you want me


---------46:30----------
to be and it's like I don't and it's


---------46:32----------
like I don't know but give me more food


---------46:34----------
find some way to make yourself better


---------46:36----------
that's the compulsion and you're like


---------46:38----------
okay I fixed I fixed my relationships


---------46:40----------
and it's like I want more and you're


---------46:42----------
like okay I'm gonna become a successful


---------46:44----------
twitch streamer it's like I want more


---------46:45----------
okay and then you put yourself up on the


---------46:49----------
altar of sacrifice and you say I should


---------46:51----------
be better because you fixed everything


---------46:53----------
else in the outside world and then you


---------46:54----------
give it yourself and you say oh I should


---------46:57----------
be better and then it's like ah good now


---------47:00----------
I'm satisfied because you're never gonna


---------47:02----------
feel better right you can always feed it


---------47:03----------
yourself you know always find something


---------47:06----------
about yourself that isn't good enough


---------47:07----------
and it's just growing and growing and


---------47:10----------
growing in the way that you stop is you


---------47:11----------
stop feeding the beast and then it's


---------47:14----------
gonna hurt because it's like it's gonna


---------47:16----------
feel hungry and hunger doesn't feel good


---------47:18----------
and then you sit with that and so I


---------47:23----------
don't know what it is but like there's


---------47:24----------
got to be a thousand things that you


---------47:26----------
should be doing like what are they


---------47:34----------
I should probably like call my parents


---------47:40----------
more I should make more content I


---------47:42----------
shouldn't like diversify I should make


---------47:44----------
sure I'm responding to these emails and


---------47:46----------
these projects and these sponsor


---------47:48----------
liaisons and blah blah Blee blah and on


---------47:50----------
top of that there are so many people


---------47:52----------
that like rely on me doing these things


---------47:54----------
not only that but they require a lot of


---------47:56----------
direction from me but also I hired them


---------47:58----------
to do the stuff so it only really makes


---------48:00----------
sense and it's just like an endless list


---------48:04----------
yeah so what is one thing that you


---------48:06----------
cannot do today okay I mean I don't know


---------48:20----------
I I will respond to work stuff good for


---------48:29----------
you


---------48:30----------
how does that feel I mean to be honest I


---------48:35----------
have been having these like episodes of


---------48:37----------
just like indulging and not doing [ __ ]


---------48:39----------
for a solid like 12 hours like I guess


---------48:44----------
24 hours if you include sleeve and


---------48:46----------
that's what well like feel really nice


---------48:50----------
in the moment sort of a bit guilty I


---------48:54----------
struggle with a lot of that guilt yeah


---------48:57----------
like well just like flip-flop back and


---------48:59----------
forth between like how long can I go


---------49:02----------
without feeling guilty feels so good


---------49:05----------
just play video games for no reason with


---------49:07----------
no one watching and then at some point


---------49:09----------
it's like I'm really guilty I need to


---------49:11----------
like do all this stuff that's what needs


---------49:13----------
to change right so like what you need to


---------49:15----------
do is don't flip-flop don't flip-flop


---------49:18----------
balance the problem here is that you've


---------49:20----------
got a seesaw and you're like Iman needs


---------49:24----------
some time to herself and then pokies


---------49:26----------
like no you don't get [ __ ] time any


---------49:28----------
minds like but I feel good and pokies


---------49:29----------
like no no no you guys like you need to


---------49:32----------
be you need to be in the middle right


---------49:34----------
you need to say like okay I'm gonna do


---------49:35----------
this for awhile and the dog that's


---------49:38----------
hungry you're gonna tell the dog like


---------49:40----------
hey man I know it's gonna hurt you're


---------49:42----------
gonna get fed tomorrow and I'm not going


---------49:45----------
to neglect you like pokey


---------49:47----------
serves a seat at the table - like she


---------49:49----------
deserves to be there and she's bitter


---------49:51----------
helped you out a lot and you're not


---------49:52----------
trying to tell her that she's a bad


---------49:53----------
person but at the same time like Iman


---------49:56----------
needs some time to herself and like you


---------50:00----------
can sit with both of those right like


---------50:01----------
you can sit with like I am NOT going to


---------50:03----------
live up to my responsibilities and I'm


---------50:05----------
gonna feel guilty and that's okay I


---------50:07----------
don't have to give in to the guilt and I


---------50:10----------
also don't have to try to conquer it


---------50:12----------
like this is the problem that people


---------50:13----------
have is they try to conquer their


---------50:15----------
negative emotions and you started you


---------50:19----------
started like from the [ __ ] get-go


---------50:21----------
first words out of your mouth how do I


---------50:24----------
not cry how are we doing oh we're okay


---------50:29----------
we're on the right track how did we do


---------50:34----------
that just talking no letting it it's not


---------50:41----------
just talking in correct answer now how


---------50:44----------
do you feel


---------50:45----------
notice how do you feel


---------50:49----------
scrambling for correct on answer trying


---------50:51----------
to compute good soup that [ __ ] you're


---------50:55----------
not gonna find it anything you say I'm


---------50:57----------
gonna say you're wrong that's good I


---------51:03----------
guess like challenge there's a word I'm


---------51:05----------
looking for that I could find but it


---------51:07----------
doesn't matter this is the kind of like


---------51:09----------
back and forth that I feel is actually


---------51:11----------
conducive or constructive to what I need


---------51:18----------
I'm trying to figure out how your


---------51:21----------
squirtle related with that it's


---------51:23----------
squirrely there's squirrel eNOS in there


---------51:25----------
see damn it your money come on no see


---------51:31----------
see even now you're saying but I'm like


---------51:33----------
that statement is saying I'm doing the


---------51:36----------
thing that I should be to grow to be a


---------51:37----------
better person I mean this does feel nice


---------51:42----------
though I know it feels nice but like do


---------51:44----------
you see how deep it is it's like even


---------51:46----------
then the reason you're okay with it


---------51:48----------
because because beneath all of the


---------51:50----------
discomfort you're actually growing


---------51:51----------
you're actually moving towards should I


---------51:54----------
think also it just kind of feels nice to


---------51:58----------
not cry for like three minutes


---------52:01----------
yeah focus on that and not so much think


---------52:04----------
about oh this is going in a good way yes


---------52:09----------
good yeah right so that's that's the pen


---------52:13----------
here you're like oh like for that pens


---------52:14----------
actually like we're fine with the pen


---------52:15----------
being here it doesn't need to be


---------52:16----------
anywhere else and you're absolutely


---------52:18----------
right that that feels good and so now


---------52:20----------
I'm gonna have a crazy crazy thought for


---------52:22----------
you it's not because we're talking it's


---------52:24----------
not because you're venting it's because


---------52:26----------
you are being where you are that's why


---------52:30----------
you're not crying and that's why you're


---------52:32----------
laughing and this is what would the


---------52:34----------
discovered he called it bliss and people


---------52:38----------
don't even know what that means being


---------52:41----------
where you are is bliss and being where


---------52:44----------
are you thinking about where you should


---------52:46----------
be is suffering so you don't you're not


---------52:53----------
getting better at this you can't get


---------52:55----------
better at this you can't level up you


---------52:59----------
can just do it or not do it in a given


---------53:01----------
moment and no amount of doing it before


---------53:04----------
it is actually untrue but no amount of


---------53:06----------
doing it because your brain can change


---------53:07----------
and there's neuroscience at Bolton and


---------53:09----------
all that [ __ ] but just pretend for a


---------53:12----------
motor work with me no amount of doing it


---------53:15----------
is going to change the fact that you


---------53:17----------
have to do it today and now like this is


---------53:19----------
the battle that you have to fight right


---------53:21----------
is like you have to say like okay


---------53:22----------
there's a part of me that wants to be


---------53:23----------
better and like I'm just gonna talk now


---------53:25----------
I'm gonna do the thing into here and now


---------53:28----------
because if you think about all of those


---------53:29----------
shoulds those shoulds are about the


---------53:31----------
future they're not about now they're


---------53:33----------
about like I should do this so that this


---------53:35----------
person can do this I should do this so


---------53:37----------
that this person can do this and then I


---------53:38----------
have to do this and I shouldn't call my


---------53:39----------
parents more because why should you call


---------53:41----------
your pants more because they could die


---------53:42----------
one day and if they died one day and


---------53:44----------
then I'd be guilty because I didn't call


---------53:45----------
me oh my god yeah oh my god yeah that's


---------53:53----------
my brain except like you know for


---------53:55----------
another like two minutes yeah absolutely


---------53:58----------
and then you get exhausted to that in


---------54:01----------
the brain's like hey next thing the next


---------54:03----------
thing to beat ourselves up over beat


---------54:05----------
herself up beat yourself up beat ourself


---------54:07----------
up and you're absolutely right that this


---------54:08----------
is instrumental to your success


---------54:11----------
absolutely right because unless you beat


---------54:13----------
yourself up


---------54:14----------
so you have a high degree of neuroticism


---------54:16----------
and conscientiousness from the Big Five


---------54:18----------
personality kind of if you know what any


---------54:21----------
action is but what that means is that


---------54:23----------
like you're you're basically like a med


---------54:24----------
student you're like a [ __ ] trihard


---------54:26----------
medicine I hate these kids okay no I was


---------54:31----------
not a med student


---------54:31----------
I was an end student and there's a


---------54:33----------
difference okay all the same stem is all


---------54:36----------
the same all the STEM fields disagree


---------54:39----------
but okay all you get where you're coming


---------54:42----------
from if I didn't go into NJ I would have


---------54:44----------
got into med I know you don't have to


---------54:46----------
tell me that


---------54:49----------
Muraki


---------54:50----------
you know Moroccan immigrants coming to


---------54:52----------
the US or Canada like come on thinking


---------54:57----------
about that so much I've literally not


---------55:01----------
only been like daydreaming but just


---------55:03----------
regular dreaming fantasizing about like


---------55:06----------
going back to school


---------55:08----------
please tell me you're not going to


---------55:10----------
become a dog no I I don't think I could


---------55:13----------
become a doctor but yes just like going


---------55:17----------
back to school and I know I shouldn't be


---------55:23----------
look it is not ideal seems like you


---------55:32----------
don't you don't get to you don't get to


---------55:34----------
just change the words and still have the


---------55:36----------
thoughts I know I know I mean you know I


---------55:41----------
was gonna call you a four year but


---------55:44----------
that's okay that's you actually calling


---------55:46----------
attention to it which is fine that's


---------55:48----------
beautiful that's what you should do you


---------55:49----------
should know that that's you noticing it


---------55:51----------
that's I think it's my brains way of you


---------55:54----------
know again trying to problem-solve like


---------55:57----------
oh I'm not happy with the way my life is


---------55:59----------
how about I go back three years when I


---------56:02----------
was in university doing engineering and


---------56:05----------
whatever maybe then I would be well I


---------56:07----------
mean I no no no I I don't know that


---------56:10----------
that's just problem solving because that


---------56:11----------
could be you mom that could that could


---------56:15----------
be him on saying I actually want to go


---------56:17----------
back and have some of those experiences


---------56:19----------
that I missed out on because I deserve


---------56:21----------
them maybe it's problem-solving maybe


---------56:25----------
it's that I don't know what do you think


---------56:27----------
I think when it's specifically in


---------56:32----------
regards to like going back to school


---------56:34----------
it's it was just like that sentiment of


---------56:37----------
like life being simpler because I could


---------56:40----------
live by a rubric but I do think in


---------56:43----------
general when I just think about the


---------56:46----------
amount of time that I've been streaming


---------56:48----------
I think about those also quarantine has


---------56:53----------
really made me think about I guess all


---------56:57----------
the experiences I probably missed out on


---------56:59----------
especially because I had a lot of


---------57:01----------
traveling plans for this year and I felt


---------57:04----------
like that was one of the ways that I


---------57:05----------
could simultaneously do my job but


---------57:07----------
experience new things and feel like I'm


---------57:11----------
like growing as a person or allowing


---------57:13----------
myself to develop some sort of identity


---------57:16----------
that I'm happy with or experience good


---------57:18----------
and bad and now feeling like I guess I


---------57:22----------
can't get to do that it further imposes


---------57:27----------
the fact that I really haven't gotten to


---------57:29----------
in the past and I just feel sad


---------57:38----------
I'm gonna think for a second so


---------57:41----------
sometimes I have these this is one of


---------57:49----------
those moments can she hear me I guess


---------57:51----------
not


---------57:51----------
so I can say this I'll just wait for


---------58:01----------
this is one of those moments can you


---------58:04----------
hear me no huh and this is one of those


---------58:07----------
moments I have these moments sometimes


---------58:10----------
when I'm talking to people and generally


---------58:12----------
speaking in my day job but remember this


---------58:14----------
isn't psychiatry okay


---------58:18----------
so I have these moments where someone


---------58:21----------
says something important and profound


---------58:22----------
that I just have this emotional reaction


---------58:24----------
that it's gonna sound like a complete


---------58:26----------
[ __ ] and I just I couldn't care less


---------58:28----------
okay but good like like I mean I get


---------58:33----------
that you had all these ideas about


---------58:35----------
yourself and like but even then it


---------58:36----------
seemed like it's so subtle it's it


---------58:38----------
because it's the same [ __ ] it's like


---------58:39----------
you're trying to figure out how to be a


---------58:41----------
better you mm-hmm you're like oh like I


---------58:44----------
had this like frankly it infuriates me


---------58:48----------
actually a little bit what do you think


---------58:49----------
about like you know I was gonna travel


---------58:51----------
and still work but like you're still


---------58:52----------
feeding that same beast you're trying to


---------58:54----------
find you're not that's not actually


---------58:58----------
gonna I mean it's gonna help the little


---------59:00----------
Iman in me was like I found a compromise


---------59:03----------
exactly yeah but I think the problem is


---------59:11----------
that that you don't deserve a compromise


---------59:14----------
you deserve Iman Iman needs to get her


---------59:19----------
seven years back like traveling and and


---------59:24----------
streaming it's not like I'm not saying


---------59:26----------
don't do it right because if that sounds


---------59:27----------
wonderful and fun and all that good


---------59:29----------
stuff it sound like a great idea and at


---------59:32----------
the same time like don't confuse


---------59:33----------
yourself that that's I mean it's a step


---------59:35----------
in the right direction but it's not the


---------59:37----------
route like the route is that like you


---------59:40----------
should be able to travel and not work I


---------59:45----------
will have a lot of people telling you


---------59:48----------
otherwise that's fine so so


---------59:51----------
but then then we get back to like okay


---------59:53----------
so like Oh what are you telling me Amon


---------59:55----------
are you telling me that you're living


---------59:56----------
your life for others huh yes but to be


---------60:05----------
fair that's also like where I derive the


---------60:09----------
most satisfaction okay fine so I don't


---------60:13----------
think oh yeah yeah so I don't think that


---------60:16----------
you should ignore others and I think


---------60:18----------
that's part of your entire MA


---------60:19----------
so daughter mine is the son script word


---------60:20----------
for duty so I think that I to have to


---------60:22----------
live my life for others I don't think I


---------60:24----------
can just stop streaming now and I think


---------60:26----------
that that's fine but at least I


---------60:29----------
acknowledge and I think this is what


---------60:31----------
you've got to think about is like it's


---------60:32----------
okay to do things for other people but


---------60:35----------
you should understand sizz not that you


---------60:38----------
don't don't do things for other people


---------60:39----------
it's that you devalue yourself for maybe


---------60:43----------
not wanting to do those things there's a


---------60:46----------
huge difference between saying I'm gonna


---------60:49----------
eat I'm sitting there for getting my


---------60:53----------
afternoon coffee I used to have this


---------60:55----------
problem all the time it I trained at


---------60:58----------
this place called Massachusetts General


---------60:59----------
Hospital and so I was I was at MGH and I


---------61:02----------
was sitting there getting my 4:00 p.m.


---------61:03----------
coffee because I was tired and


---------61:04----------
overworked and all that [ __ ]


---------61:05----------
and I'd get my coffee and then in in the


---------61:08----------
little display case they'd have like


---------61:09----------
this like healthy muffin and they have a


---------61:12----------
chocolate chip cookie and I would have a


---------61:16----------
struggle every day and the turnout that


---------61:19----------
the bran muffin was actually pretty good


---------61:20----------
and and so I would eat the bran muffin


---------61:23----------
and there's a big difference between


---------61:24----------
saying I'm gonna eat the bran muffin


---------61:26----------
even though I want the chocolate chip


---------61:28----------
cookie and saying I should want the bran


---------61:32----------
muffin over the chocolate chip cookie


---------61:35----------
and I think there's a big difference


---------61:37----------
between doing something because you


---------61:39----------
think it's the right thing to do and


---------61:40----------
because it's a sacrifice and beating


---------61:42----------
yourself up because that's not something


---------61:44----------
that you don't want to do I have no


---------61:47----------
problem with you trying to support your


---------61:49----------
community or do things that are like


---------61:51----------
good for the people on Twitch which is


---------61:52----------
great I'm behind that 100% but I want


---------61:55----------
you to be honest with yourself about


---------61:56----------
like he's that actually what you want


---------61:58----------
and if you say let I'm willing to make


---------62:01----------
the sacrifice I mean I make sacrifices


---------62:02----------
all the time my


---------62:03----------
and does this thing where once or twice


---------62:06----------
a week she wakes up at like 3 or 4 in


---------62:07----------
the morning


---------62:08----------
she can't go back to sleep she comes and


---------62:11----------
you know we tried to put her to sleep


---------62:12----------
for a while and then she's like at 5 in


---------62:14----------
the morning she's like daddy I want


---------62:16----------
noodles and I wake up and then I'm up


---------62:18----------
with her from like 4 to 7 and and you


---------62:22----------
know it's absolutely but you try getting


---------62:24----------
woken up at 4 in the morning yeah I mean


---------62:27----------
it sounds cute it's wonderful and it


---------62:29----------
makes me feel like a good dad and this


---------62:30----------
also it also sucks you know so so like I


---------62:35----------
think that the issue here is not that


---------62:37----------
you're not willing to do things that


---------62:38----------
suck the problem is that I think you


---------62:40----------
beat yourself up for not wanting to do


---------62:42----------
them mm-hmm and this still goes back to


---------62:47----------
I mean if you want to go back to the the


---------62:49----------
Trail of Tears we got to go back to like


---------62:51----------
like what was life like for you as a kid


---------62:54----------
cuz I mean that's where all this started


---------62:56----------
mm-hmm the indebtedness like it's


---------62:59----------
crushing he sounded so heavy when you


---------63:04----------
said that that word and should you be


---------63:07----------
grateful like absolutely did they do a


---------63:09----------
lot for you absolutely but I can tell


---------63:11----------
you something else that if you really


---------63:12----------
want to like get emotional that they


---------63:15----------
would be do they know how you feel it


---------63:22----------
would destroy the


---------63:23----------
damn it would destroy them


---------63:28----------
and you have to tell them because I want


---------63:32----------
you to you know what do they want for


---------63:37----------
you come on they want me to be happy I


---------63:40----------
know that and are you sometimes right so


---------63:50----------
are you gonna and this is the the other


---------63:52----------
thing is like print it's pretty smart


---------63:54----------
especially your parents I think they


---------63:59----------
know yeah baby


---------64:05----------
maybe not why don't you tell them how do


---------64:12----------
you feel I don't know it's even hard to


---------64:17----------
tell you how I feel I think it's very um


---------64:21----------
[ __ ] stranger the Internet


---------64:23----------
I feel like it's a very convoluted for


---------64:30----------
starters and also I really really I


---------64:33----------
don't like to worry my parents so even


---------64:37----------
just telling them like oh I had a bad


---------64:38----------
weekend or I'm crying or whatever it is


---------64:40----------
like especially for my mom that will


---------64:43----------
just worry the heck out of her she'll be


---------64:46----------
ringing me every like hour and if


---------64:49----------
anything that just makes me feel more


---------64:51----------
stressed out cuz now not only am I like


---------64:55----------
sad or stressed or whatever it was


---------64:56----------
initially but now I am worried about her


---------64:59----------
being worried and also kind of irritated


---------65:01----------
it's just it's a big mess it does not


---------65:04----------
feel like the kind of process that um


---------65:08----------
yeah I guess I've just learned to deal


---------65:10----------
with it on my own


---------65:11----------
yeah so you remember earlier when I was


---------65:14----------
like talking about this this moment


---------65:16----------
where you were in maan or you were pokey


---------65:18----------
and that you should do something and you


---------65:20----------
didn't do that and you did the thing


---------65:22----------
that you should do and so that being the


---------65:23----------
person that you wanted to be uh-huh I


---------65:26----------
think we just found it like in a weird


---------65:31----------
way like this makes perfect sense to me


---------65:33----------
because what I'm hearing is that you


---------65:35----------
grew up in a household that and I'm not


---------65:36----------
trying to blame your


---------65:37----------
just every household I mean my kids are


---------65:39----------
gonna be screwed up like don't you know


---------65:41----------
don't believe yourselves about that so


---------65:43----------
the children of Psychiatrists I don't


---------65:44----------
know if you guys you guys ever met


---------65:45----------
children of psychiatrists but all [ __ ]


---------65:47----------
up and and so it's just it's it just an


---------65:52----------
inevitability there's no such thing as a


---------65:53----------
perfect parent like I mean you've done


---------65:55----------
phenomenally well on so many metrics and


---------65:56----------
like you're also tortured and like we're


---------65:58----------
all tortured late if that works right


---------66:00----------
and and what I'm also hearing from you


---------66:03----------
is that fundamentally like you know when


---------66:06----------
you expressed your feelings to your mom


---------66:08----------
it sounds like you felt responsible for


---------66:11----------
worrying her and then so there was there


---------66:14----------
was like I want you to imagine


---------66:15----------
six-year-old him on who's like I don't


---------66:18----------
feel good but if mom knows then she's


---------66:21----------
not gonna feel good and so you were


---------66:25----------
protective of your parents and by not


---------66:30----------
showing them like you shoved yourself in


---------66:33----------
the closet there's like crying him on


---------66:34----------
and then there's happy him on and then


---------66:38----------
what happy him on did is she took her


---------66:40----------
crying him on and she's like get into


---------66:41----------
the closet mom's coming what you've been


---------66:50----------
doing your entire life my friend yeah I


---------66:54----------
think you should talk to your parents


---------66:57----------
pardon I think you should talk to your


---------66:59----------
parents yeah I maybe what what what


---------67:05----------
hesitation do you have what do I say


---------67:15----------
okay I can help you with that okay give


---------67:18----------
it a shot you let me know how this


---------67:19----------
sounds


---------67:20----------
your parents are still together yeah so


---------67:24----------
I think you start by telling them that


---------67:27----------
you're grateful and you can add whatever


---------67:30----------
source so tell me their story of moving


---------67:32----------
from Morocco to Canada um yeah when I


---------67:37----------
was four in Morocco it's actually funny


---------67:40----------
when I was really really young I hated


---------67:42----------
it's like school or like doing anything


---------67:45----------
like when I was little I was real wild


---------67:49----------
and then we moved to Canada


---------67:51----------
and then I became an angel sounds good


---------67:54----------
but I became very like studious it was


---------67:56----------
all about like doing what I had to do


---------67:58----------
and yeah that's just how I grew up my


---------68:00----------
mom is a teacher and my dad is like an


---------68:04----------
engineer but also taught at a university


---------68:06----------
at some point so they were always like


---------68:09----------
very supportive when it came to school


---------68:11----------
and that was like you know like I would


---------68:14----------
do on school I would get validation from


---------68:16----------
them and that was like my cycle of


---------68:18----------
happiness I guess and um oh they were


---------68:22----------
also like pretty strict it's like oh you


---------68:28----------
don't go out late like no boys in the


---------68:31----------
house like you don't hang out with too


---------68:33----------
many boys do this you do that a lot of


---------68:35----------
stuff that especially in like high


---------68:37----------
school my friends what do or could do I


---------68:40----------
wouldn't but also like maybe I had like


---------68:45----------
a little while of like being rebellious


---------68:48----------
or angry about that sort of stuff but


---------68:50----------
especially in like my later years of


---------68:52----------
high school by just kind of learned to


---------68:56----------
play around it do you know what that


---------68:57----------
it's not a saying that people use


---------68:59----------
outside of gaming I don't I don't


---------69:03----------
represent all people outside of games


---------69:06----------
what do you get what I mean oh nice they


---------69:08----------
play around I'm not sure what you mean


---------69:10----------
by that


---------69:10----------
because I don't know psychologically or


---------69:12----------
like you yeah I don't know Oh what I


---------69:16----------
mean is kind of just a work around it in


---------69:19----------
a sense work around but I know actuality


---------69:22----------
like sono idol mm-hmm so my wife for


---------69:26----------
example wasn't allowed to have boys in


---------69:27----------
the house either but she her weight


---------69:29----------
would which the way she worked around it


---------69:32----------
is that she took a ladder and would


---------69:34----------
leave it in the backyard so that people


---------69:36----------
could climb up the ladder and come in


---------69:39----------
through a balcony that's a workaround I


---------69:41----------
don't know if that's a to Mickey


---------69:42----------
um for me I mean like sometimes I would


---------69:48----------
sneak out to like get McDonald's with my


---------69:50----------
friends but I was never really


---------69:52----------
rebellious so what do you mean my


---------69:56----------
workaround was just like I found


---------69:58----------
happiness online via just gaming and I


---------70:02----------
love to game so much I was like


---------70:04----------
oh well my parents want me to stay at


---------70:06----------
home all the time anyways so sure I


---------70:08----------
guess I will forego whatever else and


---------70:10----------
just stay at home and make funds online


---------70:14----------
and then when I was seventeen that's


---------70:16----------
when I started streaming and that was


---------70:18----------
also my way of like not being so sad


---------70:22----------
about missing out on other things it was


---------70:25----------
like oh I found something else to do and


---------70:27----------
be excited about yeah so I'm gonna try


---------70:35----------
to keep things practical I'd love to


---------70:37----------
explore that further but I'm gonna try


---------70:39----------
to keep things practical and hopefully


---------70:40----------
you know you I know you want a rubric by


---------70:43----------
the time we end this so no so no but I


---------70:49----------
like rubrics too I feel frustrated if


---------70:51----------
there isn't some sense of progress at


---------70:53----------
the end of it so we can we can be


---------70:57----------
partners in crime there so thinking a


---------71:00----------
little bit about it I mean I would start


---------71:01----------
by just talking to them about like I


---------71:03----------
would start with exactly what you told


---------71:04----------
me which is that you're grateful and


---------71:06----------
also feel indebted to them that you need


---------71:09----------
to be happy in life and then you can


---------71:14----------
even you know add color like you kind of


---------71:16----------
did to mine like I don't know I mean I'm


---------71:18----------
the son of immigrants as well so there's


---------71:20----------
like a powerful story there in my mind


---------71:22----------
about sacrifices that they made to come


---------71:24----------
here and I mean my parents you know


---------71:27----------
we're in like had to borrow money for


---------71:29----------
the plane ticket and and because they


---------71:32----------
couldn't afford a plane ticket and so


---------71:34----------
they came here with like two suitcases


---------71:35----------
in debt and and you know it's it's it's


---------71:40----------
a powerful story of like a lot of


---------71:41----------
sacrifice and like I remember my dad


---------71:46----------
when he was like in high school like


---------71:49----------
they had they like singing class and so


---------71:54----------
he went to singing class like all kids


---------71:56----------
do and then like his say is his music


---------71:59----------
teacher thought that he was like


---------72:01----------
talented so he's like you should come


---------72:03----------
and you know join like this like Club


---------72:04----------
and so they joined the club and they


---------72:06----------
went to go compete and they won so he


---------72:11----------
won first place for singing and he went


---------72:13----------
home and he he showed his my grandmother


---------72:16----------
the trophy and can


---------72:18----------
guess what she did or what she said she


---------72:21----------
said it probably wasn't important


---------72:22----------
because I wasn't related to academics


---------72:25----------
really close she snapped it in half


---------72:28----------
threw it away smacked him upside the


---------72:30----------
head and said what the [ __ ] are you


---------72:31----------
doing wasting your time you should be


---------72:32----------
studying more mm-hmm


---------72:35----------
yeah and so he did study more and he


---------72:41----------
became a doctor and he came here in debt


---------72:43----------
and I know exactly how you feel


---------72:46----------
in terms of that indebtedness and I know


---------72:48----------
for me it manifested in a different way


---------72:49----------
because I didn't do a good job I didn't


---------72:53----------
do well in school I failed and I was


---------72:55----------
filled same for letting them down


---------72:58----------
and then and then eventually I became as


---------73:03----------
I put it all Indian parents dreams and


---------73:06----------
all Indian kids nightmare by becoming a


---------73:10----------
harvard-trained physician and then I


---------73:13----------
became I became that which I loved and


---------73:16----------
what I loved growing up was like my


---------73:18----------
parents would get tell me some random


---------73:20----------
person who I'd met once and their their


---------73:22----------
accomplishments maybe like someone so


---------73:24----------
son was like doing this like oh oh yeah


---------73:27----------
it's so-and-so like mm-hmm yeah go for


---------73:31----------
it I'm just gonna say like many years


---------73:34----------
into content creation even making like


---------73:38----------
six figures plus a year my mom would


---------73:41----------
still hit me with the are you gonna go


---------73:43----------
back and get your degree next semester


---------73:45----------
you know it's like probably yeah but


---------73:52----------
imagine how happy she's gonna be Iman


---------73:54----------
when you tell her that you're gonna go


---------73:55----------
back to school maybe that's


---------73:59----------
subconsciously oh boy that runs deep


---------74:05----------
maybe but going going back to you know


---------74:08----------
how to talk to you I mean I think you


---------74:10----------
got to talk to him and just tell them


---------74:11----------
that like you know I'm grateful and I


---------74:13----------
feel indebted and I feel like I need to


---------74:14----------
be happy but there's a part of me that


---------74:16----------
isn't and hear what they have to say and


---------74:21----------
you're gonna it's unclear what you're


---------74:24----------
gonna get like maybe your mom will start


---------74:26----------
breaking down in tears and then you can


---------74:27----------
break down to tears little you guys can


---------74:29----------
cry and all that stuff


---------74:31----------
and and and yeah and then you good then


---------74:34----------
this is the hard part right you've got


---------74:36----------
to sit with that and then you got to ask


---------74:40----------
her mom why are you crying and then


---------74:44----------
she's gonna say something just because


---------74:46----------
you're suffering and then I'm gonna say


---------74:47----------
well I'm crying because you're crying


---------74:49----------
and then you guys have to figure out


---------74:50----------
like how are you what are y'all gonna do


---------74:51----------
about that oh that's hard to imagine


---------74:58----------
yeah absolutely and this is the thing


---------75:01----------
I'm on I think you're playing a slow


---------75:04----------
player game you got to start treating


---------75:07----------
your family as party members instead of


---------75:09----------
NPCs I'm serious


---------75:13----------
right like you're carrying all of this


---------75:15----------
weight like I can't a mat I can't tell


---------75:18----------
you just the thought like if I had a


---------75:20----------
daughter in your situation it would be


---------75:21----------
so hard I would just be livid that she


---------75:24----------
was not talking these things because


---------75:25----------
that's what I'm here for right I don't


---------75:28----------
want her to protect my feelings I want


---------75:30----------
to be able to do something about them


---------75:35----------
like when my kid wakes me up at 5:00 in


---------75:37----------
the morning like of course I'm furious


---------75:39----------
but it's also like I'm glad you woke me


---------75:41----------
up because you're two and a half years


---------75:43----------
old and you can't make yourself instant


---------75:44----------
noodles I don't want you to try years


---------75:48----------
old


---------75:49----------
yeah but I'm 23 years old and so it


---------75:52----------
feels like I am old enough to the point


---------75:57----------
that like I should be able to deal with


---------75:58----------
these things there it is my parents


---------76:01----------
there it is where did you hear the word


---------76:07----------
yeah yeah but here's you shouldn't like


---------76:19----------
I mean I still rely on my mom for [ __ ]


---------76:24----------
like you know she still tries to do my


---------76:29----------
laundry and it's like it's weird I mean


---------76:36----------
you want to talk


---------76:36----------
about being like not independent I'm 37


---------76:40----------
sensibly professionally successful


---------76:42----------
independent and I live with four women


---------76:46----------
who all in some capacity take care of me


---------76:50----------
you want to talk about I don't know what


---------76:52----------
Moroccan culture is like but in Indian


---------76:54----------
culture like men are incapable of taking


---------76:57----------
care of yourselves and I'm so incapable


---------77:00----------
of taking care of myself that like one


---------77:01----------
isn't enough - is it enough three isn't


---------77:03----------
about you need I thought I'd to breed a


---------77:05----------
couple to get my needs met and it's a


---------77:09----------
beautiful it's a beautiful scary thing


---------77:10----------
the day that you have a daughter that's


---------77:11----------
old enough that can do something for you


---------77:14----------
it's it's like wonderful but it's also


---------77:16----------
like hey can you go get me that thing


---------77:18----------
from upstairs and they're like


---------77:19----------
absolutely dad and then they go in the


---------77:20----------
editor like yeah okay I can get used to


---------77:23----------
this but you got to tell him I'm on and


---------77:28----------
you got to sit with her like worry and


---------77:31----------
anxiety this is where the problem solver


---------77:33----------
in you rec needs to recognize that like


---------77:35----------
part of your reluctance to deal with


---------77:37----------
feelings probably comes as modeled


---------77:38----------
behavior from her and can you guys sit


---------77:42----------
with the idea that like there's parts of


---------77:44----------
you that are unhappy but like your life


---------77:46----------
is good and you need to share with that


---------77:48----------
with them too like don't give them one


---------77:50----------
seesaw like one part of the seesaw the


---------77:52----------
problem here is that you're you're only


---------77:53----------
giving them one half of the seesaw


---------77:56----------
give them both they'll be able to handle


---------77:58----------
it talk about how okay maybe they can I


---------78:03----------
don't know I mean I think they could I


---------78:07----------
just think it's so hard for me to I


---------78:13----------
guess I guide


---------78:15----------
long matte path of like every time I


---------78:18----------
mentioned something is not well you guys


---------78:20----------
don't need to freak out like I am NOT


---------78:24----------
dying if like I sneeze once you like you


---------78:30----------
don't need to call me every two hours if


---------78:32----------
I'm having a bad day it's fine so now


---------78:37----------
I'm confused mm-hmm for two reasons the


---------78:40----------
first is you say what do I say to them


---------78:42----------
and because you seem to have a really


---------78:45----------
good answer the second thing is you say


---------78:46----------
I should know better and it sounds like


---------78:48----------
you absolutely fine do your exactly your


---------78:51----------
spot-on right you need to sit with them


---------78:54----------
and teach them because you are an adult


---------78:56----------
actually that is the statement of an


---------78:58----------
adult is in recognizing that like you


---------79:01----------
need to explain to your parents and say


---------79:03----------
like and so now I can give you some


---------79:04----------
language around this okay so take notes


---------79:06----------
so when I tell you that I'm unhappy or I


---------79:10----------
cry what do you guys think is going on


---------79:14----------
and what do you think you have to do


---------79:16----------
about it and and just explore that with


---------79:21----------
them which is gonna be a really


---------79:22----------
confusing question like I had a two and


---------79:26----------
a half hour conversation with my mom the


---------79:27----------
other day about like some really basic


---------79:28----------
stuff about like understanding your


---------79:31----------
insides because she just doesn't like


---------79:34----------
I'm assuming that Indian Moroccan


---------79:36----------
culture because I understand a little


---------79:37----------
bit about Moroccan culture like pretty


---------79:39----------
similar in terms of you have your option


---------79:41----------
of stem field no boys in the house you


---------79:47----------
could also perhaps be a lawyer if you


---------79:48----------
want to be a little bit edgy yeah so so


---------79:52----------
in our case it wasn't edgy my dad said I


---------79:54----------
have an older brother and he told he


---------79:58----------
said that one of y'all is gonna be a


---------79:59----------
doctor and one of y'all is gonna be a


---------80:00----------
lawyer and I hate what I used to say my


---------80:03----------
med school interviews and they're like


---------80:04----------
why do you want to be a doctor like what


---------80:06----------
brings you here and I would say well yes


---------80:09----------
so I tell them that my dad told me that


---------80:12----------
one of y'all has to be a doctor when it


---------80:14----------
all has to be a lawyer and my brother's


---------80:16----------
older and he got to choose first and he


---------80:18----------
went to law school so here I am yeah and


---------80:24----------
so talk to them about you know what are


---------80:27----------
they thinking like and then asked


---------80:29----------
explicitly like some and I think you


---------80:33----------
should share like everything that you're


---------80:35----------
sharing with us right which is that you


---------80:36----------
sometimes hesitate to share things with


---------80:38----------
them because of how much it hurts them


---------80:40----------
tell them that and so like what do you


---------80:44----------
guys think about that


---------80:46----------
and then like is it okay for me to like


---------80:49----------
tell you that I'm not doing okay and


---------80:51----------
like I know it hurts you but like I'm


---------80:54----------
gonna be okay


---------80:55----------
like I'm not so worried about it oh you


---------81:00----------
know how like how they say if you have a


---------81:06----------
child you shouldn't be overly protective


---------81:09----------
of them especially when they're like


---------81:11----------
super super young and be too scared of


---------81:13----------
them getting sick because the only way


---------81:14----------
you build your immune system is by


---------81:17----------
getting sick every now and then when


---------81:19----------
you're young I I feel like I guess


---------81:21----------
that's what happened to me in terms of


---------81:23----------
just like general life experiences


---------81:24----------
absolutely beautifully point and am I'm


---------81:27----------
not supposed to be am I supposed to be


---------81:30----------
doing that I was just thinking am i


---------81:38----------
raising my kids wrong oh I don't know I


---------81:44----------
don't know you know it's it's really


---------81:46----------
it's okay you'll find out in like ten or


---------81:49----------
twenty years don't worry about it


---------81:50----------
absolutely that's the approach I'm


---------81:52----------
taking right yeah I guess maybe that's


---------81:58----------
how I see it yeah absolutely I think it


---------82:00----------
makes sense I think you are overly


---------82:02----------
protected and and by overly protected I


---------82:05----------
think what you've been protected from or


---------82:06----------
what you've been insulated against this


---------82:08----------
to a certain degree your own feelings


---------82:09----------
and emotional expression and and so


---------82:12----------
you'll be thrilled you can tell your mom


---------82:14----------
I'm on that that you know I spoke with a


---------82:16----------
guy who happens to be a psychiatrist and


---------82:18----------
he said he he said I was just like all


---------82:21----------
of the middle-aged you know Middle


---------82:25----------
Eastern and or South Asian or Asian


---------82:27----------
attorneys I'm just like that and that I


---------82:31----------
don't know how to emotionally express


---------82:33----------
myself or connect with you guys on an


---------82:34----------
emotional level and I'm also very


---------82:36----------
financially and professionally


---------82:38----------
successful and I'm deeply unhappy I mean


---------82:42----------
I don't think you do


---------82:43----------
but I don't think you're deeply unhappy


---------82:45----------
but I think you've got to connect and


---------82:46----------
this goes back to loneliness like I


---------82:48----------
don't understand you know I think you


---------82:51----------
speaking of things that you've missed


---------82:53----------
out on and things that you owe yourself


---------82:54----------
I don't I don't believe that you need to


---------82:56----------
have an NPC relationship with your


---------82:58----------
parents like that's like I mean it


---------82:59----------
sounds like you're alone from them you


---------83:01----------
you know they're they're NPCs and you


---------83:04----------
have scripted interactions with them


---------83:06----------
it's not like you know it's like you


---------83:09----------
walk up to them and it's like take your


---------83:11----------
pick


---------83:11----------
I am doing well and then she responds


---------83:13----------
with when are you going to college and


---------83:15----------
then it's like it's like literally like


---------83:16----------
a [ __ ] NPC you go up to them and then


---------83:18----------
you right click them and then they say


---------83:20----------
that like come on like what do you think


---------83:22----------
about going to college next semester and


---------83:24----------
you know like in games you can have


---------83:25----------
dialogue with people you can have the


---------83:26----------
same [ __ ] dialogue over and over and


---------83:28----------
over again and those are the


---------83:30----------
relationships we have with our parents I


---------83:32----------
do want to say though that like I also


---------83:37----------
feel bad because it's not it's not


---------83:40----------
entirely their fault I also feel like


---------83:44----------
and I'm here whatever it's about fault


---------83:47----------
also it just makes me really sad because


---------83:50----------
like I left Canada three years ago and I


---------83:57----------
moved out from home at 18 for University


---------84:00----------
anyways but I also feel like it's


---------84:03----------
exponentially more difficult to do these


---------84:05----------
kinds of things with that considerate


---------84:09----------
and with like language barrier to some


---------84:12----------
extent because I feel like that kind of


---------84:17----------
thing would translate so much better in


---------84:19----------
person and I was actually hoping to I


---------84:22----------
was planning on visiting them a week


---------84:24----------
before the quarantine started and I was


---------84:26----------
hoping to like perhaps get to tackle


---------84:29----------
certain issues but then that didn't


---------84:32----------
really get to happen either and I like I


---------84:36----------
can't tell whether I'm like putting it


---------84:38----------
off by wanting to do it in person or if


---------84:40----------
like I really think that that would make


---------84:42----------
a difference but I guess it's just


---------84:44----------
something that I feel has also stunted


---------84:46----------
stunted my ability to do that with them


---------84:51----------
sure do you meditate yes


---------84:56----------
I was doing really good up until two


---------84:58----------
weeks ago and then I started crying a


---------85:00----------
lot there might be a connection it might


---------85:02----------
be connection right so so come on I


---------85:07----------
think you're very spiritually adapt I


---------85:09----------
think you have a mind that's that's well


---------85:12----------
designed for spiritual exploration so


---------85:16----------
and I really would would recommend that


---------85:19----------
you continue to not miss necessarily you


---------85:22----------
have to meditate but I think so a couple


---------85:24----------
of things so you're now we talk about


---------85:25----------
kardama familiar with karma come on yeah


---------85:31----------
could you just sure define it yourself


---------85:33----------
sure I know so so when I look at you I


---------85:41----------
see a certain like you were dealt a


---------85:43----------
certain hand in life and I think that


---------85:46----------
the hand that you were dealt is sort of


---------85:48----------
like geared toward spiritual growth and


---------85:50----------
and what there are a couple of things


---------85:52----------
that I look for and people who are like


---------85:54----------
prone towards kind of spirituality and


---------85:56----------
it everyone is prone to their own kind


---------85:58----------
of spirituality I think you're prone to


---------85:59----------
a very particular kind that's actually


---------86:01----------
like with us because I think you have a


---------86:03----------
lot of the struggles that he had like


---------86:05----------
literally like literally right so if we


---------86:07----------
think about what worked for him like he


---------86:09----------
if we think about you know his starting


---------86:11----------
position in a particular game like your


---------86:13----------
starting position is actually somewhat


---------86:14----------
similar and so his solutions may apply


---------86:18----------
like you know if you I don't know what


---------86:19----------
kind of games you play but if you have a


---------86:20----------
particular star can there's like a


---------86:21----------
particular strategy that's like


---------86:23----------
optimized for you know winning yeah and


---------86:26----------
and so I think that the other thing is


---------86:27----------
you're very self-reflective I don't know


---------86:29----------
if you've done therapy or other kinds of


---------86:32----------
activities or you kind of do this kinda


---------86:33----------
stuff but your ability to catch your


---------86:35----------
thoughts and notice what you're doing


---------86:36----------
for example when you said I don't know


---------86:38----------
if that's like me just making excuses


---------86:39----------
for myself that I want to do this in


---------86:41----------
person and I want it to be perfection


---------86:43----------
even my profession is it that amount of


---------86:45----------
self reflectiveness I think is very


---------86:46----------
helpful for a particular kind of


---------86:49----------
spiritual growth which is the kind of


---------86:51----------
that I I like which is not so much about


---------86:53----------
God or devotion or anything like that


---------86:55----------
it's it's really about understanding


---------86:56----------
like how you work it's actually a system


---------86:58----------
of engineering it's not like religion


---------87:00----------
I'm serious so I mean what I think about


---------87:03----------
it as is like mechanisms of the mind and


---------87:06----------
in your case you have a particular thing


---------87:08----------
called a some scar


---------87:10----------
some scars like sort of a ball of


---------87:11----------
undigested emotion or like a background


---------87:14----------
program that's kind of running in your


---------87:15----------
mind that flagellates you for not being


---------87:18----------
good enough that drives you forward but


---------87:21----------
at the same time it's just like a


---------87:22----------
process that's running on its own and


---------87:24----------
like you know processes that are running


---------87:25----------
on their own can be like good for our


---------87:27----------
computer but then also there are some


---------87:29----------
times where we need like


---------87:29----------
control-alt-delete and like end task and


---------87:31----------
yeah a filthy Mac user but disgusting


---------87:41----------
also an eternal struggle between myself


---------87:43----------
and my wife but anyway so I think you've


---------87:48----------
got this thing right and I think you're


---------87:50----------
able to see it like you're able to see


---------87:51----------
the should and and so I think that's


---------87:54----------
good and I would just recommend that you


---------87:56----------
continue pursuing spirituality and like


---------87:58----------
a pretty concrete way because that's


---------88:00----------
what you'd like to do and and really


---------88:03----------
kind of focus on the stuff because I


---------88:04----------
think you'll get a lot of yield out of


---------88:05----------
it but in terms of you know should it be


---------88:10----------
done better in person I think yeah like


---------88:12----------
I think could you be avoiding absolutely


---------88:14----------
but I think it also you know being able


---------88:15----------
to hug I don't know if you hug your


---------88:17----------
parents but of course I mean some some


---------88:20----------
brown people don't some Asian people


---------88:24----------
don't yeah so yeah so like I for example


---------88:30----------
never my parents never kissed me like


---------88:34----------
it's weird like like I had to like like


---------88:37----------
when I was 18 or 19 I was like I'm gonna


---------88:39----------
start kissing my mom on the head cuz I


---------88:42----------
didn't know what to do and now I'm all


---------88:46----------
about the kissing with my kids but


---------88:50----------
anyway so so III think that you know


---------88:52----------
physical distance may actually be


---------88:55----------
important and you just have to decide


---------88:56----------
like this is also where I think you're


---------88:58----------
trying to set up the perfect


---------88:59----------
conversation which now that's a problem


---------89:02----------
right because like you shouldn't let


---------89:03----------
perfect to get in the way of like


---------89:04----------
starting a conversation yeah and so if


---------89:08----------
you want to do it but that too is like


---------89:09----------
Karma so this is like this is you're


---------89:11----------
gonna moan so I didn't even explain what


---------89:12----------
got my eyes but you know karma is kind


---------89:14----------
of your circumstances is one way to


---------89:16----------
think about it and the way that I think


---------89:18----------
about it is it's really just the


---------89:19----------
principle of cause and effect so like


---------89:21----------
you know if I


---------89:26----------
so if I walk into a bathroom that's


---------89:29----------
flooded that is a circumstance but at


---------89:32----------
the same time if I turn my bathtub on


---------89:34----------
and you know put the stopper in and let


---------89:37----------
it fill up and overflow like that


---------89:39----------
circumstance is created by something


---------89:41----------
that I did so now you're gone well like


---------89:44----------
kovat is part of your karma because it's


---------89:45----------
a circumstance it's something in the


---------89:46----------
external environment it's not something


---------89:48----------
that you control and at the same time


---------89:50----------
like karma is kind of tricky because


---------89:51----------
it's sort of like you can shape your


---------89:53----------
environment over time so you do control


---------89:55----------
your environment to a certain degree but


---------89:57----------
you also don't control your environment


---------89:58----------
to a certain degree and and for you to


---------90:00----------
think a little bit about like like right


---------90:02----------
now so you can't have that conversation


---------90:04----------
during koban so maybe there's some kind


---------90:07----------
of so now do you want to have it are you


---------90:09----------
not going to have it


---------90:10----------
yeah I'm really unsure yeah so I think


---------90:14----------
think about it how are we doing in terms


---------90:16----------
of untangling by the way I think good


---------90:20----------
I'm crying a bit less I want to soon


---------90:22----------
good but in general I I mean going into


---------90:30----------
this conversation has again being


---------90:34----------
reflective I feel like most of my life


---------90:37----------
I've been so busy being grateful for my


---------90:41----------
parents and the fact that they've for


---------90:45----------
the most part been like very loving and


---------90:48----------
supportive that I would have never even


---------90:50----------
thought that anything in regards to my


---------90:53----------
relationship with them would be


---------90:56----------
unhealthy I guess I just put it upon


---------90:58----------
myself to just deal with the Cork's I


---------91:03----------
don't know yeah it's a good way to it's


---------91:07----------
nice to I guess delve into that yeah I


---------91:11----------
mean what I'm so dealing with the courts


---------91:13----------
is interacting with an NPC like you


---------91:18----------
accept them as who they are like if you


---------91:20----------
really want to understand acceptance


---------91:22----------
think about the way that you approach an


---------91:23----------
NPC because they're not going to change


---------91:26----------
right and you just accept them for who


---------91:28----------
they are it's


---------91:33----------
yeah yeah but also like it was I thought


---------91:40----------
I was doing it for them you know you are


---------91:43----------
doing it for them and that happens to be


---------91:45----------
the wrong way to do it yeah Prabhas like


---------91:49----------
the whole point is that like you should


---------91:50----------
do things for them and they should do


---------91:52----------
things for you but your relationship


---------91:53----------
with them is one-sided and like that's a


---------91:55----------
problem and I can I can assure you as a


---------91:58----------
parent that like you know I want a two


---------92:01----------
sided relationship with my kids like


---------92:02----------
that's what they want


---------92:03----------
yeah and just think about how happy


---------92:06----------
they're gonna be when you share with


---------92:09----------
them that you're unhappy and then you


---------92:10----------
share with them that you're happy right


---------92:14----------
and they want to help you get there you


---------92:20----------
might say anyway this is something like


---------92:23----------
in terms of the tangled ball that we


---------92:24----------
kind of didn't get to or something that


---------92:26----------
you feel like is left unaddressed


---------92:28----------
I'm sure could I go to the bathroom real


---------92:31----------
quick yeah sure thank you I guess I'll


---------92:41----------
check quick chat while we're waiting


---------92:43----------
maybe I should go pee too


---------92:59----------
no I don't really like Pierre I don't


---------93:01----------
like drinking I gotta eat some of them


---------93:04----------
first but is Cowell Niranjan no no yeah


---------93:18----------
I'm gonna get food I like talking to him


---------93:22----------
on she's cool


---------93:23----------
Oh is she hard on herself


---------93:36----------
yeah yeah but I mean not not while I'm


---------93:38----------
talking to her right that's like really


---------93:40----------
disrespectful guys I don't I don't mind


---------93:43----------
um I'm gonna drink on stream but like


---------93:45----------
it's not fair to her like you think


---------93:48----------
about it like if you guys came on stream


---------93:50----------
what would you want me to be lucid or


---------93:52----------
would you want me to be and hit like yep


---------93:55----------
he created okay so it's it's not that I


---------94:00----------
don't mind being festive but I you know


---------94:03----------
let's let's think about why we do this


---------94:05----------
right so the stream isn't isn't about I


---------94:08----------
know it's bizarre it's not about an


---------94:09----------
entertainment right like so the one way


---------94:11----------
the thing that screws me is when I start


---------94:14----------
thinking about anything except what the


---------94:17----------
drink the stream is actually for and the


---------94:19----------
stream is to help the person that we're


---------94:21----------
talking to nothing more nothing less


---------94:24----------
and anything else that happens in terms


---------94:26----------
of donations and stuff which is amazing


---------94:28----------
and I'm grateful for it don't get me


---------94:29----------
wrong but like that's not why you do it


---------94:31----------
right you guys should donate and support


---------94:35----------
us because of what we do with the person


---------94:37----------
that we're talking to and also donate


---------94:40----------
because you think it's entertaining cuz


---------94:42----------
we'll do that from time to time but like


---------94:43----------
let's not forget what our primary


---------94:44----------
autonomous is to help the person there


---------94:46----------
because when we help that person like


---------94:48----------
you think about it right because it's


---------94:50----------
AoE healing so if I like you know if I


---------94:52----------
miss Cass to heal like not only does it


---------94:54----------
not help that person but then it like


---------94:58----------
doesn't help any of you guys like I


---------94:59----------
don't know how anyone is helped by me


---------95:01----------
being a drunken [ __ ] on stream


---------95:02----------
entertain sure and that's something that


---------95:04----------
we're willing to do and sometimes it's


---------95:06----------
important to last we'll laugh but like


---------95:08----------
how many of you guys have relationships


---------95:10----------
with your parents where you guys treat


---------95:12----------
them like NPCs and the second thing is


---------95:14----------
where they treat you like an NPC right


---------95:18----------
we haven't even gotten there but like


---------95:23----------
the other thing is like I mean I was


---------95:25----------
just getting on role talking to myself


---------95:27----------
which I sometimes do but the other thing


---------95:30----------
which is kind of tricky here is that you


---------95:32----------
know you learn how to treat them like


---------95:34----------
NPCs in a particular way like because


---------95:36----------
that's how they treat you because they


---------95:39----------
didn't see him on they saw pokey


---------95:41----------
engineering major in a couple of years


---------95:44----------
it's gonna be I mean I don't know what


---------95:45----------
your relationship status is but like


---------95:47----------
it's gonna go from no boys to like why


---------95:49----------
aren't you married yet


---------95:50----------
like that's what happens like one day


---------95:51----------
flip a switch yeah yeah and you're 23 so


---------95:56----------
you may be a bit young but I give it one


---------95:57----------
to two years and if it hasn't started


---------95:59----------
and you don't have a boyfriend then


---------96:01----------
they're gonna and it's not like a


---------96:05----------
boyfriend it's like single now okay


---------96:07----------
marriage when child when yep yeah see


---------96:11----------
that's an NPC it's like when you go to


---------96:13----------
the NPC and it's like you're you're like


---------96:15----------
looking like you're like open the vent


---------96:17----------
like you know the vendor menu and it's


---------96:18----------
like where's the child where is the


---------96:20----------
marriage like I like one of those please

---------97:33----------
it's it's unfortunate right we don't


---------97:35----------

---------97:37----------

---------97:38----------
I was just talking to a chat it's okay I


---------97:42----------
go on long rants to twitch chat is all


---------97:44----------
full so come on help me understand a


---------97:49----------
little bit about like you know I'm kind


---------97:51----------
of I'm not sure whether I'm not sure


---------97:55----------
where to go from here I'm happy to


---------97:57----------
continue talking if you want to I'm


---------97:59----------
happy to kind of summarize or if you


---------98:01----------
have questions or things like


---------98:05----------
yeah we are yeah I think there's some


---------98:09----------
other things that maybe we could delve


---------98:12----------
into a little bit namely especially as


---------98:16----------
of late and I don't know exactly why as


---------98:18----------
of late but I feel like I have a lot of


---------98:22----------
I feel very jaded and I feel like I yeah


---------98:31----------
I mean yeah


---------98:32----------
oh and I feel like I have a lot of


---------98:35----------
pent-up a resentment and regards to like


---------98:45----------
I don't want to say like streaming


---------98:47----------
because streaming isn't what bothers me


---------98:50----------
but um a lot of the things that I've


---------98:52----------
come of stream okay and I think it's


---------98:59----------
resulted the jaded Ness in me feeling


---------99:04----------
very defensive okay I didn't but I know


---------99:12----------
we'll have to you know unload that one


---------99:14----------
step at a time


---------99:14----------
yeah you know no so so defensive so you


---------99:23----------
know sometimes I can be a real [ __ ]


---------99:24----------
on stir I didn't mean to like literally


---------99:26----------
laugh in your face when you said Jaden


---------99:27----------
because I just like I was like what the


---------99:29----------
[ __ ] do you think you're like talking


---------99:30----------
yeah sorry when I said that it was


---------99:34----------
because I was referring to I guess


---------99:36----------
another aspect of my life yeah no no I


---------99:38----------
get it but like this is the thing right


---------99:40----------
this is the background process this is


---------99:42----------
you don't just whip yourself in one


---------99:43----------
dimension this is the shoulds because


---------99:46----------
like when you live a life of shoulds


---------99:47----------
you're gonna be resentful like so this


---------99:49----------
is a okay okay so funny at this point it


---------99:52----------
sounds like a disease you have a really


---------99:55----------
bad case of the show it absolutely is a


---------99:57----------
disease there's prescribed yes yes


---------100:01----------
that's what I do as I prescribe things


---------100:03----------
for the case of the show I'm writing a


---------100:06----------
couple of books and one of them like one


---------100:07----------
of the one of the chapters is a case of


---------100:10----------
the shirt of what it could us I call it


---------100:13----------
like I talked about it like it's a


---------100:14----------
disease because it [ __ ] is


---------100:16----------
okay so like first thing to understand


---------100:18----------
is like so let's think about where Jaden


---------100:19----------
comes from okay so anytime you have a


---------100:23----------
case of the shuds you end up with one or


---------100:25----------
one of two things


---------100:26----------
shame or resentment if you fill if if


---------100:30----------
you give in to the shoulds and you


---------100:32----------
accomplish what you should do you end up


---------100:33----------
with resentment and if you don't


---------100:35----------
accomplish what you should do you end up


---------100:37----------
with shame right and you've got a


---------100:39----------
healthy dose of both like you feel


---------100:40----------
guilty for not doing it


---------100:42----------
and once the should is there you're


---------100:45----------
you're stuck with one of those like I


---------100:47----------
hate to break it to you but that's why I


---------100:48----------
think about it as a disease because


---------100:49----------
that's the only thing that can happen


---------100:51----------
because either you sacrifice of yourself


---------100:53----------
and then you end up resent resenting


---------100:56----------
right like I should have a kid that's


---------101:01----------
gonna lead to Jade Yeah right all of the


---------101:04----------
things that we're forced to do in life


---------101:06----------
or that we we don't do of our own


---------101:08----------
because should is not a sacrifice


---------101:12----------
shouldn't sacrifice are very different


---------101:14----------
things


---------101:15----------
sacrifice is a choice should is like a


---------101:18----------
pressure and so the second that that in


---------101:23----------
so I think the thing is you're gonna


---------101:25----------
have more resentment and when you say


---------101:27----------
jaded what I hear is resentment because


---------101:29----------
you gave of yourself something that you


---------101:31----------
did not want to and you like are


---------101:33----------
frustrated about that you were pushed


---------101:35----------
into giving I don't know how much of


---------101:41----------
this applies could be completely wrong I


---------101:43----------
don't know what so like when you said


---------101:45----------
jaded I was like yeah damn right right


---------101:48----------
like it's not something new it's it's


---------101:51----------
that somewhere along there I mean so


---------101:53----------
this is my hypothesis is that somewhere


---------101:54----------
in there that jaded Miss that resentment


---------101:57----------
comes from doing things that you


---------101:59----------
actually did not want to do and you


---------102:01----------
mentioned something about streaming and


---------102:03----------
I think this is a great example of like


---------102:05----------
something that on the one hand you do


---------102:07----------
want to do something that you recognize


---------102:08----------
is your Dharma something that you


---------102:10----------
recognize this fun and is something that


---------102:12----------
you don't want to do in some ways or


---------102:15----------
that you don't want peace of it but you


---------102:18----------
force yourself to take that piece of it


---------102:20----------
maybe because you don't know how not to


---------102:22----------
or maybe because it's worth it but


---------102:24----------
there's a part of you that says I don't


---------102:25----------
want this yeah yeah


---------102:29----------
I think I'm stuck in that place yeah and


---------102:31----------
and so we can talk more about that but


---------102:33----------
like absolutely and then you feel


---------102:35----------
defensive and we can talk about what


---------102:36----------
defensive is so so give me more and this


---------102:38----------
is the tricky thing now what I'm gonna


---------102:40----------
ask you to do Aman is don't give me even


---------102:43----------
though they're wonderful don't give me


---------102:44----------
your conclusions give me raw data right


---------102:47----------
so and I know you gave a wonderful


---------102:48----------
summary so that was fantastic because


---------102:50----------
that got me started and I have a


---------102:51----------
framework but maybe you've biased me in


---------102:53----------
some way and maybe I already think I


---------102:54----------
know the answer maybe not so tell me


---------102:57----------
what do you what do you mean by jaded I


---------103:06----------
think a lot of the stuff that has


---------103:12----------
occurred especially over the last two


---------103:14----------
years has left me jaded both via the


---------103:22----------
ways people have treated me people that


---------103:26----------
I know as well as like randoms online


---------103:36----------
have you been treated dad dad dad dad um


---------103:45----------
[Music]


---------103:47----------
so many people I I just feel so like


---------103:55----------
used and abuse the amount of people that


---------103:58----------
will like um be so nice to me and then


---------104:04----------
ask me for help and behind closed doors


---------104:10----------
like as you know whether it's selfish or


---------104:12----------
not I really enjoy being of use to


---------104:16----------
others I get a lot of validation from


---------104:18----------
that and I feel like it's good for


---------104:20----------
everyone but then like at any given


---------104:24----------
opportunity will throw my name under the


---------104:26----------
bus or make me the butt of a joke or


---------104:30----------
will what's the word


---------104:40----------
not appeal to anyways well I guess like


---------104:45----------
appeal to or take advantage of the


---------104:48----------
mountains of people that are ready to


---------104:50----------
hate me at any moment and then I think


---------104:55----------
it also makes me really jaded to know


---------104:59----------
that jaded to know what that regardless


---------105:08----------
of like how someone will treat me


---------105:10----------
privately the public aspect of that is


---------105:15----------
so different because there's business


---------105:18----------
involved that sounds fun yeah


---------105:29----------
well like I don't want to say I agree


---------105:31----------
because it's just my feelings but and


---------105:36----------
like there you go and validating him on


---------105:38----------
again no I'm just so used to people in


---------105:44----------
validating me that I just start doing it


---------105:46----------
to myself all the [ __ ] time yeah it's


---------105:50----------
got to change my friend because you're


---------105:54----------
allowed to be resentful oh okay thank


---------105:59----------
you you just worry about you to drop an


---------106:07----------
f-bomb oh I'm so sorry no I'm but I


---------106:11----------
think it's a sign of progress a plus


---------106:13----------
[Laughter]


---------106:15----------
yeah and there's like two sides of it


---------106:17----------
there's like people where I feel it's


---------106:23----------
like manipulative in the sense that like


---------106:25----------
they want to be on my good side


---------106:29----------
privately but then publicly they want to


---------106:33----------
appeal to the people that hate me as


---------106:36----------
well and I've literally had very popular


---------106:44----------
people say very rude things about me


---------106:47----------
have their viewers harass me and then


---------106:49----------
that very same evening or next day they


---------106:52----------
DM me being all nice or asking for help


---------106:55----------
or whatever it is and that is such a


---------106:58----------
freaking brain boom for me because like


---------107:00----------
my reflex is like if someone asks me


---------107:04----------
something I want to respond I want to be


---------107:06----------
nice I want to like do the right thing


---------107:09----------
that's what like I should do and that's


---------107:10----------
like what I enjoy doing but that also


---------107:13----------
having to like calculate weight but this


---------107:15----------
this person like has no genuine care for


---------107:18----------
me like they just want to say stuff


---------107:21----------
that's gonna get like clipped and


---------107:23----------
shipped or have people laugh at or


---------107:26----------
ridicule me or whatever it is like they


---------107:28----------
want their cake and they want to eat it


---------107:29----------
too


---------107:30----------
and then there's the flipside sorry when


---------107:35----------
did where do you get your idea of what


---------107:38----------
the right thing to do where did you get


---------107:39----------
the idea that helping people is the


---------107:40----------
right thing to do


---------107:42----------
well to be fair like it makes me feel


---------107:45----------
good and I'm being helpful to someone


---------107:47----------
else so it just feels like the right


---------107:48----------
thing to do


---------107:49----------
can I tell you a story so I think we


---------107:55----------
have a really messed up view of right


---------107:58----------
and wrong so this is this is a train


---------108:02----------
wreck of a story because I use some


---------108:04----------
script names and it's hard for people to


---------108:05----------
follow so there was a long time ago in


---------108:11----------
India and I butcher the story every time


---------108:12----------
I wouldn't try to keep it quick because


---------108:13----------
I I really want to get you talking again


---------108:16----------
and hear what you have to say but I just


---------108:17----------
wonder I just can't help myself because


---------108:19----------
this infuriates me I like her stories so


---------108:22----------
there was a king in India a couple


---------108:24----------
thousand years ago and he has a couple


---------108:27----------
of kids and his eldest son is blind and


---------108:31----------
then he has another child who's younger


---------108:33----------
is also a boy but is not blind and so


---------108:37----------
generally speaking in ancient India you


---------108:39----------
know the throne passes I was gonna say


---------108:44----------
this today because people call you


---------108:46----------
royalty so I was like maybe this applies


---------108:47----------
to you have to mix up so pay attention


---------108:52----------
so the so you know generally speaking


---------108:59----------
what would happen is the throne would


---------109:00----------
pass to the eldest son but his eldest


---------109:02----------
son is blind so the king is kind of


---------109:04----------
trying to figure out he's like what


---------109:05----------
should I do


---------109:05----------
so he ends up saying you know ultimately


---------109:08----------
concluding that the kingdom is best


---------109:10----------
served by a king who can see because


---------109:13----------
they would go into battle on chariots


---------109:15----------
and archery was a big part of warfare


---------109:16----------
and you have to be an archer and like I


---------109:18----------
know that there's an anime here there we


---------109:20----------
have blind archers but for the most part


---------109:22----------
it's the knight good looks like an anime


---------109:24----------
thing it's not a real thing yeah so he


---------109:27----------
he you know passes over his first son


---------109:29----------
and passes the throne to his second son


---------109:31----------
then everyone's kind of okay with that


---------109:33----------
eldest son is somewhat resentful because


---------109:35----------
he felt like he deserved that creator he


---------109:37----------
was entitled to it and it's we'll see if


---------109:39----------
deserving or in being entitled to


---------109:42----------
certain things as part of what you


---------109:43----------
experience and then like things are


---------109:45----------
actually okay though because you know


---------109:47----------
eldest son can't really raise an army


---------109:49----------
and fight a war because he's [ __ ]


---------109:51----------
blind so then you know so the the king


---------109:55----------
who's


---------109:55----------
the younger brother G has children and


---------109:58----------
then the blind he's also kind of a king


---------110:01----------
the blind prince or whatever has


---------110:03----------
children as well and then the blind


---------110:06----------
king's children are very resentful


---------110:10----------
because they felt like they got a bad


---------110:12----------
beat and they felt like my father should


---------110:15----------
have been king and so I should have been


---------110:17----------
king but he got robbed and I'm getting


---------110:21----------
mugged


---------110:21----------
so they were filled with jealousy and so


---------110:25----------
what happens is that so there are two


---------110:28----------
sets of gun cousins one of those sets of


---------110:30----------
cousins is called the bond Ava's they're


---------110:31----------
sort of the good guys they're the people


---------110:33----------
who are actually kings and then the the


---------110:36----------
bad guys are the Kauravas and they're


---------110:39----------
the jealous people and so what happens


---------110:41----------
is they're jealous for a while and they


---------110:43----------
they actually try to kill their cousins


---------110:45----------
here there and then eventually what they


---------110:48----------
do is they come up with this plan to GAM


---------110:51----------
because they know that the eldest son of


---------110:54----------
the bond Ava's like has a weakness that


---------110:56----------
he can't turn things down so if they're


---------110:58----------
like hey I'm yeah okay so they're like


---------111:02----------
what we're gonna do is we're gonna


---------111:03----------
invite the the guy who actually rules


---------111:05----------
the kingdom over for a gambling night


---------111:07----------
and then we'll like yeah gamble thrown


---------111:12----------
absolutely so that's what they do and


---------111:14----------
and they they kind of they don't really


---------111:17----------
cheat per se but they've got someone on


---------111:19----------
their side who's like really good at


---------111:20----------
gambling so he kind of advises them and


---------111:22----------
they end up the the good guys end up


---------111:24----------
gambling away the kingdom because that


---------111:26----------
guy's a [ __ ] dumbass supposed to be


---------111:27----------
hero that he's a [ __ ] dumbass and and


---------111:30----------
then and then eventually what happens is


---------111:32----------
that one of their that one of the


---------111:33----------
Pandavas advisors sort of stops in he


---------111:35----------
says instead of gambling away the


---------111:37----------
kingdom why don't we put some conditions


---------111:39----------
on it and what you can say is that if


---------111:41----------
you guys win this hand you guys get to


---------111:43----------
rule the kingdom for 13 years but after


---------111:47----------
those 13 years we get the kingdom back


---------111:48----------
and during those 13 years you have to go


---------111:52----------
incognito and if they find you and they


---------111:57----------
can discover where you are it resets the


---------111:58----------
vlog so you basically have to go


---------112:01----------
incognito mode for 13 years and if you


---------112:04----------
can successfully hide for 13 years you


---------112:05----------
get to come back and you get to take


---------112:07----------
that back


---------112:07----------
and so everyone agrees to this before


---------112:10----------
the bat the bet happens they end up


---------112:11----------
losing they lose the kingdom they go


---------112:13----------
into hiding


---------112:14----------
thirteen years pass the governor of us


---------112:17----------
try to find the bond of Oz so that they


---------112:18----------
can reset the timer but they fail and


---------112:20----------
then thirteen years are over bond of us


---------112:23----------
come back and they say to the Kauravas


---------112:25----------
can I has my throne back please and what


---------112:29----------
are the Corolla say yes they say no I'll


---------112:36----------
say [ __ ] you so it's ours now it's mine


---------112:40----------
but even such a good job hiding yeah


---------112:43----------
they broke oh yeah come on they broke


---------112:46----------
the rules they were nice to you in


---------112:49----------
private and meet to you in public and


---------112:50----------
what did you say you said yeah sure take


---------112:53----------
it right you can have the best of me and


---------112:57----------
you can treat me like [ __ ]


---------112:59----------
anyone will get there in a second so


---------113:01----------
then the bond of us are like okay you


---------113:02----------
kind of have a fair argument right like


---------113:04----------
because your dad was the older brother


---------113:05----------
and so like it is you did kind of get


---------113:08----------
robbed and it's not your fault he's


---------113:09----------
blind so let's do halfsies you guys take


---------113:12----------
half the kingdom we'll take half the


---------113:14----------
kingdom and what are the core OS a they


---------113:20----------
probably say see your minds learning


---------113:26----------
okay right answer so they say [ __ ] you


---------113:32----------
and the bond of us say okay fine we can


---------113:34----------
live with that because we're good people


---------113:36----------
I'm on they're good people they're


---------113:37----------
givers they're helpers just like you


---------113:39----------
they're helpers right and other people


---------113:42----------
can be [ __ ] but we're gonna be nice


---------113:44----------
to them and so they say fine


---------113:47----------
give us we're five brothers in it's our


---------113:50----------
Dogma it's our duty to rule because


---------113:52----------
we're kings right we're princes we're


---------113:55----------
royalty I should rule something so give


---------113:57----------
us five villages you guys take the rest


---------113:59----------
give us each one village so that we can


---------114:02----------
do what we were born on this earth to do


---------114:04----------
which is to rule in govern and y'all can


---------114:08----------
have 95% of the kingdom just give us


---------114:09----------
five percent what are the core I must


---------114:12----------
say I think


---------114:16----------
point they just say sure whatever but I


---------114:18----------
don't know yeah maybe they also still


---------114:19----------
say [ __ ] you absolutely right because


---------114:23----------
that's how people are


---------114:24----------
they say [ __ ] you terrible it is and it


---------114:28----------
leaves me feeling so jaded


---------114:31----------
that people can do that and get away


---------114:35----------
scot-free huh


---------114:37----------
jaded is that how you feel and they


---------114:40----------
probably feel I don't know a word worse


---------114:43----------
than jaded yeah right so it's almost


---------114:47----------
like the story is relevant to your


---------114:48----------
situation


---------114:48----------
bizarre mm-hmm so then the bond of us


---------114:53----------
say like they're kind of confuse and


---------114:55----------
then and then there's a guy named


---------114:57----------
Krishna he was the guy who advised the


---------114:58----------
thirteen-year condition by the way so he


---------115:00----------
says absolutely this is unacceptable you


---------115:02----------
guys can't accept this answer so Krishna


---------115:04----------
says you have to fight like it's it's


---------115:08----------
not acceptable like you can't if someone


---------115:11----------
promises you something like be a giving


---------115:14----------
person is one thing like it's one thing


---------115:16----------
to say that you were owed something and


---------115:18----------
accept less and it's another thing to


---------115:21----------
even accept way less but at some point


---------115:24----------
you have to draw your line in the sand


---------115:25----------
and being a good person is not the right


---------115:27----------
thing to do I don't know where to draw


---------115:30----------
yeah yeah absolutely I get that right so


---------115:34----------
that's what we're gonna try to teach you


---------115:35----------
how to do and then the story sort of


---------115:38----------
continues and on the eve of battle so


---------115:40----------
they like rap you know martial their


---------115:42----------
troops and they get everyone together on


---------115:43----------
the eve of Adam one of the brothers is


---------115:45----------
looking across at these people who are


---------115:47----------
who are nice to him when they did when


---------115:49----------
they Deanna people who are is his


---------115:52----------
friends and his teachers and and people


---------115:55----------
that he cares about in respects and he


---------115:57----------
truly believes her friends and he says


---------116:00----------
you know what it's not [ __ ] worth it


---------116:01----------
like it is not worth it to kill these


---------116:04----------
people that I care about and my friends


---------116:07----------
for the sake of like what you call


---------116:10----------
justice says like I just don't want it


---------116:13----------
like it's not worth it to actually shoot


---------116:15----------
an arrow and kill that guy he can be an


---------116:17----------
[ __ ] but I don't want to kill them


---------116:18----------
and then krishna says no you have to


---------116:21----------
fight it's absolutely worth it because


---------116:24----------
it's not about like being a nice guy


---------116:26----------
like life is about doing your dharma


---------116:28----------
doing your duty


---------116:30----------
and in this case your duty is not to be


---------116:32----------
a nice guy and somewhere along the way


---------116:33----------
we we've we've conflated being a nice


---------116:35----------
guy with doing your duty right and you


---------116:38----------
did it with your parents your duty to


---------116:40----------
them is not to protect them that's the


---------116:43----------
nice thing to do absolutely because like


---------116:45----------
how is it not the right thing to do to


---------116:48----------
protect your parents but it's not your


---------116:50----------
tournament it's not your duty you don't


---------116:53----------
owe them license you owe them honesty


---------116:55----------
and you owe them the chance to make your


---------116:57----------
life better even if it hurts them mm-hmm


---------117:04----------
so there's a point where you got to draw


---------117:06----------
your line in the sand and being a nice


---------117:07----------
is not the right thing you've got to do


---------117:11----------
what's right and if people don't meet


---------117:13----------
you right I'm not saying like you burn


---------117:17----------
all bridges because I'm not a fan of


---------117:19----------
that right so like my Road tends to be


---------117:21----------
communication not you know fire and


---------117:24----------
brimstone but but I've also been


---------117:26----------
severely burned that way too burned in


---------117:29----------
what way


---------117:35----------
like even if someone like if I try to


---------117:41----------
speak to someone about an issue


---------117:43----------
privately


---------117:45----------
some people will out that some people


---------117:48----------
will then judge me for trying to resolve


---------117:51----------
something privately it just feels like


---------117:53----------
whether I respond don't respond it


---------117:57----------
doesn't matter what I do it will be


---------117:59----------
twisted and used against me to make me


---------118:02----------
look do you feel powerless you saw the


---------118:05----------
powerless in the situation what I'm


---------118:08----------
hearing for me more than anything else


---------118:10----------
is that you don't have any kind of


---------118:11----------
agency like no matter what you do you


---------118:13----------
get [ __ ] yes that sounds awful I don't


---------118:21----------
know I feel bad saying that cuz like


---------118:27----------
gorgeous I don't like I don't want to


---------118:31----------
like play victim like both because I'm


---------118:35----------
not perfect


---------118:36----------
and because I have privilege but that is


---------118:40----------
you shouldn't be complaining come on is


---------118:42----------
that what you're saying yeah get in the


---------118:47----------
closet


---------118:48----------
good now you're learning get in the


---------118:52----------
[ __ ] closet


---------118:54----------
yeah I'm on you're not allowed to have


---------118:56----------
feelings like who the [ __ ] do you think


---------118:58----------
you are I'm having feelings being hurt


---------119:01----------
by people your Twitter OMT who the [ __ ]


---------119:06----------
told you you get to have feelings


---------119:12----------
and this is this is the crazy thing


---------119:13----------
about twitch right like this is what


---------119:15----------
people don't understand is that people


---------119:17----------
look at you and they look at streamers


---------119:19----------
and they look at the audience and then I


---------119:20----------
think that there's a power dynamic


---------119:21----------
between these two people that one of


---------119:23----------
these people is stronger than the other


---------119:25----------
the whole [ __ ] point of twitch is


---------119:27----------
that we're all equal right like what we


---------119:32----------
see here is like a terrible power


---------119:33----------
dynamic because how do you even fight


---------119:35----------
against that they are formless they're


---------119:40----------
infinite number mm-hmm and you're half a


---------119:44----------
person because half of yous in the plaza


---------119:46----------
yeah like what's the real pout like if


---------119:53----------
the Internet is mad at you


---------119:54----------
I learned this the hardening when I did


---------119:57----------
an open Q&A on my discord live on stream


---------119:59----------
and boy did I get [ __ ]


---------120:01----------
really yeah actually Aquarius experience


---------120:04----------
but like there were 300 people in a disc


---------120:09----------
or chat we were just talking and I was


---------120:10----------
answering questions and one guy decides


---------120:12----------
that he's gonna start dropping and bombs


---------120:15----------
and he just he just doesn't say anything


---------120:19----------
except for the n-word over and over over


---------120:21----------
again and and he says it in a way I mean


---------120:22----------
like there's a small part of me that


---------120:25----------
can't blame the guy because you know I


---------120:28----------
appreciated what he was doing because


---------120:30----------
yeah I know it's like you know strike


---------120:34----------
while the iron's hot and he said it like


---------120:35----------
chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga


---------120:36----------
chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga temperature


---------120:43----------
so he he grabbed anyway so he and so


---------120:48----------
there was a part of me that thought it


---------120:49----------
was hilarious like I can't you know if I


---------120:51----------
saw that on LSF I would have laughed


---------120:53----------
mm-hmm so I can't blame the guy but like


---------120:55----------
that's like there's just no way that


---------120:57----------
like an individual person can fight


---------120:59----------
against the multitudes like you just


---------121:01----------
can't like you can't win against reddit


---------121:03----------
you get you can be you can be logged by


---------121:06----------
reddit and you can be loved by twitch


---------121:07----------
but you can't win against them right


---------121:09----------
it's like a Hydra like you chop off one


---------121:12----------
head like that's like what I'm hearing


---------121:13----------
come use the story the Hydra you chop


---------121:15----------
off one head and grows two more you


---------121:17----------
argue with someone on reddit and it's


---------121:18----------
like boy are two people downloading for


---------121:20----------
everyone like like it's it's amazing


---------121:23----------
it's like it's like every villains story


---------121:24----------
brought to life


---------121:26----------
anything you send them away like only


---------121:28----------
makes them stronger Iman any kind of


---------121:31----------
talks it even this I worry feels like


---------121:36----------
giving people ammo for whatever it may


---------121:39----------
be


---------121:40----------
yeah so I'm gonna try to say something


---------121:42----------
absolutely crazy which is given as much


---------121:45----------
ammo as they want to because whether


---------121:47----------
that ammo lands or not is on you they


---------121:51----------
can shoot but it's your choice whether


---------121:54----------
you get hit they can send you venom and


---------121:59----------
they can send you toxicity and and by


---------122:02----------
the way maybe this is famous last words


---------122:05----------
right because maybe I don't know because


---------122:08----------
I've never been on the bad end I mean


---------122:10----------
people criticize me and stuff but like I


---------122:11----------
don't think it's been anywhere near what


---------122:13----------
a lot of and I'm grateful for that


---------122:14----------
please don't please don't kill but but


---------122:18----------
you know it's easy for me to say so I


---------122:19----------
acknowledge that but I do believe that


---------122:21----------
like the funny thing is that like I


---------122:23----------
think that I do a lot of I mean I think


---------122:25----------
the cool thing and what I mean by give


---------122:27----------
them ammo is that I think that twitch


---------122:29----------
isn't evil right like sure it's this


---------122:31----------
Hydra but like sometimes the Hydra


---------122:33----------
cotton see and that's actually what I've


---------122:36----------
discovered in the month of May is like


---------122:38----------
people are donating like thousands of


---------122:39----------
dollars I think the Hydra is like


---------122:41----------
amazing it's powerful but it's not evil


---------122:43----------
it's just like twitch can be a force of


---------122:45----------
good and power and support and I think


---------122:48----------
that's what that's why you're successful


---------122:50----------
because it's not if you think about like


---------122:52----------
you know the Hydra has a lot more heads


---------122:55----------
that are licking you than it does that


---------122:56----------
are like biting you that's true you know


---------123:02----------
and sometimes it's easy to forget that


---------123:04----------
it's so easy to forget that and that


---------123:07----------
comes down to attachment and a couple of


---------123:08----------
other things but I mean I don't think


---------123:11----------
that you should let you know if it's


---------123:14----------
like if it's being a bad Hydra you've


---------123:15----------
got to smack it on the nose and soon


---------123:16----------
Hydra that you should feel and I want


---------123:20----------
you to feel empowered to say things to


---------123:24----------
speak your truth in like you know if the


---------123:26----------
consequence has happened the consequence


---------123:28----------
has happened you know it's kind of like


---------123:30----------
sometimes you got to be you know tank


---------123:32----------
man is anyway so there's like this very


---------123:35----------
famous photo from


---------123:37----------
Tiananmen Square of like a dude with a


---------123:40----------
grocery bag standing in front of a line


---------123:41----------
of Tanks and and anyway if you it's it's


---------123:46----------
old now but like there's just there's


---------123:49----------
like it's you've probably seen the same


---------123:52----------
sentiment can be found and take your


---------123:53----------
pick of anime when the underdog stands


---------123:56----------
up and you just got a you know you got a


---------124:00----------
hold hold your line sometimes and like


---------124:02----------
if the tanks roll over you they roll


---------124:04----------
over you like I'm not saying like


---------124:06----------
because you are powerless like you can't


---------124:08----------
you can't stop a line of tanks with a


---------124:10----------
human body but like you know that


---------124:12----------
shouldn't stop you from speaking your


---------124:14----------
truth sorry I've been talking for a


---------124:17----------
while no it's okay you know so there's a


---------124:21----------
part of me that says like if people are


---------124:22----------
mean to you in private


---------124:24----------
then you should let them know that it's


---------124:26----------
hurtful and if they want to air that


---------124:27----------
dirty laundry then like then you're done


---------124:29----------
with them so much unnecessary drama


---------124:36----------
I've gone to the point where it's just I


---------124:39----------
just I avoid where I am aware enough to


---------124:44----------
avoid what does that mean if I feel a


---------124:53----------
situation even where I am wronged and


---------124:57----------
perhaps I should tell someone like why


---------125:01----------
are you messaging me like this when you


---------125:04----------
were just talking [ __ ] however long ago


---------125:07----------
I don't even feel like I should do that


---------125:11----------
because that's like an open invitation


---------125:14----------
to perhaps creating more drama and so


---------125:18----------
it's like maybe I will just have no


---------125:22----------
friends and so I have no expectations of


---------125:25----------
anyone that's sad way to live life


---------125:30----------
yeah but maybe I will get hurt less that


---------125:33----------
way you will get hurt less but I


---------125:37----------
understand it's like it's better to have


---------125:38----------
loved than not to have loved at all you


---------125:41----------
take the risk no no no no but let's not


---------125:44----------
accept that right like let's make it


---------125:45----------
let's let's study that let's be


---------125:47----------
scientific so like you've got a choice


---------125:50----------
and and I don't I don't think I mean I


---------125:53----------
mean I'm with you that you know I


---------125:55----------
personally believe it's better to have


---------125:57----------
loved and lost than to never loved at


---------126:00----------
all but it's easy for me to say that


---------126:02----------
because I'm really lost


---------126:04----------
I started out nothing and it it's


---------126:07----------
different like I'm in a different place


---------126:08----------
because I had nothing for a long time


---------126:11----------
and then I've gained a lot I don't


---------126:12----------
really know what it's like to lose you


---------126:15----------
know I was like there's a difference


---------126:16----------
between losing your money and like being


---------126:18----------
broke from the get-go and so I don't


---------126:20----------
really know what it's like to lose like


---------126:22----------
even on twitch like I'm still in the


---------126:24----------
honeymoon phase I think you know people


---------126:28----------
favor it I'm just ignorant like I just


---------126:32----------
don't know like I don't know you know


---------126:34----------
that's what everyone tells all all the


---------126:36----------
boomers tell me like you did savor it


---------126:39----------
who's the boomer now which boomer but


---------126:44----------
yeah I mean I I don't know so I think


---------126:47----------
you know you can try that right like you


---------126:48----------
can try ignoring them you can try not


---------126:51----------
being connected to them and then there's


---------126:53----------
something in me that says that like


---------126:54----------
actually if we if we challenge people in


---------126:57----------
the right way and and we sort of diss on


---------127:00----------
their defensive miss that maybe they can


---------127:02----------
grow and like I don't know I'm just like


---------127:05----------
I don't know what would happen because


---------127:06----------
you say it sounds like when you take


---------127:08----------
issue with them they like Eric publicly


---------127:10----------
and it creates more drama sometimes yeah


---------127:13----------
and what about the other times sometimes


---------127:21----------
they react very defensively I think also


---------127:25----------
because like I don't know it's like


---------127:30----------
behind my back


---------127:31----------
it's easy to make fun of me but directly


---------127:34----------
to me perhaps they're intimidated on


---------127:36----------
some level and if I come to them with


---------127:38----------
like oh like this thing is not okay


---------127:40----------
they'll just be very defensive be mad


---------127:43----------
make a bigger deal out of it privately


---------127:45----------
and publicly whatever it is it's going


---------127:48----------
all sorts of ways and the only times


---------127:52----------
that ever like mm-hmm really goes well


---------127:55----------
is if someone is like closer to me or we


---------127:59----------
have a more legitimate a baseline


---------128:04----------
friendship as opposed to just like being


---------128:07----------
friends or knowing each other or being


---------128:08----------
on good terms but actually that brings


---------128:11----------
me to the other point of like kind of


---------128:15----------
being jaded or feeling bad because even


---------128:19----------
though I have a lot of like good friends


---------128:21----------
on Twitch I never ever feel like anyone


---------128:26----------
would risk standing up for me


---------128:28----------
cuz it could be bad for business and I


---------128:31----------
mean that's nice and fair when it's just


---------128:34----------
business


---------128:34----------
but sometimes what do you think about it


---------128:36----------
it kind of sucks mainly because but like


---------128:39----------
I understand a lot of people just like


---------128:41----------
don't like that's not part of their


---------128:45----------
personality but it is like part of my


---------128:48----------
personality if I ever saw one of my


---------128:50----------
friends being wronged it's just like in


---------128:54----------
me to wants like stand up for that or


---------128:56----------
being like or say like that's not true


---------128:58----------
that's not fair above all blah


---------129:00----------
and sometimes feeling like that would


---------129:02----------
never be reciprocated or never really is


---------129:05----------
reciprocated kind of feels bad so kind


---------129:08----------
of like that whole area of my work like


---------129:12----------
on it when it's just me streaming to my


---------129:14----------
audience and like having a good like a


---------129:16----------
good time like that's fine but then


---------129:19----------
everything past that feels like such a


---------129:21----------
headache and that's just


---------129:25----------
the iceberg honestly I think for a


---------129:31----------
second of course take all the time you


---------129:35----------
want I have no plans this is not plans


---------129:42----------
you


---------129:53----------
man this is complicated


---------129:59----------
do you say that often during these kinds


---------130:01----------
of sessions I don't know I try not to


---------130:15----------
pay attention I guess if I didn't say it


---------130:20----------
often what does that mean for you I


---------130:25----------
don't know I guess you sounded taken


---------130:29----------
aback or surprised or something I guess


---------130:33----------
it does not mean much it is what it is


---------130:35----------
it is what it is I think it means


---------130:39----------
something just maybe it validates my


---------130:42----------
situation to some extent I think so that


---------130:46----------
feels nice hmm do I do I say validating


---------130:51----------
things often I have not kept track I


---------130:56----------
think you are not trying to tip the


---------130:59----------
scales in any way okay but this feels


---------131:07----------
like a nice conversation not paying


---------131:09----------
attention to how validating it may or


---------131:11----------
may not be it I just feel like it's nice


---------131:13----------
to have a back-and-forth about things


---------131:16----------
that I don't frequently talk about so


---------131:24----------
there are a couple of different things


---------131:25----------
here and I don't know I so Iman I want


---------131:29----------
to say if your game with it maybe we can


---------131:32----------
dig into this more later just because I


---------131:35----------
tend to need so the more complicated it


---------131:39----------
is the more I want to be at a hundred


---------131:41----------
percent and I don't know how long I can


---------131:43----------
stay at a hundred percent because I


---------131:44----------
think this could be another like I can't


---------131:46----------
there's no way that you're gonna get


---------131:47----------
there's no way that I can put forward my


---------131:51----------
best self over the course of the next


---------131:53----------
hour and a half that's okay


---------131:56----------
and at the same time I think we can


---------131:58----------
definitely start talking about it but I


---------131:59----------
just so like there are a couple of


---------132:01----------
different dimensions here okay so the


---------132:03----------
first is that


---------132:10----------
and this is I don't mean this make this


---------132:14----------
sound as invalidating is it is its gonna


---------132:16----------
come across but why do you care right


---------132:17----------
like what's your skin in the game like


---------132:19----------
what is it about the drama and the


---------132:22----------
things that are said on Reddit and the


---------132:24----------
things that are said about you and not


---------132:26----------
to your face that bother you


---------132:28----------
there's something about ego and identity


---------132:31----------
and respect and whether that respect


---------132:32----------
comes from the outside or whether it


---------132:34----------
comes from the inside like your worth


---------132:36----------
and we're on the axis of like within


---------132:38----------
them on and outside of them on it comes


---------132:40----------
from mm-hmm and I think unfortunately


---------132:42----------
like you being Moroccan doesn't really


---------132:44----------
help with this and like I know that


---------132:46----------
basically Thai for parents and Indian


---------132:48----------
parents because it is like they do tell


---------132:49----------
you right Oh so-and-so is getting


---------132:51----------
married right like oh and this is


---------132:54----------
happening this is happening this is


---------132:55----------
happening so we're kind of ingrained and


---------132:58----------
you're not gonna be Caucasian or


---------132:59----------
Hispanic or whatever it just depends on


---------133:01----------
what kind of parents you are but


---------133:02----------
culturally like at least South Asian


---------133:04----------
East Asian and sort of like Middle


---------133:06----------
Eastern cultures are very very big into


---------133:09----------
image and in that respect is something


---------133:12----------
that can be like measured with like a


---------133:14----------
measuring stick right it's like not only


---------133:17----------
is that person a doctor it's like they


---------133:18----------
tell me which school he went to and like


---------133:20----------
my tariff I mean I tell my mom you know


---------133:23----------
my mom doesn't thankfully she doesn't


---------133:25----------
make that mistakes you didn't talk about


---------133:26----------
me you're just great right so and and so


---------133:31----------
I think the first thing is about like


---------133:32----------
where your attachment to this whole


---------133:34----------
issue so I think there's there's


---------133:36----------
salvation if you become unattached from


---------133:39----------
it yeah yeah right so that's one option


---------133:42----------
but then there are a couple of other


---------133:43----------
things because I just don't think it's


---------133:44----------
like you know it's it's a shitty answer


---------133:48----------
to say just care less so so like while I


---------133:52----------
think that that's true I don't think


---------133:54----------
that that's like sufficient or we're not


---------133:56----------
anywhere near there yet because not


---------133:59----------
caring means that you have strengths


---------134:02----------
coming from in here and I just don't


---------134:03----------
think you have that mm-hmm and that kind


---------134:06----------
of goes back yeah God so what we were


---------134:08----------
saying before which is my lack of time


---------134:10----------
being able to develop a sort of identity


---------134:13----------
that's kind of how I've related the to


---------134:16----------
which is just like the way to not care


---------134:19----------
about what people


---------134:20----------
think is just to like be confident


---------134:23----------
enough in yourself absolutely right so


---------134:26----------
there's yeah so so I think the other


---------134:30----------
thing is when we talk about


---------134:30----------
defensiveness like that's the ego right


---------134:33----------
like so when someone gets defensive


---------134:34----------
that's their ego activating that's them


---------134:37----------
sense of like wanting to fight back and


---------134:38----------
I think part of what you're running into


---------134:40----------
is that you activate the egos of other


---------134:43----------
people because they know they did


---------134:44----------
something wrong and then very few people


---------134:47----------
have the wherewithal to like recognize


---------134:50----------
when their ego is active in that the


---------134:52----------
words that are coming out of their mouth


---------134:53----------
or by definition


---------134:55----------
wrong because their mind is butthurt and


---------134:59----------
the more butthurt you are the more


---------135:01----------
incorrect things you're gonna think and


---------135:03----------
the more incorrect things you're gonna


---------135:05----------
say but that's not something that they


---------135:06----------
teach us that when your ego is active


---------135:09----------
that's you being hurt and then like


---------135:11----------
anything that comes afterward you know


---------135:16----------
so my kid at 4:00 in the morning came


---------135:19----------
and slept with me in our bed and then


---------135:22----------
she does this thing where she doesn't


---------135:24----------
sleep like in line with us she either


---------135:27----------
sleeps perpendicularly or she sleeps


---------135:29----------
topsy turvy and she just won't stay on a


---------135:32----------
pillow she just like once she just moves


---------135:33----------
around and then she kicked me in the


---------135:35----------
face at like 4:30 because she's just


---------135:38----------
she's like hungry and she's like not


---------135:40----------
sleeping well and stuff and then like


---------135:41----------
you know I felt hurt and I wanted to


---------135:42----------
smack her and like you know I want to


---------135:46----------
smack her because you get kicked in the


---------135:47----------
face by like you know an almost


---------135:49----------
three-year-old and she's actually like


---------135:50----------
yeah it's a reaction and it's the hurt


---------135:52----------
is gonna lead me to do things that are


---------135:55----------
like not good to do and I think that's


---------135:57----------
what you're running up against is when


---------135:59----------
you hold someone accountable they're


---------136:02----------
gonna feel hurt and they're gonna feel


---------136:03----------
defensive and they're gonna attack and


---------136:05----------
then you feel defensive because you're


---------136:08----------
being attacked and you feel hurt so like


---------136:09----------
hurt and offensiveness and ego all tied


---------136:12----------
together and so then there's another


---------136:16----------
issue here which is like how do you


---------136:17----------
relate to people can you actually become


---------136:19----------
better voicing your feelings can you


---------136:22----------
phrase things away in dms that and here


---------136:25----------
I'm thinking calculated now it's like


---------136:26----------
I'm sort of almost tapping my when I


---------136:28----------
guide people who or when I talk to


---------136:30----------
people who have like problems with like


---------136:32----------
corporate boards like


---------136:33----------
say I'm working with CEO and like the


---------136:34----------
board doesn't like him and something's


---------136:36----------
going on like that's what we're kind of


---------136:37----------
getting into how do you how do you write


---------136:39----------
an email in a way that if someone


---------136:41----------
forwards it cuz that's gonna happen


---------136:42----------
right because it's on paper and really


---------136:45----------
yeah it's like how do you write an email


---------136:48----------
that can't be taken out of context or


---------136:51----------
protects you from being taken out of


---------136:53----------
context intersects the most Oh like to


---------136:58----------
the audience they don't consider that


---------137:02----------
the fact that if something were to be


---------137:06----------
shown publicly I mean like depending on


---------137:10----------
what it says that someone would have


---------137:14----------
needed to be extremely calculating and


---------137:19----------
to some of them they would consider that


---------137:21----------
like being fake they would need to be


---------137:24----------
very calculating in order to have


---------137:25----------
something be shown publicly and not


---------137:27----------
cause any issue typically but then also


---------137:31----------
they want you to be like real and never


---------137:33----------
show any sign of like being calculating


---------137:35----------
or strategic or what they would deem is


---------137:37----------
like disingenuous or fake but then


---------137:40----------
that's the very stuff that they accept


---------137:43----------
or think is normal or like or think is


---------137:45----------
acceptable do you kind of get where I'm


---------137:48----------
coming yeah I get I think I get where


---------137:50----------
you're coming from so Waterman sucks


---------137:53----------
that just sounds exhausting yeah like


---------137:57----------
it's like there's so much work into like


---------137:59----------
each thing that go like each word like


---------138:02----------
so normal human beings get to talk yeah


---------138:05----------
right like other people get to DM back


---------138:07----------
and forth what are the [ __ ] they want


---------138:09----------
but you don't get to do that I just wish


---------138:15----------
I could feel like


---------138:21----------
I could be worthy of the benefit of the


---------138:24----------
doubt and I just feel like instead it's


---------138:27----------
the complete opposite it's like how can


---------138:31----------
we manufacture this to make it look like


---------138:33----------
she is some like devil succubus sting


---------138:38----------
monster that is trying to kill people I


---------138:41----------
don't know what happened to mom can you


---------138:43----------
can you tell me what happened so many


---------138:46----------
things have happened Nick one there was


---------138:56----------
this one like for example this one video


---------138:58----------
that went kind of viral where someone


---------139:02----------
was like talking about like the dark


---------139:06----------
side of pokey maid and saying oh she's


---------139:09----------
actually a really bad person because of


---------139:11----------
like this and not and they took a lot of


---------139:12----------
clips from my stream and it's amazing


---------139:18----------
what like ominous music and someone


---------139:22----------
delivering lines very well will say


---------139:25----------
prior to very specific cut up clips with


---------139:28----------
no context not to say that I am perfect


---------139:31----------
or I go about things in a perfect way


---------139:32----------
but it definitely made me look very bad


---------139:34----------
and also just like that in combination


---------139:40----------
with scandals about things that are like


---------139:42----------
not in my opinion like super super


---------139:46----------
important so things like that will occur


---------139:49----------
and then that will make me feel like oh


---------139:52----------
every little thing that I say can be


---------139:54----------
like used against me or clipped out of


---------139:56----------
context or whatever it is and like I am


---------139:59----------
not worthy of any sort of benefit of the


---------140:01----------
doubt and then the cherry on top is that


---------140:05----------
almost any time someone has created a


---------140:08----------
massive issue like that for me in my


---------140:11----------
life at some point or other they slide


---------140:14----------
in the DMS with a massive apology like


---------140:17----------
that video even though it amassed I


---------140:19----------
think millions of views has now been


---------140:21----------
deleted because the guy himself felt


---------140:24----------
like the video like didn't really make


---------140:27----------
sense it wasn't very fair to me and you


---------140:31----------
know what that doesn't


---------140:35----------
delete the hundreds of thousands of


---------140:38----------
shitty things that people have sent to


---------140:40----------
me said about me thought about me


---------140:42----------
or the way in which it has jaded me so


---------140:46----------
yeah that easy Lorena


---------140:56----------
I'm leaking why are you leaking what's


---------141:02----------
what's coming out what's leaking


---------141:04----------
yes I'm you just like pent up feelings


---------141:07----------
and regards a lot I don't know what what


---------141:11----------
feelings sadness it's like I pity myself


---------141:20----------
you pity yourself what about you as


---------141:23----------
pitiable I don't know are you not saying


---------141:31----------
because you don't want to provide people


---------141:32----------
with ammo or do you really not know oh I


---------141:35----------
guess just like I want to say my


---------141:39----------
situation but it has a lot of upsides as


---------141:42----------
well so see there it is again yeah there


---------141:45----------
it is the pens in this hand


---------141:49----------
it should be in this hand it's so I mean


---------141:57----------
really like I asked that question about


---------141:59----------
ammo for a reason because I think what


---------142:01----------
you feel you do not feel as fair to say


---------142:05----------
I don't feel like anything is fair to


---------142:10----------
say yeah that's you Shing him on into


---------142:14----------
the closet right and now we're kind of


---------142:18----------
at a dangerous crossroads because like


---------142:19----------
what you're telling me is actually true


---------142:21----------
this isn't in your head and that's why


---------142:24----------
the [ __ ] is complicated because if you


---------142:26----------
do talk about how you actually feel


---------142:30----------
people will crucify you they're waiting


---------142:33----------
they're out there what is this [ __ ]


---------142:38----------
complaining about alright or they'll use


---------142:41----------
the c-word yeah and I think it's


---------142:48----------
interesting I remember first sort of


---------142:49----------
encountering this with dev and mash and


---------142:52----------
sort of like we were talking about why


---------142:55----------
people are toxic and and I think like


---------142:58----------
you know what I what I told him and and


---------143:00----------
what I still think I kind of believe


---------143:02----------
because I remember who I used to hate


---------143:04----------
right because like I've felt that do I


---------143:07----------
mean being 25 years old and you know


---------143:12----------
have nothing but 80 medical school


---------143:15----------
rejection letters to show for what


---------143:17----------
you've done in life is not like it's not


---------143:20----------
it's like a dark place to be right not


---------143:22----------
having a job being supported by mommy


---------143:25----------
and daddy and you know like not even


---------143:29----------
like not even Kentucky not even helping


---------143:31----------
people like Matt contributing like doing


---------143:33----------
nothing and I think this this is why I


---------143:36----------
like mental health is a problem because


---------143:38----------
like these people don't have it like


---------143:39----------
these people their hatred doesn't come


---------143:41----------
from evil right it's like the Hydra like


---------143:44----------
the Hydra acts like depending on how you


---------143:46----------
treat it


---------143:47----------
I think the crazy thing is that I think


---------143:49----------
those people are like they're hurting


---------143:51----------
and they don't know what to do with that


---------143:54----------
it's like they're like children like if


---------143:56----------
you look at children of a like who are


---------143:58----------
abused like and there was a great stream


---------144:02----------
with LLS about this where he was kind of


---------144:04----------
talking about like he used to act out


---------144:05----------
and be a bad kid and like no no one ever


---------144:08----------
asked a lie mm-hmm no one ever like


---------144:11----------
wondered like they just punished him


---------144:12----------
because he did things that he wasn't


---------144:13----------
supposed to no one ever asks why I know


---------144:16----------
these people who hate you they so with


---------144:20----------
Devin's case I think what what happened


---------144:22----------
is like what I hate the most night even


---------144:24----------
still life I feel it today when I see


---------144:27----------
someone doing something that I feel like


---------144:29----------
I'm capable of but haven't done it


---------144:33----------
infuriates me when someone's better than


---------144:37----------
me and they do something that's fine


---------144:38----------
because they're better than me but when


---------144:41----------
someone's not better than me and they do


---------144:43----------
something that I could have done except


---------144:45----------
I didn't do it and they did do it boy


---------144:47----------
does that make me live it because then I


---------144:51----------
don't have an excuse right then my


---------144:54----------
weaknesses become exposed and then like


---------144:56----------
that's just too painful I don't know how


---------144:58----------
to sit with that pain we don't know how


---------145:00----------
to sit with pain no one ever teaches us


---------145:02----------
and then they attack actually so often


---------145:07----------
when I see people that are like


---------145:12----------
obsessively attacking me I I just I mean


---------145:17----------
there are many emotions but a big part


---------145:19----------
of me just like wants to reach out are


---------145:22----------
you okay what's wrong


---------145:24----------
yeah why are you being this way and then


---------145:28----------
I realize if I do that they'll probably


---------145:32----------
just take it as an opportunity to just


---------145:34----------
say where's things directly to me or


---------145:37----------
screenshotted or do whatever sure so


---------145:40----------
it's become sad oh you know I mean not


---------145:44----------
to go into the Lions Den but like if


---------145:46----------
that happens again send them my way I


---------145:48----------
would love to talk to Sirius I told the


---------145:52----------
same thing to Devin like these people


---------145:53----------
don't show up


---------145:54----------
[ __ ] infuriates me I know they're


---------145:56----------
real toxic as we've had to in cells come


---------145:58----------
on stream there weren't real insults


---------145:59----------
we had a guy with a [ __ ] wife who he


---------146:01----------
was like he's like a normal dude it's


---------146:04----------
like where's the fucked-up-ness like


---------146:05----------
give me give me like gimme give me the


---------146:07----------
worst part like I want the drags right


---------146:11----------
because they deserve a spot too mm-hmm


---------146:14----------
and we need to understand that we need


---------146:17----------
to help them make any send them my way


---------146:21----------
okay I'll link them here yeah I'm


---------146:24----------
serious like like the guy who made that


---------146:25----------
video and so I think there's a couple of


---------146:28----------
other things that I just want to say


---------146:29----------
because I it's complicated there's so


---------146:31----------
many threads here there's something so


---------146:33----------
devastating about getting an apology in


---------146:35----------
private I can't tell you the amount of


---------146:41----------
times and in the moment it feels nice


---------146:44----------
and then long-term I realize wait this


---------146:47----------
person got off scot-free


---------146:48----------
and the amount of resentment is


---------146:52----------
something like do you accept their


---------146:54----------
apology what else am I gonna do I mean I


---------146:58----------
very much appreciate it and I think it


---------147:00----------
takes some sort of courage to do that


---------147:02----------
too but it like in the moment I don't


---------147:05----------
realize what they would never apologize


---------147:08----------
publicly yeah so you know what else am I


---------147:15----------
gonna do like that comes back to the


---------147:16----------
parma right like


---------147:19----------
sometimes it's okay to say I don't


---------147:22----------
forgive you you don't have to like no


---------147:24----------
one is entitled to forgiveness something


---------147:27----------
like somewhere along the way we thought


---------147:28----------
that people were entitled to forgiveness


---------147:30----------
that's not how it works I think it's


---------147:32----------
more so like I expect forgiving them -


---------147:37----------
or like accepting the apology - then


---------147:40----------
make that situation go away but now I've


---------147:44----------
realized no there is still some


---------147:46----------
resentment within me so then that that


---------147:49----------
forgiveness is fake you do it because


---------147:54----------
you're supposed to do it you do it


---------147:56----------
because we've been trained to say it's


---------147:58----------
okay when someone apologizes right and


---------148:05----------
we do it all the time and like yeah it's


---------148:10----------
a real problem like no one is entitled


---------148:11----------
to forgiveness like I know that this


---------148:13----------
place is supposed to be positive but I


---------148:14----------
really think that oh man does positivity


---------148:17----------
infuriate me because it's so [ __ ]


---------148:19----------
dishonest sometimes yeah I mean to be


---------148:23----------
fair really not intentionally like all


---------148:25----------
those times I really thought oh they


---------148:27----------
apologize this is very nice okay let's


---------148:30----------
all move on with our lives yeah so I


---------148:33----------
think I think there's so I think you're


---------148:34----------
halfway there so I think I think


---------148:36----------
forgiving is good but I think it's gotta


---------148:38----------
like be actual forgiveness right so I


---------148:41----------
think that the problem isn't that you're


---------148:42----------
forgiving the problem is that you're not


---------148:44----------
saying the rest of it the problem is is


---------148:48----------
you saying because it's kind of you know


---------148:53----------
because they apologized and then and


---------148:55----------
then you said something really brilliant


---------148:56----------
which is like it doesn't change the fact


---------148:58----------
that there were hundreds of thousands of


---------149:00----------
messages thoughts like it doesn't change


---------149:03----------
the damage it doesn't undo the damage


---------149:05----------
and somewhere along the way we started


---------149:07----------
believing that an apology undoes the


---------149:10----------
damage like if I'm driving down the


---------149:11----------
street and I'm walking down the street


---------149:13----------
with one of my kids and the drunk driver


---------149:15----------
drives by and like you know runs over my


---------149:18----------
child and kills them heaven forbid you


---------149:21----------
know I hope that doesn't happen knock on


---------149:22----------
wood


---------149:23----------
and then that person comes to me and


---------149:25----------
says I'm sorry and then I say I forgive


---------149:28----------
you it doesn't change the fact that you


---------149:33----------
know there's such a damage has been done


---------149:35----------
an apology does not wipe away the damage


---------149:38----------
and the issue here I'm on is that like I


---------149:40----------
think that somewhere along the way we


---------149:42----------
started believing that forgiving wipes


---------149:44----------
away the damage because true forgiveness


---------149:47----------
is part of that mourning is part of that


---------149:49----------
acceptance but even then I don't think


---------149:52----------
that anyone is owed like your own and


---------149:56----------
I'm sorry but you're not they're not


---------149:59----------
owed mercy from you and somewhere along


---------150:04----------
the way like you decided that you were a


---------150:06----------
good person and this is what a good


---------150:08----------
person does but like I think that's your


---------150:10----------
problem like you do you deserve an


---------150:13----------
apology absolutely do they deserve your


---------150:15----------
forgiveness absolutely not


---------150:17----------
I don't really know how else to go about


---------150:21----------
it yeah that's tricky right because


---------150:25----------
we're not talking stuff right I mean I


---------150:26----------
think it starts with speaking your truth


---------150:28----------
and and that too is like in the dm's and


---------150:30----------
you can say like I appreciate your


---------150:31----------
apology but like I don't know that the


---------150:34----------
damage you've done like has been fixed


---------150:39----------
right I'm


---------150:40----------
why'd you feel remorse in that situation


---------150:43----------
people will just be defensive and be


---------150:45----------
like wow this isn't good enough for you


---------150:46----------
and I'm not turn around back yeah I


---------150:48----------
tried to apologize but she was a total


---------150:50----------
[ __ ] about it you know it's there's no


---------150:53----------
way that so you can't win right so and


---------150:56----------
this is this is where I think the


---------150:57----------
biggest problem this kind of comes back


---------150:59----------
to the beginning of detachment is that


---------151:01----------
you're playing a game where someone else


---------151:04----------
you're playing a game that like someone


---------151:07----------
else determines who wins and who loses


---------151:09----------
mm-hmm like this is why you feel


---------151:13----------
powerless because you're playing a game


---------151:15----------
where like no matter what you say


---------151:17----------
someone else can do something with it


---------151:20----------
and that's exactly the [ __ ] point


---------151:21----------
that's where detachment comes from the


---------151:24----------
game is rigged and yet we continue to


---------151:27----------
play it true we put our feelings in our


---------151:31----------
lives in our sense of self into the


---------151:34----------
hands of others and then we [ __ ] and


---------151:38----------
whine but it feels like that's such like


---------151:42----------
an inherent part of the job it isn't in


---------151:45----------
here it's not just a part of the job my


---------151:47----------
friend it's a part of life yeah every


---------151:52----------
time you like when you're year three you


---------151:54----------
in the third grade and you do your math


---------151:56----------
homework and you like get a grade back


---------151:59----------
like that's you giving power to the


---------152:01----------
world like at some point very very


---------152:05----------
quickly it goes about it moves away from


---------152:08----------
learning to grades happens so fast no


---------152:12----------
one gives a [ __ ] about learning everyone


---------152:14----------
gives a [ __ ] about grades it's about the


---------152:18----------
outcome it's about the perception mm-hmm


---------152:22----------
like when when people talk about


---------152:24----------
Moroccan doctors they say like oh this


---------152:28----------
person is a doctor like everyone talks


---------152:29----------
about that person like they're a doctor


---------152:31----------
like no one talks about the people that


---------152:34----------
they sing right and live it's like


---------152:35----------
there's value that a doctor is greater


---------152:37----------
than other human beings it's like it's


---------152:39----------
not greater than other human beings


---------152:40----------
they're just people everyone's just


---------152:42----------
people everyone does their part but we


---------152:44----------
elevate some and it's not about the


---------152:47----------
actual thing in its


---------152:52----------
perception of the thing or the opinions


---------152:55----------
of others and I mean oh you know I think


---------152:58----------
like you're just you're playing a game


---------152:59----------
like in that you feel powerless because


---------153:01----------
you can't wait like how do you win


---------153:03----------
mm-hmm


---------153:04----------
and this is a party that's really really


---------153:06----------
faking throwing whatever you want under


---------153:08----------
the bus but somehow making it out


---------153:10----------
looking nice but I don't think that is


---------153:15----------
the way I would be okay with winning


---------153:17----------
yeah that's not right I'm just stuck


---------153:20----------
suffering yeah no you don't need to stop


---------153:27----------
caring no you don't need to do that good


---------153:32----------
side what was that what is that what


---------153:38----------
does that tell me think for a second


---------153:45----------
you know maybe I don't need to do


---------153:46----------
anything that's exactly right


---------153:49----------
now almost let it slip away you don't


---------153:52----------
need to detach you need to do absolutely


---------153:54----------
nothing just sit with your suffering let


---------153:58----------
him on out of the closet that's the sign


---------154:02----------
you almost let it slip away almost you


---------154:09----------
don't need to do anything because you're


---------154:13----------
perfect


---------154:25----------
right I mean like the rest of the world


---------154:28----------
like haters gonna hate man right we've


---------154:32----------
been saying it for I don't know I don't


---------154:35----------
know yeah satchel you don't need to do


---------154:40----------
anything you know like if like here's


---------154:44----------
the thing so now we're gonna wrap up


---------154:46----------
okay I'll teach you to meditate if you


---------154:48----------
want but you are what you are him on and


---------154:52----------
I think part of I mean my understanding


---------154:54----------
is that you're you know for the most


---------154:56----------
part pretty authentic and I don't blame


---------154:59----------
you if you want but and if you think


---------155:03----------
about it like you know what what's also


---------155:05----------
been responsible for like bringing you


---------155:07----------
to where you are is like is actually you


---------155:08----------
it's not it's not you playing the game


---------155:10----------
and and so you you you are perfect and


---------155:14----------
what you give to twitch is actually like


---------155:17----------
what most of twitch loves and then like


---------155:19----------
what some people do is they hate what


---------155:20----------
you did because it's authentic it's like


---------155:24----------
we hate the person who does the thing


---------155:26----------
that we're capable of and we don't do


---------155:28----------
like the problem is that like you're a


---------155:31----------
generally positive person people [ __ ]


---------155:33----------
hate that they hate that because they're


---------155:36----------
like I tried to be a positive person and


---------155:40----------
I didn't end up as twitch royalty like


---------155:41----------
that's not fair and then they try to


---------155:45----------
tear you down but you you can just be


---------155:47----------
what you are and like like that's what


---------155:49----------
you are and like people love you for it


---------155:51----------
apparently you know I think you're


---------155:54----------
awesome and I don't know if you've been


---------155:55----------
faking it you're doing this for you know


---------155:57----------
if you're farming views or whatever I


---------156:00----------
have no idea like if I tried man I feel


---------156:03----------
like if I was faking things I should be


---------156:04----------
doing a way better job I think I think I


---------156:12----------
think yeah I don't and I think the thing


---------156:15----------
is if you really really stop and you


---------156:17----------
look the world loves you for who you are


---------156:22----------
like I'm serious it's not it's not I


---------156:24----------
know I say positive sounding [ __ ] but


---------156:27----------
I'm not trying to say positive sound you


---------156:29----------
should I'm just saying like can you get


---------156:31----------
to where you are by being who


---------156:35----------
not or by being who you are cuz it's way


---------156:39----------
harder to be who you're not than it is


---------156:41----------
to be who you are I don't think you can


---------156:44----------
get to where you are by being fake fake


---------156:47----------
here and there sure but like your true


---------156:49----------
colors eventually show up


---------156:51----------
I mean twitch is really good at sniffing


---------156:53----------
out false in this vitami yeah I mean


---------156:56----------
when you dream for so many hours yeah


---------156:58----------
yeah you


---------156:59----------
I mean so I mean I think at the end of


---------157:02----------
the day you're spot-on it sits in that


---------157:03----------
sigh and don't lose that in that moment


---------157:05----------
you understood like in that moment you


---------157:09----------
understood because like maybe I just


---------157:10----------
don't need to do anything here


---------157:11----------
absolutely and then then that thing


---------157:13----------
comes up and so I know you should do


---------157:14----------
this and you shouldn't do this and you


---------157:15----------
should do this no don't do anything just


---------157:18----------
be yourself [ __ ] slack off for a day


---------157:19----------
or two and the people are gonna hate you


---------157:21----------
because you you spoke out of turn you're


---------157:23----------
like yeah well no yeah exactly


---------157:29----------
and this is the cool thing right this is


---------157:32----------
the cool thing is when you say oops


---------157:34----------
what is the hydrogen like absolutely


---------157:40----------
it's really cool like it's really really


---------157:43----------
cool like people come on here and air


---------157:46----------
their dirty laundry over and over and


---------157:49----------
over again and like what do they get


---------157:53----------
they get hugs yeah I do really love that


---------158:01----------
aspect when people see the humanity in


---------158:07----------
you yeah like take a chance to see the


---------158:12----------
humanity in yourself


---------158:25----------
last thoughts questions I feel like I'm


---------158:27----------
wiped oh no my eyeballs are wiped this


---------158:36----------
is very very nice I have you know see


---------158:40----------
different therapists and stuff but I've


---------158:46----------
never really got into this aspect of it


---------158:49----------
especially in regards to my family or


---------158:53----------
with someone who like understands the


---------158:56----------
space you know how often are you gonna


---------158:58----------
find a therapist that streams just about


---------159:01----------
never and then you have to go into


---------159:03----------
trying to explain this beast of a thing


---------159:06----------
so it was very nice talking to someone


---------159:09----------
who who gets it


---------159:10----------
well you're very welcome it was an


---------159:12----------
absolute pleasure from I mean I love


---------159:14----------
talking to new people it's make you feel


---------159:17----------
like that's a you people I mean I I love


---------159:20----------
talking to ya but you know I I have


---------159:24----------
oddly enough I I think the reason I say


---------159:27----------
you people is because I identify more


---------159:29----------
with the audience than the streamer I


---------159:33----------
view myself as twitch chat personified


---------159:35----------
on stream as opposed to an actual stream


---------159:39----------
work I really don't think about myself


---------159:43----------
anyway maybe there's a lesson somewhere


---------159:46----------
in there but my brain is too fried to to


---------159:48----------
tease it apart all right you're frying


---------159:50----------
your brain no no I mean I think it's


---------159:52----------
good like you know I I like I like fried


---------159:56----------
food from you know it's just I i I've


---------159:59----------
come to acknowledge my limits but yeah I


---------160:02----------
really appreciate what you've done I you


---------160:04----------
know Iman just to be honest I'm I found


---------160:06----------
myself to be a little bit surprised but


---------160:08----------
I guess I shouldn't be because you know


---------160:09----------
having watched her scream a couple of


---------160:10----------
times I'm I never realized you were


---------160:13----------
hanging on to so much and I feel sad


---------160:18----------
that you've been hanging on to it and I


---------160:22----------
don't think you deserve that I think you


---------160:25----------
deserve to be able to have fun and I


---------160:28----------
deserve I think you deserve to be more


---------160:30----------
fully who you show us I want to think


---------160:37----------
the same thing


---------160:38----------
and feel deserving of that well said see


---------160:43----------
that's a statement of where you are


---------160:44----------
right you didn't say I should you said I


---------160:48----------
want to it's an acknowledgement that


---------160:49----------
you're not capable with that that's


---------160:51----------
actually step forward so it makes me


---------160:55----------
very happy to hear you say that


---------160:59----------
do you want to meditate or we just kind


---------161:01----------
of are we done what do you think oh


---------161:05----------
absolutely


---------161:06----------
how about you just tell me how no no


---------161:08----------
we're going to do have any no we're


---------161:10----------
gonna I should be able to express myself


---------161:12----------
without giving in to that feeling


---------161:15----------
voguing guilt or anything on your part


---------161:18----------
no shoulds allowed yeah


---------161:21----------
[Music]


---------161:36----------
okay I'm not quite sure if this I don't


---------161:40----------
let me let me just think for a second I


---------161:43----------
try to tailor people's the meditation


---------161:46----------
that I teach teach to both be


---------161:48----------
introductory and also to apply to like


---------161:50----------
what people are dealing with I'm tempted


---------161:56----------
to teach you chanting but I want you to


---------161:57----------
do something particular with chanting if


---------162:00----------
that's okay you've ever chanted before


---------162:03----------
I'm chanting heard of this done this


---------162:05----------
okay all right okay all right so home


---------162:11----------
chanting is home is composed of three


---------162:14----------
syllables ah ooh and mmm okay so what


---------162:18----------
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna chant over the


---------162:20----------
course of one breath start with ah go


---------162:22----------
through ooh and end up with hmm


---------162:25----------
and so just listen okay


---------162:41----------
you


---------162:47----------
and at home should be listening to


---------162:52----------
[Music]


---------163:10----------
got it I heard the ah I don't know if


---------163:14----------
you lagged out oh i lagged out or maybe


---------163:16----------
it's not transmitting okay let's try


---------163:17----------
again


---------163:30----------
[Music]


---------163:36----------
did you catch that or no I still only


---------163:39----------
heard the ah oh [ __ ] okay


---------163:45----------
well there it goes that it's just I


---------163:49----------
cannot imagine okay so let me do the ooh


---------163:53----------
and let me do and maybe discord actually


---------163:56----------
I'm not sure if it's going on let me


---------163:57----------
check


---------163:57----------
let's see what people are saying it's


---------164:01----------
the gate on this chord I thought so yeah


---------164:03----------
so I think I think they can hear it


---------164:06----------
but let me see if come on alright so


---------164:15----------
we're just not going to worry about that


---------164:16----------
oh okay I'm okay yeah I can't eat I'm


---------164:26----------
doing this okay attention okay so I'm


---------164:33----------
gonna it's it's so I'll do the oh so


---------164:35----------
actually you can do it this way too so


---------164:38----------
we'll do three separates


---------164:49----------
ooh


---------165:00----------
[Music]


---------165:15----------
Jr those I turned on your stream and I


---------165:20----------
heard it they okay so ah over the course


---------165:25----------
of one breath okay we're gonna do five


---------165:27----------
rounds - let's do seven rounds I'm a


---------165:30----------
dropout just because my throat is


---------165:32----------
scratchy when I talk too much


---------165:33----------
um chanting is argh and Aman I want you


---------165:38----------
to pay attention to two things the first


---------165:39----------
is that chanting is about vibration not


---------165:42----------
about sound so you're gonna feel kind of


---------165:44----------
anxious and maybe weird or whatever I


---------165:45----------
don't know if you have any like history


---------165:47----------
of performing or whatever but it's fine


---------165:49----------
to feel those things but focus on the


---------165:51----------
vibration and specifically try to pay


---------165:53----------
attention to where do you feel vibration


---------165:55----------
and it may change with different


---------165:57----------
syllables and really just try to kind of


---------165:59----------
go into that vibration and the last


---------166:03----------
thing that I'm going to ask you to do is


---------166:04----------
after the seventh round after the


---------166:09----------
seventh round I want you to pay


---------166:11----------
attention to like what you feel on the


---------166:13----------
inside and then try to tell me so think


---------166:19----------
about it and then try to notice what's


---------166:21----------
wrong if there's something inside you


---------166:24----------
that's like not right right so just just


---------166:26----------
feel what you are and try to figure out


---------166:28----------
does anything about this feel wrong like


---------166:30----------
is any anything incomplete should is


---------166:33----------
there should somewhere in what you feel


---------166:35----------
after the practice okay all right so so


---------166:42----------
take a deep breath in so close your eyes


---------166:46----------
deep breath in


---------166:47----------
and begin


---------166:54----------
[Music]


---------167:00----------
[Laughter]


---------167:04----------
big deep breath again


---------167:14----------
[Music]


---------167:23----------
more energy


---------167:32----------
[Music]


---------167:41----------
good take a second in and out I now will


---------167:49----------
begin begin again just like that


---------167:59----------
[Music]


---------168:04----------
[Laughter]


---------168:09----------
beautiful focus on the vibration


---------168:16----------
[Laughter]


---------168:21----------
[Music]


---------168:30----------
good two more make them count


---------168:40----------
[Music]


---------168:48----------
take a breath just a breath and down


---------168:57----------
last one long deep calm and full


---------169:12----------
[Music]


---------169:16----------
[Laughter]


---------169:20----------
[Music]


---------169:53----------
eyes closed sit with it


---------170:40----------
and now to try to find what's vlog what


---------170:45----------
do you feel you can answer if you do you


---------170:50----------
feel like something like how do you feel


---------170:53----------
now I feel like especially near the end


---------171:02----------
of like every time we would do it like


---------171:08----------
my exhaustion came through yeah


---------171:16----------
but I feel like um it was nice to kind


---------171:23----------
of get into it because it feels like a


---------171:24----------
mental reset yeah so I think you you got


---------171:29----------
to do something like this and if the


---------171:30----------
exhaustion is coming through that's


---------171:32----------
really good it's not the exhaustion


---------171:34----------
coming through it's the exhaustion


---------171:36----------
coming up because I'm on you're very


---------171:39----------
tired you're very very tired stop saying


---------171:44----------
stuff this can make me cry I mean I'm


---------171:50----------
I'm sorry but you know and I think you


---------171:54----------
don't let yourself you don't let


---------171:57----------
yourself sit down


---------171:59----------
you don't like other people get to take


---------172:01----------
a break but you don't ensure there's a


---------172:04----------
part of that that's like streaming and


---------172:05----------
business and stuff like that but I'm not


---------172:06----------
talking about business I'm talking about


---------172:08----------
up here and so you've got to let


---------172:14----------
yourself feel that and and let it


---------172:16----------
because you don't let yourself be tired


---------172:20----------
and that's not fair sorry back to square


---------172:27----------
one good I mean so so what I tell people


---------172:35----------
is when they meditate what comes up is


---------172:37----------
what needs to come up because meditation


---------172:39----------
is about relieving the pressure on your


---------172:41----------
mind and when you when you create less


---------172:44----------
pressure so if I depressurize a chamber


---------172:47----------
right and I reduce the pressure then it


---------172:49----------
becomes closer to a vacuum and when you


---------172:52----------
have a vacuum more stuff can come in so


---------172:55----------
like there's stuff in you that you've


---------172:57----------
walled off and shut off in the closet


---------172:59----------
that when you meditate you know each


---------173:01----------
round of meditation like towards the end


---------173:03----------
as you enter quietness and the pressure


---------173:06----------
and drops from the chanting you this


---------173:08----------
thing starts to come up I mean this is


---------173:10----------
why I think chanting is a good technique


---------173:11----------
for you because you're gonna you can't


---------173:13----------
sit there you're not ready to sit there


---------173:16----------
you're not ready for the closet to be


---------173:18----------
open you're not ready for that glass


---------173:20----------
wall with the pile of dishes on the


---------173:23----------
other side you're not ready for the wall


---------173:24----------
to come down what you want to do is take


---------173:25----------
a peek inside and each round you chant


---------173:28----------
you peek inside you peek inside


---------173:30----------
you peek inside it's like there's


---------173:31----------
there's you know there's a frightened


---------173:33----------
Aman who thinks that there's a monster


---------173:34----------
in the closet and if I open the door


---------173:36----------
she's gonna freak the [ __ ] out but if I


---------173:38----------
peek inside I'm gonna just look real


---------173:40----------
quick I'm gonna shut it right away is


---------173:41----------
that okay


---------173:42----------
I opened a new shine I hope I shut and I


---------173:45----------
do that a couple of times then like


---------173:46----------
eventually like Iman is gonna be okay


---------173:49----------
with me like like really looking inside


---------173:50----------
and then then like maybe like looking


---------173:53----------
and be like hey do you want to just peek


---------173:54----------
real quick and then you have to let


---------173:56----------
yourself be comfortable with that that


---------173:57----------
exhaustion and let it come up and yeah


---------174:03----------
so I hope that helps I think you're


---------174:08----------
awesome I I do I do genuinely think


---------174:10----------
you're perfect but not in like a twitch


---------174:14----------
royalty soared away like in a you know


---------174:16----------
broken and normal human sort of way yeah


---------174:19----------
and and I think we're all we're all


---------174:23----------
where we need to be and and sometimes


---------174:24----------
where we are or not sometimes usually


---------174:27----------
it's painful and I'm sorry to say this


---------174:30----------
to a chat but you can you can be a


---------174:32----------
popular streamer and it doesn't mean


---------174:35----------
that you don't have feelings like that's


---------174:38----------
what we think right and we think that oh


---------174:40----------
if I once I do this if I graduated from


---------174:42----------
college once I find a girlfriend I


---------174:44----------
hadn't thought of all these different


---------174:46----------
things once I do this then I'll be happy


---------174:48----------
once this'll happens then I'll be happy


---------174:51----------
the part of the story that I don't tell


---------174:54----------
people is that I actually got happy


---------174:55----------
before I started in that school like my


---------174:57----------
transformation happened before and then


---------174:59----------
everything after that has been like


---------175:01----------
immaterial in some way I stopped playing


---------175:10----------
a rigged game I remember a moment in


---------175:16----------
meditation where I just started I didn't


---------175:18----------
used to cry very much or like I hadn't


---------175:20----------
cried like a decade and then there was a


---------175:23----------
moment meditation where I just wept and


---------175:25----------
wept and wept and it was kind of like


---------175:27----------
you know the catharsis that sometimes


---------175:29----------
happens here I had this catharsis where


---------175:31----------
I realized like I'm not any of the


---------175:33----------
things that I wanted to be and that I


---------175:37----------
shouldn't be and I'm just not like I


---------175:38----------
just don't live up to that standard and


---------175:41----------
