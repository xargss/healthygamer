---------00:00----------
yes I can see okay awesome and so let's


---------00:02----------
get started we got now yeah


---------00:04----------
so tell me how we're great about what


---------00:07----------
what how would you like to be addressed


---------00:08----------
by the way um unions call me dumb let's


---------00:11----------
call me dumb yeah


---------00:13----------
all right Dom so tell me a little bit


---------00:14----------
about what we're talking about today and


---------00:15----------
how I can be helpful um I'm not sure so


---------00:19----------
uh your assistant reached out to me I


---------00:20----------
think he wanted to discuss like I so I


---------00:23----------
developed panic disorder when I was like


---------00:24----------
24 which is when I was in LCS which I


---------00:27----------
don't know if you're familiar with


---------00:29----------
League of Legends but that's like the I


---------00:31----------
guess the premier North American


---------00:32----------
competition here so pretty much like I


---------00:36----------
came from there that's like how people


---------00:37----------
know me I played LCS for five years nice


---------00:39----------
dream I developed like some depression


---------00:43----------
so I went to like a psychiatrist and


---------00:44----------
everything I was diagnosed with


---------00:45----------
depression and I got sober of last year


---------00:50----------
so 2019 but I'm feeling like pretty good


---------00:53----------
now with like everything in terms of


---------00:55----------
like mental health but yeah I mean I


---------00:56----------
obviously like still have some struggles


---------00:58----------
but definitely we're on the up right now


---------01:01----------
I was just a man I'm so happy to hear


---------01:03----------
that yeah Thanks so so then in the in


---------01:07----------
that case Don Dom I want you to think a


---------01:09----------
little bit about me as a resource right


---------01:11----------
yeah so like what how can I be helpful


---------01:14----------
to you or is there some and if nothing


---------01:16----------
comes to mind then I can you know I can


---------01:18----------
try to take the lead but is there


---------01:19----------
something that you are struggling with


---------01:21----------
or that you'd like to bet on I mean I


---------01:24----------
mean I guess the main thing that I've


---------01:25----------
struggled with is similar to like LS


---------01:27----------
just like negative feedback from


---------01:29----------
community like reddit Twitter stuff like


---------01:31----------
that okay so I think that that's like


---------01:33----------
the main thing that I like don't handle


---------01:36----------
super super well um I had to look better


---------01:38----------
now than I used to obviously like I went


---------01:41----------
to therapy like with a psychiatrist for


---------01:44----------
I think I did like three or four


---------01:45----------
sessions but I think that just even in


---------01:47----------
those three or four sessions it helped


---------01:48----------
like kind of like reframe how I should


---------01:51----------
think about things and then they kind of


---------01:54----------
like set me on the right path towards


---------01:56----------
like how you can become happier


---------01:58----------
so yeah just just recently a good for


---------02:01----------
you I was I was able to like I guess


---------02:03----------
listen to their advice on things and


---------02:05----------
yeah everything's been going a lot


---------02:07----------
better now yeah cool so when you say


---------02:10----------
things have been going a lot better like


---------02:12----------
what has


---------02:14----------
what has changed in your life that makes


---------02:17----------
things better like what does better look


---------02:19----------
like um so just like generally like more


---------02:22----------
happy throughout the day I'm looking


---------02:24----------
towards by I'm looking forward to a lot


---------02:26----------
of things okay um that I do also I think


---------02:28----------
maybe people are still saying them a


---------02:30----------
little bit too loud okay


---------02:31----------
thank you very much but uh yeah I mean I


---------02:35----------
guess I guess happiness for me is like


---------02:36----------
I'm looking forward to the things that


---------02:37----------
I'm doing like like every day I wake up


---------02:40----------
excited for the day I was before I was I


---------02:42----------
was kind of just like I was like


---------02:44----------
dreading streaming that was pretty much


---------02:45----------
my um inside looks like [ __ ] like I got


---------02:47----------
a stream today all right I'm gonna do it


---------02:49----------
and then I wake and then like because


---------02:51----------
I'm already expecting the negativity


---------02:52----------
almost it felt like almost focused on


---------02:54----------
the negativity coming out of my chest


---------02:56----------
because like if you ever stream gameplay


---------02:57----------
there's definitely gonna be some


---------02:58----------
percentage of people that are either


---------03:00----------
backs like seat gaming you criticizing


---------03:02----------
you criticizing like random things about


---------03:04----------
you


---------03:05----------
and when you're in that negative mindset


---------03:06----------
it's like super easy to just focus on


---------03:09----------
only those comments read only those


---------03:10----------
comments and just like have bad streams


---------03:12----------
so just generally speaking like I just


---------03:14----------
put things in place to just enjoy my


---------03:17----------
life more day to day so it's like the


---------03:19----------
way I scream is different now than what


---------03:21----------
I used to do just like the content I do


---------03:23----------
is different


---------03:23----------
and it's stuff that I look forward to


---------03:25----------
personally uh-huh and then I guess like


---------03:28----------
I don't know I just I make more of an


---------03:30----------
effort to see my friends in person you


---------03:33----------
know like just yeah just care about like


---------03:36----------
what I'm doing with my time yeah so I


---------03:39----------
guess that's what better looks like


---------03:40----------
that's awesome and so I have a couple of


---------03:43----------
thoughts for you okay or a couple of and


---------03:46----------
and maybe like directions we can go and


---------03:47----------
also thinking a little bit about what's


---------03:50----------
maybe applicable to our audience the


---------03:52----------
first thing that I want to point out is


---------03:54----------
when you talk about streaming so we


---------03:56----------
generate you talk about streaming you


---------03:57----------
say that sometimes are you used to wake


---------03:59----------
up every day and read streaming and now


---------04:02----------
you wake up every day and you look


---------04:03----------
forward to it yep so that to me is


---------04:06----------
actually in a bizarre way really really


---------04:08----------
confusing even though it makes perfect


---------04:10----------
sense and so I can empathize with what


---------04:13----------
you're describing because I felt the


---------04:15----------
same way about activities in my life


---------04:17----------
like where some days I wake up and I'm


---------04:19----------
looking forward to one activity and


---------04:20----------
another day I look I wake up and I don't


---------04:23----------
look forward to that activity the thing


---------04:25----------
that seems really illogical to


---------04:27----------
about that is if we think about it most


---------04:29----------
people think about activities as


---------04:31----------
positive or negative right we assign a


---------04:33----------
value to the activity so like we'll say


---------04:36----------
like I don't like going to school I


---------04:38----------
don't like going to work I like hanging


---------04:41----------
out with my friends I like going out and


---------04:43----------
partying


---------04:44----------
I like playing video games and so most


---------04:46----------
people conceptualize the activity as


---------04:49----------
like the source of goodness or badness


---------04:51----------
right either it's fun or it's not fun


---------04:55----------
chores not going but if we really stop


---------04:57----------
and listen to what you're saying it's


---------04:59----------
really fascinating because even though


---------05:00----------
the activity may have changed a little


---------05:02----------
bit here there that your experience of


---------05:05----------
the activity will be positive or


---------05:06----------
negative which implies that your


---------05:08----------
enjoyment of life actually has is not


---------05:12----------
dependent on the activity that you do


---------05:14----------
but is dependent on something within you


---------05:16----------
mm-hm


---------05:17----------
what do you think about that Oh hun


---------05:21----------
percent agree so I guess the way that I


---------05:24----------
like rationalize that is the way that I


---------05:26----------
stream is so drastically different now


---------05:28----------
than what it used to be in terms of like


---------05:30----------
what the type of content I do in general


---------05:33----------
that it just gives me like a better


---------05:35----------
outlook just inherently because I'm more


---------05:38----------
excited for the things that I'm doing on


---------05:40----------
stream rather than what I was doing


---------05:41----------
before so like because I and I think


---------05:44----------
that it also just feeds into like my


---------05:45----------
chat interaction because I'm doing


---------05:47----------
things that I'm excited about for people


---------05:49----------
like sense that excitement or they sense


---------05:52----------
that like positivity and they don't


---------05:54----------
really want to like say anything


---------05:56----------
negative like they're just the odd man


---------05:57----------
out if their relatives towards me in my


---------05:59----------
chat so I think that that's it's kind of


---------06:02----------
like why it was so much better yeah so


---------06:04----------
Dom what I'm I'm hearing you say is that


---------06:06----------
when you bring posit so the way the


---------06:09----------
content has changed therefore you're


---------06:11----------
more positive and if you are more


---------06:13----------
positive when you stream it creates a


---------06:15----------
different interaction which then also


---------06:18----------
reinforces your enjoyment of the stream


---------06:21----------
yeah exactly right but that's also kind


---------06:24----------
of interesting because I'm I think the


---------06:26----------
key thing there you kind of talk about


---------06:27----------
the content change as where the start of


---------06:32----------
of the cycle is right so the change


---------06:35----------
comes because you change the what what


---------06:36----------
content you stream that's what you're


---------06:38----------
saying right but I wonder how much


---------06:40----------
that has to do with your attitude right


---------06:42----------
so even though that the content has


---------06:44----------
changed your attitude is it possible to


---------06:47----------
change your attitude in and of itself


---------06:49----------
and can that be the source of changing


---------06:53----------
your life so yeah that's pretty much


---------06:55----------
what we're trying to do so before I


---------06:58----------
guess the way I'll explain is I used to


---------07:00----------
just stream only gameplay obviously I'm


---------07:02----------
an ex pro player so people originally


---------07:04----------
knew me for my gameplay and that's like


---------07:06----------
where my first fan base came from and


---------07:08----------
then over time you know I wasn't playing


---------07:09----------
as much I wasn't enjoying the game as


---------07:11----------
much and I decided like okay maybe this


---------07:15----------
isn't the right thing for me like I've


---------07:16----------
done the same things forever and it felt


---------07:18----------
like when you're just doing the same


---------07:19----------
thing every single day for four years


---------07:21----------
there's nothing exciting to you anymore


---------07:24----------
so after we developed like an idea for


---------07:29----------
creating better content we're starting


---------07:31----------
to now try to apply that like good


---------07:33----------
attitude I have in that content towards


---------07:35----------
my normal stream so I do do gameplay a


---------07:37----------
certain amount of the time now like


---------07:39----------
right now our challenge on streams we're


---------07:41----------
trying to go because I'm known as like I


---------07:42----------
like toxic or like a flamer in game like


---------07:45----------
I like talk [ __ ] in game right that's


---------07:46----------
how people perceive me that's pretty


---------07:48----------
much like how I'm known in the community


---------07:51----------
to some extent obviously there's there's


---------07:53----------
good and bad but that's definitely part


---------07:54----------
of I'm characterized on the internet so


---------07:57----------
we're trying to go we're trying to do


---------07:59----------
the same type of like grind that we


---------08:01----------
would always do which is go from the


---------08:03----------
lowest rating in the game for the


---------08:04----------
highest rating in the game but we're


---------08:05----------
trying to do that with only a positive


---------08:07----------
attitude towards my teammates so I don't


---------08:08----------
say one negative thing to my team has


---------08:10----------
that were me so far we've we've not


---------08:13----------
flames a teammate we're about 50 games


---------08:15----------
it's a challenge we've not flamed anyone


---------08:17----------
but this is like the easiest part of it


---------08:18----------
because when you're in lower rating you


---------08:20----------
obviously win a lot more games it gets


---------08:22----------
really hard when you get like towards


---------08:24----------
the top and like one mistake and just


---------08:26----------
like lose you the game or put you far


---------08:28----------
behind and why do you flame so look okay


---------08:31----------
so this is great man so I'm really


---------08:32----------
excited to kind of talk further with you


---------08:34----------
can I lay out a couple of other options


---------08:36----------
and then let me know what you're


---------08:38----------
interested in or what chat is interested


---------08:40----------
in so one is further exploring how


---------08:42----------
attitudes so it's not the activity that


---------08:44----------
changes like interleague so the one


---------08:47----------
activity can we think about activities


---------08:50----------
as positive or negative but what I'm


---------08:51----------
hearing from you is that your attitude


---------08:52----------
actually if


---------08:54----------
facts whether the activity is fun or not


---------08:55----------
fun and so we can explore a little bit


---------08:58----------
about how you changed your attitude


---------08:59----------
because I think a lot of people are


---------09:01----------
stocked because they perceive an


---------09:03----------
activity like oh going to school is


---------09:05----------
boring or going to work is boring and if


---------09:08----------
we can better understand how you were


---------09:10----------
able to shift your attitude then maybe


---------09:12----------
people can start to do things that they


---------09:15----------
normally don't conceive of is fun yeah


---------09:18----------
and and that can start to be fun for


---------09:20----------
them so that's one option okay


---------09:21----------
definitely I mean I would like to talk


---------09:23----------
about that I mean it's obviously like


---------09:24----------
really basic stuff it's gonna sound so


---------09:26----------
dumb when I say it but part of it was


---------09:29----------
just that I wasn't taking care of myself


---------09:30----------
like in the proper way so I used to


---------09:32----------
stream every single day so for four


---------09:33----------
years I streamed every single day


---------09:34----------
starting at midnight and I would wake up


---------09:38----------
at midnight and I would stream until 8


---------09:39----------
a.m. so I changed my sleep schedule and


---------09:41----------
I always felt like [ __ ] up doing that


---------09:43----------
schedule like I always felt groggy when


---------09:45----------
I woke up it felt weird going to sleep


---------09:47----------
in the middle of the day like 4 p.m.


---------09:48----------
you're trying to go to sleep it's light


---------09:49----------
outside it just feels wrong even when


---------09:52----------
you get enough sleep it still just feels


---------09:53----------
feels bad so I changed my sleep schedule


---------09:55----------
I now start my stream at like 6 7 a.m.


---------09:58----------
so I wake up in the morning this is like


---------10:01----------
mainly through my like when I went to a


---------10:03----------
psychiatrist these are like the glaring


---------10:04----------
things or it's like you need to change


---------10:05----------
this [ __ ] was my diet like now I eat


---------10:08----------
three times a day I try to like start


---------10:09----------
the day with like oatmeal and a coffee


---------10:11----------
and then I just have like more healthy


---------10:13----------
meals throughout the day that's another


---------10:15----------
thing that helped me a lot


---------10:16----------
so diet and then just starting to


---------10:18----------
exercise again which I've been pretty


---------10:20----------
bad about recently but in the beginning


---------10:22----------
I tried to implement that into my life


---------10:26----------
so just like having just I guess a more


---------10:27----------
healthy body


---------10:28----------
I think drastically changed my attitude


---------10:30----------
so yeah dude-- yeah dude-- the the


---------10:35----------
challenge for me right now is that


---------10:37----------
everything you're saying is something


---------10:39----------
that I want to spend an hour talking to


---------10:40----------
you about talking about the relationship


---------10:46----------
between your body and mind the other


---------10:48----------
thing that I just want to drive home is


---------10:50----------
that you know what part of happiness or


---------10:54----------
contentment or joy comes from you and


---------10:57----------
what part of it comes from the outside


---------10:59----------
world


---------11:00----------
right like let's just think about this


---------11:03----------
for a second because what you're saying


---------11:04----------
is that your enjoyment of life


---------11:07----------
and we generally tend to conceptualize


---------11:09----------
pain or enjoyment is coming from outside


---------11:12----------
of us we think about our circumstances


---------11:15----------
we're like I'm unhappy because my


---------11:17----------
girlfriend broke up with me and so most


---------11:20----------
human beings really think about the


---------11:22----------
source of their unhappiness and it makes


---------11:24----------
perfect sense right if you get dumped by


---------11:25----------
your girlfriend like you're gonna be


---------11:26----------
unhappy but we think about we don't


---------11:28----------
think about so let's take the case of a


---------11:31----------
guy who gets dumped by his girlfriend


---------11:32----------
like the solution there is to you know


---------11:34----------
mourn for a little while and then like


---------11:37----------
find another girlfriend because that's


---------11:39----------
the solution to loneliness like you know


---------11:42----------
the substitute for a girlfriend is


---------11:43----------
another girlfriend we don't think about


---------11:44----------
the solution as and I love it what you


---------11:47----------
said you said eat three times a day


---------11:49----------
right we're not talking about like


---------11:51----------
eating super healthy we're not talking


---------11:53----------
about like increasing like going vegan


---------11:54----------
or eating like salads for lunch every


---------11:56----------
day you're just saying like [ __ ] eat


---------11:58----------
three times a day like real real low


---------12:01----------
barrier trying to eat healthy is not


---------12:04----------
what you said was successful for you you


---------12:06----------
say yeah I try to eat healthy try


---------12:08----------
implies that you don't succeed very much


---------12:10----------
but it sounds like what you are doing is


---------12:11----------
actually just eating three times a day


---------12:13----------
yep and


---------12:15----------
that is a fantastic example of like the


---------12:18----------
bar for feeling better and enjoying life


---------12:20----------
more is actually not about changing your


---------12:22----------
circumstances it's not about graduating


---------12:25----------
from college and getting a super nice


---------12:26----------
job it's not about making more money


---------12:28----------
it's about eating three times a day for


---------12:32----------
me yeah yeah it sounds crazy because


---------12:35----------
that's not the way we think about it


---------12:36----------
mm-hmm right yeah I mean it was all


---------12:39----------
things that I signed like really low


---------12:41----------
amounts of value to I was like yeah I


---------12:42----------
don't sleep enough and I know I have


---------12:44----------
like a [ __ ] up diet but that [ __ ] like


---------12:46----------
doesn't really matter to me like that's


---------12:47----------
not the reason why I'm unhappy it's


---------12:49----------
because like all this other stuff what


---------12:51----------
did you so much what did you think were


---------12:53----------
the reasons you were unhappy I thought


---------12:55----------
it was because I felt like reddit and


---------12:58----------
like Twitter and like all these big


---------13:00----------
social platforms like what heavily


---------13:02----------
mischaracterize me I thought it was


---------13:03----------
because of you know like I would read


---------13:05----------
like threads about how I'm like this


---------13:06----------
awful person like I'm a piece of [ __ ]


---------13:08----------
which happens to like everyone and I


---------13:09----------
just don't perceive people the same way


---------13:11----------
that those platforms do like a bunch of


---------13:13----------
the people you've had on here I've met


---------13:14----------
in real life like like reckful for


---------13:15----------
example and Mitch Jones ls and if you


---------13:19----------
read how people are


---------13:20----------
talked about like it's like these people


---------13:22----------
are just like [ __ ] on the bottom of


---------13:24----------
their boot that's literally how people


---------13:25----------
describe these people on livestream fail


---------13:27----------
ly like League of Legends subreddit


---------13:29----------
cetera and I just don't view like these


---------13:31----------
people as bad people I feel like they're


---------13:32----------
all good people so I want to continue


---------13:35----------
talking about positivity but I also want


---------13:37----------
to mention just another thing that we


---------13:38----------
could talk about which is like toxicity


---------13:41----------
in general and you were sort of saying


---------13:43----------
that you know if you start to play


---------13:44----------
poorly or you start to flame that like


---------13:46----------
people on twitch ad are gonna be toxic


---------13:48----------
towards you on people on LSM or toxic


---------13:50----------
towards you it sounds like you yourself


---------13:52----------
are like I'm toxic right so it's like if


---------13:55----------
I'm toxic or if they can label me as


---------13:57----------
toxic then it's like easy to be toxic to


---------14:00----------
the toxic sure feels like everyone wants


---------14:01----------
that outlet to be toxic on those but I


---------14:03----------
think we could also talk a little bit


---------14:05----------
about like where toxicity comes from so


---------14:08----------
you're saying that they mirror what you


---------14:09----------
give them which is also in line with


---------14:12----------
what you were saying about your


---------14:13----------
positivity or negativity on stream that


---------14:15----------
that you know people sort of follow


---------14:17----------
where you lead but then this question


---------14:18----------
still be caught like we can still


---------14:20----------
explore the question of why were you


---------14:22----------
toxic in the first place and why are


---------14:24----------
other people toxic in the first place


---------14:26----------
like where does toxicity come from you


---------14:28----------
know how does it affect us so we can


---------14:30----------
kind of explore toxicity we can explore


---------14:32----------
whether happiness or positive like


---------14:34----------
happiness or dissatisfaction comes from


---------14:37----------
reddit mischaracterizing you or eating


---------14:39----------
three meals a day which is also


---------14:40----------
collecting to me the last thing that I


---------14:42----------
kind of want to just mention to you and


---------14:44----------
it doesn't sound like we're gonna get to


---------14:45----------
this is it sounds like you haven't sort


---------14:47----------
of said this explicitly but it sounds


---------14:49----------
like at some point you started changing


---------14:51----------
the way that you view your identity then


---------14:55----------
yeah and and so I'm curious about how


---------15:00----------
much of your suffering or positive


---------15:03----------
trajectory or negative trajectory comes


---------15:05----------
from a sense like your definition of who


---------15:08----------
you are and how your life changed when


---------15:12----------
you started to view yourself in a


---------15:13----------
different way yeah so out of these three


---------15:17----------
there's part of our you know so like I


---------15:19----------
guess one thing I was gonna say is so


---------15:21----------
part of that came because I feel like


---------15:22----------
everything really just lined up like I'm


---------15:24----------
pretty lucky in the way it all lined up


---------15:26----------
because I I ended up changing my content


---------15:29----------
right and I tried to change my attitude


---------15:31----------
but then really what happened is like


---------15:32----------
because my content was


---------15:34----------
good or like at least in the League of


---------15:36----------
Legends community people just liked what


---------15:37----------
I was doing like I was doing certain


---------15:38----------
types of like Co streams that was doing


---------15:41----------
more analytical stuff and people valued


---------15:43----------
the stuff I was putting out I started


---------15:44----------
just receiving a lot more positive


---------15:45----------
feedback so I was somebody who was like


---------15:47----------
majority like majority hated on reddit


---------15:50----------
or at least League of Legends reddit for


---------15:52----------
like a lot of years and then when my


---------15:55----------
content improved you know all the cut


---------15:56----------
all the comments changed so I think that


---------15:58----------
kind of helped me feel better about


---------15:59----------
myself because I would read these


---------16:01----------
comments that are suddenly like you know


---------16:02----------
sometimes Dom gets frustrated in game


---------16:04----------
but you know recently he's trying harder


---------16:06----------
to be better and I really like him in


---------16:08----------
this format like there was just a lot


---------16:09----------
more positivity so it's because it feels


---------16:11----------
like everything kind of just lined up to


---------16:13----------
like yeah allow me to be happier so I


---------16:15----------
you know Dom respectfully I'm gonna


---------16:18----------
actually bizarre as the sounds disagree


---------16:20----------
with you a little bit and what I'm


---------16:22----------
really curious about is I think your


---------16:25----------
success sure you got positive feedback


---------16:27----------
in that fuel that but I think the key


---------16:29----------
thing here is how did you decide to try


---------16:32----------
new content yeah so pretty much what


---------16:36----------
happened was before I was really


---------16:37----------
motivated by you know stream numbers


---------16:40----------
like I was super focused on stream


---------16:41----------
members growth like everything like that


---------16:43----------
and I thought that what I was doing was


---------16:45----------
taking a hit I was like I'm just gonna


---------16:46----------
do stuff that I want to do that I think


---------16:48----------
will get less viewership but it'll be


---------16:50----------
more fulfilling to me so that I could be


---------16:52----------
more proud of what I was putting out so


---------16:55----------
yeah I mean that was pretty much like


---------16:56----------
what happened in my mind I tried to like


---------16:58----------
sacrifice the money and like growth of


---------17:01----------
my stream to do things that are


---------17:03----------
fulfilling but it end up just all


---------17:04----------
working out so yeah so but I think


---------17:06----------
that's the key thing right so if we


---------17:08----------
think about what you were doing you


---------17:10----------
actually made a sacrifice or you moved


---------17:12----------
away you did something that on paper was


---------17:15----------
a bad idea


---------17:16----------
mm-hm right you were saying like okay so


---------17:18----------
I'm focused on viewership numbers and if


---------17:21----------
I try something new people come to my


---------17:23----------
stream because they're expecting


---------17:24----------
something and and so in a sense you were


---------17:26----------
providing good content right like you


---------17:28----------
had a pretty stable viewership but you


---------17:32----------
know you had a good thing going and the


---------17:35----------
interesting thing that I'm hearing from


---------17:36----------
you is that you actually walked away


---------17:38----------
from a good thing by trying to new new


---------17:40----------
content yeah well yeah what was


---------17:43----------
perceived as a good thing yet like I


---------17:45----------
don't I wasn't necessarily growing but I


---------17:47----------
was pretty stable but


---------17:48----------
with my view count yeah I'm with you I


---------17:50----------
think perceived as the key word here


---------17:52----------
right so I think a lot of people do what


---------17:56----------
they perceive to be a good thing instead


---------17:59----------
of doing what like feels right to them


---------18:01----------
like we have this formula for success


---------18:03----------
and we have this idea that like okay if


---------18:05----------
I do X Y & Z I'm gonna be successful if


---------18:07----------
I continue streaming like you know


---------18:09----------
generally speaking most most twitch


---------18:11----------
streamers know that like if you're a


---------18:13----------
particular kind of get like if you're


---------18:15----------
like let's say a hearthstone player or a


---------18:17----------
law player and you try to play a new


---------18:19----------
game what happens to your viewership


---------18:22----------
exactly right so it's kind of common


---------18:25----------
knowledge that trying new stuff on


---------18:27----------
stream is like an objectively a bad idea


---------18:30----------
so what I think is really awesome about


---------18:33----------
what you were doing what you were able


---------18:35----------
to do is you had a particular formula


---------18:37----------
from six for success which you actually


---------18:39----------
walked away from how are you able to do


---------18:44----------
that right how are you able to make that


---------18:46----------
sacrifice um I think it like part of it


---------18:49----------
was just like talking to talking to my


---------18:51----------
mom about things and just like being


---------18:53----------
like okay like have I made enough money


---------18:56----------
at this point to like live modestly for


---------18:59----------
the rest of my life so once I'd like hit


---------19:01----------
that point where I felt like I'm gonna


---------19:03----------
be okay no matter what like I can move


---------19:04----------
to a place that doesn't have high like


---------19:07----------
taxing like I can move to like an area


---------19:09----------
and I could be fine I can raise the


---------19:10----------
family like I can do that once I hit


---------19:12----------
that like that number in my head were up


---------19:14----------
like okay I'm fine forever


---------19:15----------
then I just stopped caring as much about


---------19:18----------
the success of my stream because I


---------19:19----------
didn't view that like I just want to be


---------19:21----------
able to live the way that I like grew up


---------19:23----------
which was not like particularly I was


---------19:25----------
like middle-class like not particularly


---------19:27----------
particularly luxurious but I have


---------19:28----------
everything I need you know I always have


---------19:31----------
food always have like the ability to do


---------19:34----------
what I want so yeah so it sounds like


---------19:36----------
you hit a particular amount of financial


---------19:38----------
security that allowed you to take a


---------19:40----------
chance yeah yep at the same time I it


---------19:43----------
sounds like your financial security


---------19:45----------
while that gave you the kind of gave you


---------19:49----------
the security to take a chance it sounds


---------19:52----------
like your success does not actually have


---------19:54----------
to do with your financial security Yeah


---------19:59----------
right


---------19:59----------
I think outwardly that's what that's how


---------20:01----------
its


---------20:02----------
but yeah I think it's this is important


---------20:04----------
to understand right so for people who


---------20:05----------
are feeling stuck I I think that what


---------20:08----------
I'm really like what this is by the way


---------20:10----------
going in a completely different


---------20:11----------
direction from panic disorder and


---------20:12----------
depression which is great but I what I'm


---------20:15----------
really kind of fascinated by is that and


---------20:17----------
I've noticed this kind of time and again


---------20:19----------
that I think that success doesn't come


---------20:21----------
from taking good opportunities I think


---------20:23----------
success comes from walking away from


---------20:25----------
good opportunities what do you think


---------20:27----------
about that that's like I mean it's


---------20:32----------
definitely an interesting way to it just


---------20:34----------
sounds it sounds so so logical but I


---------20:36----------
guess I guess that that does make sense


---------20:38----------
because if you're walking away from good


---------20:39----------
opportunities you're probably doing it


---------20:41----------
for a reason so if like the reason it's


---------20:43----------
good enough for you that sounds like so


---------20:45----------
what kind of and spot-on right so here's


---------20:48----------
the point that I'm making and I think


---------20:49----------
you kind of embody this is that in order


---------20:52----------
to walk away from it like what is it


---------20:54----------
within you that allows you to walk away


---------20:56----------
from a good opportunity like what do you


---------20:58----------
have to do to walk away from a


---------21:00----------
successful stream I mean I guess for me


---------21:03----------
you just have to convince yourself that


---------21:04----------
the benefits you're gonna get from


---------21:07----------
whatever you're gonna do in the future


---------21:09----------
is going to be like you're just gonna


---------21:11----------
have some type of positive over what you


---------21:14----------
had before so it could be like what kind


---------21:16----------
what kind of benefit so I think that's


---------21:19----------
important right so what kind of benefit


---------21:21----------
what were you what if we think about you


---------21:23----------
stopping your loss stream there's


---------21:24----------
traditional rock little all stream and


---------21:26----------
doing like more analysis and other


---------21:28----------
things like that


---------21:29----------
what were you moving towards within


---------21:32----------
yourself um just like like more like


---------21:37----------
emotional happiness I guess so is just


---------21:38----------
like it was trading off like security I


---------21:42----------
guess for emotional well-being yeah I


---------21:45----------
guess I even sort of answered so I think


---------21:48----------
what I what I'm noticing is that


---------21:50----------
actually when I say what were you moving


---------21:52----------
towards within yourself that's the key


---------21:54----------
thing is that you stopped moving towards


---------21:56----------
the external world and you started


---------21:58----------
moving towards yourself mm-hmm


---------22:01----------
is that fair to say yep and and it's


---------22:04----------
awfully fair and and that I think is


---------22:06----------
like beautiful and I think it's critical


---------22:08----------
because when most people feel stuck in


---------22:10----------
life where do they move


---------22:15----------
I mean normally they move I would say it


---------22:19----------
would be like Alps it right like it


---------22:20----------
would be more like external they've


---------22:21----------
moved towards like more external success


---------22:22----------
absolutely right so the worse that you


---------22:25----------
feel about yourself the more that you


---------22:27----------
gravitate towards an external thing you


---------22:29----------
kind of come up with a formula for


---------22:31----------
success and I imagine that when you were


---------22:33----------
feeling shitty before you decided to


---------22:35----------
kind of make this big change which


---------22:36----------
sounds like it came through a lot of


---------22:38----------
conversation and a lot of reflection


---------22:40----------
right it's not like something that you


---------22:41----------
just woke up one day and you're like


---------22:43----------
[ __ ] it I'm done with this yeah it


---------22:45----------
sounds like my friends and you know yeah


---------22:49----------
so it sounds like you did a lot of


---------22:50----------
soul-searching to try to figure out what


---------22:53----------
you wanted to do before you went through


---------22:55----------
this process how did you feel about like


---------22:57----------
like when you were feeling shitty about


---------23:00----------
like what's a so how long ago were you


---------23:03----------
in the LCS uh four years ago okay so


---------23:07----------
let's say like one and a half years


---------23:09----------
after leaving the LCS how happy were you


---------23:12----------
um I'd say I was pretty happy but that


---------23:16----------
was because like it was the first time


---------23:17----------
where I had because when I was in the


---------23:19----------
LCS of his complete different thing way


---------23:20----------
I'd never experienced financial success


---------23:22----------
and then I also was like traveling a bit


---------23:24----------
and I like fell in love with a girl from


---------23:26----------
Australia and I just liked traveling to


---------23:27----------
Australia so I just like felt like my


---------23:29----------
life was so cool at that point it's like


---------23:30----------
oh I can work from anywhere like I've


---------23:32----------
been you know up until this point for


---------23:33----------
the last five six years I've been like


---------23:35----------
in a gaming house grinding and now I


---------23:37----------
have the freedom that I can just go to


---------23:38----------
Australia for three months and just like


---------23:41----------
experience all these new things so I'd


---------23:42----------
say I was pretty happy at that point cuz


---------23:44----------
everything was just like different what


---------23:46----------
happened to your happiness um well I


---------23:51----------
mean obviously like the start of a


---------23:53----------
relationship is always the best part I


---------23:54----------
feel like we're not necessarily always


---------23:55----------
the best part but there's like a


---------23:57----------
honeymoon phase obviously right I think


---------23:58----------
you start being more realistic with like


---------24:01----------
your flaws the other person's flaws how


---------24:03----------
you guys actually like wind up together


---------24:07----------
so the relationship just ended up being


---------24:09----------
you know less and less beneficial for


---------24:13----------
for my happiness personally also like


---------24:16----------
yeah I mean we were both dealing with


---------24:18----------
with our own things like we both had


---------24:19----------
depression at the same time which was


---------24:20----------
like kind of like and I think that's


---------24:22----------
kind of like when you're when you live


---------24:24----------
with somebody that that's depressed I


---------24:26----------
feel like it's it's like


---------24:28----------
you become depressed too or something


---------24:29----------
absolutely right so like we both weren't


---------24:33----------
like in the best state and then also I


---------24:35----------
think that my career started to plateau


---------24:37----------
because I think part of the reason why I


---------24:39----------
was so happy and like like a year and a


---------24:41----------
half in it was like every like bit I


---------24:43----------
would be like oh I get to see my viewers


---------24:44----------
go for like 3k and a 3.5 to 4k like I


---------24:46----------
was very like focused on that being


---------24:48----------
success more viewers equals success


---------24:50----------
that's like what my mentality was so


---------24:53----------
everything was going up and then my


---------24:55----------
relationship started to like plateau and


---------24:57----------
then maybe even decline and then my


---------24:58----------
career started to plateau so then it's


---------25:01----------
just like when when you start plateauing


---------25:02----------
I feel like when you don't feel like


---------25:03----------
you're making any progress in your


---------25:05----------
career and you don't feel like you're


---------25:06----------
making any progress in your relationship


---------25:08----------
it just it felt like I just wasn't like


---------25:10----------
doing anything positive like I didn't


---------25:11----------
feel like I was growing day by day it


---------25:13----------
was just like oh I'm just like existing


---------25:14----------
yeah beautifully set right you're just


---------25:17----------
existing so you're not you're not really


---------25:20----------
like living life it's just life is just


---------25:22----------
moving around you you know and it's just


---------25:25----------
kind of proceeding on its own and you're


---------25:27----------
just kind of there day to day so I want


---------25:29----------
to tunnel down into this a little bit so


---------25:31----------
you know how is your life different now


---------25:35----------
and in terms of in terms of what in


---------25:39----------
terms of like like feeling happy um well


---------25:42----------
I guess like part of it is that instead


---------25:44----------
of looking at view count for things I'm


---------25:47----------
more like proud of the content that I


---------25:49----------
produce so when I go back I feel like


---------25:52----------
because I've started like now I have two


---------25:54----------
podcasts that I do and they're well


---------25:57----------
received in the community and I just


---------25:58----------
like doing them they're really exciting


---------26:00----------
for me I have like bodies of work where


---------26:02----------
at the end of it it's like it's not like


---------26:03----------
oh I just grinded another year for no


---------26:05----------
reason I can look back at like my


---------26:07----------
YouTube videos or I can like put like


---------26:09----------
look at like a playlist of all my my


---------26:11----------
videos and be like that is like a body


---------26:12----------
of work I did here's my show the crack


---------26:14----------
down season one there it is I did that


---------26:17----------
I'm proud of it I'm happy about that so


---------26:18----------
like professionally I feel like I have


---------26:19----------
some gratification whereas before it was


---------26:21----------
kind of just like month to month like


---------26:22----------
let's try to just do things that Cyprian


---------26:24----------
more viewership exactly so so I'm and


---------26:27----------
Dom you got to let me know if I'm like


---------26:29----------
hammering at a point too much but I just


---------26:30----------
hear you you lacing it into so much of


---------26:33----------
what you're saying so I just want you to


---------26:34----------
think a little bit about where was your


---------26:38----------
barometer of success coming from when


---------26:41----------
you


---------26:41----------
were unhappy um just like average view


---------26:46----------
account exactly literally like the


---------26:47----------
biggest where is your barometer for hat


---------26:49----------
for success coming from now um just like


---------26:54----------
when I'm done with whatever I produce


---------26:57----------
feeling good about it like if I if I


---------26:59----------
don't get any viewers and I'm hat and


---------27:02----------
like I do a piece of content that I like


---------27:05----------
I'm just like okay that was good for me


---------27:08----------
you know that was beneficial so like


---------27:11----------
even even things like coming on um like


---------27:13----------
you're surely I would are like yeah


---------27:16----------
being able to talk to you this is


---------27:17----------
something like before I'd be like last


---------27:19----------
year I'd be weighing that like in the


---------27:21----------
mentality of like oh this like increased


---------27:23----------
my branding well like I'd be getting


---------27:25----------
like followers from this like it was


---------27:26----------
like a really like [ __ ] up way to


---------27:27----------
think but I think that just like when


---------27:29----------
you stream for so long and you talk to


---------27:30----------
all these streamers it just becomes like


---------27:32----------
so hammered into you so I'd be like


---------27:33----------
thinking about okay I'm talking to dr. K


---------27:36----------
is it better to the stream for three


---------27:37----------
hours if I made more money streaming


---------27:38----------
through it for three hours do I gain


---------27:40----------
more reach by talking to dr. K and that


---------27:42----------
would be just like the my like what I'd


---------27:44----------
be think what got in my head to judge


---------27:45----------
whether or not I sure that that does


---------27:47----------
that what's [ __ ] up about that that's


---------27:50----------
how I'm very intelligent to me well I


---------27:52----------
think it's just like so business II when


---------27:54----------
the point of talking to you is I get to


---------27:57----------
talk to a Harvard PhD psychologist that


---------28:00----------
is extremely intelligent about you know


---------28:03----------
about these things that I'm that I'm


---------28:05----------
thinking about you know so it's like


---------28:06----------
it's an opportunity to talk to you it's


---------28:08----------
not an opportunity to grow my brand yeah


---------28:11----------
so how do you think it is that you're


---------28:13----------
able to change the way that you look at


---------28:15----------
a conversation right so like this once


---------28:17----------
again nothing has changed in the outside


---------28:19----------
world something has changed within you


---------28:21----------
which affects the way that you look at


---------28:24----------
the outside world um yeah I don't know I


---------28:29----------
guess it's just like that quest for like


---------28:31----------
I guess I guess it's just like being


---------28:34----------
conscious of like your own happiness and


---------28:36----------
then like questing towards that I guess


---------28:38----------
it would be yeah and and so I think this


---------28:41----------
so most people are conscious of their


---------28:43----------
own unhappiness and and the way that


---------28:46----------
they quest towards it is on the outside


---------28:48----------
right like and that's what you were


---------28:50----------
doing for a long time like you were


---------28:51----------
thinking about the outside you were


---------28:52----------
thinking about the outcomes you were


---------28:54----------
thinking about viewership you were think


---------28:55----------
about monetization those are all


---------28:57----------
important business decisions and I


---------28:59----------
adventure that you actually still think


---------29:00----------
about that stuff right yeah definitely


---------29:02----------
but like I guess I guess the main thing


---------29:04----------
that I would say is like I assign value


---------29:07----------
to other things before before I didn't I


---------29:10----------
didn't assign value to like hang out


---------29:11----------
with my friends for a night like it was


---------29:14----------
like oh that


---------29:14----------
like I don't gain anything from that


---------29:16----------
monetarily or business-wise so it's not


---------29:19----------
valuable so I think that my mentality


---------29:20----------
change like trying to find the value


---------29:22----------
within like just your actions throughout


---------29:24----------
the day like come on spending two hours


---------29:26----------
talking to you like what is the value of


---------29:27----------
that what is the value of like having


---------29:31----------
you know a good conversation with my


---------29:33----------
friends like how am I gonna feel the


---------29:34----------
next day like just assigning more value


---------29:36----------
to those types of things I think helped


---------29:37----------
me like mentally a lot yeah


---------29:40----------
beautifully said right so if I I think


---------29:43----------
if I had to find an answer to all of the


---------29:45----------
questions I've been asking you Dom I


---------29:46----------
think you just gave it to me so most


---------29:49----------
people who were stuck they have a set


---------29:53----------
they have like a chart in their mind


---------29:55----------
about what's valuable and they tend to


---------29:58----------
gravitate towards the things that are


---------30:00----------
high value right like you kind of think


---------30:02----------
about okay if I do this


---------30:03----------
like what's valuable is getting more


---------30:06----------
viewership in making more money getting


---------30:08----------
building my brand that's what is


---------30:10----------
valuable and so what happens is all of


---------30:13----------
your actions you think about okay


---------30:15----------
there's high value stuff and there's low


---------30:17----------
value stuff and you chase the high value


---------30:19----------
stuff and you forget about the low value


---------30:21----------
stuff the fundamental thing start go


---------30:24----------
ahead well I was just gonna say I also


---------30:26----------
just like felt like I was being a [ __ ]


---------30:27----------
if I wasn't pursuing that stuff so if I


---------30:29----------
like exactly went out and partied I was


---------30:31----------
like oh that's like a day I just lost


---------30:33----------
streaming like I'm just like [ __ ] up


---------30:34----------
I'm being selfish is kind of how I


---------30:36----------
viewed it yeah it's like good to be


---------30:37----------
selfish in that


---------30:39----------
yeah it's that way I would say so so the


---------30:42----------
reason that you felt like it sounds like


---------30:43----------
you felt like a [ __ ] but that once


---------30:45----------
again is based on your perception of


---------30:47----------
what's valuable and what is it like you


---------30:49----------
felt like a [ __ ] you felt like you


---------30:51----------
felt selfish and guilty for doing the


---------30:53----------
low value thing instead of a high value


---------30:55----------
thing mm-hm


---------30:57----------
what I'm hearing from you now this is


---------30:58----------
that I tried to jot down your exact word


---------31:00----------
egde because I thought it was it was


---------31:02----------
excellent


---------31:02----------
trying to find value and activities


---------31:04----------
throughout the day that's fundamentally


---------31:06----------
what I think has changed about you yeah


---------31:09----------
is that what you've done is instead of


---------31:11----------
having a standard of high value and low


---------31:13----------
value in gravitating towards high value


---------31:15----------
stuff you tried to find value and so


---------31:18----------
instead of like your life being about


---------31:20----------
ups and downs like there's good stuff


---------31:22----------
and there's bad stuff there's horizontal


---------31:24----------
value across the board and so what it


---------31:27----------
does is it allows you to do different


---------31:29----------
kinds of activities which sort of


---------31:31----------
enriches your life overall and what's


---------31:33----------
happened to your success over the last


---------31:35----------
two or three years well I mean in the


---------31:39----------
last yeah in the last two or three


---------31:40----------
months since I've been I guess or like I


---------31:42----------
guess maybe five months six months now


---------31:44----------
yeah it just all went up like


---------31:45----------
everything's just been better


---------31:47----------
so that's [ __ ] weird right so like if


---------31:49----------
we think about you started moving away


---------31:50----------
from the high value things and your


---------31:52----------
success has improved yep so this goes


---------31:56----------
back to and I'm convinced of this


---------31:58----------
because I've talked to a lot of people


---------32:00----------
who've been very successful and and what


---------32:02----------
it basically is is like I I kind of what


---------32:05----------
I see in all of them they're not all I


---------32:08----------
mean all is a lot but you know I think


---------32:09----------
what I've observed the joys to them is


---------32:11----------
that most of them do essentially what


---------32:13----------
you did which is that they walk away


---------32:16----------
from the high value stuff so success


---------32:19----------
once again comes away from walking away


---------32:21----------
from good opportunities not taking them


---------32:24----------
and oftentimes we think about good


---------32:27----------
opportunities as like things that we


---------32:29----------
really need to be doing and we beat


---------32:30----------
ourselves up go ahead you look well no I


---------32:33----------
was gonna say like are they are there


---------32:34----------
opportunities actually good if you're


---------32:36----------
like the better option is to walk away


---------32:39----------
from them beautifully put right and in


---------32:42----------
the this is what's changed about your


---------32:44----------
mindset because you used to think that


---------32:46----------
there are good opportunities and there


---------32:47----------
are bad opportunities and and now what


---------32:50----------
I'm hearing from you is is spot-on


---------32:51----------
that's like that's the next-level


---------32:53----------
comment is that when you look at an


---------32:55----------
opportunity it can look good on paper


---------32:57----------
but it doesn't mean that it's good for


---------32:59----------
you right and in that that like when we


---------33:03----------
think about what someone says is a good


---------33:04----------
opportunity we're using some kind of


---------33:06----------
objective or external criteria and the


---------33:09----------
whole point is that it's actually not a


---------33:11----------
good opportunity even though it looks


---------33:12----------
like a good opportunity if you asked a


---------33:15----------
dozen streamers or a hundred streamers


---------33:17----------
would you consider like if you have a


---------33:21----------
successful viewership count


---------33:23----------
delivering one kind of content would you


---------33:25----------
think about decreasing that content and


---------33:27----------
trying something new what are they gonna


---------33:29----------
say I mean I guess it depends on the


---------33:33----------
streamer because I've had I have had


---------33:34----------
friends that have just like walked away


---------33:35----------
from that but most people are just gonna


---------33:37----------
be like you know that's just a dumb


---------33:39----------
business decision like it's exactly


---------33:41----------
right killing your so it is exactly


---------33:43----------
killing your career that's walking away


---------33:46----------
from a quote unquote good opportunity


---------33:48----------
and they're all [ __ ] wrong so I think


---------33:51----------
that you you have your business acumen


---------33:52----------
which I'm sure you leverage to make a


---------33:55----------
successful podcast right it's not like


---------33:57----------
you just wake up one day and and you


---------33:58----------
just decide to follow your heart it's


---------34:01----------
using all your business acumen but not


---------34:03----------
sacrificing the person that you are of


---------34:05----------
course I still click the [ __ ] out of my


---------34:07----------
podcast right yes oh that's exactly what


---------34:09----------
you have to do so I'm not saying you let


---------34:11----------
go of that it's about sort of not being


---------34:14----------
a slave to that click mate it's about


---------34:17----------
you being in charge of the clickbait


---------34:18----------
instead of the clickbait being in charge


---------34:20----------
of you and used to be like you know if


---------34:23----------
it's if it's not click beta ballif I


---------34:25----------
can't get more viewership I'm not gonna


---------34:27----------
do it now you're saying like ok let me


---------34:28----------
use my click baiting skills to do


---------34:30----------
something that I love and try to make it


---------34:32----------
successful and reach more people sounds


---------34:34----------
beautiful


---------34:35----------
yeah it's all working out yeah man I'm


---------34:39----------
really really happy for you you you have


---------34:42----------
any thoughts or questions I just


---------34:43----------
realized I've been kind of steering the


---------34:44----------
conversation for a while no I mean I


---------34:47----------
guess my thoughts right now err I think


---------34:51----------
the way that you've like spoken about


---------34:52----------
things has given me like a better idea


---------34:55----------
of just like categorizing certain things


---------34:57----------
like because like I've thought of a lot


---------35:00----------
of this stuff but I haven't really you


---------35:02----------
know had a conversation with somebody


---------35:04----------
where I was like ok assign value to


---------35:06----------
other things throughout the day which


---------35:07----------
makes a lot of sense because I um so I


---------35:11----------
this is gonna sound weird but I look


---------35:12----------
into like a rapper named Jay Cole I


---------35:14----------
don't know if you know Jay Cole but he's


---------35:15----------
a huge rapper and he was talking about


---------35:17----------
like kind of how he dealt with uh he


---------35:19----------
didn't really talk about depression but


---------35:21----------
he talked about something similar to it


---------35:23----------
I guess like how he got out of like a


---------35:25----------
funk I guess is what what he said and


---------35:26----------
one of the things that he was talking


---------35:28----------
about his assigning value to random


---------35:29----------
things throughout the day so like if he


---------35:30----------
took out the trash you try to like be


---------35:32----------
like hey this is like has a purpose and


---------35:34----------
like like I'm taking out the trash and


---------35:35----------
then when he was


---------35:36----------
done with that task he felt good about


---------35:38----------
himself afterwards where before it would


---------35:41----------
just be like yeah he's gotta [ __ ]


---------35:42----------
take out the trash so I think that that


---------35:44----------
is like kind of that's like pretty


---------35:46----------
accurate in what the like goal is of


---------35:49----------
trying to just be happy it's like


---------35:51----------
assigning value to things and then like


---------35:54----------
when you've completed them be allowing


---------35:56----------
yourself to feel good about completing


---------35:57----------
them so beautifully part Dom because


---------36:00----------
this kind of goes back to this idea that


---------36:01----------
taking out the trash is an activity and


---------36:04----------
most people think that taking out the


---------36:06----------
trash is a chore no one looks at taking


---------36:09----------
out the trash as an opportunity and so


---------36:12----------
it is it is not actually the task which


---------36:15----------
brings us happiness or unhappiness it is


---------36:18----------
our attitude towards the task and the


---------36:20----------
value that we're able to assign to it


---------36:22----------
that's what I'm hearing from you and


---------36:24----------
that is something that I think very very


---------36:26----------
very few people understand because if


---------36:29----------
you think about like how do we live our


---------36:30----------
life it's like oh go to college get a


---------36:32----------
job get married have kids these are all


---------36:34----------
things that we think about is like


---------36:36----------
high-value tasks and so we gravitate


---------36:38----------
towards those things and then what


---------36:40----------
happens is that you end up is my patient


---------36:42----------
which is like a 45 year old investment


---------36:45----------
banker who's very successful has a


---------36:47----------
million dollar home and you know makes


---------36:49----------
tons of money every year and feels empty


---------36:51----------
inside because what he has done is chase


---------36:54----------
the high value task time and time and


---------36:57----------
time again instead of like as cheesy as


---------37:00----------
the sounds following his heart right and


---------37:03----------
so he dreads going to work every day but


---------37:06----------
he does it because it's it's a good


---------37:08----------
opportunity and when he thinks about


---------37:10----------
quitting the ideas like like terrifying


---------37:12----------
to him and he goes to his mentors in his


---------37:15----------
bosses and his colleagues and he's like


---------37:16----------
hey I'm thinking about quitting and


---------37:18----------
they're like man you're crazy like


---------37:20----------
everyone wants to be like you know


---------37:22----------
managing partner at Goldman Sachs and


---------37:24----------
you're one step away why would you walk


---------37:27----------
away from this it's such an amazing


---------37:29----------
opportunity I think that's one of the


---------37:30----------
opportunities that streaming has is like


---------37:33----------
even though you will have like a certain


---------37:35----------
audience that is keen to whatever


---------37:38----------
content you've produced originally I


---------37:40----------
feel like you can kind of do whatever


---------37:42----------
you want at the end of the day like


---------37:43----------
there is nothing that says like you have


---------37:45----------
to like I don't have to just wake up and


---------37:47----------
stream leads every day like I could do


---------37:48----------
something else whereas like if you are


---------37:50----------
an investment


---------37:50----------
banker it feels like you're kind of more


---------37:51----------
pigeon-holed into like like that is what


---------37:54----------
your degree is in like you should be an


---------37:55----------
investment banker at that point why is


---------37:57----------
why do you want why do you believe that


---------37:59----------
his situation is different from yours um


---------38:02----------
I guess because of like the amount of


---------38:04----------
work he probably put in in like


---------38:06----------
positioning himself within that field to


---------38:10----------
to be successful so his like whatever


---------38:15----------
college degree he ended up getting I


---------38:16----------
assume that he has to get a master's


---------38:17----------
potentially a PhD like all those things


---------38:20----------
to grind towards one goal I feel like it


---------38:23----------
kind of puts you in a yeah how old are


---------38:28----------
you don't mind me asking 29 okay so I'm


---------38:32----------
pretty sure that you have you have grind


---------38:34----------
like four years ago or three years ago


---------38:37----------
I'm pretty sure that the amount of grind


---------38:39----------
that both of you had done was comparable


---------38:41----------
or even yours is greater potentially


---------38:45----------
right so IIIi don't I think that yes I


---------38:50----------
guess what I was pretty much a meowt was


---------38:52----------
like my grind was essentially to like it


---------38:56----------
sounds weird but it's like your grind is


---------38:57----------
like to become popular on the Internet


---------38:58----------
where his grind was towards getting like


---------39:00----------
qualifications to be able to perform


---------39:02----------
whatever job he's doing now yeah and and


---------39:04----------
so so I think that you know this is


---------39:06----------
something that I understand your


---------39:07----------
perception is that way I don't really


---------39:09----------
agree so I think that is capacity to


---------39:11----------
become a streamer is about as high as


---------39:14----------
your capacity to become an investment


---------39:16----------
banker but I think that like you can


---------39:18----------
sort of do when you say you can do


---------39:20----------
whatever you want you can't really do


---------39:21----------
whatever you want to what you can do is


---------39:23----------
move like one step laterally at a time


---------39:26----------
within your field right so has you


---------39:28----------
become a like an influencer or streamer


---------39:31----------
you can start to create new content but


---------39:33----------
you're still a streamer but you're just


---------39:35----------
kind of moving laterally and he's


---------39:36----------
capable of doing the same lateral move


---------39:38----------
so he can move from Investment Banking


---------39:40----------
into venture capital he can become an


---------39:41----------
angel investor he can become CFO chief


---------39:45----------
financial officer of like a company yeah


---------39:46----------
he can move that way and that's


---------39:48----------
basically what I did too I mean I'm I'm


---------39:50----------
a you know a psychiatrist and so I


---------39:51----------
trained for many many years to like


---------39:53----------
understand psychiatry and neuroscience


---------39:54----------
and so I can't become a pro gamer but I


---------39:57----------
can sure as hell start talking to gamers


---------39:59----------
about their mental health and how their


---------40:00----------
brain works that's like a really big


---------40:02----------
lateral step if you think about it


---------40:04----------
yeah that makes that make sense you're


---------40:06----------
definitely right about that yeah and and


---------40:08----------
so I think um you know as you understand


---------40:11----------
the individual field I think everyone


---------40:12----------
can make lateral changes you can't jump


---------40:15----------
from like a to Z but you can definitely


---------40:17----------
go from like a to D and what I'm hearing


---------40:19----------
from you is that you've branched out


---------40:21----------
laterally and I think this is also


---------40:22----------
something that's leads to a lot of


---------40:24----------
successes when people start branching


---------40:25----------
out laterally from there like one thing


---------40:28----------
so to produce a podcast I think is like


---------40:31----------
a fantastic idea right because you're


---------40:32----------
kind of there's some of your core


---------40:34----------
audience and then you're kind of


---------40:35----------
appealing to like slightly different


---------40:36----------
people you're kind of expanding your


---------40:38----------
base by offering a different kind of


---------40:40----------
content there are a lot of people like


---------40:42----------
so what percentage of League of Legends


---------40:43----------
players have podcasts ah not sure that's


---------40:48----------
a very small amount exactly right so


---------40:51----------
you're also differentiating yourself


---------40:53----------
from your competition because there are


---------40:54----------
lots of people who are League of Legends


---------40:57----------
players there are lots of pros lots of


---------40:58----------
streamers it's a very popular game but


---------41:00----------
not everyone has a podcast so you're


---------41:02----------
kind of enhancing your brand by kind of


---------41:03----------
expanding that way so I mean yeah I'm


---------41:06----------
just I'm really happy to am I just


---------41:08----------
talking too much because I'm excited I


---------41:10----------
love what I'm hearing okay let's make it


---------41:12----------
yeah it's making perfect sense I think


---------41:14----------
it's helping how is it helping I guess


---------41:18----------
just like giving more definition to a


---------41:19----------
lot of like the ideas I've had and like


---------41:21----------
some reinforcement on certain ideas some


---------41:24----------
like new opinions on other ideas like


---------41:26----------
obviously like the what we just talked


---------41:27----------
about about like lateral movements


---------41:29----------
within your field I think that's like


---------41:30----------
something that I can definitely take and


---------41:32----------
like apply to whatever I do next if I do


---------41:34----------
something next or just like a different


---------41:36----------
way to kind of think about what I am


---------41:39----------
doing because I kind of just view it as


---------41:40----------
like oh I'm doing different [ __ ] but


---------41:42----------
it's better to think about it as like


---------41:44----------
lateral moves within your field I think


---------41:47----------
that's like a very like good idea yeah


---------41:49----------
so I'm happy it's helpful and I'm a


---------41:53----------
little bit curious why does defining


---------41:55----------
stuff help um I guess it's because then


---------41:57----------
when I think about the concept I can


---------41:59----------
kind of just like jump to things so


---------42:01----------
instead of just thinking about like


---------42:03----------
things in so many words in my head or


---------42:05----------
just like I don't have to be like oh I


---------42:07----------
move from this to that and like leave


---------42:09----------
like like I can just be like that's a


---------42:11----------
lot of move within my field


---------42:12----------
what's another idea like what so that's


---------42:14----------
the concept right so then if I like him


---------42:16----------
define the concept to me


---------42:17----------
I think that it just will like help me


---------42:19----------
apply it later on okay so sense makes a


---------42:22----------
lot of sense Dom I'm gonna still push


---------42:23----------
you a little bit okay all right so now


---------42:25----------
what I'm gonna ask you to do is define


---------42:27----------
how defining is helpful so right so so


---------42:32----------
like so I think defining is helpful


---------42:34----------
because it gives you like a mental


---------42:36----------
framework in which you can like apply


---------42:38----------
the concept to different things what is


---------42:40----------
different about problem-solving with a


---------42:43----------
mental framework versus problem-solving


---------42:45----------
without a mental framework what does it


---------42:46----------
do in your mind I think it's like just


---------42:48----------
like it's like driving when you have


---------42:52----------
like directions that's kind of how I see


---------42:54----------
it it's just like having a map to


---------42:56----------
something okay so this is gonna sound


---------42:59----------
some kind of like a dumb question but


---------43:00----------
why is driving with directions better


---------43:03----------
than driving without directions I guess


---------43:06----------
it just makes you feel more like calm


---------43:08----------
and stable while you're while you're


---------43:10----------
driving like for me like I'll just I'll


---------43:13----------
feel better about it so I'm sure you


---------43:15----------
feel better about it but I think if we


---------43:17----------
think about the like pardon me for


---------43:19----------
saying so I just don't think that that's


---------43:21----------
really that's a piece of it but that's


---------43:23----------
not the majority of it right if I'm


---------43:25----------
trying to get from point A to point B


---------43:28----------
exactly right it has nothing to do with


---------43:30----------
how I [ __ ] feel it's about like


---------43:32----------
knowing where you're going right yeah


---------43:35----------
and and so this is where I'm gonna pull


---------43:38----------
do you meditate by the way


---------43:39----------
no okay I tried I've tried a couple


---------43:42----------
times I think that it's super high value


---------43:45----------
right I just I don't know I feel like I


---------43:49----------
should okay so like that's that's like a


---------43:51----------
long can we can we save a little bit of


---------43:53----------
time I'd love to talk to you about


---------43:54----------
meditation if you're interested in


---------43:55----------
learning I'd love to help you try to


---------43:57----------
problem-solve about how you can meditate


---------43:59----------
in a way that feels comfortable for you


---------44:01----------
yeah and is helpful so I'm gonna use a


---------44:05----------
concept from meditation so this is what


---------44:06----------
I'm gonna say so if we think about


---------44:07----------
getting from you know where you are to


---------44:10----------
where your destination is if you have a


---------44:12----------
road map it essentially focuses the


---------44:15----------
effort of driving does that make sense


---------44:18----------
so instead of driving across ten


---------44:20----------
different roads


---------44:21----------
you pick the one Road and so all of your


---------44:24----------
gas is spent on getting from point A to


---------44:26----------
point B instead of driving all over the


---------44:29----------
place what a mental framework does


---------44:31----------
essentially focuses your mental energy


---------44:33----------
in a particular direction and so if we


---------44:36----------
listen to some of the language that you


---------44:38----------
use you felt like you were doing quote


---------44:40----------
all kinds of random stuff if I had to


---------44:43----------
use a word to describe that it would be


---------44:46----------
unfocused yeah does that make sense


---------44:49----------
so I think that generally speaking the


---------44:51----------
reason that defining our problems is


---------44:54----------
important is because we are all


---------44:56----------
generally speaking pretty smart people


---------44:57----------
and we have a high amount of mental


---------45:00----------
energy when a lot of people feel stuck I


---------45:02----------
think that they start to feel stupid


---------45:04----------
about themselves or they start to feel


---------45:05----------
unhappy or whatever and they start to


---------45:07----------
think that like essentially their stats


---------45:09----------
are too low right they think like oh I'm


---------45:11----------
lazy or I'm undisciplined or I have low


---------45:13----------
willpower so their wills power score is


---------45:15----------
like a three instead of like an eighteen


---------45:17----------
and someone who looks at you and they


---------45:20----------
say like oh wow DOM is so successful


---------45:22----------
he's super disciplined do you think the


---------45:25----------
reason that your success is because


---------45:26----------
you're disciplined I thought I used to


---------45:30----------
think a part of it was but yeah I don't


---------45:34----------
think that's a huge part of it anymore


---------45:36----------
what do you think it is I'm not I'm not


---------45:45----------
a hundred percent sure I think


---------45:47----------
definitely there was there was some


---------45:48----------
element of luck because I was in early


---------45:50----------
and then I've never really thought about


---------45:57----------
that I don't know I think it might I


---------45:58----------
think it might be like so I mean I I


---------46:02----------
think it might be like uniqueness like


---------46:04----------
because I was like I don't know I was


---------46:07----------
just more vocal about my thoughts


---------46:11----------
towards things and I was more just like


---------46:13----------
harsh or like you know it was very um


---------46:16----------
extreme I guess with with my thoughts I


---------46:19----------
thought that that might have been part


---------46:20----------
of like the reason why people wanted to


---------46:22----------
like even if they don't agree with me


---------46:23----------
the fact that I would say things that


---------46:25----------
other people wouldn't say we just like


---------46:26----------
gravitate them towards me I'm not sure


---------46:27----------
okay so I think it's worth exploring you


---------46:31----------
know to understand so a lot of times you


---------46:33----------
spend a lot of time like understanding


---------46:35----------
why we fail right so like if you think


---------46:38----------
about like if you're a law player would


---------46:41----------
you say that watching a replay where you


---------46:43----------
lose or


---------46:44----------
to replay where you win is more valuable


---------46:46----------
I mean obviously watching yourself lose


---------46:48----------
exactly right yeah but let's think about


---------46:52----------
that for a second because I don't think


---------46:55----------
that that's actually true tell me where


---------46:58----------
I'm going what am I so this is kind of


---------47:00----------
like watching yourself lose within like


---------47:03----------
your career and analyzing that and


---------47:05----------
trying to learn from that it's going to


---------47:07----------
give you like a better like it's gonna


---------47:09----------
help you grow more than like watching


---------47:12----------
yourself be successful and what do you


---------47:13----------
think about that right that's definitely


---------47:17----------
what's 100 percent right that you should


---------47:19----------
be viewing like like when you take Elves


---------47:23----------
you should be really trying to


---------47:24----------
internalize like and grow from those as


---------47:26----------
much as possible and use them as like


---------47:27----------
opportunities for improvement rather


---------47:29----------
than you know just feel bad about them I


---------47:31----------
completely agree with that the other


---------47:33----------
thing is the other point that I'm trying


---------47:35----------
to make is that I think you can learn a


---------47:36----------
lot from your w's as well right so I


---------47:39----------
think that learning why you lose is just


---------47:42----------
as important as learning why you win and


---------47:44----------
in fact we have a bias to focus on the


---------47:46----------
losses and instead like what we should


---------47:49----------
actually do is like like understand why


---------47:52----------
we're winning so when I think about you


---------47:54----------
know when I talk to people most people


---------47:55----------
talk to me about their problems but what


---------47:57----------
I think is just as important is so


---------47:59----------
they'll say oh I can't take out the


---------48:00----------
trash but I think what's just as


---------48:02----------
important is have you ever taken out the


---------48:04----------
trash and the answer to that is yes and


---------48:07----------
then asking them what was different


---------48:09----------
about that day mm-hm right so that you


---------48:12----------
can study your successes


---------48:14----------
just like you study your failures and


---------48:15----------
that if you really want to be successful


---------48:17----------
you should study your failures and


---------48:19----------
successes and understand why on on one


---------48:22----------
day you make the right choice and on


---------48:25----------
another day you make the wrong choice


---------48:27----------
mm-hmm right so yeah so anyway I think


---------48:30----------
studying your successes is actually very


---------48:31----------
important and I think for us like


---------48:34----------
digging into why you've been successful


---------48:35----------
I want to come back to one word which is


---------48:37----------
uniqueness so I think luck is also an


---------48:40----------
important word and I think there's a lot


---------48:41----------
behind these and and I think the reason


---------48:43----------
that uniqueness is important is from


---------48:45----------
what I'm hearing from you is that you


---------48:46----------
allowed yourself to be yourself yeah


---------48:51----------
yeah I would say I would say so


---------48:53----------
but right it definitely been me in the


---------48:55----------
ass sure as well that's that's part of


---------48:58----------
the


---------48:58----------
process but if you think about it I


---------49:01----------
think a lot of people are held back


---------49:03----------
because they have a formula for success


---------49:06----------
which is based on the high value things


---------49:08----------
and the low value things and they


---------49:10----------
gravitate towards the high value things


---------49:12----------
because they think that this is an


---------49:13----------
external formula for success because


---------49:15----------
this is what allowed Dom to be


---------49:17----------
successful this is what allowed dr. K to


---------49:18----------
be successful so I have to do what they


---------49:20----------
did in order to be successful and this


---------49:22----------
kind of circles back to the good


---------49:24----------
opportunities right they say like oh I


---------49:26----------
need operat like if I take a good


---------49:27----------
opportunity that sort of this objective


---------49:28----------
idea of like good for everyone it's like


---------49:31----------
a universal ranking does that make sense


---------49:33----------
yeah and what I'm hearing from you is


---------49:36----------
that you allowed yourself to be yourself


---------49:38----------
and I think that a lot of success comes


---------49:41----------
from people instead of following someone


---------49:43----------
else's PlayBook understanding that your


---------49:46----------
life is fundamentally different that


---------49:48----------
your circumstances are fundamentally


---------49:50----------
different in that you are fundamentally


---------49:52----------
different from any human being who has


---------49:53----------
ever existed you know no one has been a


---------49:57----------
pro of Law five years ago named Dom who


---------50:02----------
produces a podcast that you have a fully


---------50:04----------
unique circumstance in life and that the


---------50:06----------
more that you base your strategy on your


---------50:09----------
unique circumstance the more like the


---------50:12----------
better off you're gonna do like does


---------50:13----------
that just logically make sense but yeah


---------50:16----------
but the crazy thing is that's not what


---------50:18----------
people do right like what do most people


---------50:20----------
do to try to be successful Dom they


---------50:23----------
funnel themselves into whatever mold has


---------50:25----------
been created by other people that have


---------50:27----------
been successful exactly and so if we


---------50:30----------
really look at your success it sounds


---------50:32----------
like you sort of found your own way to


---------50:33----------
being a pro ballplayer and then you also


---------50:35----------
find the lido self into a mold based on


---------50:37----------
other people which is he became the


---------50:39----------
former pro who became a streamer and you


---------50:42----------
found some success and it sounds like a


---------50:43----------
lot of your enjoyment for the first year


---------50:44----------
or two afterward because you had made it


---------50:46----------
right and you're just posting and


---------50:49----------
enjoying the fruits of your labor which


---------50:51----------
it absolutely makes sense but ultimately


---------50:53----------
those kinds of pleasurable activities


---------50:55----------
that are really cool are not going to


---------50:57----------
lead to your sustained happiness it's


---------51:00----------
essentially like material pursuits that


---------51:01----------
agree or disagree agree yeah and then


---------51:05----------
now what you're doing is living a life


---------51:07----------
that is dynamic Dharma is the Sun Square


---------51:10----------
the word for duty or responsibility


---------51:12----------
and I think what you're doing is you're


---------51:14----------
living a life of like duty to yourself


---------51:16----------
and to other people what do you think


---------51:18----------
about that does that make sense


---------51:20----------
hmm I think it almost sounds like too


---------51:23----------
pure for what I'm doing but I agree with


---------51:27----------
like the overall yeah yeah it just


---------51:29----------
sounds like a little too pure for me


---------51:31----------
makes makes a lot of sense so the Dharma


---------51:35----------
is not actually as pure as people think


---------51:37----------
it is


---------51:38----------
it sounds pure toka but it's just a


---------51:39----------
really [ __ ] bumpy road right so it's


---------51:42----------
like it's like you're but you're living


---------51:43----------
a life that I think you find fulfilling


---------51:45----------
and is aligned with the person that you


---------51:48----------
are you're noticing that you have


---------51:50----------
certain advantages and unique qualities


---------51:52----------
and you're like turning those advantages


---------51:54----------
and you can equality's into like


---------51:55----------
opportunities and the world is kind of


---------51:57----------
like meeting you halfway yeah yeah so


---------52:03----------
I'm gonna just pause once again cuz I'm


---------52:05----------
kind of at the end of a train of thought


---------52:07----------
and I've kind of been monologuing for a


---------52:09----------
little while so just give you a chance


---------52:11----------
like any thoughts questions um thoughts


---------52:16----------
or questions I don't know I feel like as


---------52:18----------
we've been going most of my questions


---------52:20----------
have been answered like I felt pretty


---------52:21----------
like free to be able to just interject


---------52:23----------
with whatever I was thinking during it


---------52:25----------
so I don't have any like overall


---------52:26----------
thoughts that I haven't already stated


---------52:28----------
so what would you like to do so we can


---------52:32----------
do a couple of things next alright let


---------52:33----------
me just see how we're doing on time okay


---------52:34----------
so we've been talking for just a little


---------52:37----------
under an hour I'm happy to continue


---------52:39----------
talking for a little bit longer or even


---------52:41----------
way longer if you want to so I tend to


---------52:44----------
stream for about forty five more minutes


---------52:45----------
so there are a couple of things that we


---------52:48----------
can do one is we can we can talk about


---------52:51----------
meditation if you're curious we can talk


---------52:53----------
about why why people are toxic and why


---------52:56----------
you used to be toxic and what's changed


---------52:58----------
or we can talk I think I would still be


---------53:00----------
qualified as toxic okay so tell me about


---------53:06----------
toxicity I mean I guess like for me it


---------53:09----------
seems to like start at frustration so


---------53:12----------
like the more frustrated you are the


---------53:14----------
more toxic you'll be and just in general


---------53:20----------
I guess like being able to like handle


---------53:24----------
that frustration well is something that


---------53:25----------
I still saw


---------53:26----------
like even if I'm not typing to my


---------53:28----------
teammates anymore recently I still


---------53:31----------
thinking what I'm saying work or I'm


---------53:33----------
still thinking and saying like what my


---------53:36----------
issue is constantly so I guess like


---------53:39----------
trying to that's one thing that's really


---------53:41----------
hard for me is like having a more


---------53:42----------
positive mindset towards like even like


---------53:46----------
in game doomed situations like well you


---------53:48----------
know you are like stuck in a negative


---------53:50----------
situation like how to find positivity in


---------53:52----------
those moments because it just for me it


---------53:53----------
just feels like almost like the waste of


---------53:54----------
time


---------53:55----------
mmm so trying to like find value within


---------53:57----------
that I think is something that I've


---------53:59----------
struggled with which is like why I


---------54:00----------
consider myself toxic so you you


---------54:03----------
consider yourself toxic because you have


---------54:05----------
even though you don't speak toxic we


---------54:07----------
anymore you still think toxic top


---------54:09----------
thoughts you say toxic things and you


---------54:12----------
have a bleak outlook on the


---------54:14----------
circumstances of the game yes and what


---------54:17----------
is a non-toxic person do in your


---------54:19----------
situations how are they different um I


---------54:22----------
think they're just like more okay just


---------54:24----------
like giving their best effort and then


---------54:26----------
not really caring about the result as


---------54:28----------
much so if they like their I think


---------54:31----------
they're better at like finding value


---------54:33----------
within situations that could be like


---------54:36----------
unwinnable so if like they view it as


---------54:38----------
like hey this is this is a loss


---------54:40----------
guaranteed they can still find something


---------54:42----------
to like learn in the game but for me I


---------54:44----------
think that I'm at this point I'm very


---------54:46----------
attached to the result and if the result


---------54:51----------
is negative it seems like my like all my


---------54:53----------
thoughts are negative towards myself and


---------54:55----------
like my teammates do you watch our


---------54:58----------
streams I do okay but I haven't watched


---------55:03----------
like every stream in sure entirely I


---------55:05----------
think the only one that I watched


---------55:07----------
completely was the Destiny one I found


---------55:08----------
that one very interesting no it's just a


---------55:10----------
little bit curious about some of the


---------55:12----------
dialogue you use because it's the same


---------55:13----------
dialogue that I use and curious about


---------55:18----------
yeah interesting so so I mean I think


---------55:25----------
because it's weird because usually when


---------55:27----------
I ask people a question about toxicity I


---------55:29----------
expect them to not have the answer


---------55:32----------
articulated so well right away maybe


---------55:34----------
that's because I'm under estimating who


---------55:36----------
you are and what you've discovered but


---------55:39----------
yeah it's interesting because I think


---------55:41----------
that's basically I would agree with you


---------55:42----------
a hundred percent right and and so maybe


---------55:45----------
that's my arrogance but I think it's it


---------55:47----------
also kind of goes back to what you were


---------55:48----------
saying earlier about you know taking out


---------55:51----------
the trash right so it sounds like the


---------55:53----------
barrier of where your growth is is you


---------55:56----------
have learned how to find value and


---------55:59----------
things that you've changed the way that


---------56:00----------
you look at value when it comes to


---------56:02----------
everything except for actually playing a


---------56:04----------
game with weak watch it's yeah it does


---------56:07----------
to playing law you know you you know


---------56:11----------
you're really good at like finding value


---------56:13----------
like like discovering value and what you


---------56:15----------
used to perceive as low value


---------56:17----------
opportunities like going out with


---------56:18----------
friends when it comes to [ __ ] law


---------56:21----------
yeah pretty much yeah


---------56:26----------
so so let's think a little bit about how


---------56:28----------
to help you find value in that so that


---------56:32----------
once again so I'm sure that I could


---------56:33----------
logically tell you and that you could


---------56:36----------
logically convince yourself that even in


---------56:39----------
a losing game there's something to be


---------56:40----------
learned of course right so what is what


---------56:44----------
how do you as a whole person respond to


---------56:47----------
that logical argument I don't know if


---------56:49----------
that request that's like if I guess I


---------56:54----------
guess so for me the reason why I'm


---------56:56----------
frustrated is I just feel like I'm not


---------56:59----------
gonna be learning enough to satisfy the


---------57:03----------
negative experience that I'm feeling


---------57:04----------
like it's not worth being pissed off and


---------57:07----------
frustrated for that amount of time to


---------57:08----------
get whatever like small little like


---------57:11----------
positive piece of information that I


---------57:13----------
could get out of the game


---------57:14----------
yep so what so I think this comes down


---------57:17----------
to and maybe we can kind of come full


---------57:19----------
circle you know playing a losing game


---------57:22----------
can can have a positive impact or it can


---------57:25----------
have a negative impact and it comes


---------57:27----------
entirely to your attitude so why do you


---------57:29----------
get so pissed off and weak watches I


---------57:32----------
think that just inherently it's a


---------57:34----------
frustrating game um you I know a lot of


---------57:36----------
the time use dota references right so


---------57:38----------
it's the same type of situation where at


---------57:42----------
the end of the day right like you're


---------57:43----------
only 10% of the game right you're 1 out


---------57:44----------
of 10 players in the game so so often


---------57:47----------
you're gonna have like other people


---------57:50----------
determine the outcome instead of you


---------57:52----------
right look you can


---------57:53----------
put your team a little bit up a little


---------57:55----------
bit down but overall it's going to be


---------57:58----------
based on like the performance of other


---------57:59----------
people and not yourself enemies and


---------58:01----------
teammates for the situation so I think


---------58:04----------
it's just like an inherently frustrating


---------58:06----------
experience also there's in the game I


---------58:08----------
play like I know dota has voice comms


---------58:10----------
there's no boys comes in this game so


---------58:11----------
there's almost no communication between


---------58:14----------
oh interesting


---------58:15----------
we have lighters doesn't have voice


---------58:17----------
communication yeah yeah it doesn't have


---------58:19----------
voice communication so huh for me it's


---------58:21----------
very frustrating because like I


---------58:23----------
obviously played a lot of team play like


---------58:25----------
I screamed with a team I played


---------58:27----------
professionally for years where I just


---------58:29----------
feel like it's so much of an of a better


---------58:31----------
game to play at so much of a better


---------58:33----------
experience where you're able to just


---------58:35----------
communicate with your teammates so for


---------58:36----------
example in like the rare occurrences


---------58:38----------
where I've been able to like find five


---------58:39----------
people and get them on discord together


---------58:40----------
but we've talked it's even if you lose


---------58:43----------
it's almost always a better experience


---------58:44----------
when you when you could like hear people


---------58:46----------
saw it like if somebody dies and they're


---------58:48----------
like hey my bad like [ __ ] I like [ __ ]


---------58:50----------
up like whatever that always makes me


---------58:52----------
feel better than whatever people type


---------58:55----------
like I think that people are just more


---------58:56----------
human over voice communication than they


---------58:58----------
are if you're like text so so so how do


---------59:01----------
you view people when you're not able to


---------59:03----------
communicate with them like how do you


---------59:04----------
actually think about a league of Legends


---------59:06----------
I don't even view them as like people


---------59:07----------
absolutely right mouth breather


---------59:11----------
Neanderthals well I mean just just like


---------59:17----------
complete waste of space just just toxic


---------59:21----------
as BOTS right yep yeah and III know so


---------59:27----------
you know having played a MOBA myself so


---------59:29----------
I started playing dota maybe like 10 or


---------59:31----------
12 years ago and and absolutely man you


---------59:34----------
just completely dehumanize them right


---------59:37----------
and it's kind of interesting because


---------59:38----------
like when you dehumanize people like


---------59:40----------
your experience gets worse yeah it's


---------59:42----------
easier to also be toxic to them because


---------59:44----------
like you don't view that like you don't


---------59:45----------
really like view the impact of your


---------59:48----------
words is meaningful because you don't


---------59:50----------
view them as meaningful yeah hey you


---------59:53----------
know what you're describing kind of


---------59:55----------
reminds me of like breaking an inanimate


---------59:56----------
object when you're frustrated like if I


---------59:59----------
if I like you know if I step on a toy


---------60:04----------
and I get angry like I'm gonna pick


---------60:07----------
up the toy and I'm just gonna [ __ ]


---------60:08----------
throw it into the river and yeah and


---------60:11----------
it's kind of like you can just unload on


---------60:13----------
it because it's just this [ __ ] thing


---------60:14----------
that's making your life worse and it's


---------60:16----------
annoying and it's bad and I don't like


---------60:17----------
it great yeah so I think you know we can


---------60:23----------
it's interesting because I think you're


---------60:24----------
doing a good job of actually I mean I


---------60:26----------
feel like I'm learning a lot about the


---------60:28----------
nature of toxicity and just how much of


---------60:30----------
the toxicity comes from you know the


---------60:36----------
dehumanization and that when you're


---------60:38----------
dealing at humans it's harder to be


---------60:39----------
toxic what do you do you think that that


---------60:42----------
sort of translates like why are people


---------60:43----------
toxic on like on your stream like why


---------60:46----------
are your viewers toxic he said then


---------60:49----------
there are always some people who are


---------60:50----------
just gonna be like so looking for so


---------60:53----------
like I'll go and say this I think that


---------60:55----------
League of Legends viewers are innately


---------60:56----------
toxic like it's just because of the


---------60:59----------
experience of the game and also I think


---------61:00----------
they do human eyes you to some point so


---------61:03----------
if you go out like any League of Legends


---------61:04----------
stream I think you're gonna find some


---------61:06----------
degree of negativity unless you why I


---------61:11----------
just I think that it's just because


---------61:13----------
people see only your perspective and


---------61:16----------
they're not and like they'll I guess


---------61:19----------
over prioritize or under prioritized


---------61:20----------
things you're doing and not really be


---------61:23----------
able to see the full picture of what's


---------61:24----------
going on also I don't think that people


---------61:26----------
are as focused on what's going on as the


---------61:29----------
person playing most of the time like


---------61:30----------
when you're watching a stream you're


---------61:31----------
just like oh I saw you make one mistake


---------61:33----------
so that invalidates your criticism of


---------61:35----------
the team because you're making mistakes


---------61:36----------
too and they have this like arbitrary


---------61:38----------
system of all that all mistakes or equal


---------61:40----------
all situations are equal like that I'm


---------61:44----------
not sure I think that's it's also that


---------61:46----------
and then also like if you're more


---------61:48----------
negative if you're more frustrated


---------61:49----------
yourself I think people feed off that


---------61:51----------
because they're like hey this guy's


---------61:52----------
already pissed off I can get a bigger


---------61:53----------
reaction out of him like if I am


---------61:56----------
negative that if I am positive based on


---------61:57----------
like how he is right now yeah so I think


---------61:59----------
you bring up a good point about sort of


---------62:01----------
like you know they don't look at the


---------62:02----------
whole picture what I'm kind of curious


---------62:03----------
about is why does someone watch a


---------62:06----------
twister and try to get a bigger reaction


---------62:09----------
out of you like what's that about


---------62:12----------
hmm I guess just like feeling the


---------62:15----------
connection with the streamer like if you


---------62:17----------
can get them to react negatively


---------62:20----------
I feel like they feel like they've


---------62:22----------
influenced you in some way they feel


---------62:23----------
more like part of the stream I guess or


---------62:27----------
they feel like it's a more real


---------62:28----------
experience and then also I guess part of


---------62:32----------
it is also like just just doing it for


---------62:37----------
humor doing it for their own self


---------62:38----------
gratification


---------62:39----------
ya know what it's fun like it's funny to


---------62:41----------
make somebody else angry it's funny for


---------62:43----------
everyone else when I'm angry it's funny


---------62:44----------
for everyone else except for me feels


---------62:46----------
like most of the time yep


---------62:48----------
so let's just think about that for a


---------62:49----------
second okay what's up with that why is


---------62:53----------
it funny for some human beings


---------62:57----------
you know to make other human beings


---------63:00----------
angry like why do we enjoy life better


---------63:09----------
response you get out of me yeah so


---------63:12----------
that's why I really wish I could look


---------63:14----------
into a chat right now but I can because


---------63:16----------
I you know I'm on a laptop and my


---------63:18----------
potatoes set up but I mean I'm reading a


---------63:21----------
lot of your comments because we are


---------63:22----------
sadistic as [ __ ] yes you'll read about


---------63:25----------
ourselves to make them so the question


---------63:29----------
is why right like why are why is twitch


---------63:31----------
at like what what are we tapping into


---------63:33----------
because I I think it's not I don't think


---------63:35----------
that human beings are inherently bad I


---------63:37----------
do think that trolling comes from a very


---------63:39----------
genuine place deep within side or deep


---------63:42----------
inside us right I would love to hear


---------63:44----------
your take on this and and but the


---------63:45----------
question is why like why do we troll


---------63:48----------
other humans and what is it about us and


---------63:50----------
if we kind of thing if we kind of kind


---------63:52----------
of give you sort of a little bit of a


---------63:53----------
hint which is that what influences your


---------63:56----------
toxicity right so what within you


---------63:59----------
creates your toxicity I guess part of it


---------64:07----------
is like not being able to like fully


---------64:11----------
express my skill so like if you're


---------64:14----------
losing really hard right and I know


---------64:16----------
there's nothing I can do to win like no


---------64:17----------
matter if I play like perfectly I think


---------64:19----------
that not being able to like show people


---------64:21----------
how good I am really like [ __ ] with me


---------64:23----------
so I don't know if that's insecurity or


---------64:25----------
what that is but like that's really


---------64:27----------
frustrating that's a super frustrating


---------64:29----------
thing it's like beautiful so let me ask


---------64:31----------
you something do you think that the


---------64:32----------
majority of people on


---------64:34----------
chat are able to fully express their


---------64:36----------
value as human beings mmm probably not


---------64:41----------
I'd assume that they're dealing with


---------64:43----------
whatever same same situation whatever


---------64:45----------
life they have yes so do you think that


---------64:47----------
the majority of people who are toxic on


---------64:49----------
stream or what do you think what do you


---------64:52----------
think about can you have any idea of how


---------64:57----------
they feel about themselves okay I'm not


---------65:03----------
sure right because I would want to say


---------65:05----------
yeah they probably like a lot of it is


---------65:07----------
like projection where people are feeling


---------65:09----------
shitty about themselves so they want to


---------65:11----------
make somebody else feel shitty but I I


---------65:13----------
know there's those people that that


---------65:14----------
aren't like that necessarily good so I


---------65:17----------
don't want you to give me the right


---------65:18----------
answer I want you to give me the answer


---------65:19----------
of your heart and the answer of your


---------65:21----------
heart is that it's more complicated that


---------65:23----------
some people are just [ __ ] trolls Yeah


---------65:26----------
right that's what I'm hearing from you


---------65:28----------
is that there's supposed to be this


---------65:30----------
right psychological answer but honestly


---------65:32----------
some of us are just [ __ ] trolls yes


---------65:34----------
toxic human beings I agree with you 100%


---------65:36----------
mm-hmm right so I think that's there's


---------65:39----------
there's just something fundamentally


---------65:41----------
human schadenfreude you know what that


---------65:43----------
word means it's grown a lot recently but


---------65:45----------
you know so schadenfreude is the German


---------65:47----------
word for getting deriving pleasure out


---------65:50----------
of like the pain of others so it's not


---------65:53----------
quite you say tis imboca Lee why trolls


---------65:55----------
to do what they do right okay and I


---------65:58----------
think that too is like fundamentally


---------65:59----------
human I don't think it has to be a deep


---------66:03----------
psychological conflict but I do wonder a


---------66:05----------
little bit about I mean so one so I do


---------66:08----------
think that you hit on something with


---------66:10----------
about fully expressing your skill so I


---------66:13----------
think that there's if we think about


---------66:14----------
what makes you satisfied in life you


---------66:17----------
know what we were saying earlier about


---------66:19----------
the podcast it's like why is the podcast


---------66:20----------
satisfying to you because it's not about


---------66:23----------
viewership yeah yeah because at the end


---------66:25----------
I have like a body of work that I'm


---------66:27----------
proud of yeah exactly right so you can


---------66:28----------
look at this and you can say I made this


---------66:30----------
this is me this is actually an accurate


---------66:32----------
representation of Who I am I can look at


---------66:35----------
a piece of work that I have produced and


---------66:37----------
I can say that this fully expresses my


---------66:40----------
skill in this moment and you can derive


---------66:43----------
satisfaction from that you can be fully


---------66:45----------
yourself and you can create something of


---------66:47----------
yours


---------66:48----------
salt and you can derive value of it out


---------66:49----------
of it that has nothing to do with how


---------66:51----------
people perceive you has nothing to do


---------66:53----------
with how many people watch your podcast


---------66:55----------
it has nothing to do with what kind of


---------66:57----------
criticism you get it's just about your


---------66:59----------
internal feeling of being able to


---------67:01----------
express your skill and I think it you


---------67:03----------
know what you said makes a lot of sense


---------67:05----------
I think a lot of people are toxic online


---------67:07----------
because they can't full they don't have


---------67:09----------
a place to do that and so they feel


---------67:11----------
frustration and then they also find a


---------67:14----------
place where they can vent their


---------67:16----------
frustration and like you also said I


---------67:18----------
think that allows them to feel connected


---------67:21----------
yeah the other thing that I just like to


---------67:24----------
point out is you were saying earlier


---------67:25----------
that that your toxicity originally you


---------67:28----------
said comes from a sense of frustration


---------67:30----------
so I've also found that most people who


---------67:34----------
are angry or hurt hey what do you think


---------67:41----------
about that


---------67:44----------
I'd agree to some extent so this is a


---------67:47----------
kind of like most of psychiatrists like


---------67:49----------
going to like my past or whatever and


---------67:52----------
one thing that one of them said that


---------67:55----------
made sense was so I dealt with like a


---------67:58----------
lot of just like bad experiences early


---------68:02----------
in my life one of them was so like this


---------68:06----------
is gonna sound way worse than it is so I


---------68:07----------
was physically abused by my dad but it


---------68:09----------
wasn't ever like it was sometimes like


---------68:12----------
he would lose control but I never was


---------68:13----------
scared of my dad I never didn't love my


---------68:15----------
dad it was just like I knew that when he


---------68:18----------
was triggered like I could trigger him


---------68:20----------
and I knew that if I triggered him like


---------68:22----------
there's old be I was get [ __ ] up right


---------68:25----------
so I dealt with that and then I also I


---------68:28----------
got robbed at gunpoint when I was like


---------68:30----------
19 so pretty much a lot of the or the


---------68:34----------
psychiatrist that I talk to you kind of


---------68:36----------
formed that as like I have a problem


---------68:38----------
when people are like hurting me and I


---------68:42----------
don't and I'm not able to like stand up


---------68:44----------
to it I'm not able to fight it so


---------68:45----------
they're kind of tying that into like


---------68:46----------
maybe how I am with like comments


---------68:49----------
affecting me or like in this type of


---------68:53----------
situation frustration because like if


---------68:57----------
people are saying mean things to me


---------68:58----------
online I can't do anything to stop them


---------69:00----------
saying like mean I could mute them but I


---------69:01----------
actually do anything about it so it's


---------69:04----------
like a feeling of just like not being


---------69:06----------
able to deal with the situation


---------69:09----------
so I think if that makes some sense but


---------69:11----------
I wasn't completely bought in but tell


---------69:13----------
me about your skepticism um hmm I don't


---------69:22----------
know I'm not sure why I just feel like


---------69:24----------
it's just not true but just like it just


---------69:28----------
in hmm actually would have to think I'd


---------69:32----------
have to think more about it so so so I


---------69:34----------
want you to try to reconstruct july's


---------69:36----------
maybe this little okay is it okay if we


---------69:37----------
try to think through that together you


---------69:39----------
don't want to have this conversation we


---------69:40----------
just come no no idea I don't think that


---------69:43----------
I don't think what they said is not true


---------69:46----------
I think what they said is much like what


---------69:49----------
I say on stream simplistic so it feels


---------69:53----------
more incomplete to me than untrue what


---------69:57----------
do you think got that yeah I think


---------70:01----------
there's definitely truth within there


---------70:02----------
like I definitely don't like when people


---------70:06----------
are hurting me and I can't do anything


---------70:08----------
about it sure no one does I feel like


---------70:09----------
most yeah I I don't know if my feeling


---------70:17----------
of that is more extreme cuz of


---------70:18----------
experiences I've had in my life though


---------70:20----------
that's where I'm like kind of lost like


---------70:22----------
I just I just feel like it's it's


---------70:23----------
something that like psychiatrist one or


---------70:27----------
like the Lisa's like I just I I talked


---------70:29----------
to it just felt like she wanted to find


---------70:31----------
like a reason behind like a reason in my


---------70:33----------
early childhood I feel like that's a lot


---------70:35----------
of what it is like a reason in your


---------70:36----------
early childhood why that shapes you to


---------70:39----------
be a certain way yeah and and what I'm


---------70:41----------
hearing from you is that they may that


---------70:42----------
may have influenced a bit that we're


---------70:44----------
missing something right so when we think


---------70:47----------
about like Reddit mischaracterizing you


---------70:49----------
we can sort of say like oh like this is


---------70:52----------
this is what we do then via in the


---------70:54----------
psychiatry videos like the Sigmund Freud


---------70:56----------
one and we kind of say oh is that the


---------70:59----------
people on Reddit and the twitch chat is


---------71:01----------
your fossa and they are hitting you and


---------71:03----------
says nothing you can do about it and we


---------71:05----------
like causal connections and you say oh


---------71:07----------
that's wonderful it's so beautiful I


---------71:09----------
mean it's not beautiful but via enamored


---------71:12----------
with the analytical part of it


---------71:14----------
yep but it sounds like it's incomplete


---------71:17----------
right so like like it when reddit


---------71:20----------
mischaracterizes you III think it


---------71:23----------
actually is quite different and let me


---------71:25----------
tell you why so when your dad it sounds


---------71:28----------
like when when he used to hit you you


---------71:32----------
sort of understood that like the weather


---------71:34----------
like it didn't actually I'm not hearing


---------71:36----------
that it evoke to that much emotion in


---------71:38----------
you it was kind of like you yet well I


---------71:41----------
always felt like I did it myself you


---------71:44----------
know


---------71:45----------
like I knew I think I was smart enough


---------71:47----------
as a kid to identify like when I was


---------71:51----------
doing things that were going to get me


---------71:53----------
like hit like when I was triggering my


---------71:55----------
dad's like I understood when I was


---------71:56----------
triggering him fully so I felt like I


---------71:58----------
had a decent out of control over the


---------71:59----------
situation in that respect so it's not


---------72:01----------
like I guess that's part of I guess I


---------72:02----------
guess it's kind of ties in to what you


---------72:03----------
were saying before like why do I think


---------72:04----------
it's completely not true because I did


---------72:06----------
feel like I had some level of control I


---------72:08----------
felt like I could say certain things


---------72:09----------
like like if I said to my dad I don't


---------72:12----------
love you anymore something like that


---------72:13----------
like the kids say to their parents right


---------72:14----------
like I would get hit yes so actually


---------72:18----------
actually Dom this sounds very different


---------72:20----------
from to me so I think we're talking


---------72:22----------
about two different things because when


---------72:23----------
I think about what you're describing you


---------72:26----------
have agency in the situation with your


---------72:28----------
dad Yeah right what I'm hearing about


---------72:31----------
reddit and lul is actually the exact


---------72:34----------
opposite yeah that you have no power to


---------72:37----------
change yes yes so that's what I'm trying


---------72:40----------
to say he's like that's the that's where


---------72:42----------
I think that there is like well I do


---------72:43----------
think I have some degree of power but I


---------72:45----------
just think that it's really hard it


---------72:48----------
feels different to me it feels like


---------72:50----------
we're talking about two different things


---------72:51----------
mm-hmm does that make sense yes so let


---------72:55----------
me ask you this have you had it cuz via


---------72:57----------
via via going to talk about Sood's oh


---------73:00----------
have you had a period like his something


---------73:02----------
happened to you that you remember where


---------73:04----------
you felt really really unable to alter


---------73:07----------
other people's opinions of you um where


---------73:11----------
people judged you or treated you a


---------73:13----------
certain way and you couldn't do anything


---------73:14----------
about it when I was a child or now or


---------73:17----------
anytime


---------73:18----------
um where you were mischaracterized


---------73:27----------
I'm not sure uh I think I think maybe I


---------73:32----------
was mischaracterized a little bit by my


---------73:33----------
parents but I think if that's like


---------73:35----------
normal just in in terms of what just


---------73:39----------
like what I was good at you know like it


---------73:41----------
always kind of was like oh you're just


---------73:43----------
like you're not a hard worker because


---------73:46----------
you don't work hard in school but I felt


---------73:48----------
like I was always a hard worker at


---------73:49----------
things that I cared about right so like


---------73:51----------
when I was when I was in high school


---------73:53----------
like when I had my first girlfriend you


---------73:55----------
know I felt like I put a lot into the


---------73:57----------
relationship because I cared about her


---------73:58----------
and I cared about that experience um


---------74:01----------
when I you know would play sports I


---------74:03----------
cared a lot about the results of my team


---------74:05----------
so I felt like I was I'm able to work


---------74:07----------
hard I just don't have the capability to


---------74:08----------
work hard about things I don't care


---------74:10----------
about is what I would I would say hmm


---------74:11----------
yeah so I think that makes sense does


---------74:14----------
that is the way that when they told you


---------74:17----------
that do you mean did you feel the way


---------74:19----------
that when they judged you in that way


---------74:21----------
did you feel the way that you do when


---------74:23----------
someone shows something on Reddit and


---------74:25----------
mischaracterizes you yeah it's like the


---------74:27----------
whole like you don't actually get me


---------74:29----------
you're like missing the point type thing


---------74:30----------
yeah


---------74:31----------
and is there is there been a particular


---------74:33----------
time where it's not so much about them


---------74:36----------
abusing you but then like missing the


---------74:38----------
point like if someone is there been a


---------74:40----------
time in your life where you felt like it


---------74:43----------
was really important for someone to like


---------74:45----------
understand you and they missed the point


---------74:47----------
um yeah I mean I guess with the whole


---------74:55----------
reddit situation that's pretty much


---------74:56----------
mainly what it is yeah like I feel like


---------74:59----------
it's like okay you could over focus on


---------75:01----------
like it's like I said mean things true


---------75:03----------
but like the problem that I'm dealing


---------75:05----------
with like what I what I'm trying to get


---------75:07----------
at like overall concept is just like not


---------75:09----------
being attacked it's like I'm just being


---------75:10----------
attacked just person because what I said


---------75:11----------
yeah so are you still seeing a therapist


---------75:14----------
or psychiatrist no okay so one thing to


---------75:17----------
just think a little bit about is that so


---------75:20----------
first of all I I agree with so I trust


---------75:22----------
your sentiment that you know if you feel


---------75:24----------
like what the psychiatrist's say which


---------75:26----------
if we had talked about it I likely would


---------75:28----------
have come to the same conclusion because


---------75:30----------
we're trained to think in a particular


---------75:31----------
way if I trust you though in the sense


---------75:34----------
that I've come to trust what people


---------75:39----------
believe


---------75:40----------
themselves irrespective of how brilliant


---------75:42----------
my hypothesis and formulation is if it


---------75:45----------
doesn't fit with you I think it's just


---------75:47----------
wrong I think ultimately you are the


---------75:50----------
judge jury and executioner of knowing


---------75:52----------
what is right and what is wrong and is


---------75:54----------
knowledgeable or a studied as I am I you


---------75:56----------
know I don't [ __ ]


---------75:57----------
I don't live your life so I can't no I


---------75:59----------
can't really yeah yeah I mean so just to


---------76:02----------
clarify I didn't stop going to the


---------76:04----------
psychiatrist because I felt like it


---------76:05----------
wasn't useful I think that it was just


---------76:07----------
kind of like I understood what I wanted


---------76:11----------
to do like it was kind of like okay you


---------76:13----------
told you gave me a bunch of information


---------76:14----------
I'm gonna try to like apply that to my


---------76:15----------
life and then like it's not like I can


---------76:18----------
just see them every week and that's


---------76:19----------
going to drastically change it's like I


---------76:20----------
need to actually have some time to live


---------76:22----------
my life differently and then based off


---------76:25----------
that like I still plan on potentially


---------76:26----------
seeing her like again at some point it's


---------76:29----------
just I just wanted to like kind of work


---------76:30----------
on this stuff it's like it's almost like


---------76:32----------
information overload it's like okay


---------76:33----------
you've given me like all this stuff to


---------76:34----------
do takes a while to like set it up I had


---------76:37----------
it up I feel better now so I probably


---------76:38----------
should go back at some point like even


---------76:40----------
when I'm in a positive mental state like


---------76:42----------
I don't feel like I only need to go


---------76:44----------
there when I'm not feeling well but um


---------76:46----------
yeah just like I kind of just wanted to


---------76:48----------
work on things myself and just see the


---------76:50----------
results


---------76:50----------
yeah I'm glad you clarified that I at


---------76:52----------
the same time I didn't get the


---------76:53----------
perception I mean it sounded to me like


---------76:55----------
you had three to four sessions that were


---------76:57----------
very useful yeah it's very good yeah the


---------77:00----------
reason the reason that you stopped going


---------77:02----------
was not because you were fixed or that


---------77:06----------
it wasn't helping but just because like


---------77:08----------
you got a lot out of it and you needed


---------77:09----------
to apply it to your life and and so the


---------77:11----------
reason I kind of asked you is because I


---------77:13----------
think if you go back or when you go back


---------77:16----------
then you should consider sort of


---------77:19----------
exploring this aspect and instead of


---------77:21----------
attributing it to you know you being


---------77:22----------
powerless against redit it sounds like


---------77:24----------
like your dad is actually a different


---------77:27----------
situation because you felt like in a


---------77:29----------
sense you are in control and maybe


---------77:31----------
that's also why you said yes you know it


---------77:34----------
was you made an interesting discovery


---------77:47----------
actually feel like their parents don't


---------77:49----------
love them or their parents are like


---------77:51----------
alcoholics and do it and like they just


---------77:52----------
like they live in fear


---------77:53----------
the time like never left lived in fear


---------77:56----------
of my dad yeah I never thought that he


---------77:58----------
was like just gonna hit me randomly it


---------78:00----------
was always like if we get into a


---------78:01----------
conversation we get into like an


---------78:02----------
argument and I say certain things I can


---------78:04----------
like like it would yeah I think that


---------78:06----------
part of it was just like being like


---------78:07----------
manipulative like as a kid like I


---------78:09----------
understood that like if my mom sees my


---------78:13----------
dad hit me I'm Adam Attica Lee right in


---------78:15----------
the argument you know it's like oh then


---------78:17----------
it's suddenly you never hit the kid like


---------78:19----------
it's is that this whole thing so I think


---------78:20----------
that I was kind of like me being like


---------78:21----------
you know being a little [ __ ] so so I


---------78:24----------
think that what I'm hearing from you is


---------78:26----------
that what makes it not as bad as it


---------78:28----------
sounds is that it sounds like you


---------78:29----------
actually had a fair amount of control


---------78:32----------
and power in that relationship despite


---------78:34----------
being physically weaker yes and that a


---------78:37----------
lot of times when people are in abusive


---------78:38----------
situations part of the most damaging


---------78:41----------
part is not necessarily a physical the


---------78:42----------
physical abuse but in the lack of power


---------78:45----------
or control in the relationship which I


---------78:49----------
didn't feel like I actually felt like I


---------78:50----------
had power like that yeah that's the


---------78:52----------
things I felt like I had power even


---------78:54----------
though he was hitting me yeah so that


---------78:55----------
sounds completely opposite of the


---------78:58----------
situation on reddit like it so I guess I


---------78:59----------
get that now that we've like talked it


---------79:01----------
through more that's why I don't agree


---------79:03----------
with that yep discussion because it is


---------79:05----------
just different


---------79:06----------
apparently I completely agree that's


---------79:07----------
really useful yeah well it helps to have


---------79:12----------
someone who's very insightful and pays


---------79:14----------
attention so I I didn't hear you because


---------79:18----------
they cut out well I said you can have


---------79:21----------
someone who's insightful and pays


---------79:22----------
attention try my best


---------79:27----------
thanks man I appreciate it and so so I


---------79:31----------
was just gonna say I think if you visit


---------79:32----------
that psychiatrist again I think it's


---------79:34----------
worthy exploring that dichotomy right


---------79:37----------
that like actually the feeling with your


---------79:39----------
dad is very different from the feeling


---------79:41----------
with Rhetta and if we ever do a


---------79:43----------
follow-up and you want to talk more


---------79:44----------
about that we can talk more about that


---------79:45----------
but one thing that I mean cuz also it


---------79:48----------
sounds like you had kind of a little bit


---------79:50----------
of a light bulb there so fantastic so


---------79:52----------
you can play with that you know work


---------79:54----------
with it do whatever you want to I wanted


---------79:55----------
to just give you I just I wanted to give


---------79:58----------
you the opportunity if you're interested


---------79:59----------
to learn a little bit about meditation


---------80:01----------
and that maybe we could meditate


---------80:02----------
together before we wrap up we don't have


---------80:05----------
to but I just want to make sure we have


---------80:07----------
enough time


---------80:07----------
for that if you're interested sure yeah


---------80:09----------
oh I would love to like have some you


---------80:12----------
know direction with meditation so tell


---------80:13----------
me a little bit about your experience of


---------80:15----------
meditation so far it's very very limited


---------80:18----------
so like I took a yoga class a while back


---------80:21----------
and we do meditation so I mean I like I


---------80:25----------
understand like to having like correct


---------80:27----------
posture sitting up trying to like


---------80:30----------
concentrate on your breathing and just


---------80:33----------
like like trying not to think like I


---------80:35----------
just always end up thinking about


---------80:37----------
something I'm trying not to think well I


---------80:40----------
guess I guess that yeah that was kind of


---------80:42----------
how I understood it like you kind of


---------80:43----------
want to let like your mind like rest or


---------80:45----------
something or you want to just yeah maybe


---------80:47----------
I'm wrong about this but you are kind


---------80:49----------
you are wrong so I think that's why your


---------80:50----------
have got a faculty we can fix that okay


---------80:53----------
because trying not to think if you're


---------80:55----------
trying not to think you're doing it


---------80:57----------
wrong and you're never gonna be


---------80:58----------
successful and and most people it's a


---------81:01----------
very very very common misconception but


---------81:04----------
you can't try not to think trying not to


---------81:06----------
think is going to be the opposite of


---------81:08----------
what meditation is so let's start there


---------81:10----------
so when you're trying not to think are


---------81:16----------
you are you creating tension or


---------81:20----------
relaxation within your mind


---------81:22----------
attention definitely absolutely and so


---------81:26----------
so what are you doing within your mind


---------81:28----------
what kind of tension what's on the two


---------81:30----------
sides like so tension it implies like


---------81:32----------
pulling or conflict between two sides


---------81:34----------
what are on the two sides of the tension


---------81:36----------
I guess just like you're naturally


---------81:40----------
thinking and then you're telling


---------81:42----------
yourself don't do that exactly right so


---------81:44----------
you're fighting with yourself so as long


---------81:46----------
as you're fighting within yourself


---------81:48----------
you're never gonna be able to meditate


---------81:49----------
in fact it is the very opposite because


---------81:51----------
what you're doing is you're fueling more


---------81:54----------
thoughts mm-hmm does that make sense


---------81:57----------
yeah so I want you guys to understand


---------82:00----------
that energy in the mind produces


---------82:04----------
thoughts and thoughts in the mind


---------82:07----------
produce energy so if we think about you


---------82:09----------
so that you've been diagnosed with panic


---------82:11----------
disorder so for example when you're


---------82:13----------
panicking is your mind super energetic


---------82:16----------
or low energy oh it's super super


---------82:19----------
energetic absolutely


---------82:20----------
right and is there is or when you're


---------82:24----------
panicking is there tension within your


---------82:25----------
mind or their parts of your mind that


---------82:27----------
are fighting oh yeah it's all a fight


---------82:30----------
like for me it was always like because


---------82:33----------
my main symptom was like breathing okay


---------82:35----------
it's felt like I couldn't breathe so


---------82:36----------
it's constantly like like like okay no


---------82:39----------
you are breathing you're definitely


---------82:40----------
breathing and then like the other side


---------82:41----------
it's like no you're not breathing like


---------82:42----------
something seriously wrong with you like


---------82:43----------
you're gonna [ __ ] die do something


---------82:45----------
yeah so would you say that oftentimes in


---------82:48----------
panic disorder when you were panicking


---------82:50----------
you are actually trying not to think


---------82:52----------
certain thoughts yeah definitely


---------82:56----------
right so let's just think about that for


---------82:58----------
a second while you're in a panic attack


---------83:00----------
you are trying not to think certain


---------83:01----------
thoughts and your goal in meditation is


---------83:04----------
to try not to think certain thoughts so


---------83:11----------
what you're actually doing is the same


---------83:13----------
mode of activity so if we think about


---------83:15----------
the mechanics of the mind you're doing


---------83:18----------
the same mode of activity as a panic


---------83:20----------
attack I'm not saying that it's actually


---------83:21----------
the same as a panic attack what I'm


---------83:23----------
saying is if we tunnel down into like


---------83:25----------
the function of what your mind is doing


---------83:27----------
it's a what you're creating energy panic


---------83:30----------
attacks or high energy and you're trying


---------83:33----------
not to think certain things so it's


---------83:35----------
actually very similar to a panic attack


---------83:37----------
which is why it hasn't worked for you


---------83:39----------
right because essentially you're like


---------83:41----------
sort of doing the same thing as a panic


---------83:42----------
attack so what we actually want to do is


---------83:44----------
is so this is also good because I mean a


---------83:47----------
lot of times I really struggle when


---------83:49----------
people are meditating right


---------83:50----------
because then it's hard to teach them but


---------83:53----------
if they're doing something colossal E


---------83:54----------
wrong and I say this with love Dom


---------83:55----------
because at this point I have some


---------83:56----------
genuine affection for you you're doing


---------83:58----------
it colossal E wrong so that's actually


---------84:00----------
pretty good because it's also better for


---------84:02----------
me yeah exactly so the the first thing


---------84:07----------
is to try to not try to think or try


---------84:10----------
okay not try try not to try not anything


---------84:14----------
yeah right so essentially what we need


---------84:16----------
to do I want you to think about try not


---------84:18----------
to think yeah and and so but that too is


---------84:20----------
trying so you can do that as much as you


---------84:22----------
want to and that's still gonna create


---------84:24----------
tension so so what we actually need to


---------84:26----------
do is is stop the trying entirely and


---------84:29----------
what we need to do is try to relax wrap


---------84:32----------
it that's gonna you can't try to relax


---------84:34----------
that


---------84:34----------
the other thing you're ever having


---------84:35----------
trouble falling asleep you're like man I


---------84:37----------
just really need to relax and go to


---------84:38----------
sleep and what does that do does that


---------84:40----------
let you sleep no it's the opposite right


---------84:43----------
so what we need to do is is train you


---------84:46----------
how to let go and there are two ways


---------84:49----------
that we can do that we can either


---------84:50----------
directly try to train you how to let go


---------84:52----------
but you seem to me to be a Trier does


---------84:55----------
that make sense yeah you're a Trier so I


---------84:58----------
think it's a big part of your your


---------85:00----------
cognitive fingerprint so the way the


---------85:02----------
unique way that your mind works for


---------85:04----------
those of you who are interested in


---------85:05----------
Ayurveda Dom has a lot of bit that if


---------85:09----------
you watched anything about our Father


---------85:10----------
you know okay so that you can even see


---------85:12----------
it in his name right so I will dominate


---------85:14----------
is PIPA so you have a fiery mind


---------85:16----------
it's about domination suppression


---------85:19----------
argument trying effort passion conflict


---------85:23----------
like that's where you excel creation


---------85:26----------
it's like a very very active mind so I


---------85:28----------
think what we actually need to do is


---------85:30----------
direct to your mind so we need to have


---------85:33----------
we need to give you we don't want to try


---------85:35----------
to not think we want to give you


---------85:38----------
something to focus on exactly we want to


---------85:41----------
direct your thinking because this - it


---------85:44----------
sounds like what you you benefit I mean


---------85:46----------
your your intellect is actually quite


---------85:47----------
profound and you're very easily able to


---------85:50----------
take information and direct your


---------85:53----------
thinking in a new way


---------85:54----------
and and what I want you to do is just if


---------85:55----------
you go back and watch the vaad that's


---------85:57----------
basically what we've been doing for an


---------85:58----------
hour and a half like when you talked


---------86:00----------
about reframing right like in looking at


---------86:03----------
things in a new way


---------86:03----------
giving your your mind a frame why does


---------86:06----------
your mind thrive with a frame because


---------86:08----------
then you can focus your energy in one


---------86:10----------
way so frame allows you to focus your


---------86:12----------
energy and what you're really good at is


---------86:14----------
actually focusing your energy okay right


---------86:17----------
so what we need to do for you to


---------86:19----------
meditate is give you something that


---------86:21----------
focuses the full attention of your mind


---------86:24----------
do you do you have a reluctance to use a


---------86:29----------
breathing technique no okay


---------86:33----------
I use breathing techniques to help my


---------86:35----------
panic disorder so what kind of breathing


---------86:38----------
have you done it just likes really


---------86:42----------
standard into the nose out through the


---------86:43----------
mouth deep breaths like that type of


---------86:44----------
thing okay so I want to give you


---------86:47----------
something that is going to be men


---------86:48----------
to lead taxing okay so what we want to


---------86:51----------
do for you to be able to meditate what


---------86:53----------
we need is for the energy of your mind


---------86:55----------
not to be built up through tension but


---------86:57----------
through dissipate through effort okay


---------87:01----------
does that make sense yeah


---------87:03----------
so Wigan we can try a couple of things


---------87:06----------
okay so I'm gonna just I gotta sit


---------87:08----------
across like so so is it gonna be like


---------87:10----------
more complicated breathing techniques


---------87:13----------
absolutely require more attention


---------87:15----------
absolutely okay we're gonna try to


---------87:17----------
complicate you to the extent of what you


---------87:19----------
can handle okay perfect yeah and so the


---------87:24----------
first so if you've watched streams


---------87:26----------
before you gotta let me know if you've


---------87:27----------
tried this at home okay so the first


---------87:29----------
thing that I'm gonna try to teach you is


---------87:30----------
something called triphasic breathing so


---------87:33----------
it's a relatively somatic experience and


---------87:35----------
it should be like cognitively a little


---------87:37----------
bit burdensome okay okay so what I'm


---------87:40----------
gonna ask you to do is sit up straight


---------87:42----------
and close your eyes


---------87:43----------
mm-hmm do you know how to belly breathe


---------87:47----------
yes okay so what I want like with your


---------87:50----------
diaphragm yes so the first thing that I


---------87:52----------
want you to do so I'm gonna just teach


---------87:54----------
other people so I want everyone at home


---------87:56----------
to do this - okay so close your eyes and


---------87:58----------
I want you to breathe with your belly


---------88:01----------
and what that means is when you breathe


---------88:03----------
in expand your stomach kind of push your


---------88:08----------
abdomen out and when you breathe out


---------88:10----------
contract your belly and pull in and what


---------88:16----------
you can do is kind of focus on your


---------88:18----------
navel your belly button and when you


---------88:21----------
breathe in imagine your belly button


---------88:23----------
moving away from your spine and when you


---------88:27----------
breathe out pull your belly button in


---------88:29----------
towards your spine try to decrease the


---------88:33----------
distance between your belly button and


---------88:36----------
your spine as you breathe out and so


---------88:41----------
what you should feel is your belly


---------88:47----------
moving out during inhalation in your


---------88:51----------
belly moving in during exhalation


---------88:56----------
and we're gonna go ahead and do that for


---------88:59----------
about 15 seconds before the next step


---------89:09----------
and really try to focus on your abdomen


---------89:11----------
as you breathe try to expand it to its


---------89:16----------
fullest


---------89:31----------
now Dom what I want you to do is as you


---------89:34----------
breathe in and as you breathe out try to


---------89:37----------
minimize the movement of your chest so


---------89:43----------
try to keep it as localized in the


---------89:45----------
abdomen as possible


---------90:01----------
you may feel some chest expansion or


---------90:03----------
contraction that's okay but really try


---------90:07----------
to direct all of your breath into the


---------90:10----------
abdomen and minimize the chest we'll do


---------90:14----------
this for about 15 to 20 seconds


---------90:37----------
and now we move to step two so after you


---------90:41----------
fully breathe in with your belly I want


---------90:44----------
you to pause for a second and then try


---------90:46----------
to expand your chest and breathe in even


---------90:48----------
more while keeping your belly still so


---------90:52----------
full breath into the belly extra breath


---------90:55----------
with the chest in sequence and then go


---------90:59----------
ahead and exhale and relax both good


---------91:02----------
practice that full in with the belly


---------91:06----------
first the second phase of breathing is


---------91:09----------
expansion of the chest and then


---------91:13----------
relaxation will do this for 15 seconds


---------91:31----------
another five seconds and now the next


---------91:40----------
step I want you to break down the


---------91:44----------
exhalation the same way you break down


---------91:46----------
the inhalation so breathe in with the


---------91:48----------
belly expand the chest hold the belly


---------91:52----------
still contract the chest then breathe


---------91:55----------
out the rest of the way through the


---------91:57----------
belly so now we have four discrete steps


---------92:00----------
to the practice phase one breathe in


---------92:07----------
with the belly phase two breathe in with


---------92:10----------
the chest phase three relax the chest


---------92:13----------
phase four relax the belly and you


---------92:18----------
should feel a little bit of a stop


---------92:20----------
between each phase we're gonna do this


---------92:25----------
for fifteen seconds


---------92:39----------
and now we're gonna do phase three


---------92:42----------
expand the belly expand the chest hold


---------92:45----------
for a moment and then push your


---------92:47----------
shoulders up as you expand just a tiny


---------92:50----------
bit more


---------92:51----------
so belly out chest out shoulders up and


---------92:55----------
now exhale all together breathe in with


---------93:02----------
the belly breathe in with the chest


---------93:05----------
raise your shoulders and breathe in a


---------93:07----------
tiny bit more and then relax all three


---------93:13----------
good in with the belly expand the chest


---------93:19----------
raise the shoulders and then out


---------93:25----------
continue at your own pace for about


---------93:27----------
fifteen seconds


---------93:49----------
and now we're gonna tie it all together


---------93:51----------
so we're gonna segment our exhalation in


---------93:55----------
the opposite of our inhalation so in


---------93:58----------
with the belly I'm sorry


---------94:00----------
expand the belly expand the chest raise


---------94:02----------
your shoulders really like hunch them up


---------94:05----------
a little bit to get as much in as you


---------94:06----------
can and then relax the shoulders first


---------94:09----------
bring them down contract the chest let


---------94:12----------
it relax and then the third phase is


---------94:14----------
move your navel towards your spine so in


---------94:20----------
a third in a third in a third out a


---------94:23----------
third out a third out a third and we're


---------94:25----------
gonna practice for 30 seconds


---------94:53----------
I want you to do three more rounds three


---------94:56----------
more breaths and after the third round I


---------95:00----------
want you to just sit relax let your


---------95:05----------
breath do whatever it wants to and


---------95:07----------
observe what your breath is doing after


---------95:10----------
you stop just notice it and sit with


---------95:14----------
that new kind of breath


---------96:13----------
and now dumb let your eyes stay closed


---------96:16----------
and let yourself come back right so


---------96:24----------
notice the return of your your mind and


---------96:27----------
now put your hands together in front of


---------96:28----------
you put your palms together in front of


---------96:30----------
you good rub them together rub rub rub


---------96:33----------
rub rub rub rub feel that heat that


---------96:35----------
friction good cut them over your eyes as


---------96:40----------
you breathe in and exhale slowly open


---------96:43----------
your eyes with your palms over them and


---------96:46----------
when your breath is complete let your


---------96:48----------
hands come down yeah that's crazy really


---------96:56----------
cool what what do you mean by crazy


---------96:58----------
let's die well I noticed that when you


---------97:03----------
said to concentrate on my breathing


---------97:04----------
again like at first it was really


---------97:08----------
different so I feel like super more like


---------97:11----------
way more awake than I did before so I


---------97:13----------
feel like way more like conscious but I


---------97:14----------
guess my breathing like before that like


---------97:18----------
diaphragm breathing I was focusing on


---------97:19----------
diaphragm breathing but then once I


---------97:21----------
stopped doing like the segmented


---------97:22----------
breathing my diaphragm breathing was


---------97:24----------
natural so then when I was like just


---------97:26----------
breathe however you want I went back to


---------97:29----------
like diaphragm breathing there naturally


---------97:33----------
even though before I was breathing like


---------97:35----------
higher up like in my chest


---------97:37----------
naturally yep so yeah the breathing was


---------97:40----------
definitely way different what was your


---------97:41----------
mind doing just focusing on focusing on


---------97:46----------
doing it correctly each step feels like


---------97:51----------
it was kind of hard to manage it so I'm


---------97:55----------
getting actually more air in each point


---------97:58----------
because like those times route try to


---------98:00----------
breathe into my chest and then it's like


---------98:01----------
okay now try to breathe more with your


---------98:02----------
shoulders and I'm already like max


---------98:03----------
capacity capacity on air so trying to


---------98:05----------
just do it correctly


---------98:06----------
well over and over what kind of thoughts


---------98:09----------
were you having


---------98:12----------
[Music]


---------98:17----------
I'm like very just like calm relaxed


---------98:20----------
thoughts like and I was thinking I guess


---------98:22----------
part of what I was thinking about was it


---------98:26----------
like made me feel like like a kid again


---------98:28----------
almost in a way because the last time I


---------98:29----------
did diaphragm breathing I played music


---------98:32----------
and that was something that they like


---------98:33----------
trained you to do as wooden players like


---------98:34----------
breathe through your diaphragm so I was


---------98:36----------
just like thinking about like Oh last


---------98:37----------
time I did this I remember like like the


---------98:39----------
joy of being a kid so I guess I just


---------98:41----------
felt like joy so so hold on there's a


---------98:44----------
big difference between remembering the


---------98:46----------
joy of being a kid and feeling joy


---------98:48----------
mm-hmm


---------98:49----------
well I felt like happy like when I when


---------98:52----------
I stopped doing this like I just like I


---------98:55----------
can't stop smiling right now for some


---------98:56----------
reason yeah so I guess I am feeling some


---------98:59----------
amount of like happiness yeah so that


---------99:02----------
also means that you're meditating right


---------99:05----------
so this is what happens when people


---------99:06----------
meditate they start to feel happy


---------99:08----------
so like enlightenment or moksha is


---------99:11----------
liberate is defined as liberation which


---------99:13----------
sort of in platon implies freedom but


---------99:15----------
also bliss onon which it means bliss and


---------99:19----------
so when people meditate they just feel


---------99:21----------
happier and so last question I have as


---------99:24----------
you can just see you can just do that to


---------99:26----------
yourself every day meditation is [ __ ]


---------99:29----------
Opie yeah it's absolutely thing that's


---------99:37----------
what people keep on talking about the


---------99:39----------
problem is that they do such a shitty


---------99:40----------
job teaching it that people don't like


---------99:43----------
it's absolutely Opie like there's no


---------99:44----------
question that you can just make yourself


---------99:46----------
happy every day yeah man so you so you'd


---------99:50----------
recommend doing that like before I just


---------99:51----------
started my day like right like when you


---------99:53----------
wake up like I win at a point or I would


---------99:55----------
not recommend that okay I would I


---------99:59----------
wouldn't recommend anything for you you


---------100:01----------
tell me yeah well like I guess when I


---------100:05----------
would wake up I would just feel happy at


---------100:07----------
the beginning of the day so probably


---------100:08----------
like that would be what I would


---------100:10----------
naturally think it'd be the best time


---------100:11----------
for it good then that's when you should


---------100:14----------
do it remember it's not about external


---------100:17----------
formulas of success it's about your


---------100:18----------
uniqueness yeah listen to yourself


---------100:22----------
you will know when to meditate perfect


---------100:25----------
I'm gonna do that when I wake up yep


---------100:27----------
so one thing I will tell you is that if


---------100:29----------
you can do it around dawn


---------100:30----------
dusk there are lots of texts that are


---------100:33----------
thousands of years old that say that


---------100:35----------
your yield from meditation will be


---------100:37----------
greater okay well it works for you I


---------100:40----------
don't know it sounds like you start


---------100:41----------
streaming pretty early so you may be up


---------100:43----------
around dawn yeah yeah it'd be like 6 7


---------100:45----------
a.m. okay yep do you have a place that


---------100:47----------
you can see the Sun my balcony or I can


---------100:52----------
go yeah my balcony so I would consider


---------100:55----------
watching the sunrise or being exposed to


---------100:58----------
sunrise and meditating in that situation


---------101:00----------
if you want to go like hardcore and be


---------101:01----------
like a yoga hippy you can go do that you


---------101:04----------
could also do it while streaming in


---------101:07----------
front of a computer in bizarrely you


---------101:09----------
don't have to do it in a very special


---------101:10----------
place like that's what's cool is you can


---------101:11----------
do it wherever you are


---------101:12----------
mm-hmm and you'd recommend I do it the


---------101:14----------
same way with the segmented breathing


---------101:16----------
you're like stuck would I do it the same


---------101:18----------
way where I start with just diaphragm


---------101:20----------
breathing and that I do diaphragm to


---------101:22----------
chest then to shoulder a bit and then


---------101:24----------
like back down and then diaphragm to


---------101:25----------
Chester shoulders like that same


---------101:26----------
technique what do you think well I mean


---------101:29----------
that's just naturally what I'll do


---------101:30----------
because that's what gave me that go for


---------101:32----------
happiness response go for it right so I


---------101:36----------
think the main thing here so the last


---------101:38----------
thing I'll ask you Dom is what happened


---------101:40----------
to your perception of time during that


---------101:41----------
practice hmm I'm not sure was that a


---------101:47----------
long time I I don't know what happened


---------101:49----------
to my perception I think I lost my


---------101:50----------
perception of time excellent that means


---------101:52----------
you're doing it right right okay so you


---------101:55----------
weren't trying to not think so if you


---------101:57----------
lose perception of time so time happens


---------101:59----------
within the mind right so like while


---------102:02----------
we're asleep we lose our perception of


---------102:03----------
time now that we're talking your


---------102:04----------
perception of time is returned does that


---------102:06----------
make sense yeah and and so if you lose


---------102:09----------
your perception of time that means that


---------102:12----------
you're entering a no mind state and so


---------102:15----------
that means that you're also not thinking


---------102:16----------
thoughts so it seems like you had


---------102:18----------
thoughts from time to time but for most


---------102:20----------
of the practice or maybe not most I


---------102:22----------
don't know how much but it sounds like


---------102:24----------
you definitely got to a place where


---------102:26----------
you're you're a tenth the attention of


---------102:28----------
your cut of your consciousness was


---------102:30----------
focused on you without thoughts so you


---------102:34----------
were a conscious but you are not


---------102:36----------
actually thinking things and even then


---------102:39----------
it whether you recalled whether you had


---------102:41----------
the thought of oh this is like being a


---------102:43----------
child that it sounds like you


---------102:44----------
had the experience of joy that was


---------102:47----------
similar to you being a child but the


---------102:49----------
thought of this reminds me of being a


---------102:50----------
child and that experience of joy are


---------102:52----------
separate things does that make sense


---------102:54----------
one is a thought one is not so I just


---------102:56----------
probably linked it in my head because of


---------102:58----------
like so we had the thought and then I


---------102:59----------
had the experience and I just linked it


---------103:01----------
naturally but they weren't connected


---------103:03----------
yeah so you had the experience and then


---------103:05----------
your mind because this is what it does


---------103:07----------
scans based on prior experiences and


---------103:10----------
makes connections okay like every time I


---------103:13----------
go to the bathroom and I flush the


---------103:15----------
toilet my mind connects that little


---------103:18----------
handle with the toilet flushing so


---------103:21----------
that's what the mind does but I'm any


---------103:22----------
way we're kind of getting a little bit


---------103:23----------
deep but just understand that there's


---------103:25----------
actually a lot of cool stuff that


---------103:27----------
happened within Dom that is not thinking


---------103:30----------
is that okay like there wasn't that


---------103:32----------
wasn't all just thought it's like weird


---------103:33----------
experiences so yeah so I think you're


---------103:38----------
doing it I think the main thing is that


---------103:39----------
you need something so in order for you


---------103:41----------
to get to that state it's got to be


---------103:43----------
challenging mm-hmm okay it's like it's


---------103:47----------
kind of like saying like it's easy to


---------103:49----------
not get toxic when you're playing noobs


---------103:50----------
and loll because you're climbing because


---------103:52----------
it's like NBD so you need to be at a


---------103:55----------
high degree of competition with your


---------103:57----------
mind so if it and I so I think you


---------104:01----------
decide kind of what the cognitive you


---------104:04----------
can do it whichever so eventually what I


---------104:07----------
assume is gonna happen is over time like


---------104:09----------
I'll be more practiced at that type of


---------104:11----------
breathing method and it will become like


---------104:13----------
easier for me which will make it like


---------104:16----------
yeah that I'm gonna need new challenges


---------104:18----------
so how what do i do from there happens


---------104:20----------
so that's why advanced meditation


---------104:22----------
techniques exist right so there's


---------104:25----------
beginner meditation there's advanced


---------104:27----------
meditation there's Expo meditation so so


---------104:32----------
my path of learning meditation I learned


---------104:35----------
a bunch of techniques for about three


---------104:36----------
months when I was living in India at an


---------104:38----------
ashram came back to the u.s. practice


---------104:41----------
those techniques for a year went back


---------104:42----------
and then went to the advanced class


---------104:44----------
which are more engaging more cognitively


---------104:47----------
like more focusing deeper techniques and


---------104:50----------
then eventually you'll start to have you


---------104:52----------
know different kinds of experiences


---------104:53----------
within meditation that are kind of cool


---------104:55----------
and fun Wow


---------104:57----------
I didn't even know this stuff was


---------104:58----------
possible like I thought it was like a


---------105:00----------
myth I thought it wasn't like hippy


---------105:01----------
stuff or something you know yeah I'm


---------105:02----------
with you that's because that's how it's


---------105:04----------
[ __ ] taught most of the time so the


---------105:07----------
problem with meditation is that we to


---------105:09----------
become a meditation teacher you have to


---------105:11----------
have a class right then cuz that's how


---------105:13----------
we determine someone's an expert it's


---------105:15----------
[ __ ] dumb


---------105:16----------
someone has to completes the class they


---------105:18----------
go through the motions they become a


---------105:19----------
meditation teacher know like meditation


---------105:23----------
teacher is about experience and like the


---------105:25----------
competence that comes from it and then


---------105:26----------
if you're a good meditation teacher you


---------105:28----------
should be able to take someone and teach


---------105:30----------
them how to meditate properly right like


---------105:33----------
that's yep but good I'm very happy for


---------105:35----------
you yeah whatever I did before I don't


---------105:37----------
think that was meditation yeah I guess I


---------105:40----------
haven't tried meditation until this you


---------105:42----------
haven't tried so so this is where there


---------105:44----------
are a couple of different words for


---------105:45----------
meditation so meditation is two things


---------105:48----------
one is a verb it's a practice that you


---------105:50----------
do the other thing is it's a state of


---------105:52----------
mind I think you have tried meditation I


---------105:54----------
think you have not achieved the


---------105:57----------
meditative state of mind until today


---------105:59----------
okay


---------106:01----------
thoughts of lots of questions before you


---------106:04----------
wrap up that I understood why it was


---------106:13----------
good and like I like I understood the


---------106:15----------
reasoning behind it but I just didn't


---------106:16----------
think it was like that like I didn't


---------106:18----------
think that you actually liked so I'll


---------106:20----------
let you in on a little secret like


---------106:21----------
everyone who talks about the benefits of


---------106:23----------
meditation or is missing the [ __ ]


---------106:25----------
point what you felt is the [ __ ] point


---------106:27----------
it's not about reductions of anxiety


---------106:29----------
it's not about improvements of in


---------106:31----------
depression this is why people meditate


---------106:33----------
understand this very clearly but though


---------106:35----------
was not trying to treat people's anxiety


---------106:37----------
which is what we do now right we use but


---------106:40----------
like oh you should use headspace oh


---------106:41----------
you've got panic attacks like Oh use


---------106:42----------
headspace that's not why blood though


---------106:44----------
was doing it would that was doing it for


---------106:46----------
what you experienced today that's the


---------106:47----------
reason you meditate perfect absolutely


---------106:53----------
man


---------106:53----------
good I'm so happy for you I'm very very


---------106:55----------
happy for you


---------106:56----------
that's really cool okay well I


---------106:58----------
appreciate that thank you


---------107:00----------
of course man that's gonna that's


---------107:01----------
definitely gonna change things going


---------107:02----------
forward okay well good for you good no I


---------107:08----------
just say you know if you run into any


---------107:10----------
trouble or anything like that


---------107:11----------
feel free to drop me a line or something


---------107:13----------
you know I'm happy to continue to help


---------107:15----------
you or guide you okay awesome okay I


---------107:18----------
appreciate that a lot


---------107:19----------
any thoughts or questions before you


---------107:20----------
wrap up I'm good okay awesome and thank


---------107:25----------
you so much for coming on and thank you


---------107:26----------
so much for sharing like everything that


---------107:28----------
you did because I certainly learned a


---------107:30----------
lot and hopefully it was helpful to


---------107:31----------
other people too yeah


---------107:34----------
good luck man take care all right thanks


---------107:37----------
all righty


---------107:42----------
okay so we're about at time for today


---------107:46----------
and so I wanna yeah so he's a bit though


---------107:51----------
absolutely right so we just we get a lot


---------107:54----------
of Bottas well what happens is like


---------107:56----------
electronics worse and Vata so we see a


---------107:59----------
lot more Vata disturbance then then bit


---------108:03----------
that disturbance in gaming but i


---------108:04----------
absolutely think that toxicity is an


---------108:06----------
example of bit the disturbance but yeah


---------108:11----------
so that was I don't know I mean how was


---------108:13----------
like I know that we didn't like you know


---------108:14----------
he didn't start breaking down and crying


---------108:16----------
and stuff which I know is why how some


---------108:18----------
people gauged the value of a session I


---------108:19----------
definitely don't think of it that way


---------108:22----------
and yeah so I want to thank you guys


---------108:27----------
hopefully that was helpful for y'all I


---------108:28----------
really think that so I think Dom has a


---------108:31----------
very very good experience allure


---------108:34----------
intuitive understanding of a lot of the


---------108:36----------
things that I think hold our audience or


---------108:39----------
gamers or Gen Z back Millennials which


---------108:42----------
is sort of like you know he's orienting


---------108:43----------
towards himself like he's understanding


---------108:45----------
that activities are not good or bad that


---------108:49----------
like if you don't like school it's not


---------108:51----------
necessarily school's fault that you have


---------108:54----------
an individual contribution to the way


---------108:57----------
that you live your life and how


---------108:59----------
activities are experienced right so like


---------109:02----------
a great example like he said was from


---------109:04----------
from Jay Cole and taking out the trash


---------109:06----------
that you can change something in your


---------109:08----------
mind that makes you enjoy things more


---------109:11----------
and that is 100% been my experience so


---------109:15----------
like what I found is that you know I


---------109:16----------
used to dislike life and that you can


---------109:19----------
actually do some kind of process of


---------109:21----------
reflection and observation that through


---------109:24----------
reflection


---------109:24----------
observe a


---------109:25----------
and understanding activities that you


---------109:27----------
used to dislike are more able to be done


---------109:30----------
not necessarily saying that I like doing


---------109:32----------
them but that I'm able to do them and


---------109:35----------
then so that can then that gets to the


---------109:37----------
question of how do you understand


---------109:39----------
because watching someone else tell you


---------109:40----------
that conclusion it doesn't make it easy


---------109:42----------
for you to take out the trash so I think


---------109:44----------
another kind of meditative practice that


---------109:47----------
you all can think about is just take out


---------109:50----------
the trash right and when you take out


---------109:52----------
the trash or clean something and notice


---------109:55----------
yourself before take a snapshot of


---------109:57----------
yourself before notice that you don't


---------109:59----------
feel like doing it do the thing and then


---------110:02----------
take a snapshot after how do you feel


---------110:04----------
afterward so study yourself in the way


---------110:09----------
that you read guides to like climb you


---------110:11----------
know rank and League of Legends or in


---------110:14----------
the way that you like you know read


---------110:15----------
about this and study other things in the


---------110:17----------
way that you guys keep up with


---------110:19----------
coronavirus and understand what's going


---------110:21----------
on understand yourself and try to try to


---------110:25----------
be a little bit more unique instead of


---------110:28----------
like you know just following an external


---------110:31----------
road to success because following the


---------110:34----------
external road to success [ __ ] doesn't


---------110:36----------
work and so stop doing it like look


---------110:39----------
within yourself everyone is a snowflake


---------110:44----------
right that's actually the whole point


---------110:46----------
like I have a video mapped out about


---------110:49----------
this that I want to do but but you guys


---------110:50----------
you are snowflakes and you should treat


---------110:52----------
yourself as a snowflake because you are


---------110:54----------
a snowflake no one with your set of


---------110:57----------
experiences and your set of advantages


---------111:00----------
and your set of disadvantages has ever


---------111:03----------
existed in the history of the universe


---------111:05----------
and never will again so you are unique


---------111:09----------
and you better start playing the game of


---------111:11----------
life that way you better stop playing


---------111:13----------
based on like what other characters with


---------111:15----------
other stats do and understand like what


---------111:17----------
you are and how you are unique and what


---------111:21----------
we can hear from Dom very clearly is


---------111:23----------
that when he stopped gravitating towards


---------111:25----------
objective success and started


---------111:27----------
gravitating towards being unique he


---------111:30----------
became more fulfilled and more


---------111:32----------
successful and I did the same exact


---------111:34----------
thing
