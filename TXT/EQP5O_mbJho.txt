---------00:00----------
yeah so a couple of things just a brief


---------00:02----------
announcements for before we hop in with


---------00:03----------
train one is that our coaching program


---------00:05----------
actually launched on friday


---------00:07----------
and just a reminder that coaching is not


---------00:09----------
medical advice so it's not like


---------00:11----------
treatment or therapy it's actually like


---------00:12----------
supporting you and moving forward


---------00:14----------
so issues like playing too many video


---------00:16----------
games um working on your motivation your


---------00:19----------
relationships laziness things like that


---------00:21----------
feeling socially isolated negative


---------00:23----------
thought patterns


---------00:24----------
um these are the kinds of things that


---------00:25----------
our coaches work with and


---------00:27----------
specifically what i wanted to talk to


---------00:29----------
you guys about because we haven't really


---------00:30----------
shown this group coaching i think is


---------00:33----------
really really effective


---------00:34----------
i think it's interesting because on


---------00:36----------
stream you know we do a lot of


---------00:37----------
individual work


---------00:38----------
but i i don't know if you guys could


---------00:40----------
kind of get this from friday's stream


---------00:42----------
but


---------00:42----------
the cool thing about a group is how can


---------00:46----------
i say this so when i'm working with a


---------00:47----------
person individually


---------00:49----------
it's hard to make them see their biases


---------00:54----------
right what's actually really really


---------00:55----------
effective and i think part of the reason


---------00:57----------
that group coaching is so effective


---------00:58----------
is that when you see your problems


---------01:01----------
in another person it is way easier to


---------01:05----------
analyze and figure them out so like when


---------01:07----------
you hear someone else talk about


---------01:09----------
procrastination


---------01:10----------
in a bizarre way you're free from all of


---------01:13----------
your own issues so you


---------01:15----------
see how they struggle with


---------01:16----------
procrastination and then you


---------01:19----------
learn a lot more from it so group


---------01:20----------
coaching is sort of this idea that like


---------01:23----------
you know we get a group of y'all


---------01:24----------
together and then you guys kind of go


---------01:26----------
through this process


---------01:27----------
together there's also um sort of this


---------01:30----------
idea that like you know when we're


---------01:32----------
trying to figure out a problem


---------01:33----------
each of y'all is gonna have one piece of


---------01:35----------
the puzzle so in a weird way it can


---------01:37----------
actually be


---------01:38----------
while it isn't quite as specific to you


---------01:40----------
you can actually learn a lot from your


---------01:42----------
colleagues


---------01:43----------
and there's also an added advantage to


---------01:45----------
group which is that you can actually


---------01:47----------
help


---------01:47----------
other people which i cannot


---------01:50----------
underestimate the value of there are


---------01:52----------
thousands of people that need help


---------01:54----------
and we think that group is kind of like


---------01:55----------
effective because you know you can


---------01:57----------
support your peers you can learn from


---------01:58----------
each other we can help more people


---------02:01----------
so if you guys are kind of curious i


---------02:03----------
would highly encourage you all check out


---------02:04----------
group coaching


---------02:07----------
give me just there we go wow how you


---------02:10----------

---------03:29----------
anything in particular you wanted to


---------03:30----------
talk about today


---------03:33----------
i think no i think we just do a


---------03:35----------
continuation you know


---------03:36----------
like a part one part two part three part


---------03:38----------
four part five you know


---------03:39----------

---------03:48----------
the abyss it's like where are we going

---------04:04----------
deeper down deeper deeper


---------04:09----------
all right i'm back all right man wow wow


---------04:12----------
what


---------04:13----------
you know since since i just woke up i


---------04:15----------
still have burning sensation in my eyes


---------04:17----------
does that make sense


---------04:19----------
sort of you have tried i'm not awake yet


---------04:22----------
no maybe i'm not sure but it's it's as


---------04:25----------
if


---------04:26----------
i'm still tired my body's awake


---------04:29----------
my mind's awake my eyes are not does


---------04:32----------
that make sense


---------04:35----------
let me think about that


---------04:40----------
burning yeah it's like


---------04:43----------
well hmm it's not burning it's like


---------04:49----------
let me think about this so let's see i


---------04:50----------
wake up oh


---------04:53----------
you know my eyes are indicating that i


---------04:55----------
need to go i need to close them and


---------04:57----------
sleep


---------04:58----------
but my body and mind are awake i think


---------05:00----------
it's nyquil i took that i took


---------05:01----------
i took nyquil last night ah i think it's


---------05:04----------
nyquil does that make sense


---------05:05----------
i'm a little drowsy still yeah right


---------05:07----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------05:09----------
nyquil will lead to dry eyes actually


---------05:12----------
really


---------05:13----------
yeah oh wow


---------05:16----------
that explains a lot if i remember


---------05:18----------
correctly nyquil has something called


---------05:20----------
anticholinergic effects


---------05:23----------
which dry you out so they cause


---------05:24----------
constipation sometimes urinary retention


---------05:27----------
dry eyes dry mouth dry nose


---------05:30----------
right that's sometimes why it helps so


---------05:32----------
that would


---------05:33----------
if you took nyquil may have something to


---------05:35----------
do with it


---------05:37----------
yeah damn yeah well how have you been


---------05:41----------
how are you going coven good so i


---------05:44----------
actually was thinking


---------05:45----------
uh yeah i mean things are good i think


---------05:47----------
uh


---------05:49----------
you know things are sort of like we i


---------05:50----------
moved to texas during covet actually


---------05:53----------
so yeah so at first i just came down


---------05:56----------
here temporarily but then


---------05:57----------
covet never ended so now i'm just here


---------06:00----------
well you're in texas right now


---------06:02----------
yeah are you in austin houston houston


---------06:06----------
oh


---------06:06----------
nice very good so i i i was


---------06:10----------

---------06:12----------
texas so


---------06:14----------
back home to texas boy yeah man


---------06:17----------
absolutely


---------06:18----------
cool is houston more like cowboy hat


---------06:21----------
cowboy boot spurs


---------06:22----------
cause well i mean austin austin is well


---------06:25----------
you can have cowboy hats in order texas


---------06:27----------
let me tell you what but


---------06:28----------
austin is really it's like it's like all


---------06:30----------
the liberals are down there you know


---------06:31----------
what i mean


---------06:32----------
it's true it's like a tiny amount of the


---------06:35----------
northeast or the west coast


---------06:37----------
right in the heart of texas yeah yeah


---------06:40----------
it's it's


---------06:40----------
it's a little piece of california in


---------06:42----------
texas yeah


---------06:44----------
yeah a lot of hippies and you know just


---------06:46----------
people experimenting with


---------06:48----------
different things and yeah living freely


---------06:51----------
and


---------06:52----------
yeah yeah you know all those all those


---------06:55----------
things man


---------06:56----------
yeah yeah i would even say maybe like


---------06:57----------
you know i watch some vampire movies


---------07:00----------
tv series you know like vampire diaries


---------07:02----------
right or like the originals


---------07:04----------
and and these things take place in like


---------07:06----------
new orleans right


---------07:08----------
i would say what's that one district


---------07:10----------
called the new orleans where there's


---------07:11----------
like mardi gras and stuff


---------07:13----------
the french quarter the french quarter


---------07:15----------
yeah i would say there's a little bit of


---------07:16----------
french quarter


---------07:17----------
in austin right i feel like i could walk


---------07:19----------
down the street get my fortune told


---------07:20----------
while there was like a witch


---------07:21----------
performing a ritual vampire


---------07:24----------
talking about yeah you could certainly


---------07:26----------
get your fortune told in austin for sure


---------07:28----------
oh for sure yeah um i i've heard it's


---------07:31----------
changed a lot but back when i was you


---------07:33----------
know


---------07:34----------
i mean yeah i don't know if the keep


---------07:35----------
austin weird is still a thing


---------07:38----------
oh it's yes very much so yeah that was


---------07:41----------
you know that was before a bunch of


---------07:43----------
people moved in but i'm glad it's still


---------07:44----------
a thing


---------07:46----------
so train yeah um one question that i had


---------07:49----------
kind of


---------07:49----------
last time is is you know you'd mentioned


---------07:51----------
your parents a couple of times


---------07:53----------
and and i just i was looking at some of


---------07:55----------
the notes that i had taken from our


---------07:57----------
last talk and it seemed like we hadn't


---------08:00----------
um you know we talked a lot about sort


---------08:02----------
of the effects of their upbringing but


---------08:04----------
we hadn't really talked much about


---------08:06----------
them or what it was like to grow up um


---------08:08----------
you'd kind of mentioned to me that you


---------08:10----------
know you studied biochem


---------08:11----------
and your of iranian descent yeah


---------08:14----------
and and so there were kind of i sort of


---------08:18----------
felt like you had mentioned a couple


---------08:19----------
things and we could make assumptions


---------08:20----------
about what those sorts of things meant


---------08:23----------
like in terms of the value system that


---------08:25----------
you were brought up with and things like


---------08:27----------
that but i was


---------08:28----------
actually kind of curious if if you could


---------08:30----------
tell us more


---------08:32----------
yeah so um


---------08:38----------
yeah um hmm


---------08:42----------
sorry i have to okay so before we get to


---------08:45----------
that


---------08:46----------
sure we gotta do a


---------08:49----------
hmm what can i i gotta warm the juice so


---------08:53----------
my brain is like right now here's where


---------08:55----------
i'm at mentally


---------08:56----------
okay okay so you buy a new computer


---------09:00----------
okay turns on instantly right


---------09:02----------
everything's ready to go


---------09:04----------
right and then after


---------09:08----------
about five years of doing various things


---------09:10----------
in that computer you know


---------09:12----------
it could be anything right it starts


---------09:14----------
slowing down you start turning it on you


---------09:16----------
have three different startup processes


---------09:18----------
you know and things are just taking


---------09:20----------
forever right you end up blue screening


---------09:22----------
going back to the restart


---------09:23----------
that's where i'm at right now okay so i


---------09:25----------
gotta i gotta get i gotta get the juices


---------09:27----------
flowing before we get into that you know


---------09:29----------
so okay so


---------09:32----------
yeah um


---------09:37----------
let me think about this where can we


---------09:39----------
start that i'll get my


---------09:40----------
you know brain where it needs to be hmm


---------09:44----------
great question one that i think you'll


---------09:46----------
have the answer to


---------09:49----------
yeah have you played among us have you


---------09:51----------
tried that game


---------09:52----------
no it's a really good game what's it


---------09:55----------
what kind of game is it


---------09:57----------
so there's like there's 10 players


---------10:00----------
and you load into a map


---------10:03----------
and the map has various tasks that you


---------10:05----------
do and the objective of the game


---------10:07----------
is there's two imposters but they don't


---------10:10----------
tell you who the impostors are they're


---------10:12----------
randomly selected at the start of the


---------10:13----------
map


---------10:13----------
no one can talk and you go around the


---------10:16----------
map


---------10:17----------
and you have to like study people's


---------10:19----------
behavior study people's


---------10:20----------
you know you know have a good sense of


---------10:23----------
deception


---------10:24----------
and you know be able to perceive when


---------10:26----------
people are lying or not


---------10:27----------
i don't perceive the right word there


---------10:28----------
but anyways it's really really fun


---------10:30----------
really good


---------10:31----------
um but yeah i suggest you play with


---------10:34----------
people that don't take it personally


---------10:35----------
because you know if you end up lying to


---------10:37----------
them or you end up calling them out


---------10:38----------
online


---------10:39----------
how do you lie if there's i think you


---------10:40----------
said there's no communication


---------10:42----------
so there's communication um in between


---------10:46----------
each round so if i if i'm imposter and i


---------10:49----------
kill somebody and let's say an innocent


---------10:50----------
person finds the body they can call it


---------10:52----------
and then we all tell our locations they


---------10:54----------
ask questions and we all play it off as


---------10:56----------
if we didn't kill it


---------10:57----------
and then people have to figure out


---------10:58----------
through the clues and consistencies


---------11:00----------
and and and like contradictions and


---------11:02----------
stories of who the killer is does that


---------11:04----------
make sense


---------11:05----------
yeah yeah yeah sounds so it's really fun


---------11:08----------
it's a really good game yeah if no if no


---------11:11----------
one cheats but you know i've


---------11:12----------
you know me and xbc have caught some


---------11:14----------
people uh


---------11:16----------
so since the different since everyone


---------11:17----------
has a chat and different chats can go


---------11:19----------
into each person's stream


---------11:20----------
they can see on the screen who the


---------11:22----------
imposter is and


---------11:24----------
right so a lot of people i don't know


---------11:26----------
why but they read their chat while


---------11:28----------
they're


---------11:29----------
innocent crew members so they're told


---------11:31----------
that they're you know it's


---------11:32----------
it's terrible but it that's a very low


---------11:34----------
percentage of blood do it but


---------11:36----------
you know hacks yeah it's like yeah


---------11:40----------
yeah are you pretty good at being


---------11:41----------
deceptive


---------11:45----------
you know


---------11:48----------
it was actually one of my worries of


---------11:50----------
starting the game so


---------11:52----------
with where i'm at so i'm a very paranoid


---------11:56----------
person


---------11:57----------
very paranoid okay so like i'm talking


---------11:59----------
paranoid to the point where


---------12:01----------
you know other students can tell you you


---------12:03----------
know i had slicker and john zurka here


---------12:05----------
in austin


---------12:05----------
and i took them to dinner and before i


---------12:08----------
had any conversation at all


---------12:10----------
i made them put their phones in the


---------12:12----------
middle airplane mode


---------12:14----------
then i had them stand up in the middle


---------12:15----------
of the restaurant this is a nice


---------12:16----------
restaurant i took them to


---------12:18----------
stand up i patted them down for a


---------12:19----------
secondary device


---------12:21----------
and then we sat down and talked so i'm


---------12:23----------
very paranoid as is


---------12:25----------
like some cia type stuff now


---------12:30----------
i was worried about starting the game


---------12:32----------
because everyone's been asking me to


---------12:33----------
play the game for so long i've been kind


---------12:35----------
of just


---------12:36----------
ignoring it not wanting to play just


---------12:38----------
avoiding it because i knew that this


---------12:40----------
game is going to lead me down one of two


---------12:41----------
roads


---------12:43----------
it's either gonna lead me down the road


---------12:44----------
where i'm very bad at it


---------12:46----------
and it fits every narrative that i'm


---------12:48----------
terrible at games


---------12:50----------
or i'm very good at it and it's going to


---------12:52----------
be used as a


---------12:54----------
as a credibility against the negative


---------12:57----------
imperative of i'm a manipulating


---------12:59----------
terrible evil person right so


---------13:02----------
since i'm like that character in each of


---------13:04----------
these narratives i was scared


---------13:06----------
there it was a lose-lose for me to play


---------13:07----------
the game but fortunately


---------13:09----------
i've been pretty good at it and no one's


---------13:11----------
gone that down that road but that was


---------13:13----------
definitely something me and my community


---------13:14----------
were laughing about along with my other


---------13:15----------
streamers that are friends


---------13:17----------
um so yeah it was definitely a fun time


---------13:20----------
though


---------13:21----------
so yeah i mean i don't know if i'm good


---------13:22----------
at being deceptive but it's it's


---------13:24----------
i like puzzles i like puzzles so i'm


---------13:26----------
gonna i'm gonna puzzle games i think


---------13:28----------
i don't know i could be wrong okay


---------13:32----------
does that make sense sure i mean it's so


---------13:34----------
interesting so i asked you


---------13:36----------
a question and then you gave me a lot of


---------13:40----------
stuff


---------13:42----------
yeah and and interestingly enough i i


---------13:45----------
don't even know if i got an answer to


---------13:47----------
the question


---------13:48----------
but boy did you give me some juicy


---------13:50----------
morsels


---------13:52----------
like what's up with the paranoia who is


---------13:55----------
slicker


---------13:56----------
slicker and john are two streamers on


---------14:00----------
twitch


---------14:01----------
and i met them on oh go ahead


---------14:04----------
are you bad at games


---------14:07----------
and what's up with with feeding into the


---------14:10----------
narrative that you're


---------14:11----------
evil are you where does that you seem


---------14:14----------
like a decent guy to me man


---------14:17----------
really authentic yeah


---------14:20----------
but i think i think you can see through


---------14:23----------
a lens


---------14:24----------
of like wisdom and maturity and like


---------14:27----------
more like you know


---------14:30----------
just a more i don't want to call it an


---------14:33----------
objective lens because i don't think


---------14:34----------
good or bad is


---------14:35----------
necessarily the subjective thing i mean


---------14:37----------
it is but it's not i don't know what it


---------14:39----------
is but it seems like you can see me


---------14:43----------
not for i mean i'm sure


---------14:47----------
initially from first impr the point is


---------14:50----------
here's what i've so [ __ ] um excuse my


---------14:53----------
language by the way um


---------14:57----------
okay so how do we do this so it starts


---------14:59----------
all the way back


---------15:00----------
in middle school high school okay this


---------15:03----------
is when i first learned about this


---------15:04----------
i was totally oblivious and ignorant to


---------15:07----------
this because i didn't know it existed


---------15:09----------
okay so in middle school in high school


---------15:13----------
i was


---------15:13----------
bullied a lot not physically though it


---------15:15----------
was psychologically


---------15:17----------
and in my time you know i'm a 1990 baby


---------15:20----------
psychologically


---------15:21----------
was never taken seriously


---------15:22----------
psychologically was i come from the time


---------15:24----------
of sticks and stones and hurt your bones


---------15:26----------
but words cannot hurt you they'd laugh


---------15:27----------
at that if someone called you dumb or


---------15:28----------
whatever


---------15:29----------
or worse things you're like who cares


---------15:31----------
right


---------15:32----------
so we'll skip middle school for now


---------15:37----------
in high school i moved schools i moved


---------15:41----------
cities we moved


---------15:43----------
and i walked into school and from day


---------15:46----------
one


---------15:47----------
i was like just heavily mentally like


---------15:50----------
psychologically bullied heavily by


---------15:52----------
everybody and i didn't know why


---------15:55----------
and i'll spare you the entire story


---------15:58----------
let's get to the end


---------15:59----------
senior year high school


---------16:03----------
i confront my bully okay i'm at a point


---------16:06----------
in my life where


---------16:07----------
i've gotten to a you know


---------16:10----------
i'm in english class with him and


---------16:13----------
he punches me in the back the english


---------16:15----------
teacher is this football coach that and


---------16:17----------
he's on the football team


---------16:18----------
and basically he gets away with it i get


---------16:20----------
kicked out because the teachers


---------16:22----------
i think reliving his high school


---------16:23----------
experience that he wanted to have back


---------16:24----------
when he was in high school


---------16:25----------
through being a football coach now so


---------16:27----------
this weird thing where they're teaming


---------16:29----------
up and


---------16:29----------
you know smiling at each other like got


---------16:31----------
some deal together weird stuff


---------16:33----------
so anyways i'm pissed off i just had to


---------16:35----------
confront him


---------16:36----------
and the truth comes out apparently the


---------16:39----------
reason


---------16:40----------
he and the football team bullied me so


---------16:42----------
much is because they


---------16:43----------
thought they needed to bring me down a


---------16:45----------
notch they said when i


---------16:47----------
first walked into the school as the new


---------16:48----------
kid


---------16:50----------
that they thought that i thought


---------16:53----------
i ran the place because of my demeanor


---------16:56----------
because of how i looked because of how i


---------16:59----------
talked and because of the aggressive


---------17:01----------
look i have


---------17:02----------
so they felt they needed to bring me


---------17:04----------
down right


---------17:05----------
and when i heard this it started


---------17:08----------
clicking in so many different like


---------17:09----------
friend groups and spots i started


---------17:11----------
bringing this up and asking if this was


---------17:12----------
the case


---------17:13----------
and it ended up being the case almost 99


---------17:15----------
of the time there's always


---------17:17----------
so my case is is that you


---------17:21----------
your physical presence makes you come


---------17:23----------
across as


---------17:25----------
it's it's confidence or arrogant i don't


---------17:28----------
know if it's the physical presence i


---------17:29----------
think it's a mixture of like my face


---------17:30----------
like i have like very protruding


---------17:32----------
structure like you know it's where the


---------17:34----------
nickname ape comes from like my whole my


---------17:36----------
entire thing ape gang or you know


---------17:38----------
uh the gorilla it comes from people say


---------17:40----------
i have these like protruding bone


---------17:41----------
structures you know i have a


---------17:43----------
my side view you know i have like a


---------17:45----------
built-in umbrella when it rains i don't


---------17:46----------
need an umbrella


---------17:48----------
you know my forehead is the umbrella


---------17:50----------
right


---------17:51----------
and then i have these like dark black


---------17:53----------
eyes that like stare you know


---------17:54----------
people describe my eyes in my stream as


---------17:56----------
someone that's been through six


---------17:57----------
different wars


---------17:58----------
and is like going through an active


---------18:00----------
episode of ptsd


---------18:01----------
and thinking of all the kills and deaths


---------18:03----------
i went through like that that's like


---------18:04----------
describe my eyes right


---------18:06----------
and then i have a deep voice that


---------18:07----------
doesn't help at all


---------18:09----------
and doesn't right help with what is it


---------18:13----------
what does it not help with the view that


---------18:15----------
you're


---------18:17----------
like this i don't know i think upon i


---------18:20----------
mean


---------18:21----------
i've talked to like my friends about


---------18:22----------
this too like my friends that like i'm


---------18:24----------
actually cool and stuff


---------18:25----------
and they said like initially they felt


---------18:26----------
the same and even every day they do


---------18:29----------
they feel like it doesn't it doesn't


---------18:31----------
help with


---------18:33----------
so i'm a very passionate person so i


---------18:36----------
have to and


---------18:37----------
my mom's always told me i have to be


---------18:38----------
very very careful when i get excited


---------18:41----------
because it's not like a normal person's


---------18:43----------
excited where you can tell they're just


---------18:45----------
having fun


---------18:45----------
i sound like i'm about to go to war


---------18:48----------
right so when i jump at someone and say


---------18:49----------
oh i don't believe this no you're wrong


---------18:52----------
it sounds like we're about to go to into


---------18:54----------
like a viking


---------18:55----------
you know versus gladiator russell crowe


---------18:58----------
war right


---------18:59----------
we're talking like you know heads


---------19:00----------
chopped off type of war right so


---------19:03----------
all these different things go into this


---------19:05----------
but on the inside


---------19:10----------
you know i just love you know just love


---------19:13----------
but on the outside people see


---------19:16----------
war but the inside it's not the case


---------19:20----------
right so


---------19:23----------
i don't know what's it like to be


---------19:26----------
perceived like that


---------19:27----------
to be viewed as a viking when inside


---------19:31----------
you're a poet


---------19:36----------
well


---------19:40----------
i don't know i think the biggest


---------19:43----------
the biggest challenge of it all


---------19:46----------
is i think


---------19:49----------
most the time where others will get the


---------19:52----------
benefit of the doubt


---------19:53----------
i have to work uphill because i won't


---------19:55----------
get the benefit of the doubt


---------19:56----------
right so i have to like work uphill and


---------19:58----------
oh that's why i'm paranoid all the time


---------20:00----------
i feel like i need to always be ahead


---------20:02----------
one step ahead


---------20:03----------
i feel like i have to always watch my


---------20:05----------
back and be one step ahead of people


---------20:07----------
trying to like do whatever


---------20:09----------
because i know when something happens


---------20:12----------
right the only person that's going to be


---------20:14----------
there i don't know


---------20:15----------
does that make any sense like i feel


---------20:16----------
like i need to be ahead of it because


---------20:18----------
the benefit of the doubt won't be the


---------20:19----------
only person the only person that's gonna


---------20:21----------
be there is who well me


---------20:25----------
how long have you felt that way


---------20:29----------
probably since like the bullying started


---------20:31----------
middle


---------20:33----------
i would i think that actually i you know


---------20:36----------
this this is going to sound really weird


---------20:40----------
but this is going to sound very weird


---------20:44----------
but i


---------20:44----------
almost i'm almost kind of


---------20:47----------
happy that i went through what i went


---------20:50----------
through in middle school in high school


---------20:52----------
no matter you know when i think back to


---------20:53----------
it if i told you the story i'd probably


---------20:54----------
tear up


---------20:55----------
but i'm kind of happy it wasn't the


---------20:57----------
other way around i think it was the


---------20:59----------
other way around if


---------20:59----------
i just either lived a normal one or i


---------21:01----------
was accepted


---------21:03----------
i wouldn't be who i am today and i


---------21:06----------
wouldn't have the confidence as i do


---------21:09----------
right because i don't know


---------21:14----------
does that make any sense yeah i i think


---------21:17----------
sort of


---------21:18----------
i i think it makes a lot of sense that


---------21:21----------
i think a lot of people myself included


---------21:23----------
feel like our challenges and our


---------21:25----------
difficulties


---------21:26----------
are what make us who we are today which


---------21:28----------
i think it's really hard for people to


---------21:30----------
understand while you're in the middle of


---------21:31----------
it


---------21:32----------
right like i remember when i was 18 or


---------21:35----------
19


---------21:36----------
and trying really hard to get a


---------21:38----------
girlfriend and all i wanted


---------21:40----------
more than anything else in the world


---------21:44----------
a girlfriend and at the same time i


---------21:48----------
think that that was a really


---------21:49----------
transformative and important period for


---------21:51----------
me that allowed me to then engage


---------21:53----------
in you know healthier relationships down


---------21:56----------
the road


---------21:57----------
because i had to learn a lot about


---------21:58----------
myself and like what


---------22:02----------
just just how bad i was with women


---------22:06----------
and that's how you learn right oh 100


---------22:09----------
believe me


---------22:10----------
and and so that's that's just part of it


---------22:14----------
um and so i can understand where you're


---------22:15----------
coming from at the same time it's it's


---------22:17----------
hard to really


---------22:18----------
fully understand because what i'm


---------22:20----------
hearing from you is that there are some


---------22:22----------
very formative and important experiences


---------22:24----------
that you're actually kind of skipping


---------22:26----------
over


---------22:27----------
right so you'll give us a lot of


---------22:28----------
conclusions but i i don't really know


---------22:30----------
the story so you kind of said you


---------22:32----------
confronted your bully


---------22:34----------
and then what came out dot dot dot was


---------22:36----------
that essentially it sounds like they


---------22:38----------
were intimidated by you


---------22:41----------
and and so so that i mean you you keep


---------22:44----------
on referencing middle school and you


---------22:46----------
kind of


---------22:47----------
jump to the end of the story like but


---------22:49----------
it's hard to really


---------22:51----------
fully understand what you mean because


---------22:52----------
you're kind of glossing over like the


---------22:54----------
beginning in the middle well


---------22:55----------
it's because i i wanted to save you the


---------22:59----------
i


---------23:02----------
um okay so by no means do i


---------23:06----------
so what i'm going to say next by no


---------23:07----------
means am i meaning to


---------23:10----------
say since everyone now has a story that


---------23:13----------
all of them don't mean much anymore or


---------23:15----------
you know i'll just say i just wanted to


---------23:17----------
skip through because i feel like


---------23:19----------
these days


---------23:23----------
see these these are the takes that i say


---------23:25----------
that i think also attribute


---------23:28----------
they attribute to it so like it's not


---------23:30----------
entirely this passive thing that


---------23:32----------
i'm that that isn't my fault


---------23:35----------
some like takes they


---------23:38----------
take so like my perspective


---------23:41----------
yeah my perspective on so okay the


---------23:43----------
reason the reason i wanted to skip and


---------23:45----------
get to the conclusion is because


---------23:51----------
okay this is gonna be a hot take and


---------23:54----------
this is exactly


---------23:55----------
what gets me in trouble so i will take


---------23:57----------
responsibility for this completely


---------23:58----------
but i wanted to skip through it


---------24:02----------
because i feel like every story nowadays


---------24:05----------
starts with uh i was bullied


---------24:09----------
right and


---------24:12----------
from my experience in my school now i


---------24:16----------
know there's millions of schools


---------24:17----------
everywhere but for my husband's school


---------24:19----------
the bullied was a very small percentage


---------24:22----------
and we all knew each other all from


---------24:23----------
different groups but we all had


---------24:26----------
a spot it was almost like a movie like


---------24:27----------
an action superhero movie where


---------24:30----------
we came together in a bathroom and we


---------24:33----------
in public we weren't friends but in


---------24:34----------
private we had like consoling each other


---------24:37----------
what's the word is a consolidated consul


---------24:38----------
whatever right


---------24:40----------
so i know that statistically based on


---------24:42----------
what i see


---------24:43----------
when i talk to other people that share


---------24:44----------
the same experiences that


---------24:47----------
every single individual that's saying


---------24:49----------
that now it can't be the case so now i


---------24:51----------
just feel like it's like


---------24:52----------
this cheap thing to say where i was


---------24:54----------
bullied so instead of going through the


---------24:55----------
entire story


---------24:57----------
i just wanted to skip i just want to


---------24:58----------
start with you know that and then skip


---------25:00----------
to the conclusion to what i learned from


---------25:01----------
it and what i gained from it and that's


---------25:03----------
it


---------25:03----------
i don't want to like waste people's time


---------25:06----------
and telling a story that they've heard a


---------25:08----------
million times from it


---------25:09----------
it just seems like the same i don't know


---------25:10----------
does that make any sense i think it just


---------25:13----------
make sense i just


---------25:14----------
disagree so i i think i think the


---------25:17----------
conclusion


---------25:18----------
i mean someone can hear the conclusion


---------25:20----------
but i don't think that's what really


---------25:22----------
helps someone understand


---------25:24----------
okay i think understanding comes from


---------25:25----------
the story and you say like oh


---------25:27----------
like just because everyone else is


---------25:29----------
bullied like i think that's kind of


---------25:30----------
important right everyone has


---------25:32----------
their story to tell you're right


---------25:34----------
completely


---------25:35----------
um okay then i'll say i just did i just


---------25:38----------
okay there's a certain there's like


---------25:41----------
certain things i try


---------25:42----------
to stay away from why


---------25:47----------
okay so for example i'll give you an


---------25:48----------
example to what i mean by this because i


---------25:49----------
can't get it into words and it sounds


---------25:51----------
really bad


---------25:52----------
so for example um


---------25:55----------
with like my with my bipolar stuff right


---------25:58----------
it's it's a very new thing like some


---------26:01----------
some individuals in my community knew


---------26:02----------
about this five six years ago


---------26:04----------
but it's a very like new thing that a


---------26:07----------
lot of people don't know about


---------26:08----------
because i was raised in an era where


---------26:12----------
even though you have this and even


---------26:15----------
though it may be responsible for


---------26:17----------
some of the ways you may treat people


---------26:19----------
you still have to take responsibility


---------26:21----------
for it and never should you


---------26:23----------
never should it come out of your mouth


---------26:24----------
that oh i oh you did this terrible thing


---------26:27----------
oh well i bipolar that's why so either


---------26:29----------
accept it


---------26:30----------
take it or don't talk to me like i i've


---------26:32----------
been taught


---------26:33----------
not to do that take responsibility right


---------26:36----------
look inside and


---------26:37----------
find a better way to manage it instead


---------26:39----------
of crutching on this excuse that i have


---------26:40----------
this


---------26:41----------
so since i'm brought up that way i never


---------26:43----------
bring that up i try not to i feel like


---------26:45----------
blaming it on it


---------26:46----------
is isn't something for others if i want


---------26:49----------
to if i know it's that then i have to


---------26:51----------
work that much harder


---------26:52----------
around people to make that work it's not


---------26:54----------
that they have to work harder to make it


---------26:55----------
work i need to work harder


---------26:57----------
knowing that i have that so i always


---------26:58----------
raise them this way whereas i feel like


---------27:00----------
most people these days are raising the


---------27:01----------
other way where others if they want to


---------27:03----------
be in the presence of greatness tyler


---------27:04----------
they need to work around my


---------27:06----------
bipolar and they need to do better right


---------27:08----------
i'm i was i was


---------27:09----------
born i was raised the opposite yeah i


---------27:11----------
need to do better don't crush on it


---------27:12----------
don't use it as excuse right


---------27:14----------
so because of these things i don't have


---------27:17----------
this


---------27:17----------
like i feel like when i talk about a


---------27:20----------
bullied experience or i bring up a


---------27:22----------
mental


---------27:22----------
disorder i'm now pitying myself


---------27:25----------
and it's this very shameless cheap thing


---------27:27----------
to do and it's like this


---------27:29----------
week no i don't want to say week weeks


---------27:31----------
not i wasn't really use the words man


---------27:32----------
but i i just


---------27:35----------
you understand what i'm saying tyler


---------27:37----------
i'll say the words


---------27:38----------
so some people use mental illness as an


---------27:40----------
excuse for being [ __ ]


---------27:42----------
yes i'll say it


---------27:46----------
okay great so yeah i think it's a huge i


---------27:49----------
was raised to take responsibility


---------27:50----------
so i think people need to take


---------27:52----------
responsibility for their mental illness


---------27:53----------
i'll i'll say i'm a [ __ ] psychiatrist


---------27:56----------
my job is to help people take


---------27:58----------
responsibility for the things that like


---------28:00----------
hold them back


---------28:03----------
that's why i feel bad telling a bull so


---------28:05----------
i bring that example up because


---------28:08----------
when i give the story i feel like people


---------28:10----------
aren't


---------28:11----------
giving it the bully story they're not


---------28:13----------
giving the story of oh i was bullied


---------28:16----------
as a way to explain i've been through


---------28:18----------
that i understand you because i


---------28:20----------
understand me it shaped


---------28:22----------
me in this way i went through this i get


---------28:24----------
it people bring that story up


---------28:26----------
as a ticket out as a pity


---------28:29----------
so i i try to skip that story because


---------28:30----------
that's the way it's perceived by mostly


---------28:32----------
but let me explain something to tyler


---------28:34----------
this is exactly why you need to tell a


---------28:36----------
story


---------28:39----------
because there's a there's a narrative


---------28:41----------
which i agree with by the way


---------28:43----------
of absolving people of individual


---------28:45----------
responsibility because of certain things


---------28:47----------
that happened to them


---------28:49----------
and i think some of that is fair like


---------28:50----------
don't get me wrong so like i have a


---------28:52----------
policy where like


---------28:53----------
you know if i'm seeing a patient i need


---------28:55----------
a 24-hour notice for a cancellation


---------28:58----------
otherwise like they get billed for it


---------29:00----------
you know


---------29:01----------
and and so but there are some exceptions


---------29:03----------
that i make for that right so if you're


---------29:05----------
like


---------29:05----------
actively in a depressive episode that


---------29:07----------
was not there


---------29:08----------
a day or two ago and you miss your


---------29:11----------
appointment for reasons for your health


---------29:13----------
i won't bill you for it so i certainly


---------29:16----------
make allowances


---------29:18----------
but what i try really hard not to do


---------29:21----------
is to let people use their illness as an


---------29:24----------
excuse to not grow


---------29:26----------
as a person because i don't think that


---------29:28----------
actually helps them i'm here to help


---------29:30----------
them


---------29:31----------
not to cater to a narrative that keeps


---------29:35----------
them


---------29:35----------
in place and sometimes that means giving


---------29:39----------
people allowances


---------29:40----------
and sometimes it doesn't you know so


---------29:43----------
basically what i do when a patient


---------29:44----------
doesn't show up for an appointment


---------29:47----------
i'll ask them the next week like hey


---------29:50----------
what happened


---------29:51----------
do you have a good excuse and then if


---------29:53----------
they say yes


---------29:55----------
won't bill them so be it i trust you if


---------29:58----------
the depression got too much


---------30:00----------
and you couldn't even email me no big


---------30:02----------
deal


---------30:03----------
i'm glad you showed up this week but


---------30:06----------
it's also like


---------30:08----------
did you just stay up too late playing


---------30:10----------
video games


---------30:11----------
and not wake up on time


---------30:15----------
if so then you don't get to use your


---------30:17----------
depression as a as a pass


---------30:20----------
and i do see this i mean i hate to say


---------30:21----------
it but i see it a lot where


---------30:23----------
you know there's even there's even a


---------30:25----------
term for it in in the medical field


---------30:27----------
which is something called


---------30:28----------
secondary gain so it's when someone uses


---------30:32----------
their


---------30:32----------
illness to like get something and we


---------30:35----------
know that people people


---------30:36----------
have been doing this since the beginning


---------30:38----------
of psychiatry as a field


---------30:41----------
and i mean the really tricky thing is


---------30:42----------
for some people they use it as an excuse


---------30:45----------
and for some people it's actually an


---------30:46----------
impairment and to be honest for


---------30:49----------
people who use it as an excuse there's a


---------30:51----------
really fascinating


---------30:52----------
statistic so there's this thing called a


---------30:54----------
pseudo-seizure


---------30:55----------
which is a fake seizure it's not really


---------30:57----------
a fake it's just a non-epileptic seer


---------31:00----------
so it's like when someone acts like


---------31:01----------
they're sort of having a seizure but


---------31:03----------
they're not


---------31:04----------
actually like there's nothing going on


---------31:05----------
in their brain in terms of like


---------31:06----------
electrical activity that would cause a


---------31:08----------
seizure


---------31:08----------
the really interesting thing is that


---------31:10----------
people who it's almost like a it's


---------31:12----------
called a psychogenic seizure


---------31:13----------
some people think about it like a fake


---------31:15----------
seizure although i think that's a little


---------31:16----------
bit


---------31:18----------
unfair but it's not a seizure resulting


---------31:21----------
from like


---------31:22----------
rampant electrical activity in your


---------31:24----------
brain


---------31:25----------
can you guess what percentage of people


---------31:28----------
who have psychogenic seizures


---------31:30----------
also have real seizures


---------31:38----------
this is the simplest question ever and


---------31:39----------
i'm overthinking it like usual sure


---------31:41----------
just toss out a number what percentage


---------31:44----------
of people who have quote unquote fake


---------31:46----------
seizures also have real seizures


---------31:49----------
zero nope it's about fifty percent


---------31:53----------
okay i was gonna say fifty first then a


---------31:55----------
hundred that then i cheated off chat


---------31:57----------
yeah don't listen to chat don't listen


---------32:00----------
to chat


---------32:00----------
so it's interesting because people who


---------32:02----------
actually exhibit


---------32:03----------
displays of psychogenic seizures half of


---------32:06----------
them have real seizures too


---------32:08----------
so something goes on in the mind where


---------32:10----------
like we sort of


---------32:12----------
recognize like like citing mental


---------32:14----------
illness has now become


---------32:16----------
what sometimes is viewed as an excuse


---------32:18----------
but i think really what that is


---------32:20----------
is it's like it's a way of people


---------32:23----------
it's a way of signaling like hey i need


---------32:25----------
help


---------32:26----------
or like i don't want you to judge me for


---------32:30----------
this


---------32:31----------
i feel bad about it but i don't want you


---------32:33----------
to judge me because i'm already judging


---------32:35----------
myself


---------32:36----------
that's what i really see a lot is that


---------32:38----------
people will cite mental illness when


---------32:40----------
they


---------32:40----------
can't it's almost a protective shield


---------32:44----------
for them against themselves because if


---------32:47----------
i'm a [ __ ] up


---------32:48----------
that's hard to deal with but if i cite


---------32:50----------
my mental illness then that's easier for


---------32:52----------
me to deal with


---------32:53----------
because then it's not my fault but i do


---------32:56----------
think sometimes people absolve


---------32:57----------
themselves of responsibility and i'm not


---------32:59----------
saying like i'm trying to be insensitive


---------33:00----------
to people with mental illness i mean i


---------33:02----------
like i just i think it genuinely holds


---------33:04----------
them back which is why like


---------33:06----------
you don't want to just you know say like


---------33:08----------
yeah man it's okay like you don't you


---------33:09----------
know you know


---------33:10----------
i trust them i tell them hey do you have


---------33:13----------
a good reason


---------33:14----------
is it really illness why you didn't show


---------33:16----------
up and if you say yes


---------33:17----------
i'm gonna choose to believe you but if


---------33:20----------
you just [ __ ] up like because if you


---------33:22----------
have mental illness you can [ __ ] up too


---------33:23----------
it doesn't make you imperfect it's not


---------33:25----------
like


---------33:26----------
when you get to [ __ ] up just like


---------33:27----------
everyone else does


---------33:29----------
not everything has to be because of your


---------33:30----------
depression


---------33:32----------
you can be a lazy [ __ ] and be


---------33:34----------
depressed and a lazy [ __ ] and not be


---------33:36----------
depressed


---------33:37----------
do i think the people with depression


---------33:39----------
deserve more compassion


---------33:41----------
no do they do i think they deserve more


---------33:45----------
allowance


---------33:46----------
sure


---------33:50----------
yeah i agree with that completely what


---------33:52----------
i'm saying


---------33:53----------
and i agree with everything you said i


---------33:55----------
think it applies to what i'm saying as


---------33:56----------
well and i i think to


---------33:57----------
take it one step further what i'm saying


---------33:59----------
is so


---------34:01----------
if something is a result of my bipolar


---------34:03----------
right i know it


---------34:04----------
is i was like


---------34:09----------
i will take the l for that right that's


---------34:12----------
what i'm trying to say so i'm not trying


---------34:13----------
to say like


---------34:15----------
yes and no yeah so so like just just a


---------34:17----------
thing about that so like train i


---------34:19----------
i respect where you're coming from and i


---------34:20----------
think that like you know just to be


---------34:22----------
clear


---------34:23----------
i think that if you have bipolar it's


---------34:25----------
your responsibility to manage it


---------34:28----------
and at this same time what i tend to do


---------34:32----------
is if you do everything that you can to


---------34:34----------
manage it


---------34:37----------
and it still doesn't sometimes get


---------34:39----------
managed that's not your fault


---------34:42----------
right so what i judge people for is not


---------34:44----------
what happens


---------34:46----------
i judge them for what they do


---------34:50----------
so if if someone shows up to my office


---------34:52----------
like every week and they're in treatment


---------34:53----------
they're taking medication like they're


---------34:55----------
supposed to or whatever


---------34:56----------
and then one week they don't show up


---------34:58----------
because they get depressed and they


---------34:59----------
can't get out of bed like that's not


---------35:00----------
their fault


---------35:03----------
i don't judge them for that i give them


---------35:05----------
an allowance for that


---------35:07----------
i like that and at the same time


---------35:11----------
if they're not showing up and doing


---------35:13----------
their work like i don't care whether


---------35:15----------
they


---------35:16----------
like you know they're allowed to miss


---------35:17----------
appointments the question is like are


---------35:18----------
they doing what they're they're supposed


---------35:20----------
to and they


---------35:20----------
do do they do it for the right reason if


---------35:22----------
the illness got the better of you that's


---------35:24----------
the way illness works you deserve a


---------35:26----------
break


---------35:27----------
right like we don't blame people for


---------35:29----------
getting the flu it's like [ __ ] you


---------35:31----------
you got the flu [ __ ] you you got


---------35:33----------
hospitalized for covid for a month


---------35:35----------
and you stood me up on our second date


---------35:37----------
it's like


---------35:38----------
f you know cut people some slack i will


---------35:40----------
i will say if you get the flu


---------35:41----------
hey stay at home yeah these guys keep


---------35:43----------
going they keep going in the gym


---------35:45----------
touching everything you know terrible no


---------35:47----------
but i completely agree with you


---------35:48----------
that that's actually very good that's a


---------35:50----------
good take a good example yeah and i i


---------35:51----------
think you know sometimes


---------35:52----------
there's also this interesting thing


---------35:54----------
train i don't know exactly what's going


---------35:55----------
on here but like you you seem to be


---------35:57----------
judged a lot


---------35:59----------
right so you're like you're trying not


---------36:00----------
to say these things which i think are


---------36:01----------
like important to say because i


---------36:03----------
genuinely think when people use mental


---------36:04----------
illness


---------36:05----------
is an excuse it doesn't


---------36:08----------
help them move forward is it a debuff


---------36:12----------
absolutely does it sometimes [ __ ] with


---------36:14----------
your life absolutely do you need more


---------36:16----------
support


---------36:17----------
do you deserve more support absolutely


---------36:20----------
and at the same time don't use it as an


---------36:22----------
excuse because it doesn't help


---------36:26----------
yeah i agree i completely agree with


---------36:28----------
that


---------36:29----------
also i think uh i i think


---------36:34----------
so in a perfect world everything you're


---------36:36----------
saying is completely right


---------36:39----------
the problem is


---------36:43----------
we live in a time right now not even now


---------36:46----------
always i think


---------36:47----------
i think it's just it's become more aware


---------36:50----------
and connected


---------36:51----------
because of technology in the internet


---------36:52----------
where we know what's going on


---------36:54----------
finally we now never aware it's not just


---------36:56----------
going on in my town it's going on


---------36:57----------
everywhere and it's this thing where


---------37:02----------
there's this impenetrable wall


---------37:05----------
right metaphorically speaking so that


---------37:08----------
wall


---------37:08----------
it used to be within each of us and what


---------37:11----------
that wall does is


---------37:13----------
let's say i'm late to your meeting i


---------37:15----------
know i can use that secondary bipolar


---------37:18----------
advantage and say oh it's my bipolar dr


---------37:20----------
k sorry i didn't mean to


---------37:21----------
be late it's the bipolar i'm so psyched


---------37:23----------
to reschedule right


---------37:24----------
now if you call me and say i don't think


---------37:26----------
it's the bipolar i think you're making


---------37:27----------
an excuse in using it


---------37:28----------
you know normally oh you know i'll


---------37:30----------
probably hang up on you say screw you


---------37:32----------
you're not my doctor anymore then i'll


---------37:33----------
go into bed and depending on how i'm


---------37:35----------
raised depending on


---------37:36----------
my morals values and how well i know


---------37:38----------
myself


---------37:39----------
eventually after two or three days of


---------37:40----------
pouting i'll realize holy [ __ ] he knows


---------37:42----------
me better than


---------37:44----------
i do i need to talk to him again call


---------37:46----------
you i apologize we see each other again


---------37:48----------
now in today's society with everything


---------37:49----------
being connected


---------37:51----------
that wall has fortified itself stronger


---------37:55----------
so now instead of having the time to sit


---------37:58----------
in your thoughts


---------37:59----------
knowing that that doctor that's called


---------38:00----------
you out on that is right


---------38:02----------
now you can find solace or whatever the


---------38:04----------
word is


---------38:05----------
in thousands of accounts that share the


---------38:08----------
similar experience that cannot handle


---------38:10----------
the truth that you gave them


---------38:12----------
and instead of facing it through


---------38:14----------
self-reflection


---------38:16----------
they find comfort in others that further


---------38:19----------
fuel their delusion that you are


---------38:22----------
wrong and you're an [ __ ] and you


---------38:24----------
don't respect mental illness and it is


---------38:26----------
their mental illness


---------38:27----------
that gets them away from everything and


---------38:28----------
it further pushes people down this


---------38:30----------
delusion this


---------38:31----------
whole and no one gets better and


---------38:34----------
everyone believes they have some


---------38:35----------
does this make any sense this is what


---------38:37----------
i've noticed in today's time


---------38:39----------
so everyone thinks they seek the truth


---------38:41----------
but what they really seek


---------38:43----------
is someone to tell them what they want


---------38:45----------
to hear and label it the truth


---------38:47----------
and that is why i think these truthful


---------38:49----------
scenarios that we're talking about sure


---------38:50----------
they're


---------38:51----------
they work in a perfect world but it's


---------38:53----------
not this world people


---------38:54----------
does that make any sense yeah so it


---------38:56----------
makes a lot of sense so here's what i


---------38:58----------
heard you say


---------38:59----------
that like when when you get called out


---------39:02----------
for your behavior


---------39:03----------
you go into what i would call the


---------39:05----------
waiting arms of the internet


---------39:07----------
you go and you pry to your mommy in


---------39:10----------
general right you're


---------39:11----------
you as general yeah yeah so yeah like


---------39:13----------
you go


---------39:14----------
these people me included


---------39:17----------
go into the waiting arms of the internet


---------39:20----------
where i post something on


---------39:21----------
reddit and then i post the story from my


---------39:24----------
perspective which is one perspective


---------39:27----------
and then it gets upvoted because it's


---------39:29----------
just one perspective


---------39:31----------
and you'll see this like a lot in and


---------39:33----------
you know these


---------39:34----------
these subreddits that are like they're


---------39:37----------
they're not they're very transparent


---------39:38----------
about it they're like this is what we're


---------39:39----------
about


---------39:40----------
you you tell the story from one way and


---------39:42----------
then you get upvoted and it makes you


---------39:44----------
feel like you're right


---------39:45----------
no one critically looks at your thoughts


---------39:47----------
no one critically asks what happened on


---------39:49----------
the other side


---------39:50----------
and so then you get vindication because


---------39:53----------
10 000 strangers on the internet agree


---------39:55----------
with you


---------39:56----------
the interesting thing train is that i


---------39:59----------
think the solution there


---------40:01----------
is so what people do is they look at the


---------40:04----------
internet and they look at the person


---------40:05----------
and they blame them and they say this is


---------40:07----------
bad that the internet should not be an


---------40:09----------
echo


---------40:10----------
chamber and that's fair the interesting


---------40:12----------
thing i think that that really i found


---------40:14----------
is is in a subtle point which is


---------40:16----------
something that i almost never do


---------40:18----------
so in the scenario you described you


---------40:20----------
said at some point dr k says


---------40:22----------
hey i think you're lying i think you


---------40:25----------
actually [ __ ] up and it's not your


---------40:27----------
your bipolar well like


---------40:28----------
yeah i cut to the chase yeah yeah i i


---------40:30----------
know but i i think i think it's


---------40:31----------
it's a good it's a good point because i


---------40:33----------
think this is really important


---------40:34----------
yeah so i think the key thing here is


---------40:37----------
that it is


---------40:38----------
not for the person outside to


---------40:41----------
judge whether something is an excuse or


---------40:44----------
not


---------40:46----------
it is for it so if my patient


---------40:49----------
says hey yeah sorry it's my bipolar


---------40:52----------
i choose to trust them because if i


---------40:56----------
don't trust them


---------40:57----------
what happens is exactly what you


---------40:58----------
described


---------41:00----------
so if i kind of attack them for their


---------41:03----------
mental illness they're going to go and


---------41:05----------
find some way to like mentally deal with


---------41:07----------
that so i think the interesting thing


---------41:09----------
i think this is this is where a lot of


---------41:10----------
people get i think stumble


---------41:12----------
is that i don't think mental illness


---------41:13----------
should be an excuse but at the same time


---------41:15----------
i do think there are far too many people


---------41:18----------
who


---------41:18----------
judge people with mental illness


---------41:22----------
as using as an excuse


---------41:25----------
i think it has to be the person


---------41:27----------
themselves like you're the one who has


---------41:29----------
to decide


---------41:30----------
whether your bipolar got the best of you


---------41:32----------
or you got the best of your bipolar


---------41:35----------
it can't be me it can't be other people


---------41:38----------
but


---------41:38----------
but here's the problem so


---------41:41----------
that only happens in my experience


---------41:44----------
with dealing with other people that have


---------41:46----------
issues in myself


---------41:47----------
in one of two ways one


---------41:50----------
either you're raised by a


---------41:54----------
you know intel emotionally intelligent


---------41:57----------
and you know


---------41:58----------
uh uh you know whatever the other one is


---------42:01----------
or


---------42:02----------
what is the eq iq what's iq either


---------42:05----------
you're raised by a good


---------42:06----------
a good set of parents that will teach


---------42:09----------
you this as you grow up


---------42:10----------
will what will help you self-reflect


---------42:12----------
will you know talk to you and open you


---------42:14----------
up and help you realize these things or


---------42:17----------
you learn it from experience because


---------42:20----------
of the way your parents raised you


---------42:22----------
because of the good set of morals they


---------42:24----------
instilled within you


---------42:25----------
whatever the case might be right i feel


---------42:27----------
like today


---------42:28----------
that's missing so what happens is


---------42:31----------
we're giving this benefit of doubt to


---------42:33----------
people


---------42:35----------
that i don't know if they were like it's


---------42:38----------
not and it's not their fault


---------42:41----------
it feels like there's a responsibility i


---------42:43----------
mean i guess i guess i'm kind of


---------42:44----------
i'm talking way too general i guess i


---------42:46----------
don't have enough sample size but


---------42:47----------
it seems like the methodology of


---------42:51----------
raising has like changed it feels like


---------42:54----------
things are bulldozed more so than uh


---------42:57----------
like parents are bulldozing for their


---------42:58----------
children more so than like


---------43:00----------
you know occasionally scooping with a


---------43:02----------
shovel you know some [ __ ] out of the way


---------43:04----------
it seems like it's a bulldoze miles and


---------43:05----------
miles ahead


---------43:06----------
right and what this causes is this lack


---------43:10----------
of accountability and responsibility


---------43:12----------
which comes from that self-reflection so


---------43:14----------
instead of self-reflecting instead of


---------43:15----------
laying in bed and feeling guilty


---------43:17----------
that guilt is not there so when you find


---------43:20----------
comfort in finding others on the


---------43:21----------
internet that have gone through what


---------43:22----------
you've gone through


---------43:24----------
it's that's the problem you you don't


---------43:26----------
you're not


---------43:27----------
seeing it ever at any point as wrong and


---------43:29----------
learning from it so when you're giving


---------43:30----------
the benefit of the doubt it's not


---------43:31----------
actually teaching them anything


---------43:33----------
it's it's does this make any sense this


---------43:35----------
is what i've noticed yeah


---------43:36----------
uh just from observing does this make


---------43:38----------
any sense yeah i i think it makes a lot


---------43:40----------
of sense training and i find myself


---------43:41----------
wondering i think that interestingly


---------43:43----------
enough i think the most illustrative


---------43:44----------
question then is how were you raised


---------43:47----------
so instead of making general talking


---------43:49----------
about generalities and commenting on


---------43:50----------
what you


---------43:51----------
see true show us


---------43:56----------
right so you have a unique opportunity


---------43:58----------
here that you have an


---------43:59----------
opportunity so you see something


---------44:03----------
we see something so show us


---------44:07----------
show us something different how were you


---------44:08----------
raised


---------44:12----------
okay so should we start excuse me i'm so


---------44:16----------
sorry should we start with


---------44:18----------
how i was raised or we go back to the


---------44:20----------
bully story and finish that fully


---------44:22----------
first let's start i mean we're talking


---------44:24----------
about how people get raised so how did


---------44:25----------
you get raised


---------44:27----------
okay before we start that can i use the


---------44:29----------
restroom sure real quick two seconds


---------44:31----------
i'll be like i'll be like


---------44:32----------
35 to 45 maybe 50 seconds


---------44:35----------
maybe even less actually 20 seconds i


---------44:37----------
don't know i'll run okay


---------44:38----------
i'll be quick and i'll wash my hands


---------44:40----------
i'll be right back okay


---------44:43----------
hector the [ __ ] is this conversation


---------44:47----------
either he's got urinary tension from the


---------44:49----------
nyquil or he's washing his hands real


---------44:51----------
good


---------44:52----------
or a number one turned into a number two


---------44:57----------
can you hear me train are you listening


---------45:06----------
hey man yeah i was listening but anyways


---------45:10----------
sorry i was juicing up but anyways um so


---------45:16----------
yeah last time no yeah i think i think i


---------45:19----------
deviated septum they meant


---------45:20----------
uh the breathing technique you taught me


---------45:22----------
bro do you have a deviated septum


---------45:24----------
i don't know okay my nose my nose is


---------45:26----------
huge like


---------45:27----------
there's no way i get a deviated system


---------45:28----------
septum i mean look at these things


---------45:30----------
i'm telling you these things so in high


---------45:32----------
school you know i played soccer and


---------45:34----------
i was one of the fastest and i truly


---------45:36----------
believe this sounds like a memeing or


---------45:37----------
making into a joke i


---------45:38----------
i honest to god believe that these these


---------45:41----------
huge nostrils


---------45:43----------
which by the way my my dad's friend


---------45:45----------
which i love used to


---------45:46----------
joke and say that my nostrils are so big


---------45:49----------
the shape of my finger


---------45:50----------
because i he he made this joke oh do you


---------45:52----------
pick your nose in private and your nose


---------45:54----------
shaped around your finger


---------45:55----------
blah blah but i think my nostrils


---------45:57----------
actually


---------45:59----------
give me the oxygen intake while i'm


---------46:01----------
running to perform the speeds that i do


---------46:03----------
does that make any sense


---------46:04----------
yeah yeah i mean breathing through your


---------46:07----------
nose when you're running


---------46:09----------
i don't know actually yeah


---------46:13----------
i breathe through the nose and i breathe


---------46:14----------
out of mouth i think okay


---------46:18----------
i think holy [ __ ] that's a good question


---------46:20----------
wow


---------46:21----------
i should think about that next time i do


---------46:22----------
that i haven't ran for like two years


---------46:25----------
um so


---------46:29----------
anyway so you're so yeah tell me about


---------46:31----------
your parents


---------46:35----------
so here's the crazy part


---------46:39----------
my parents they're happily married


---------46:44----------
and for a long time i don't know how


---------46:46----------
long 40 years 20 30 years something like


---------46:47----------
that


---------46:49----------
but and they're that they're total


---------46:52----------
opposites


---------46:52----------
but they find like a strong connection


---------46:56----------
through that so my mom is


---------47:00----------
very my mom is very like conservative


---------47:03----------
not politically just like as far as like


---------47:05----------
not politically conservative she's


---------47:07----------
she's a democrat and she's like she


---------47:09----------
loves bernie and stuff but


---------47:10----------
my mom is conservative when it comes to


---------47:13----------
like you know


---------47:14----------
crazy stuff right so she's like


---------47:19----------
how do i explain conservative like more


---------47:21----------
socially right like so like she doesn't


---------47:23----------
she's


---------47:24----------
like so my mom is more like she's like


---------47:27----------
proper


---------47:29----------
classy you know any


---------47:32----------
any talk of like like i don't even feel


---------47:34----------
awkward saying that mixing two words


---------47:36----------
together sex


---------47:37----------
you know because like that stuff it's


---------47:38----------
like you know


---------47:40----------
you know right yeah just she's just


---------47:44----------
proper proper but she's not proper in


---------47:46----------
like that


---------47:47----------
in that way that you see in movies where


---------47:49----------
like you know you know


---------47:51----------
the house and the prairie where the


---------47:53----------
woman walks you know it's not like that


---------47:54----------
she's very like


---------47:55----------
loose and cool and she's very social and


---------47:59----------
but for her it's very


---------48:02----------
it's go with the flow you know it's go


---------48:05----------
where the wind takes you


---------48:06----------
and you know she's a chemical engineer


---------48:09----------
and


---------48:10----------
she's very smart and she's very just


---------48:13----------
easy going and very cool


---------48:14----------
and she's creative and very loving and


---------48:18----------
um sounds like you respect her a lot


---------48:22----------
i do i do and so that's my mom


---------48:25----------
my dad same thing but the opposite


---------48:29----------
i'll tell you the opposite is so the


---------48:30----------
opposite isn't like perspective and view


---------48:32----------
of life


---------48:33----------
my dad very outgoing like pretty much


---------48:36----------
my outgoing side where i can just joke


---------48:39----------
and talk about


---------48:40----------
anything and everything the moment we


---------48:41----------
meet comes from my dad my dad's very


---------48:44----------
social always making jokes


---------48:47----------
you know um very cool but my dad


---------48:50----------
he has a different clock he has a


---------48:53----------
different set of values right


---------48:55----------
everything for him is very objective


---------48:58----------
it's very precise


---------48:59----------
there's a routine you know he comes from


---------49:01----------
like a military


---------49:02----------
family so like you know he wakes up at


---------49:05----------
the same exact time


---------49:06----------
sleeps the same exact time you know beds


---------49:09----------
the bed is like perfectly like you know


---------49:11----------
corner tucked


---------49:12----------
everything down like everything is


---------49:14----------
there's a clock there's a time


---------49:16----------
never be late if you're late it gets


---------49:18----------
very upset there's no being late with


---------49:20----------
him


---------49:20----------
but my mom it's always being late right


---------49:22----------
my mom's always late my dad's never late


---------49:25----------
so in respect to how like it's lived my


---------49:28----------
dad's very like mathematical very


---------49:29----------
precise


---------49:30----------
strategical my mom is the exact opposite


---------49:32----------
of that


---------49:34----------
so i i i i


---------49:37----------
i like that that's why i have this very


---------49:40----------
so people can't understand when i tell


---------49:41----------
them i have two degrees and they watch


---------49:42----------
my stream


---------49:43----------
they can't understand how the train


---------49:45----------
wreck they watch


---------49:46----------
can possibly sit down in school and


---------49:50----------
finish two degrees but the way i was


---------49:52----------
raised is that there's a time and place


---------49:54----------
if you're streaming that's the time to


---------49:56----------
bring your social side


---------49:58----------
out have fun do whatever you want now if


---------50:01----------
streaming was school work


---------50:03----------
then that's where people would probably


---------50:04----------
understand how i got my degrees because


---------50:05----------
they would see a much more serious side


---------50:07----------
of me


---------50:08----------
that can sit down organize things


---------50:09----------
properly get things does that make sense


---------50:11----------
sure so when you say how are you you


---------50:14----------
were raised can you paint us a picture


---------50:15----------
so like what was it


---------50:17----------
like in your house like how did these


---------50:20----------
things manifest these differences


---------50:22----------
between your mom and your dad


---------50:29----------
damn it's like we need like seven


---------50:32----------
sessions to talk about that


---------50:33----------
um did you give any que like direct


---------50:37----------
i've never really talked about them like


---------50:38----------
that i don't know like questions


---------50:41----------
just ignite yeah sure so like his like


---------50:43----------
does anything come up


---------50:44----------
when you kind of think about when your


---------50:47----------
mom was your mom and your dad was your


---------50:49----------
dad and and you were kind of caught in


---------50:50----------
the middle


---------50:51----------
or you know how you responded to like


---------50:54----------
their differential views on time or


---------50:56----------
studying or whatever


---------50:57----------
or how were you taught that like there's


---------50:59----------
a time to study


---------51:07----------
um


---------51:14----------
you know uh


---------51:18----------
i'm i'm pretty sure the same way that


---------51:21----------
you were


---------51:22----------
taught this way to i you know i was told


---------51:25----------
to


---------51:25----------
you know i was told to study you know


---------51:26----------
i'd say you know i would say i


---------51:28----------
i finished my homework you know my dad


---------51:31----------
would look at me he's like


---------51:32----------
you know you give me that little eye you


---------51:33----------
know everyone knows the eye right


---------51:36----------
and at that point i have that feeling


---------51:38----------
coming to my stomach of aw


---------51:39----------
[ __ ] right which


---------51:42----------
pretty much you know insert the larry


---------51:44----------
david


---------51:46----------
and then maybe skip five minutes and i'm


---------51:48----------
sitting at the table doing my homework


---------51:49----------
while the modem's in their room


---------51:51----------
right it's gone the router's gone right


---------51:53----------
no more internet


---------51:54----------
so you know um


---------51:58----------
pretty much rinse repeat of that sure um


---------52:02----------
you know i was very you know i was very


---------52:04----------
blessed


---------52:06----------
because my parents put a lot of time


---------52:07----------
into me you know my dad


---------52:10----------
so you know my parents came from iran


---------52:15----------
uh during the revolution or whatever the


---------52:16----------
hell it's called right they came


---------52:18----------
with having nothing at all and my dad


---------52:21----------
had


---------52:21----------
uh four other siblings so five all


---------52:25----------
together including himself


---------52:27----------
and he's not the oldest i think he's the


---------52:30----------
second oldest


---------52:31----------
but his role was he took care of


---------52:34----------
everybody so when they came they had no


---------52:36----------
money he had to work two jobs


---------52:39----------
while going to school and he ended up


---------52:42----------
finishing school in three years instead


---------52:43----------
of four


---------52:44----------
university while working two jobs and


---------52:47----------
supporting his two sisters and brother


---------52:51----------
um he came out of school um got his


---------52:54----------
masters


---------52:55----------
and he started working and


---------52:58----------
that's when travel started that's when


---------53:00----------
you know my parents had me


---------53:02----------
then i lived in korea for three years


---------53:03----------
because my dad's the company i worked


---------53:05----------
for was in korea


---------53:07----------
and um


---------53:10----------
he pretty much he puts everyone ahead of


---------53:13----------
himself


---------53:14----------
right and everyone everyone


---------53:17----------
and you know that put a lot of stress to


---------53:19----------
my mom because she was always worried


---------53:21----------
about him


---------53:22----------
and then that put a stress on me because


---------53:24----------
if i misbehave that put stress into him


---------53:26----------
and my mom would cry because she thought


---------53:27----------
that he would


---------53:28----------
you know you know he would ex


---------53:32----------
pass or you know whatever because of the


---------53:33----------
stress


---------53:35----------
so i tried my best to do you know what i


---------53:37----------
was told but you know i was a kid and i


---------53:38----------
was stupid so


---------53:41----------
uh no no like no no he's alive i don't


---------53:43----------
know what i'm saying is like yeah she


---------53:44----------
thought the stress would eventually like


---------53:46----------
you know the stress of doing misbehaving


---------53:47----------
would do him in you know the stress of


---------53:49----------
everything going on and i was a kid i


---------53:51----------
was dumb i didn't want to do homework i


---------53:52----------
didn't want to learn i don't want to do


---------53:53----------
this right i was a typical kid right i


---------53:55----------
just wanted to play games


---------53:56----------
and not do any work and not do this


---------53:58----------
don't do that so


---------53:59----------
you know um so my dad so


---------54:02----------
i'll get to the part to what stressed


---------54:03----------
him out so my dad really care he loves


---------54:05----------
me cares about me and every night


---------54:08----------
so he would go to work you know from


---------54:10----------
like he'd leave 5 a.m come home you know


---------54:12----------
8 p.m you know and right there he'd


---------54:16----------
you know dr get dressed for the home


---------54:18----------
attire


---------54:19----------
and then from right that point that


---------54:21----------
point wouldn't even eat that point he


---------54:22----------
would sit down with me and he would


---------54:23----------
teach me math


---------54:24----------
right he would teach me from math from


---------54:26----------
scratch and we'd sit there until like 2


---------54:27----------
3 a.m and then he sleeps like two three


---------54:29----------
hours go to work rinse with every day


---------54:31----------
he was hands-on with me every day


---------54:32----------
teaching me he was just so good at these


---------54:34----------
things


---------54:35----------
and i you know in the beginning stages i


---------54:37----------
didn't want to sit down and put time in


---------54:38----------
right i didn't want to apply myself i


---------54:39----------
was kind of everywhere


---------54:41----------
so he put a lot of time with me and i


---------54:42----------
love him for that to this day i'm very


---------54:43----------
thankful he always put himself ahead


---------54:45----------
you know um if there was something he


---------54:47----------
could you know


---------54:49----------
eventually got to a point through his


---------54:50----------
hard work that we were above average as


---------54:53----------
far as income goes and things were


---------54:54----------
you know i'm very blessed but you know


---------54:56----------
in the beginning stage when i was


---------54:57----------
younger we weren't


---------54:58----------
so like if i wanted something i remember


---------55:00----------
like he would sacrifice you know a lot


---------55:01----------
of his own or like you know


---------55:02----------
if i was hungry but there wasn't any


---------55:04----------
food he would give me his and


---------55:06----------
all these different things like taught


---------55:07----------
me to you know


---------55:09----------
give you know take care of others before


---------55:12----------
i take care of myself


---------55:14----------
type of thing right and unfortunately in


---------55:16----------
america that's not the way it works in


---------55:18----------
america you take care of yourself and


---------55:19----------
then if you have a little extra maybe


---------55:21----------
you give a little extra to others if you


---------55:22----------
can you take care of yourself right so


---------55:24----------
this really i got taken advantage a lot


---------55:27----------
for this but i still haven't changed


---------55:28----------
i'm still that person i still do that


---------55:30----------
but


---------55:33----------
what i'm trying to say is


---------55:38----------
i don't know what i'm trying to say what


---------55:39----------
i'm trying to say is they're very good


---------55:40----------
parents and i love them


---------55:41----------
so [ __ ] much yeah they're very like


---------55:43----------
very very


---------55:44----------
very good parents they taught me


---------55:45----------
everything i know it was two different


---------55:47----------
perspectives i'd go to i'd get two


---------55:49----------
different responses


---------55:50----------
you know on some things like you know uh


---------55:53----------
social things my dad would give me


---------55:57----------
leeway he would understand and my mom


---------56:00----------
wouldn't she'd be pissed


---------56:02----------
because she was more proper so an


---------56:04----------
example if i were to go to a party with


---------56:06----------
my friends


---------56:07----------
you know and i wouldn't come home that


---------56:09----------
night and my parents are


---------56:11----------
sick worried about me maybe on the phone


---------56:12----------
with the cops i'd like oh it's all good


---------56:14----------
i know


---------56:15----------
you know my man good stuff i know what


---------56:16----------
you're doing right my mom's like wow why


---------56:18----------
are you there right


---------56:19----------
now let's say i get a c on my paper


---------56:23----------
i was like oh it's okay just study my


---------56:25----------
dad's like


---------56:26----------
ah right so when it came to like


---------56:28----------
academics when it came to


---------56:30----------
school when it comes to like [ __ ] that


---------56:31----------
like you you need to get done because


---------56:33----------
the 40 year old me is going to regret


---------56:34----------
the 15 year old me not doing it


---------56:36----------
my dad's gonna be upset you know when it


---------56:38----------
comes to


---------56:39----------
getting into the wrong crowd of friends


---------56:41----------
you know partying


---------56:42----------
drinking hanging out the wrong girl that


---------56:44----------
seems like she's kind of you know


---------56:46----------
you know maybe i'm out there yeah my


---------56:48----------
mom's gonna be upset right


---------56:49----------
so it was these different perspectives


---------56:51----------
were it was just crazy so


---------56:52----------
i got yeah so yeah it sounds like your


---------56:55----------
parents made a lot of sacrifices for you


---------56:58----------
they did they a lot a lot and still do a


---------57:01----------
lot


---------57:01----------
just everything everything that it was


---------57:05----------
yeah they made a lot of sacrifices and


---------57:11----------
a yeah yeah they're very good parents


---------57:13----------
very very very good parents


---------57:16----------
yeah so it's kind of scary like


---------57:20----------
i mean did you guys actually grow up in


---------57:21----------
a household where sometimes there wasn't


---------57:23----------
enough food to go around


---------57:25----------
no it wasn't it wasn't like that


---------57:31----------
but like it wasn't like that


---------57:36----------
right but like if there was none that


---------57:39----------
night


---------57:40----------
because like there was just nothing that


---------57:41----------
night there was like one food made


---------57:43----------
then like he would give me his but then


---------57:45----------
i would like cry and well


---------57:46----------
you know i wouldn't want it but then he


---------57:48----------
would say he's not eating anymore then


---------57:49----------
i'd end up eating it but i ended up


---------57:50----------
crying and then


---------57:51----------
so i didn't i wanted him to eat but he


---------57:52----------
just like go ahead and he would just


---------57:54----------
pretty much my dad was like you know he


---------57:57----------
would just


---------57:58----------
pretend he didn't want it or and this


---------58:00----------
this applies to everything


---------58:01----------
right so like he did i i don't know does


---------58:04----------
that make sense now it wasn't like that


---------58:05----------
it wasn't like we were dirt broke coin


---------58:06----------
house house like we were good my dad


---------58:08----------
sacrificed a lot he was very successful


---------58:09----------
yeah


---------58:10----------
you know i was blessed in that way right


---------58:12----------
but


---------58:13----------
do you remember why you cried


---------58:16----------
well


---------58:21----------
okay let's see here


---------58:24----------
i think


---------58:34----------
hmm


---------58:37----------
i don't let me think about this


---------58:46----------
how do we start here how do we start


---------58:48----------
here okay


---------58:51----------
let's go to birthdays okay


---------58:54----------
so


---------58:58----------
there is a reason why i try my best and


---------59:04----------
i'm sure


---------59:04----------
everyone can vouch for this like all my


---------59:06----------
all my friends


---------59:07----------
during all my friends birthdays on


---------59:09----------
twitch i try to get them all presents


---------59:12----------
so i will go around on each of the


---------59:14----------
birthdays and i'll whether it's just


---------59:16----------
money subs or something i always need to


---------59:18----------
get them a present


---------59:21----------
and as far as like gifting subs you know


---------59:23----------
i'm like i'm number two gifter on twitch


---------59:25----------
for subs and


---------59:25----------
all these other things this like stems


---------59:28----------
from one


---------59:29----------
thing from my childhood one thing and


---------59:32----------
everything


---------59:32----------
from that stems from this


---------59:36----------
so i need to breathe here because this


---------59:37----------
is


---------59:39----------
i've told a story twice and i've cried


---------59:40----------
both times so give me a sec here


---------59:44----------
so


---------59:46----------
so during birthdays or christmas


---------59:49----------
or any holiday or event where i would


---------59:52----------
get a present


---------59:53----------
or presents for my parents i would


---------59:56----------
always cry


---------59:57----------
and here's why so there's two two things


---------60:02----------
first


---------60:05----------
since i was never really the popular kid


---------60:07----------
and i was never really the cool kid that


---------60:08----------
you know had


---------60:09----------
a lot of friends which i think leads to


---------60:12----------
another thing where i feel like i need


---------60:13----------
everyone to like me now but anyways


---------60:15----------
you know birthdays wouldn't be what you


---------60:19----------
see in like tv series and movies for


---------60:20----------
everybody


---------60:21----------
it was birthdays would be like me and


---------60:23----------
maybe like a couple cousins


---------60:24----------
and like that's it right and my parents


---------60:27----------
would always try to like you know


---------60:28----------
pretend like you know


---------60:30----------
i you know i had these friends and so


---------60:32----------
they would like get presents and like


---------60:33----------
you know uh uh you know you know


---------60:36----------
give them to me on behalf of them or


---------60:37----------
whatever you know blah blah blah now


---------60:39----------
hold on


---------60:40----------
when you say blah blah does it it sounds


---------60:41----------
to me like your


---------60:43----------
parents attributed gifts


---------60:47----------
to friends that you didn't have yeah


---------60:51----------
so so


---------60:56----------
pretty much


---------60:59----------
so there's two parts of this the first


---------61:00----------
part is


---------61:11----------
okay so hmm the second part to the first


---------61:15----------
part


---------61:22----------
let me think about this


---------61:31----------
why does this require so much thought


---------61:35----------
because i i just need to collect my uh


---------61:40----------
my motions for a sec


---------61:50----------
so


---------61:52----------
there is a distinct feeling that i


---------61:54----------
remember


---------61:56----------
very clearly and very vividly and


---------62:02----------
it's the feeling


---------62:05----------
of knowing that my parents are going


---------62:08----------
above their means to fulfill


---------62:10----------
things that i wanted


---------62:17----------
and knowing they made the sacrifice


---------62:21----------
and there's a feeling of not of of


---------62:24----------
not having the friends at the parties


---------62:27----------
and not


---------62:28----------
having a lot of people


---------62:34----------
there is a there's this feeling i


---------62:36----------
remember


---------62:38----------
a deep deep pain loneliness a breaking


---------62:41----------
of like the heart as they would call it


---------62:44----------
and i guess i do what i do today


---------62:48----------
when i try to give so no one ever has to


---------62:51----------
feel that because i felt it because of a


---------62:54----------
cause and effect


---------62:55----------
of that so i don't want anyone to think


---------62:57----------
i've forgotten their birthday


---------62:59----------
right so i try to be there and give them


---------63:05----------
what i think i don't know does that make


---------63:07----------
any sense


---------63:09----------
yeah let me see if i understood you so


---------63:14----------
it sounds to me like you sort of


---------63:16----------
remember feeling lonely and also


---------63:20----------
in that same moment felt deeply loved


---------63:22----------
and appreciated


---------63:24----------
while you were feeling under appreciated


---------63:27----------
that your parents went above and beyond


---------63:29----------
to take away something


---------63:31----------
from you or protect you from something


---------63:35----------
and you sort of knew that they were


---------63:36----------
doing that that they got you all these


---------63:38----------
presents that maybe even they couldn't


---------63:40----------
quite afford


---------63:43----------
to protect you from feeling the way that


---------63:45----------
you did


---------63:46----------
and they didn't want you to feel that


---------63:48----------
way so they went out of their way


---------63:51----------
to try to protect you from those


---------63:54----------
feelings


---------63:56----------
make up for them kind of but i i hate


---------63:59----------
presents and i always hated presents


---------64:01----------
because i feel like so i so here's the


---------64:03----------
weird part for me it wasn't about the


---------64:05----------
presence i just


---------64:06----------
i just wanted people to be there to have


---------64:08----------
fun with


---------64:09----------
pres i never so i hate presents i hate


---------64:12----------
receiving stuff because i feel like i'm


---------64:14----------
not worthy of it


---------64:15----------
right i feel like i feel like i need to


---------64:19----------
do something good to receive a present


---------64:22----------
right so


---------64:22----------
when i get the prep so when i know my


---------64:24----------
parents are working very hard and they


---------64:25----------
give me a present


---------64:26----------
i i hate getting it like so i don't it's


---------64:29----------
not that i wanted presents it's that


---------64:31----------
i just wanted the friends but


---------64:37----------
since we're over the internet there's no


---------64:38----------
other way to sh uh i don't know i don't


---------64:41----------
yeah yes i guess but it's something so i


---------64:43----------
i i i've always hated


---------64:44----------
yeah go ahead so okay


---------64:48----------
thanks for sharing tyler so let's see if


---------64:50----------
we can unpack this a little bit does


---------64:52----------
that does that sound okay


---------64:55----------
do you mind if uh while you talk i i get


---------64:58----------
up real quick


---------64:58----------
i can hear my wireless headphones okay


---------65:00----------
unpack it so i can walk i just need to


---------65:02----------
collect my


---------65:04----------
collection i need to blow my nose in the


---------65:05----------
bathroom okay go


---------65:08----------
talk or do you need to see me it helps


---------65:10----------
if i see you it's awkward to talk to


---------65:12----------
and that's okay okay i'll be very fast i


---------65:13----------
just have one nose otherwise yeah take


---------65:15----------
your time man


---------65:15----------
i don't wanna start sniffling in the


---------65:16----------
camera and then it just becomes


---------65:18----------
disgusting trust me


---------65:22----------
train you seem very concerned it's


---------65:24----------
interesting right so on the one hand you


---------65:25----------
don't care about how you're perceived


---------65:27----------
but i think you own up to a lot of the


---------65:29----------
way that you're perceived


---------65:31----------
you kind of joke about your forehead and


---------65:34----------
at the same time


---------65:35----------
it also seems like you're very concerned


---------65:37----------
about how you're perceived


---------65:40----------
so no i'm actually talking to y'all


---------65:43----------
twitch chat i'm thinking out loud but i


---------65:45----------
know he can hear


---------65:47----------
i feel comfortable talking to you guys


---------65:49----------
it's just weird talking to train if he's


---------65:50----------
not there


---------65:54----------
so i do care i'm perceived 100 i do care


---------65:57----------
it's not that i don't care i do care i


---------65:59----------
think that says they don't care


---------66:01----------
yeah i do care


---------66:04----------
it's that since i've


---------66:09----------
taken a lot of criticism on how i'm


---------66:10----------
pursuing since i've taken a lot of


---------66:12----------
careers my whole life


---------66:13----------
i can handle it well so it seems like i


---------66:14----------
don't care or seems like i'm trying to


---------66:16----------
say i don't care i do care


---------66:18----------
right i can see that does that make


---------66:20----------
sense so yeah it makes sense yeah


---------66:21----------
so i do somewhere just when someone


---------66:24----------
describes their


---------66:25----------
forehead as an umbrella that protects


---------66:27----------
them from the rain


---------66:28----------
it implies that they're comfortable with


---------66:32----------
the way that they're perceived and the


---------66:34----------
way that people talk about them


---------66:37----------
right that's what it suggests and at the


---------66:39----------
same time i'm noticing that


---------66:41----------
it actually matters to you a lot i think


---------66:44----------
that there's


---------66:44----------
there's a lot of interesting


---------66:48----------
stuff for lack of a better term about


---------66:53----------
yeah so let's go back to the gift giving


---------66:54----------
for a second we'll go back


---------66:56----------
go ahead so so i mean what i'm hearing


---------66:59----------
you kind of say is that


---------67:00----------
you sort of don't feel sometimes like


---------67:02----------
you're worthy


---------67:03----------
of the gift and that too sort of makes


---------67:07----------
sense because


---------67:08----------
what i'm getting is that your parents


---------67:09----------
made a lot of sacrifices


---------67:12----------
to get you gifts to me


---------67:15----------
the gift was their sacrifice but i don't


---------67:17----------
think they thought that i understood at


---------67:19----------
that age that their sacrifice


---------67:21----------
was worth anything because i was young


---------67:22----------
and i thought gifts and toys were


---------67:24----------
everything i think they thought that but


---------67:25----------
i


---------67:25----------
at that age i saw their sacrifice and


---------67:27----------
every night their sacrifice would make


---------67:29----------
me cry every night


---------67:30----------
because i i wouldn't i would


---------67:34----------
for for how much they sacrifice why


---------67:35----------
would you die every night


---------67:38----------
because i saw what it was doing to like


---------67:39----------
their health i saw like i could


---------67:42----------
see my dad aging i could see my dad was


---------67:44----------
already doing so much


---------67:45----------
and i was not


---------67:48----------
i don't know that's why i would cry does


---------67:50----------
that make any sense


---------67:51----------
i'll try for many reasons but that's one


---------67:53----------
of them yeah yeah so


---------67:54----------
i so i them being my parents was gift


---------67:57----------
enough


---------67:58----------
but they didn't know that so when i'd


---------68:01----------
get a gift


---------68:02----------
i would always cry and i wouldn't want


---------68:04----------
to accept it but they couldn't


---------68:06----------
understand because they thought


---------68:07----------
i didn't know does that make any sense


---------68:10----------
so well they didn't know that i was


---------68:13----------
aware of the sacrifices they'd make


---------68:15----------
they didn't know that like i could like


---------68:18----------
overhear conversations of like things


---------68:19----------
they had like


---------68:20----------
you know if they were behind on things


---------68:22----------
but they would sacrifice that and put it


---------68:23----------
toward me and act like everything was


---------68:25----------
okay


---------68:25----------
i knew these things were going on but


---------68:28----------
they'd still do them


---------68:29----------
and they'd take the weight of the world


---------68:31----------
just to make me believe that everything


---------68:33----------
was okay but i knew everything was not


---------68:36----------
so it's that feeling that's what makes


---------68:40----------
me want


---------68:40----------
i i don't want people to feel that so


---------68:44----------
that's why like so for example i have


---------68:46----------
these like advice streams and i try to


---------68:47----------
like


---------68:48----------
i try to like you know i'll pay for like


---------68:51----------
psychiatric or psychology


---------68:52----------
like sessions i don't want them to feel


---------68:54----------
what i felt of


---------68:56----------
why do you think your parents did that


---------68:58----------
for you because they loved me


---------69:03----------
i don't know right i mean i think that's


---------69:06----------
a that's a good answer i think it's


---------69:07----------
certainly true


---------69:10----------
but i i wonder has it ever occurred to


---------69:12----------
you that the same thing that motivates


---------69:14----------
you to help other people


---------69:18----------
is what motivated your parents to do


---------69:20----------
that for you


---------69:24----------
yeah well it did because it wasn't only


---------69:26----------
me they did it for


---------69:28----------
i remember uh he would do it for a lot


---------69:30----------
of people like


---------69:31----------
so he coached my soccer team as well and


---------69:34----------
yeah


---------69:35----------
there was like yeah i'm actually that's


---------69:37----------
a tangent but yeah i mean so


---------69:38----------
so on a very simple sense it sounds like


---------69:41----------
you're trying to protect people from


---------69:43----------
the hurt that you experienced


---------69:48----------
yeah but the hurt is in a lot of places


---------69:50----------
we're just talking about one of them and


---------69:51----------
the other one i couldn't fully


---------69:53----------
embody into like i couldn't fully put


---------69:55----------
into words for the birthdays and the


---------69:57----------
holidays and like the friends i couldn't


---------69:59----------
that one wasn't coming out clearly but


---------70:00----------
yeah for this


---------70:01----------
one instance this is one of the many


---------70:04----------
that we can talk about but yeah


---------70:05----------
i guess yeah the second one was


---------70:08----------
something around loneliness


---------70:13----------
around loneliness that was tied to my


---------70:16----------
yeah yeah my parents would try to


---------70:20----------
yeah make me feel not and i just


---------70:22----------
wouldn't feel yeah


---------70:23----------
it ties into this they would sacrifice


---------70:25----------
more and more just to make me feel


---------70:28----------
you know i don't know it wasn't just all


---------70:29----------
gifts it was love and affection too but


---------70:31----------
i i don't know yeah yeah yes we'll just


---------70:32----------
say yes


---------70:34----------
it sounds like that they made a lot of


---------70:36----------
they tried to really


---------70:38----------
help you feel better and they


---------70:41----------
they did a lot of things behind the


---------70:42----------
scenes to create a particular kind of


---------70:44----------
experience for you


---------70:47----------
yeah what was it like to be able to see


---------70:50----------
backstage


---------70:53----------
it gave me a lot of perspective a lot of


---------70:54----------
character um


---------70:57----------
it it taught me to you know


---------71:02----------
it taught me that time and like quality


---------71:05----------
time is more important than


---------71:07----------
than money and that family is more


---------71:09----------
important than money and that


---------71:10----------
you know take just that kind of like


---------71:13----------
yeah i don't know it just top yeah i


---------71:16----------
guess


---------71:17----------
yeah i guess just


---------71:21----------
i don't know


---------71:24----------
i feel like i sk i feel like i couldn't


---------71:26----------
fully put into words what i wanted to


---------71:28----------
say and like we're like


---------71:29----------
six chapters in but chapters one two and


---------71:31----------
three i couldn't fill


---------71:32----------
fully for you i don't know does that


---------71:34----------
make any sense i think it does but i


---------71:36----------
think that's okay


---------71:37----------
i think sometimes you know there


---------71:40----------
sometimes you


---------71:41----------
you know much like a good book you


---------71:43----------
really figure out what was happening in


---------71:45----------
chapters one two and three


---------71:46----------
in chapter 25. true right a plot twist


---------71:50----------
puts everything into perspective so i


---------71:52----------
think that's okay okay


---------71:54----------
that makes me makes me feel better yeah


---------71:56----------
i mean i i think it's clear that your


---------71:58----------
feelings are com


---------71:59----------
complex and that there are many


---------72:02----------
different nuances to them


---------72:04----------
that there's a sense of appreciation


---------72:07----------
and also what sounds like some something


---------72:09----------
like a shade of guilt to be honest


---------72:12----------
that you know you recognize that they


---------72:14----------
were making a sacrifice and you


---------72:16----------
appreciate them for that


---------72:17----------
and there's also a certain sadness of


---------72:19----------
like


---------72:20----------
you know when your dad chooses to give


---------72:23----------
you his share of like


---------72:24----------
whatever has been made and like you end


---------72:26----------
up eating it like that's gotta


---------72:28----------
it's hard to receive the kindness


---------72:31----------
of another person who has to give


---------72:34----------
something up to give it


---------72:38----------
yes yes it can make you feel


---------72:42----------
not worthy yes


---------72:45----------
right because who is truly worthy of


---------72:47----------
that like i mean


---------72:48----------
your dad doesn't there's something about


---------72:51----------
that that's just horribly


---------72:52----------
unfair and you're kind of the recipient


---------72:55----------
of kindness which on the one hand is


---------72:58----------
good but like


---------72:59----------
not at such a cost


---------73:03----------
yes you know i mean that makes a lot of


---------73:06----------
sense to me


---------73:07----------
said it does no it does yes 100 does


---------73:11----------
yeah sometimes i think it's it's hard i


---------73:13----------
think the interesting thing tyler is


---------73:15----------
that


---------73:15----------
i'm not sure if that still carries over


---------73:18----------
to today


---------73:20----------
do you still feel like sometimes you're


---------73:22----------
not worthy of the kindness that you


---------73:24----------
receive


---------73:30----------
hmm


---------73:39----------
from my parents i would say


---------73:44----------
it's


---------73:50----------
for my parents yes it's not that


---------73:55----------
from my parents


---------74:00----------
i don't know if it's right now at this


---------74:02----------
stage in my life i don't know i don't


---------74:03----------
know if it's a worthiness it's more so


---------74:05----------
about


---------74:10----------
i don't know i mean i know my parents


---------74:12----------
are proud of me


---------74:14----------
tyler let me ask you something okay go


---------74:16----------
ahead


---------74:17----------
what could your dad have done


---------74:22----------
to


---------74:25----------
so so you understood that they made the


---------74:27----------
sacrifice you appreciated their


---------74:28----------
sacrifice


---------74:29----------
and at the same time you experienced


---------74:32----------
some degree of pain from that


---------74:34----------
does that make sense


---------74:38----------
to answer your question before the next


---------74:40----------
thing right here


---------74:42----------
i don't think there was anything that


---------74:44----------
they could have done differently i think


---------74:46----------
that the pain that i felt


---------74:50----------
was because i knew that that


---------74:54----------
is pure good and in and because


---------74:57----------
it's good what i felt


---------75:02----------
has made me do what he does unto me


---------75:06----------
onto others right like


---------75:10----------
so the best way i can explain this is


---------75:17----------
there's no way i can explain it but i


---------75:18----------
don't think there's anything different


---------75:19----------
you can do i think he did


---------75:21----------
exactly what any good person would do


---------75:23----------
that loves somebody that's why i don't


---------75:24----------
think there is any


---------75:26----------
there is no perfect in this world that


---------75:28----------
you know it


---------75:29----------
everything comes with its opposite it


---------75:33----------
comes with its


---------75:34----------
right that's what gives you the


---------75:36----------
perspective the duality of it right


---------75:38----------
like i'm i don't know does that make any


---------75:39----------
sense i don't think there's anything


---------75:40----------
makes sense


---------75:41----------
and and i'd encourage you to to think


---------75:43----------
about it slightly differently


---------75:46----------
so that your dad taught you pure


---------75:48----------
goodness


---------75:50----------
right is that right he taught me


---------75:53----------
appearance


---------75:54----------
it's not yeah sure it is okay


---------75:58----------
yeah okay go ahead what else do we call


---------76:02----------
not eating to feed your child pure


---------76:04----------
goodness


---------76:07----------
and so so i i also see that you have


---------76:11----------
you have taken what he taught you you've


---------76:13----------
made it a part of who you are


---------76:14----------
and you try to do it for others right


---------76:17----------
you said that your dad puts everyone


---------76:19----------
else first


---------76:20----------
and you don't it is you still have some


---------76:22----------
strange feelings around receiving gifts


---------76:25----------
but you're very particular about giving


---------76:28----------
gifts


---------76:30----------
and yet receiving them is still hard for


---------76:33----------
you


---------76:35----------
so like let's try to like try to


---------76:37----------
understand that for a second


---------76:38----------
so i think the crazy thing here is that


---------76:42----------
can i tell you a story yes please


---------76:46----------
okay maybe this story will uh because i


---------76:48----------
i i'm going to make a couple of


---------76:49----------
assumptions about how iranian culture


---------76:51----------
and indian culture


---------76:52----------
are away similar yeah so when i was


---------76:57----------
uh first um kind of like not first but


---------77:00----------
like


---------77:00----------
you know after i'd been dating my wife


---------77:01----------
for a while or maybe we were engaged i


---------77:04----------
would probably like engaged um and uh


---------77:07----------
you know one day i went home


---------77:11----------
and she came with me so i was at my you


---------77:13----------
know my parents house and my grandmother


---------77:14----------
was there


---------77:15----------
the first thing that that happens when i


---------77:17----------
come home is is you know my mom and my


---------77:19----------
grandmother ask me


---------77:20----------
what do i want to eat and i don't want


---------77:23----------
to burden them


---------77:25----------
right so i say like whatever's easiest


---------77:28----------
and what do you think their responses


---------77:32----------
any idea so you asked your parents


---------77:36----------
what you could do to not burden them no


---------77:37----------
no no so yeah so i


---------77:39----------
no i said they're like what do you want


---------77:40----------
to eat like when you go home like you


---------77:42----------
know i don't know if your mom tries to


---------77:43----------
like cook your favorite dish


---------77:44----------
oh go ahead right and and so so so


---------77:47----------
they're like oh look what do you want to


---------77:49----------
eat and i say like whatever is easy like


---------77:51----------
you know don't


---------77:51----------
inconvenience yourself for my sake right


---------77:55----------
makes sense right so and then what what


---------77:58----------
you think that like


---------77:59----------
calms them down or riles them up


---------78:02----------
riles them up why


---------78:07----------
because you're damn right why


---------78:17----------
that's a question i still have yet to


---------78:19----------
answer because for me it goes back and


---------78:21----------
forth


---------78:22----------
yeah yeah so so like the interesting


---------78:23----------
thing is like you know sometimes like


---------78:25----------
what happens like


---------78:27----------
you know is that people want to take


---------78:29----------
care of you


---------78:30----------
yeah and and if you


---------78:33----------
tell people like yeah like so they would


---------78:36----------
and then what what happened is they like


---------78:37----------
ask me a thousand questions so like do


---------78:38----------
you want this


---------78:39----------
do you want this do you want this and


---------78:41----------
i'd be like whatever's fine like


---------78:42----------
everything's fine


---------78:43----------
like really like whatever's easy like


---------78:44----------
please don't and then get like more and


---------78:46----------
more riled up


---------78:48----------
yes because they wouldn't know like here


---------78:50----------
is their


---------78:51----------
you know son home from whatever like


---------78:54----------
back from boston


---------78:56----------
and i i'm in medical school and so


---------78:58----------
they're like oh you're home


---------79:00----------
and like we wanna you know they wanna


---------79:02----------
they wanna show their affection they


---------79:03----------
wanna show their love


---------79:04----------
so they ask me like what do i wanna eat


---------79:06----------
and i'd say like whatever


---------79:08----------
my wife is like you're driving i'm


---------79:09----------
[ __ ] insane just it doesn't matter


---------79:11----------
what you want to eat just pick something


---------79:15----------
because they you you owe them


---------79:19----------
a simple answer so that they haven't


---------79:22----------
seen you in two months


---------79:25----------
they get joy out of watching you eat you


---------79:27----------
come home and you say you just pick


---------79:29----------
something


---------79:30----------
tell them i want to eat this and then


---------79:32----------
when they make it


---------79:33----------
you s shove your face full of it


---------79:36----------
and then you tell them it's delicious it


---------79:38----------
doesn't matter what you want


---------79:40----------
it doesn't matter what they want you


---------79:42----------
just say something


---------79:43----------
and then you accept what they give you


---------79:45----------
and you appreciate it


---------79:48----------
does that make sense completely makes


---------79:50----------
sense yes


---------79:51----------
right on point yes and so when it comes


---------79:54----------
to the gift giving


---------79:56----------
i i get where you're coming from that


---------79:57----------
you want to protect like you want to be


---------80:00----------
like your dad said something did


---------80:02----------
something so awesome for you


---------80:04----------
and if everyone in the world was like


---------80:06----------
your dad the world would be


---------80:08----------
for the most part an awesome place maybe


---------80:11----------
people would be


---------80:12----------
freaking out about beds not being made


---------80:13----------
but you know people would put others


---------80:15----------
ahead of themselves


---------80:18----------
and so in a weird way i think one of the


---------80:22----------
simplest things just think about what it


---------80:24----------
would have done


---------80:25----------
for you as a kid


---------80:28----------
if like he knows like you know he's


---------80:30----------
hungry he knows he's hungry


---------80:33----------
he doesn't want to accept or doesn't


---------80:35----------
know


---------80:36----------
that you know and while you eat it


---------80:40----------
there's a part of you that feels like


---------80:42----------
hurt because like


---------80:43----------
you know he's sacrificing and sure it's


---------80:46----------
a beautiful sacrifice


---------80:48----------
but it brings pain with it and sure


---------80:51----------
there's something about duality and


---------80:52----------
something there


---------80:53----------
i'm curious you know how do you think it


---------80:57----------
would have affected you if your dad said


---------80:59----------
like let's say there's one


---------81:00----------
you know piece of bread left or


---------81:02----------
something like that and you guys went


---------81:04----------
halfsies


---------81:06----------
how would you have felt if he had taken


---------81:10----------
half of his portion


---------81:14----------
i think giving me half or giving me full


---------81:18----------
it would have the same exact effect


---------81:21----------
because it's not for me it's not so for


---------81:24----------
me it's not the


---------81:25----------
it's not the actual food that's being


---------81:29----------
given or the amount of it


---------81:31----------
it's the intention of of the of the


---------81:35----------
it's the inception of the thought


---------81:39----------
that is there instantly instinctually


---------81:41----------
it's it's there


---------81:42----------
to give it to be willing to ready at any


---------81:45----------
call


---------81:46----------
any chance at any second to give it


---------81:48----------
right it's it's the thought


---------81:49----------
it's not the actual action of it it's


---------81:52----------
it's that it's there like


---------81:53----------
that's why for me when people reach out


---------81:56----------
to me like what's


---------81:57----------
on my birthday right it's just


---------82:00----------
the little reach out that isn't for me


---------82:02----------
that's enough right


---------82:04----------
and for a lot of people i think that's


---------82:05----------
enough it's just it's it's the fact that


---------82:07----------
it's there


---------82:08----------
yeah so tyler yeah so i i i make okay


---------82:11----------
i'm with you in terms of the portion so


---------82:13----------
let me put it this way


---------82:14----------
sometimes a kindness that you can the


---------82:17----------
biggest kindness you can do for someone


---------82:19----------
else


---------82:20----------
is to let them do a kindness for you


---------82:26----------
what do you think about that i think


---------82:28----------
it's completely accurate that was gonna


---------82:29----------
be my next point


---------82:31----------
right so and i think when it comes to


---------82:33----------
like gift receiving


---------82:34----------
yeah so sure you feel guilty on some


---------82:38----------
level


---------82:40----------
but remember that like something about


---------82:43----------
your feeling of guilt is depriving them


---------82:47----------
of their intention to make you feel a


---------82:49----------
certain way


---------82:51----------
i think here's how i actually think it


---------82:54----------
is


---------82:54----------
now tell me if you feel me on this okay


---------82:57----------
okay


---------82:58----------
i think the guilt that i felt


---------83:02----------
and that i feel


---------83:05----------
is the very response that is most


---------83:09----------
appropriate


---------83:10----------
for their action because if i learn from


---------83:13----------
their action


---------83:14----------
and if i were to be good and understand


---------83:17----------
what good is in putting others before


---------83:19----------
yourself


---------83:21----------
i would have to feel that way if i'm


---------83:23----------
actually learning from them and


---------83:25----------
i was gonna do that one day if i didn't


---------83:27----------
feel that guilt and i just took


---------83:29----------
that's when you become shameless that's


---------83:30----------
when you're no longer aware of the


---------83:32----------
other's emotions


---------83:33----------
you're no longer aware of the other


---------83:35----------
person's experience that they're


---------83:38----------
uh going through and what they're losing


---------83:40----------
by giving you the peace so i think i


---------83:41----------
need to feel that way in order to


---------83:43----------
reciprocate


---------83:46----------
so let me need it when you give someone


---------83:49----------
else a gift


---------83:50----------
do you want them to feel guilty


---------83:54----------
i think guilty is the wrong word it's


---------83:56----------
not it's not


---------83:57----------
guilty that i felt it's it was


---------84:00----------
it was it's not the


---------84:03----------
guilt isn't the right word the word i


---------84:05----------
felt


---------84:07----------
was it softened my heart it made me


---------84:10----------
ache for a moment to know that this


---------84:13----------
existed that this was the closest thing


---------84:15----------
to a superhero right we all see our


---------84:16----------
parents as


---------84:17----------
you know this or that us fortunate ones


---------84:19----------
at least i don't want to assume everyone


---------84:20----------
has a good relationship


---------84:22----------
but you know especially in our cultures


---------84:24----------
right like i would say like


---------84:28----------
it's


---------84:33----------
the feeling shapes me


---------84:38----------
it's the good and the i felt the good in


---------84:41----------
the world right


---------84:42----------
that's what i felt so that feeling


---------84:45----------
naturally


---------84:48----------
if i myself i'm not some crazy


---------84:50----------
sociopathic serial killer


---------84:52----------
naturally no matter i mean listen this


---------84:54----------
is why i wouldn't say it out loud


---------84:56----------
i accepted the gift to make him feel


---------84:58----------
good he had no idea that i was


---------85:00----------
sad in his decision so i allowed him to


---------85:03----------
feel good by giving me the gift i held


---------85:05----------
that inside


---------85:06----------
knowing that so that


---------85:09----------
knowing is what allows me to


---------85:12----------
learn from that grow from that and it's


---------85:14----------
it allows me to shape


---------85:15----------
into that to do it myself so doing it my


---------85:19----------
does that make any sense makes perfect


---------85:20----------
sense right so but


---------85:22----------
now you guys are playing this little


---------85:24----------
game


---------85:26----------
of i'm gonna sacrifice more i'm gonna


---------85:28----------
take the pain from you


---------85:30----------
i'm gonna eat this thing because i know


---------85:32----------
it makes my dad


---------85:34----------
feel comforted that there isn't enough


---------85:35----------
food for both of us


---------85:38----------
so what you do is you you receive his


---------85:40----------
goodness


---------85:42----------
and you sacrifice because of it


---------85:45----------
right yes yeah and so


---------85:49----------
what what i'm hearing from you is that


---------85:50----------
the world is a place where pure goodness


---------85:53----------
is represented by sacrifice


---------85:59----------
you want to feel guilt


---------86:02----------
it's how you know you're doing it right


---------86:05----------
you're becoming your father


---------86:07----------
you're putting other people first and


---------86:09----------
you can't put someone else first


---------86:11----------
without someone taking a loss


---------86:17----------
sometimes yes right for serious


---------86:19----------
occasions like


---------86:20----------
fine yeah yeah i guess maybe yeah tyler


---------86:23----------
so like like the interesting thing i


---------86:24----------
think it's beautiful don't get me wrong


---------86:26----------
and i come from the same culture of


---------86:27----------
sacrifice


---------86:28----------
yeah right so i i'm with you that i


---------86:31----------
think the world is sort of changing


---------86:32----------
like we're real boomers now because we


---------86:34----------
talk about kids nowadays


---------86:36----------
but i i do think that you made a good


---------86:38----------
point that in america


---------86:39----------
it's help yourself first and help


---------86:41----------
yourself second


---------86:43----------
it's a very you know like like


---------86:46----------
anyway so it's different right so in in


---------86:48----------
a lot of like the


---------86:50----------
like middle eastern south asian east


---------86:53----------
asian


---------86:54----------
i'm not sure about other parts of the


---------86:55----------
world because i just don't know those


---------86:56----------
cultures as well but like


---------86:58----------
there's a very community aspect the


---------87:00----------
community actually comes ahead of the


---------87:02----------
individual


---------87:02----------
it's just a different value system yeah


---------87:05----------
i invited uh did


---------87:06----------
you know who lacari is le carr is a


---------87:08----------
streamer so i invited him over and


---------87:10----------
when he came over i gave him


---------87:14----------
my master bedroom and my master bathroom


---------87:16----------
and i


---------87:17----------
slept in the guest room on like this


---------87:19----------
very like shitty bed


---------87:21----------
and he couldn't understand why the hell


---------87:23----------
would this guy invite me to his house


---------87:24----------
and give me the master bedroom after


---------87:26----------
bathroom master bathroom everything good


---------87:28----------
and sleep in a


---------87:29----------
creaky old bed in the guest room this is


---------87:31----------
just this is my culture this is how i


---------87:33----------
was raised right


---------87:34----------
now it's not everybody in our culture


---------87:36----------
because i'll tell you what my cousins


---------87:37----------
if they had one last fruit roll up that


---------87:40----------
[ __ ] you know they hounded me they would


---------87:42----------
argue hit me pull my hair it's theirs


---------87:45----------
when i had one last


---------87:46----------
fruit roll up my dad taught me listen we


---------87:48----------
can get more another time


---------87:50----------
let your cousins have it that's the way


---------87:52----------
i was raised right give it to them


---------87:53----------
don't worry you know take care of


---------87:55----------
yourself last make sure they're good


---------87:56----------
they're your guests


---------87:57----------
right yeah so no one understands this


---------87:59----------
and i think lucario was confused which


---------88:00----------
led to another story but


---------88:02----------
that's true yeah so so let me kind of


---------88:04----------
like ask so so i'm with you that that


---------88:06----------
oftentimes


---------88:08----------
sacrifice that


---------88:11----------
goodness so goodness to you feels


---------88:15----------
right when it comes with a sense of


---------88:17----------
guilt unworthiness or sacrifice


---------88:20----------
right now i know i'm not perfectly


---------88:21----------
capturing this because i think that


---------88:23----------
there's


---------88:24----------
but but so so here's here's the the


---------88:26----------
thing right so in the


---------88:27----------
in in the same way that


---------88:30----------
you decided to eat the food so your dad


---------88:34----------
could have the feeling of like


---------88:38----------
okay like i did the good thing and my


---------88:41----------
son is eating


---------88:42----------
because like he feels the same way right


---------88:43----------
like you're helping him feel good


---------88:45----------
through sacrifice


---------88:46----------
yes and then and then the big thing that


---------88:49----------
my my wife


---------88:50----------
taught me is that like that's something


---------88:54----------
you know sometimes the best way that you


---------88:56----------
can feel is sort of like what you said


---------88:58----------
you just


---------88:59----------
you take one you just take it you take


---------89:02----------
what other people have to offer and


---------89:03----------
that's actually the best gift you can


---------89:05----------
give them


---------89:06----------
and i think it's it runs contrary to our


---------89:09----------
cultures of like taking is bad


---------89:12----------
but at the same time it's really like a


---------89:13----------
next level play


---------89:15----------
and i have never seen my family be


---------89:17----------
happier than when i


---------89:18----------
sometimes become a taker you know i'm


---------89:20----------
careful about it


---------89:23----------
but now i have this thing where like


---------89:24----------
when i visit my in-laws


---------89:26----------
like i just ask for one thing


---------89:29----------
every time i go pick one thing and


---------89:31----------
[ __ ] ask for it


---------89:33----------
and then like my my mother-in-law is


---------89:36----------
awesome and she feels just so much


---------89:38----------
like then she gives me the thing i enjoy


---------89:40----------
it fully and then she's a happy camper


---------89:42----------
i'm a happy camper and all i had to do


---------89:45----------
was be a little bit of an [ __ ] and


---------89:46----------
ask for something


---------89:49----------
and so in a weird way tyler what i what


---------89:51----------
i'd encourage you to do is like the next


---------89:53----------
time you receive a gift


---------89:56----------
give someone the opportunity of just


---------89:59----------
receiving it and give someone the


---------90:02----------
opportunity


---------90:03----------
of doing of accepting it


---------90:06----------
just like you did for your dad and that


---------90:09----------
you don't have to feel


---------90:10----------
like you can you accepted something from


---------90:12----------
your dad and it came with guilt and so i


---------90:13----------
think your mind is somewhat conditioned


---------90:15----------
for like when someone gives something to


---------90:16----------
you like you feel guilt fine


---------90:18----------
like you can see how those two


---------90:19----------
experiences are connected and at the


---------90:21----------
same time


---------90:22----------
let go of that guilt


---------90:25----------
as best as you can try to just accept


---------90:27----------
what people have to give


---------90:29----------
and that understand that on some level


---------90:32----------
sometimes


---------90:33----------
the the best the the best sacrifice


---------90:36----------
the purest goodness that you can


---------90:39----------
have is one of sacrifice which is


---------90:40----------
something that i think is like very well


---------90:42----------
represented and explained in


---------90:43----------
christianity


---------90:45----------
right so that's like it's like an


---------90:46----------
age-old kind of thing that like the


---------90:48----------
the bigger the sacrifice the better the


---------90:51----------
good


---------90:52----------
but i think that there's also like a


---------90:54----------
different perspective which is that


---------90:55----------
sometimes


---------90:56----------
you can just accept other sacrifices and


---------90:59----------
you don't have to feel guilty


---------91:01----------
which i know sounds bizarre to you and


---------91:03----------
that's why i encourage you to just


---------91:05----------
accept what gifts people have to give


---------91:07----------
and and acknowledge that


---------91:09----------
when they're giving that gift the last


---------91:11----------
thing they want you to feel is guilty


---------91:14----------
they're giving it for the same reason i


---------91:16----------
mean just imagine if other people feel


---------91:18----------
guilty when


---------91:18----------
you give them a gift and sure there's a


---------91:21----------
certain amount of like paying it forward


---------91:22----------
that you want to do you're demonstrating


---------91:24----------
to them sacrifice


---------91:25----------
i just feel like i feel like i i feel


---------91:27----------
like it's my responsibility


---------91:29----------
to to know when they're sacrificing


---------91:32----------
and to feel that i'll accept it i'll


---------91:35----------
make them feel good and


---------91:36----------
and let them do the heroic deed but i


---------91:39----------
feel like i need to


---------91:39----------
see that and reciprocate the favor and


---------91:42----------
get them back


---------91:43----------
out of there does that make sense which


---------91:44----------
i think is completely natural it's how


---------91:45----------
people should feel does that make sure


---------91:47----------
so yeah get them out of there in terms


---------91:51----------
of what


---------91:52----------
so let's say i'm in a tough spot right


---------91:55----------
and you know


---------91:56----------
someone reaches out gives me a gift


---------91:59----------
helps me out right


---------92:00----------
i so if they've sacrificed something


---------92:02----------
giving me that because they you know


---------92:04----------
they can maybe take a couple days


---------92:06----------
without eating so i can eat that one day


---------92:08----------
then i feel like i need to come back and


---------92:10----------
he he gave me a plate of food i need to


---------92:12----------
give him a restaurant


---------92:13----------
sure does that make any sense like i was


---------92:14----------
talking about old school mob type stuff


---------92:17----------
yeah i'm saying like yep you you feel me


---------92:19----------
yeah yeah


---------92:20----------
yeah no but yeah i feel understand what


---------92:22----------
you're saying


---------92:24----------
yeah so i just wanna make sure we have


---------92:25----------
time for the bully thing but i don't


---------92:26----------
know if we do do we have to


---------92:27----------
go for that not so much but i mean is


---------92:30----------
there something


---------92:31----------
we can because i i think you know we


---------92:32----------
tend to get


---------92:34----------
talk about things somewhat deeply so i


---------92:36----------
think we kind of cover less ground


---------92:38----------
but if there's something you want to say


---------92:40----------
about my only concern about the bully


---------92:41----------
thing is that


---------92:42----------
we wouldn't have enough time to do it


---------92:43----------
justice what do you think


---------92:46----------
yeah you're probably right i mean i i


---------92:48----------
can never get to any of my points and i


---------92:49----------
feel like today


---------92:51----------
yeah so yeah how do you feel about today


---------92:56----------
um i i feel like


---------92:59----------
every time i have a camera i've how i


---------93:01----------
feel today is how i feel


---------93:03----------
every time i have a conversation with


---------93:05----------
someone that i


---------93:06----------
enjoy their which is there's just never


---------93:08----------
enough time


---------93:09----------
that's how i feel i like you i like you


---------93:12----------
it's


---------93:13----------
i like it's fun talking to you it's fun


---------93:16----------
yeah i just enjoyed talking to you you


---------93:17----------
know just


---------93:18----------
hey it could be anything we could


---------93:19----------
[ __ ] we could talk about


---------93:21----------
a horse and i'll have a good time let me


---------93:23----------
talk 45 minutes about horus believe me


---------93:25----------
i can stretch that out i'll start with


---------93:27----------
the tail we'll go to the hooves


---------93:29----------
we'll go up the you know ankles we'll


---------93:30----------
talk about the bony structures we'll


---------93:31----------
talk about the muscles


---------93:32----------
i'll stretch out for two hours and i'm a


---------93:34----------
pro at this but


---------93:36----------
i just it's just fun it's just it's it's


---------93:38----------
it's nice to


---------93:40----------
talk to someone that's it's why i enjoy


---------93:42----------
among us a lot


---------93:44----------
it forces it forces interactions that i


---------93:47----------
feel like this generation is completely


---------93:49----------
lost it forces 10 people to get into a


---------93:50----------
call


---------93:51----------
it forces us to


---------93:55----------
be in situations that build stronger


---------93:56----------
relationships


---------93:58----------
right nowadays friendships over the


---------94:00----------
internet they have no challenges and


---------94:01----------
when one challenge happens everyone's


---------94:03----------
ready to just run and


---------94:04----------
disappear because it attacks


---------94:07----------
what they've hidden deep inside their


---------94:09----------
mind that no one can have


---------94:10----------
but anyways yeah i really enjoy these


---------94:12----------
conversations so how i feel today is how


---------94:14----------
i feel when i have a conversation with


---------94:15----------
anyone that's


---------94:16----------
fun to talk to what i'm hearing is


---------94:18----------
incomplete


---------94:20----------
no no it was very complete it's just


---------94:23----------
that i just want to talk about you know


---------94:25----------
i wish we had 15 hours straight you know


---------94:27----------
i feel like i wish we both could just go


---------94:29----------
six coffees each


---------94:30----------
talk for 15 hours straight you know and


---------94:33----------
just


---------94:36----------
[ __ ] around just have fun together


---------94:38----------
you know can i


---------94:39----------
offer um my perspective


---------94:42----------
yeah of course so uh


---------94:46----------
train i i want to talk more too i think


---------94:48----------
one of the things that i found is that


---------94:51----------
um the longer a conversation


---------94:54----------
goes like i feel like i have a certain


---------94:56----------
amount of hard drive space


---------94:58----------
and that hard drive space is about 90


---------95:00----------
minutes and that what i find is that


---------95:02----------
if i keep going there's a lot of


---------95:04----------
fruitful stuff but i tend to start


---------95:06----------
overriding the stuff at the beginning


---------95:09----------
interesting


---------95:10----------
so for you to know here's how i work


---------95:13----------
okay


---------95:14----------
so that 90 minute period you have where


---------95:16----------
you start recording or writing onto your


---------95:19----------
hard drive


---------95:21----------
for me booting up


---------95:25----------
yeah for me so the last 15 minutes


---------95:28----------
is the information is real information


---------95:30----------
that can get us somewhere


---------95:32----------
and the other you know uh uh 75 minutes


---------95:36----------
all of that was just me booting up just


---------95:38----------
just complete like


---------95:39----------
an utter just just [ __ ] right so


---------95:43----------
maybe i need to just wake up and


---------95:47----------
look and talk in the mirror for like 45


---------95:48----------
minutes to myself and get all the


---------95:50----------
[ __ ] out


---------95:51----------
so when you when you and i start i can


---------95:53----------
start right at the good stuff


---------95:55----------
you know what i'm saying well yeah but i


---------95:57----------
just to play devil's advocate there for


---------95:59----------
a second i think there was a lot of good


---------96:01----------
stuff


---------96:02----------
so so just as an example so i have a


---------96:04----------
hypothesis that you're very concerned


---------96:05----------
about


---------96:06----------
you know your perception and how people


---------96:08----------
treat you that you're very


---------96:10----------
confident in yourself and at the same


---------96:11----------
time there's this weird [ __ ] about the


---------96:13----------
parent oil like


---------96:14----------
why those phones need to be in in


---------96:16----------
airplane mode like


---------96:17----------
it sounds like you were concerned about


---------96:18----------
something getting out


---------96:20----------
in which case then no it's because okay


---------96:23----------
so the way i talk


---------96:25----------
and the generation i came from with the


---------96:26----------
friends i had the way i talk it's very


---------96:28----------
loose


---------96:28----------
and it's from a generation where


---------96:29----------
everyone gave each other the benefit of


---------96:30----------
the doubt


---------96:32----------
so when you come from a generation where


---------96:33----------
everyone gives you the benefit of the


---------96:34----------
doubt


---------96:35----------
everything you say it's taken in a


---------96:37----------
context that is the least harmful


---------96:39----------
in the sense of like you don't mean it


---------96:41----------
in a way where you're this terrible


---------96:43----------
person


---------96:43----------
right he was just kidding he meant it in


---------96:45----------
this context relaxed nowadays we live in


---------96:47----------
the total opposite


---------96:48----------
nowadays the worst possible scenario is


---------96:49----------
found the worst possible context is


---------96:51----------
applied


---------96:52----------
and that's the way it's written so


---------96:54----------
nowadays with the way i talk


---------96:56----------
i i speak very crazily right um


---------96:59----------
i've i type the same way right whether


---------97:02----------
it's


---------97:02----------
uh males females anyone you know i've


---------97:05----------
told


---------97:06----------
tyler juan and other streamers that they


---------97:07----------
have you know sexy eyes and i went a


---------97:09----------
little deeper into sexual stuff with you


---------97:10----------
know these guys


---------97:11----------
i i just i talk very loosely and


---------97:15----------
the problem is here's the problem the


---------97:18----------
way that


---------97:18----------
it's represented by whoever represents


---------97:21----------
it if they introduce it first


---------97:23----------
they get to dictate what the context is


---------97:26----------
and i know


---------97:26----------
anyone that does not like me will always


---------97:28----------
dictate the context


---------97:30----------
in a different way and the things that i


---------97:32----------
say are very important


---------97:34----------
with context they're very important you


---------97:35----------
remove the context they could be very


---------97:37----------
serious and very bad


---------97:39----------
so i think the same way yeah so when i'm


---------97:42----------
having


---------97:43----------
dinner with two friends off stream and


---------97:46----------
i'm talking freely i might make a joke


---------97:49----------
that i know me and my friends there


---------97:52----------
understand the context of and we know


---------97:55----------
it's not harmful


---------97:56----------
the problem is if that were to be


---------97:58----------
recorded


---------97:59----------
and someone were to introduce it with a


---------98:01----------
different narrative line


---------98:02----------
there is nothing i can say or do that


---------98:06----------
will


---------98:06----------
ever prove that it is the way i meant it


---------98:09----------
it is always forever going to be taken


---------98:10----------
away by the general public because


---------98:11----------
there's no way they can understand


---------98:14----------
what i meant and since we of what we


---------98:16----------
talked about before of how i'm perceived


---------98:18----------
kind of this like terrible


---------98:19----------
evil like villain that's the way it it


---------98:22----------
makes it even harder for me to


---------98:24----------
battle that so i just take precautions


---------98:27----------
because i know does that make any sense


---------98:29----------
yeah i mean i think that makes a lot of


---------98:30----------
sense i'm


---------98:31----------
i i find myself being curious but i i


---------98:33----------
think you know there's a lot of


---------98:35----------
questions from that like you know why


---------98:36----------
are you perceived as a villain and where


---------98:38----------
does that come from


---------98:39----------
but i think that sounds like it's a


---------98:40----------
whole other conversation it is i'll i'll


---------98:43----------
keep this one very short but


---------98:44----------
sure we'll talk about that we'll talk


---------98:45----------
about a little later so there's this


---------98:47----------
weird like


---------98:48----------
double side to this half of it


---------98:53----------
half of it i i have my opinions i have


---------98:56----------
my theories


---------98:58----------
and it sucks and i don't like it


---------99:01----------
the other half of me feels like it's


---------99:04----------
necessary to be seen this way


---------99:06----------
it's a very weird conflicting uh two uh


---------99:09----------
different sides that i have in my head


---------99:10----------
right now


---------99:11----------
that i i've always had so


---------99:15----------
because of my experiences through the


---------99:17----------
bullying in middle school


---------99:19----------
high school beca and and


---------99:22----------
a little bit of college because of that


---------99:25----------
it fueled me to


---------99:29----------
do whatever i needed to do it was my


---------99:30----------
fuel i learned how to take


---------99:32----------
people's hate doubt and turn it into


---------99:36----------
fuel


---------99:36----------
right and that's why even


---------99:40----------
i mean even if people don't like me here


---------99:42----------
they can they can


---------99:44----------
they have to admit to themselves when


---------99:46----------
i've had hordes of people hating me way


---------99:48----------
outnumbering me i've still kept going


---------99:50----------
right where others take months breaks


---------99:52----------
because of one hate thread


---------99:54----------
you know there's been hundreds that i


---------99:56----------
just use as fuel


---------99:58----------
now here's the reason why up half of me


---------99:59----------
which is unhealthy thinks it needs to be


---------100:01----------
there


---------100:02----------
i've learned no other way to move


---------100:04----------
forward


---------100:05----------
besides using the doubt and hate as fuel


---------100:08----------
there was there was a week where i went


---------100:10----------
remember i was cherished and praised i


---------100:11----------
think it was during the australia


---------100:12----------
wildfires


---------100:13----------
where we did this big community event


---------100:16----------
and i was


---------100:16----------
i was like cherished and praised it was


---------100:18----------
all love and good


---------100:20----------
and for that entire week i actually


---------100:23----------
i almost felt like purposeless i felt


---------100:26----------
like i


---------100:26----------
i was i i had nothing fueling me


---------100:30----------
to prove people wrong and uh do


---------100:33----------
something


---------100:34----------
and i i actually had no i had no


---------100:36----------
motivation at all


---------100:37----------
and then as soon as the first hate


---------100:39----------
thread came back of train wrecks being


---------100:41----------
an


---------100:41----------
[ __ ] or a hate piece of [ __ ] when


---------100:44----------
that came and i saw that


---------100:46----------
it invigorated me it it it refueled this


---------100:50----------
flame in my eye where i wanted to go to


---------100:52----------
the next step just to


---------100:53----------
you know does that make sense so it's


---------100:55----------
this weird thing where i hate it because


---------100:56----------
i'm not this person


---------100:58----------
that i look like i am but on the other


---------101:00----------
hand


---------101:01----------
as soon as people start seeing it from


---------101:02----------
the inside i lose the mode of it right


---------101:05----------
because


---------101:05----------
my primary feel was that it's just wrong


---------101:08----------
i don't know i think it makes sense


---------101:09----------
it makes a lot of sense uh tyler i think


---------101:11----------
a big thing that i've noticed is that


---------101:13----------
we tend to stick with the patterns that


---------101:16----------
are adaptive at one point


---------101:18----------
and then sometimes they become


---------101:20----------
maladaptive


---------101:23----------
and and they no longer are ideal for us


---------101:26----------
but it's what we know


---------101:27----------
and it's what works so like substance


---------101:30----------
use i think is a really good example of


---------101:31----------
this where


---------101:33----------
you know people can have bad feelings


---------101:35----------
and then what they find is that there's


---------101:37----------
something that


---------101:37----------
helps those bad feelings go away and


---------101:41----------
and so and it can work you know for a


---------101:44----------
time


---------101:44----------
and in your case it sounds like it's


---------101:46----------
still working pretty well but i think


---------101:48----------
that sometimes it's bizarre that


---------101:50----------
you know we propagate things that seem


---------101:53----------
like they're bad


---------101:54----------
but the reason we propagate them is


---------101:55----------
because they work


---------101:58----------
and that's it you know it's


---------102:01----------
it it's not that uncommon but i think i


---------102:04----------
think we can dig into it do you how do


---------102:05----------
you feel about meditation today


---------102:08----------
we can try it oh that's that's what


---------102:10----------
we're going to talk about remember last


---------102:11----------
time we ended on substance use i was


---------102:13----------
going to tell you about my


---------102:14----------
my long yeah next time i guess we'll do


---------102:16----------
that next time


---------102:17----------
you know i've had i've dabbled in uh


---------102:21----------
and i hate talking about it in this mood


---------102:22----------
because it sounds like i'm bragging as


---------102:24----------
it's some sort of experience that


---------102:26----------
everyone no you know


---------102:29----------
again you see that like so much of what


---------102:31----------
you say like your mind automatically


---------102:33----------
goes to


---------102:35----------
i hate to send you say what you want to


---------102:36----------
say


---------102:38----------
i just want to take it the wrong way but


---------102:40----------
yeah you know i [ __ ] like


---------102:42----------
you know i went through four years uh


---------102:47----------
i've done a lot of you know i've i've


---------102:50----------
you know um


---------102:54----------
yeah i did i wasn't like heroin for like


---------102:57----------
three four years


---------102:58----------
you know i tried meth once um


---------103:01----------
i've done a lot of drugs i was quite


---------103:03----------
dangerous i was young


---------103:04----------
yeah i was like 18 to 12 18 like 23 20


---------103:07----------
18


---------103:07----------
23. i think i tried these things and


---------103:11----------
i've never been to i've never been to


---------103:12----------
one rehab but i i i


---------103:15----------
s this is this the dangerous part be


---------103:17----------
careful about i like i self-taught how


---------103:19----------
to like quit


---------103:20----------
and that's what we're going to talk


---------103:21----------
about into this one since you're an


---------103:22----------
addiction


---------103:23----------
psychiatrist but we'll do that next time


---------103:26----------
okay some crazy i'm telling some i got


---------103:29----------
i i ended up one of these nights


---------103:32----------
i ended up in a neighborhood


---------103:38----------
and my friend takes me to this party


---------103:39----------
okay so i'm gonna leave i'm like this on


---------103:40----------
a cliffhanger here i'm not gonna end the


---------103:42----------
story so


---------103:45----------
i do drugs with these kids and i end up


---------103:48----------
at this party


---------103:49----------

---------103:52----------

---------103:53----------

---------103:58----------
party


---------103:59----------
supposed to be this cool party fun i


---------104:02----------
walk in


---------104:02----------
and the first thing i remember i saw was


---------104:07----------
black duct tape


---------104:10----------
going straight from the double door of


---------104:12----------
the front of the house


---------104:14----------
through the middle of the double door


---------104:16----------
zigzagging perfectly


---------104:17----------
splitting the house i'm like what the


---------104:21----------
[ __ ]


---------104:21----------
like is he taping down an ethernet cable


---------104:24----------
i didn't see anything which is the flat


---------104:26----------
duct tape what's going on


---------104:29----------
so i look back up i walk in i make it to


---------104:32----------
the main portion


---------104:33----------
on the right side there was a bunch of


---------104:36----------
people


---------104:37----------
in blue shirts and attire


---------104:40----------
on the left side red i was at a


---------104:44----------
neighborhood


---------104:45----------
peace party between gangs


---------104:48----------
and this story was so [ __ ]


---------104:51----------
insane i've told it once on my stream


---------104:55----------
but these are the things i went through


---------104:56----------
during that phase the three to four year


---------104:58----------
phase of like the usages the things that


---------105:00----------
i


---------105:01----------
lucky i made it out alive i mean let


---------105:02----------
alone the drug itself but


---------105:04----------
the situations and the people are


---------105:06----------
brought around [ __ ] that that's a story


---------105:08----------
for later that that was


---------105:11----------
crazy stuff happened later that night


---------105:12----------
you know there's helicopters choppers i


---------105:14----------
was in a car with random three people it


---------105:16----------
was bad


---------105:16----------
but we'll tell that next time it was


---------105:18----------
some insane [ __ ]


---------105:20----------
okay so trade that does sound like quite


---------105:22----------
the cliffhanger man


---------105:24----------
um i need to pee so i'm going to leave


---------105:26----------
you too


---------105:28----------
oh okay okay i'll entertain stream


---------105:31----------

---------105:33----------

---------105:34----------
up in like 15


---------105:35----------
minutes


---------105:42----------
oh no socks yo dr k got some socks on my


---------105:46----------
man


---------105:48----------
what's up guys you know i feel like


---------105:53----------
i wish i wish i can


---------105:56----------
pick and choose when to come on within


---------105:59----------
the like


---------105:59----------
hour of having the show but it's like so


---------106:02----------
selfish and irresponsible of me to like


---------106:03----------
expect that or want that


---------106:05----------
there's days where i can speak


---------106:06----------
eloquently which is very rare but


---------106:08----------
there's days that that's there


---------106:10----------
those are the days i want to come talk


---------106:11----------
to them so i can freely express


---------106:13----------
everything i'm feeling like uh or in an


---------106:15----------
organized way today is not one of those


---------106:17----------
days as you guys can tell


---------106:22----------
you just need more time training


---------106:25----------
yeah maybe i don't know yeah maybe but


---------106:28----------
at the end of the day i mean listen he's


---------106:30----------
already doing amazing work you know


---------106:33----------
the you know plus hey


---------106:36----------
we'll come back and we'll talk about the


---------106:38----------
juicy stuff


---------106:40----------
can i touch up on one thing before we go


---------106:41----------
to meditation and wrap up yeah sure


---------106:45----------
oh it's the birthday it's the birthday


---------106:47----------
thing i want to clean that up cause i


---------106:49----------
think i didn't properly get it out


---------106:51----------
and there's no response needed i just


---------106:53----------
want to clear i i just think i didn't


---------106:55----------
explain that properly


---------106:59----------
then again i feel like it's awkward now


---------107:00----------
re-explaining it


---------107:02----------
you know because i was like a soft


---------107:03----------
moment and now i'm not in a soft mood


---------107:05----------
does that make any sense


---------107:06----------
but anyways sure so


---------107:14----------
actually i i i guess we can revisit that


---------107:17----------
later


---------107:17----------
okay but but in that time i was gonna


---------107:20----------
use to answer your other question before


---------107:23----------
i


---------107:23----------
uh kind of just jumped away and went


---------107:24----------
into different different direction


---------107:26----------
you asked why i was why i feel like i'm


---------107:29----------
seen


---------107:29----------
as the villain so i want to be honest


---------107:31----------
with you okay


---------107:32----------
when you look at me okay look at me


---------107:36----------
do i come off initially now i know


---------107:38----------
you're wise


---------107:39----------
you know i'm not calling you old


---------107:43----------
kind of you're not old but you know


---------107:44----------
you're older than me i think then again


---------107:46----------
wait maybe not


---------107:47----------
anyways so


---------107:50----------
damn i just called you old i'm so sorry


---------107:53----------
but anyway no no no i'm


---------107:54----------
i'm just i i didn't get perceived as you


---------107:57----------
calling me old


---------107:59----------
oh great you look great by the way


---------108:00----------
amazing skin amazing hair


---------108:02----------
what i'm what i'm what made me laugh


---------108:05----------
train is just how


---------108:06----------
tuned in you are to how people perceive


---------108:09----------
you and how you affect other people


---------108:12----------
right so like you're it there seems to


---------108:14----------
be like a constant program in your mind


---------108:16----------
about how are my work it's


---------108:18----------
kind of good right so it means that


---------108:19----------
you're like very empathic


---------108:22----------
you're kind of constantly tuned in to


---------108:23----------
like how how am i being perceived or my


---------108:26----------
words being understood


---------108:28----------
you know you're always asking does that


---------108:31----------
make sense


---------108:33----------
it's like it's sort of like there's a


---------108:35----------
second monitor in your mind that has


---------108:37----------
this program about


---------108:38----------
how are my words being you could call me


---------108:40----------
old i wouldn't mind


---------108:41----------
i was laughing because you called me


---------108:43----------
wise and i think i'm not


---------108:45----------
that's why i was laughing like if if you


---------108:48----------
only


---------108:48----------
knew i mean i get i'm wise oh no no


---------108:51----------
believe me


---------108:52----------
i've already in my mind at the very


---------108:54----------
least this is gonna sound very


---------108:55----------
pretentious of me but


---------108:59----------
that right there what you just said if


---------109:00----------
you only knew i've already


---------109:02----------
believe me i'm already assuming


---------109:06----------
okay how can i say this psychiatry and


---------109:10----------
like


---------109:10----------
so obviously psychiatry go to medical


---------109:11----------
stuff psychology you know it's a little


---------109:12----------
different


---------109:14----------
but in order to have in my opinion


---------109:17----------
a decently high social experience which


---------109:20----------
you sorry social intelligence which i


---------109:21----------
think you do


---------109:23----------
you have to have quite a bit of trial


---------109:25----------
and error


---------109:27----------
quite a bit of different experiences and


---------109:29----------
you have to


---------109:30----------
be able to think


---------109:34----------
think into a situation that you mean the


---------109:37----------
point is i believe me i've already


---------109:38----------
calculated things


---------109:39----------
i'm not putting you in as this holy


---------109:41----------
grail of a god and your you know god's


---------109:43----------
left nut


---------109:44----------
and your you know this pure thing that


---------109:45----------
touches water turns into wine


---------109:47----------
by no means but that's exactly why i


---------109:49----------
think you're wise and i think you


---------109:50----------
admitting that you're not wise is


---------109:51----------
exactly why you are wise right but


---------109:53----------
anyways the point i'm trying to make is


---------109:55----------
when you look at me


---------110:03----------
okay i have black hair black eyebrows i


---------110:06----------
have


---------110:06----------
black eyes i have very a very deep voice


---------110:09----------
i'm very passionate


---------110:10----------
so i my voice my voice raises very


---------110:12----------
quickly which to others


---------110:13----------
it would be a slight raise but since my


---------110:15----------
voice is deeper it sounds like i'm


---------110:16----------
yelling and ready to


---------110:17----------
you know call the trumpets of war or the


---------110:19----------
horn of war


---------110:20----------
right so when you look at me initially


---------110:23----------
now that you've talked to me


---------110:25----------
you can you probably have a good idea of


---------110:26----------
what i'm like but but when you initially


---------110:28----------
look at me okay imagine before you talk


---------110:30----------
to me at all when i just look at you


---------110:31----------
like this


---------110:33----------
would you say that i'm a that that i


---------110:35----------
look like an approachable person that's


---------110:37----------
gonna be very nice to you or do you


---------110:38----------
think i look like someone that's gonna


---------110:39----------
be a total [ __ ] to you


---------110:44----------
most people answer that as the [ __ ] i


---------110:45----------
wouldn't describe you as approachable


---------110:47----------
but i think that there's like


---------110:49----------
it's not either or what do you look


---------110:51----------
approachable


---------110:52----------
no but i don't think you look like an


---------110:55----------
ass


---------110:56----------
because let me tell you [ __ ]


---------110:58----------
[ __ ] come in all colors shapes and


---------111:00----------
sizes


---------111:01----------
oh i know that i know that but so but


---------111:04----------
i i would agree i don't think i i think


---------111:06----------
you can be intimidating


---------111:08----------
i think you can look intimidating for


---------111:09----------
sure


---------111:12----------
certainly i think a deep voice


---------111:16----------
a certain confidence


---------111:19----------
and i i think you also


---------111:23----------
yeah i i think intimidating is a word i


---------111:27----------
would use to describe


---------111:28----------
you i think so i wouldn't i wouldn't


---------111:31----------
describe you as looking


---------111:33----------
nice when i think about like people who


---------111:35----------
look nice i think about like


---------111:37----------
you know babysitters that i hire for my


---------111:40----------
kids


---------111:41----------
like that's what i perceive as nice


---------111:43----------
they're like little old ladies


---------111:45----------
yeah so like in my opinion and i'll wrap


---------111:47----------
this up where i'm so sorry i'm talking


---------111:48----------
your head off but


---------111:50----------
so that in that intimating aspect for a


---------111:53----------
lot of people


---------111:54----------
it causes a fear right and here's what


---------111:56----------
happens right


---------111:57----------
this is the same thing i talk this in my


---------111:59----------
stream a lot so i have this thing where


---------112:01----------
i talk about certain things where people


---------112:02----------
think i'm gay


---------112:03----------
okay now it's it's their very


---------112:06----------
understanding and misunderstanding that


---------112:09----------
makes them think this it makes them


---------112:11----------
think that if i look at another man


---------112:12----------
and i think that they're good looking


---------112:14----------
that has to mean i'm gay if i smack


---------112:16----------
their ass or they smack mine out on an


---------112:18----------
issue with it i must be gay but this


---------112:19----------
isn't what


---------112:20----------
this isn't what defines whether you're


---------112:21----------
straight gay bisexual or whatever right


---------112:25----------
so my point is it's the fear it's the


---------112:27----------
not knowing


---------112:28----------
that causes these ignorant beliefs of


---------112:31----------
what


---------112:32----------
makes you what right so that was very


---------112:35----------
quick with that example i know it sounds


---------112:36----------
it was very sloppy i'm trying to be fast


---------112:38----------
here so what i'm trying to get to is


---------112:41----------
that intimidation that others see it


---------112:43----------
causes a


---------112:44----------
fear and an ignorance so when you see


---------112:47----------
that


---------112:48----------
you want to either get away from it


---------112:50----------
completely shut it out get it out of the


---------112:51----------
screen get it out of a position or you


---------112:53----------
want to bring it down


---------112:55----------
and that that's what i feel like almost


---------112:57----------
every single encounter i have initially


---------112:59----------
starts as until there's an opportunity


---------113:02----------
where we can just talk and hang out


---------113:05----------
individually right i'm always starting


---------113:07----------
at a position


---------113:09----------
where i need to work uphill or does that


---------113:11----------
make any sense


---------113:12----------
it makes a lot of sense i think it goes


---------113:14----------
along with this theme of like


---------113:16----------
you're judged tyler and people have


---------113:20----------
perceptions of you


---------113:21----------
and you're very careful about how you


---------113:22----------
manage those because


---------113:24----------
it sounds like when you haven't been


---------113:26----------
you've been burned


---------113:28----------
that's what i would hypothesize but


---------113:31----------
maybe a conversation for a different day


---------113:33----------
but i i think you're very careful about


---------113:35----------
how you're perceived


---------113:37----------
you're very in tune with what people


---------113:39----------
think of you


---------113:40----------
i i don't know why that is or where it


---------113:42----------
comes from but i certainly see it and i


---------113:44----------
think it makes sense


---------113:46----------
so recently last thing i swear last


---------113:48----------
thing so recently


---------113:50----------
i'll give you an example of why i'm like


---------113:51----------
this and why i'm like hyperactive this


---------113:53----------
area i'm very paranoid


---------113:54----------
recently there was a situation where


---------113:57----------
i did something right and it was a very


---------114:01----------
it was a very like big something like


---------114:02----------
monetarily


---------114:04----------
and when someone looked at it and then


---------114:06----------
looked at me and thought of me


---------114:08----------
the immediate reaction was i need to


---------114:10----------
find why he did this


---------114:12----------
it can't be good it's too bad so


---------114:14----------
narrative was created is i did it


---------114:16----------
for free advertisement right and then


---------114:19----------
you have someone else


---------114:21----------
that does a fraction of a fraction of a


---------114:25----------
fraction of it


---------114:26----------
and they did it for the advertisement


---------114:27----------
but the way they're perceived because


---------114:29----------
they have a more humble look


---------114:30----------
is wow even though you know even though


---------114:33----------
this


---------114:33----------
right like others are given the benefit


---------114:35----------
of the doubt whereas for me


---------114:37----------
anything is found that matches the way i


---------114:40----------
make them


---------114:41----------
feel does that make any sense so because


---------114:43----------
of this i'm very


---------114:44----------
i'm very paranoid and i'm constantly


---------114:47----------
like trying to


---------114:49----------
make sure it's not i'm not taking the


---------114:50----------
wrong way and i'm i feel like


---------114:52----------
does that make any sense yeah


---------114:56----------
i mean i don't know but anyway i'm sorry


---------114:57----------
i i i can go for hours yeah just


---------114:59----------
i think the rains wrap it up i apologize


---------115:01----------
no that's okay i i think it's


---------115:03----------
no not bad you know i i mean everything


---------115:06----------
you say train i think triggers things


---------115:08----------
than me


---------115:09----------
and everything i say triggers things and


---------115:10----------
you i don't mean trigger in a bad way


---------115:12----------
um like for example hearing that and you


---------115:16----------
know we'll see if i can


---------115:17----------
man should i restrain i don't want to


---------115:19----------
restrain asking the question so i feel


---------115:21----------
like i want to ask a question


---------115:22----------
more just to solidify it in my mind as


---------115:25----------
opposed to get an answer from you but


---------115:26----------
how does it feel to constantly be judged


---------115:29----------
like that


---------115:35----------
to not be given the benefit of the doubt


---------115:39----------
to have all of your actions scrutinized


---------115:41----------
your words scrutinized to be


---------115:44----------
misinterpreted


---------115:54----------
anyway but you can tell me whether


---------115:57----------
you know because you say your parent


---------116:00----------
what's it like to be paranoid what's it


---------116:02----------
like to need to be paranoid


---------116:04----------
i i think is the deeper question there


---------116:05----------
are a lot of questions left i'm i'm with


---------116:07----------
you there


---------116:09----------
um so maybe something to think about


---------116:12----------
you tell me i i can't i'll tell you okay


---------116:16----------
i'll tell you now so here's the way i


---------116:19----------
see it


---------116:22----------
if you remember we talked about my


---------116:24----------
feeling the need to take an l


---------116:25----------
or to take a sec to sacrifice to make


---------116:27----------
others feel good so


---------116:28----------
i see so it it's not that i feel sad for


---------116:31----------
being judged


---------116:32----------
you know i mean when we get deeper into


---------116:36----------
it i'll explain it obviously


---------116:37----------
i do have my moments where i'll just you


---------116:39----------
know


---------116:41----------
you know be in bed and i'll just you


---------116:43----------
know that never mind but the the point


---------116:45----------
is


---------116:45----------
it's not that i feel sad i see it as


---------116:49----------
that's the sacrifice i take and it


---------116:52----------
doesn't matter if


---------116:53----------
others i mean i'll fight it still don't


---------116:56----------
get me wrong so it does matter i don't


---------116:57----------
want to say it doesn't matter but


---------116:58----------
that's the sacrifice that's the l i take


---------117:01----------
knowing that there are people's lives


---------117:03----------
that are changing from what i'm doing


---------117:05----------
and knowing that in order to continue to


---------117:07----------
change lives i need to keep taking this


---------117:08----------
l


---------117:09----------
doing what i'm doing now on the other


---------117:11----------
hand


---------117:15----------
on the other hand what unmotivates me


---------117:20----------
is i'm cool with making that sacrifice


---------117:27----------
but what


---------117:30----------
makes me what chips away at me


---------117:33----------
is the people


---------117:37----------
that are the true villains


---------117:40----------
are praised as the heroes and given the


---------117:44----------
credibility of the heroes


---------117:47----------
which in line creates a system that's


---------117:50----------
never going to fix itself


---------117:52----------
because the very trickery that got us


---------117:54----------
into the problems of the system in the


---------117:56----------
first place


---------117:57----------
are continuously happening just evolving


---------118:00----------
to be more advanced


---------118:01----------
and then the people who actually are


---------118:04----------
putting


---------118:05----------
words into action and not just speaking


---------118:08----------
in this idealistic way but actually


---------118:09----------
putting the actions behind it


---------118:12----------
are seen as the villains and since the


---------118:14----------
villains


---------118:15----------
that are labeled as villains are the


---------118:17----------
ones that are actually proving with


---------118:19----------
action


---------118:20----------
and the heroes are only talking no


---------118:22----------
change


---------118:23----------
ever happens and we're stuck in this


---------118:25----------
perpetuating


---------118:27----------
endless circle of


---------118:30----------
corruption [ __ ] and trash


---------118:33----------
and no one can understand why this is


---------118:36----------
happening but what's that's happening


---------118:38----------
because no one can actually look into


---------118:39----------
themselves and realize


---------118:43----------
so does that make any sense so this time


---------118:47----------
i'm gonna say no i completely lost you


---------118:50----------
bro


---------118:51----------
when you started talking about


---------118:52----------
corruption and the real heroes


---------118:55----------
are being perceived as villains and the


---------118:57----------
villains are being perceived as heroes


---------118:59----------
and and like like i i could follow like


---------119:01----------
pieces of that but i feel like there's


---------119:03----------
just so much to that story


---------119:05----------
which you started to toss in which i i


---------119:07----------
honestly i don't i don't know like


---------119:09----------
what like who you're like i just don't


---------119:12----------
have the context


---------119:13----------
we talking about your english teacher


---------119:15----------
are we talking about


---------119:16----------
people on twitch are we talking about


---------119:19----------
people like talking


---------119:20----------
so i'm talking about the very thing that


---------119:24----------
that being so getting to a point of


---------119:26----------
self-awareness and getting a point of


---------119:28----------
knowing yourself


---------119:30----------
would bring this out in people i'm


---------119:32----------
talking so what i'm talking about


---------119:34----------
is


---------119:37----------
so what i'm saying is


---------119:41----------
train i gotta jump in for a second sorry


---------119:43----------
okay i'm sorry i i don't mean to leave


---------119:44----------
let's wrap it up


---------119:45----------
i'm sorry but but i just need clarity


---------119:47----------
for you i'm happy if you want to finish


---------119:48----------
that thought but i do have i


---------119:50----------
actually have a client this coming yeah


---------119:52----------
you're good i'm sorry yeah yeah


---------119:54----------
so do you do you want to learn how to


---------119:55----------
meditate or do you want to finish your


---------119:56----------
thoughts whichever okay let's meditate


---------119:58----------
and often i'll


---------119:59----------
i'll think more clearly and i'll come


---------120:01----------
back and next time more clear


---------120:02----------
okay yeah so i i didn't mean yes you


---------120:05----------
know i just i do no you're sort of


---------120:06----------
eliminated


---------120:07----------
actually you let me know four different


---------120:08----------
times i should have that was that was


---------120:10----------
shameless of me that's my fault nope


---------120:12----------
i mean i played ball right you would say


---------120:14----------
something and then i would get curious


---------120:15----------
because what you say is really


---------120:17----------
interesting


---------120:18----------
and i do feel like we could talk for 15


---------120:19----------
hours i i don't doubt that for a second


---------120:22----------
i think it'd be fun to like go camping


---------120:24----------
you know and just just hang out in the


---------120:26----------
wilderness for a while and and talk and


---------120:28----------
i get stuck in a rant because i


---------120:29----------
when i talk i see it yep so i


---------120:33----------
yeah so i just get stuck in a rant yeah


---------120:35----------
the reason i was i was jumping in there


---------120:36----------
is because i i


---------120:37----------
literally this is the first time i think


---------120:39----------
you've been really clear but i just


---------120:40----------
don't have the context to understand


---------120:42----------
what you were saying earlier yeah it


---------120:43----------
would take so yeah so let me ask you


---------120:46----------
um i kind of feel like doing a


---------120:48----------
particular practice today that's a


---------120:50----------
little bit different


---------120:51----------
do you want to repeat the do you think


---------120:53----------
it would be helpful to do the same


---------120:54----------
practice we did last time or try


---------120:56----------
something else


---------120:59----------
honestly i think


---------121:02----------
hey you know you take the reins and i'll


---------121:05----------
i'll ride with i'll write on you


---------121:07----------
i won't write on you that's a little


---------121:08----------
weird i'm so sorry i'll write


---------121:11----------
you lead i'll follow go ahead okay um


---------121:14----------
so let's so what i want you to sit up


---------121:17----------
straight


---------121:18----------
i'm gonna teach you a practice we


---------121:20----------
haven't done a little while for a little


---------121:21----------
while on stream but


---------121:23----------
it it's called charging the laser beam


---------121:25----------
and that's something that


---------121:27----------
that someone in chat came up with so


---------121:30----------
um the actual so this is a technique


---------121:32----------
that's uh


---------121:33----------
sort of an introductory practice to


---------121:35----------
third eye meditations


---------121:37----------
and third eye meditations are about


---------121:39----------
cultivating like insight


---------121:41----------
intuition and understanding that's


---------121:44----------
bizarre


---------121:44----------
but basically uh last time you know we


---------121:48----------
taught you a breath meditation so now


---------121:50----------
i'm going to teach you a meditation that


---------121:51----------
involves


---------121:52----------
focusing essentially just focusing on


---------121:54----------
your third eye so what i want you to do


---------121:56----------
is


---------121:56----------
um you know it's going to sound kind of


---------121:59----------
look weird but i want you to take


---------122:00----------
one finger i usually actually use the


---------122:02----------
middle finger which i know is


---------122:04----------
weird but there's a reason for that so


---------122:06----------
what we want to do is


---------122:07----------
is take your middle finger and actually


---------122:09----------
hover it


---------122:10----------
just sort of right between your eyebrows


---------122:12----------
don't touch yeah close your eyes


---------122:14----------
just hold it there for a second


---------122:17----------
and try to get close maybe like a


---------122:20----------
centimeter away


---------122:23----------
and focus just a little bit above your


---------122:25----------
eyebrows


---------122:27----------
sit up straight


---------122:31----------
i want you to just focus on any


---------122:33----------
sensations


---------122:35----------
in your forehead and tell me do you feel


---------122:44----------
anything


---------122:46----------
i feel my middle finger tickling the


---------122:48----------
little hairs of my forehead


---------122:50----------
okay so try to pull a little bit away


---------122:53----------
to where they can't touch


---------122:58----------
and focus on those sensations so if it's


---------123:00----------
actually


---------123:01----------
touch on hairs on your head you want to


---------123:04----------
pull a little bit further out


---------123:09----------
and just focus on that part of your


---------123:10----------
forehead


---------123:13----------
you can go ahead and relax your hand now


---------123:16----------
and let your


---------123:17----------
let your focus maintain on that point


---------123:21----------
okay and try to drive your attention


---------123:24----------
into it


---------123:29----------
okay


---------123:36----------
just keep pushing we'll practice for


---------123:37----------
about 60 or 90 seconds you can focus on


---------123:39----------
sensations


---------123:40----------
on of your forehead or just


---------123:45----------
moving into that spot


---------123:48----------
for lack of a better term oh i'm on that


---------123:51----------
spot right now


---------123:53----------
good keep your attention there


---------123:59----------
we'll go for about two minutes huh i


---------124:02----------
leaned back and i lost it give me a sec


---------124:03----------
here we go


---------124:04----------
okay all right let's go


---------124:58----------
now i want you to take your finger and


---------125:00----------
move it back to the spot


---------125:07----------
focus on your forehead


---------125:32----------
now relax your hand


---------125:36----------
we'll continue for about another minute


---------126:21----------
now i want you to take a deep breath in


---------126:23----------
through your nose


---------126:26----------
breathe out slowly


---------126:30----------
again


---------126:34----------
and out


---------126:40----------
and then in for a third time and super


---------126:44----------
slow


---------126:44----------
out of your nose super super slow


---------126:49----------
when you're ready open your eyes


---------126:57----------
