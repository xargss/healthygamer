---------00:52----------
i guess that's the biggest that's the


---------00:54----------
tip of the iceberg and i guess we're


---------00:56----------
gonna explore


---------00:57----------
deeper down as we as we go through


---------01:00----------

---------01:17----------
that's what you see like the behavior


---------01:20----------
that you observe is that you

you the computer is slowly ruining your


---------01:23----------
life


---------01:24----------
yeah yeah it's it's like it's not

---------01:54----------
you


---------01:54----------
say that the computer is slowly ruining


---------01:56----------
your life what does that mean


---------01:58----------
um i think i think the biggest thing


---------02:03----------
i mean by that is i have a lot of goals


---------02:06----------
outside


---------02:07----------
of electronic things uh


---------02:10----------
i want to learn bass guitar i think my


---------02:12----------
bass is in frame yeah i'm trying to


---------02:14----------
learn bass guitar


---------02:15----------
funny enough i need to use the computer


---------02:16----------
to learn bass guitar


---------02:19----------
i want to learn how to play right


---------02:20----------
skateboard a lot of


---------02:23----------
academic goals and sports goals i run


---------02:26----------
track and field


---------02:27----------
the university and it's


---------02:31----------
it's hard it's hard to run a track


---------02:33----------
practice on little amounts of sleep when


---------02:34----------
you're gaming all night


---------02:36----------
so


---------02:40----------
okay um


---------02:44----------
so it sounds like you're not happy with


---------02:46----------
yourself for not being able to achieve


---------02:48----------
your goals


---------02:50----------
yeah yeah there's a there's a lot of


---------02:53----------
frustration


---------02:54----------
um can you hold on just one second there


---------02:57----------
we go


---------02:59----------
i just realized i forgot to switch over


---------03:00----------
the overlay so people haven't been able


---------03:02----------
to see you


---------03:02----------
until now oh unlucky i'm not right


---------03:05----------
we fixed it thank you now now chad can


---------03:09----------
see me


---------03:09----------
you know prior to the computer we have


---------03:11----------
this boomer device called a phone


---------03:13----------
and sometimes my my team has to contact


---------03:16----------
me


---------03:17----------
it's like it's like a miniature computer


---------03:19----------
that can do very few things


---------03:21----------
dude that's that sounds really useful


---------03:23----------
and helpful


---------03:24----------
in your pocket it it it's like a device


---------03:28----------
that can solely do voice chat


---------03:30----------
well you can you can do dms sort of we


---------03:32----------
call them texts


---------03:34----------
whoa crazy kind of like emails kind of


---------03:37----------
like


---------03:37----------
short emails yeah it's like a short


---------03:39----------
email exactly yeah


---------03:41----------
um so you sound uh


---------03:45----------
oh a little bit frustrated that


---------03:48----------
you're you're not sort of achieving your


---------03:50----------
goals


---------03:52----------
yeah uh a little bit is kind of an


---------03:54----------
understatement um


---------03:57----------
there there are times when because i


---------04:00----------
used to i used to think i didn't have an


---------04:02----------
anger


---------04:03----------
and i used to kind of just like bury it


---------04:06----------
in a sense or maybe just ignore it not


---------04:08----------
kind of bury it because


---------04:09----------
it kind of just explodes but when


---------04:14----------
over the past year it came to points


---------04:16----------
where i just had nothing to do and i


---------04:17----------
didn't want to play video games


---------04:19----------
but i didn't know how to do anything


---------04:20----------
else right i didn't know how to go


---------04:21----------
skateboard


---------04:22----------
i couldn't practice space because i


---------04:23----------
didn't own one um i couldn't start


---------04:26----------
journaling because i didn't own any


---------04:27----------
journals


---------04:28----------
right so like the only thing i could do


---------04:30----------
while in quarantine


---------04:31----------
after i finished my homework uh was play


---------04:34----------
video games and


---------04:35----------
i guess when it came to the point where


---------04:38----------
i like acknowledged my anger


---------04:40----------
at myself um i don't know how to play


---------04:42----------
piano and i'm frustrated with that you


---------04:44----------
know i'm not


---------04:45----------
i'm not getting the grades that i wanted


---------04:46----------
to so i'm frustrated with that you know


---------04:48----------
i'm not


---------04:50----------
running the track and field times that i


---------04:51----------
wish i was you know and i'm frustrated


---------04:53----------
with that


---------04:54----------
it kind of just explodes and i got you


---------04:56----------
know i got to go take a


---------04:57----------
steaming walk outside and make sure it's


---------05:00----------
uh well steaming isn't i'm steaming


---------05:03----------
uh what what anybody explodes


---------05:07----------
well it kind of like my face gets red


---------05:11----------
um i can't focus on one thing


---------05:15----------
like i'll think about one thing that's


---------05:17----------
upsetting and then i'll just think about


---------05:18----------
the next thing then i'll just think


---------05:19----------
about the next thing and i'll just think


---------05:20----------
about the next thing


---------05:21----------
and it kind of just gets out of control


---------05:24----------
and all of a sudden i'm not thinking


---------05:25----------
about


---------05:25----------
what i initially thought about right and


---------05:27----------
all of a sudden i'm angry at my parents


---------05:29----------
or i'm angry at


---------05:30----------
politics or i'm angry at youtube or i'm


---------05:33----------
hanging angry at


---------05:35----------
the current smash bros meta right like


---------05:37----------
it doesn't matter


---------05:38----------
what it is i just i get just frustrated


---------05:42----------
with stuff


---------05:42----------
yeah yeah sometimes you know i'll joke


---------05:46----------
about people becoming


---------05:47----------
anger elementals


---------05:50----------
yeah and and what i'm sort of noticing


---------05:52----------
is that your anger will


---------05:53----------
find something like you feel the anger


---------05:57----------
and it seems like


---------05:58----------
it's looking for some kind of outlet to


---------06:00----------
latch onto whether it's parents or


---------06:03----------
the meta in a video game and that each


---------06:05----------
thing that you engage with


---------06:06----------
with like actually like boosts up the


---------06:08----------
anger more


---------06:10----------
yeah yeah yeah definitely that's it


---------06:13----------
that's a good way to put it


---------06:15----------
so help me understand um don


---------06:19----------
okay let me just lay a couple things out


---------06:21----------
okay so here's what i think we can talk


---------06:23----------
about


---------06:23----------
um you know i want to better understand


---------06:26----------
what


---------06:27----------
what it means when you say like computer


---------06:29----------
games are ruining your life


---------06:31----------
because what i see is you know you're


---------06:34----------
like


---------06:35----------
you seem to have a touch of the chad


---------06:37----------
within you like you're


---------06:39----------
in school you run track and field you


---------06:41----------
know


---------06:42----------
you're learning like you have a bass


---------06:43----------
guitar it sounds like you're not very


---------06:45----------
good but that


---------06:46----------
you know you're you know there's there's


---------06:49----------
i can imagine i know it sounds kind of


---------06:50----------
weird but like i can imagine that a lot


---------06:52----------
of people who are walking


---------06:53----------
uh watching would actually like envy


---------06:55----------
certain parts of your life and wish they


---------06:57----------
could do what you wanted to do


---------06:59----------
yeah so i'm curious about you know how


---------07:02----------
video games are ruining your life


---------07:05----------
i also think that we may wind up talking


---------07:08----------
a little bit about


---------07:09----------
you know two directions which is like


---------07:10----------
where does that anger come from because


---------07:12----------
it seems like


---------07:13----------
the anger can choose to get mad about


---------07:16----------
any sort of thing


---------07:17----------
and what we tend to do is we say when we


---------07:19----------
get mad about something that the thing


---------07:21----------
is where the anger is coming from


---------07:24----------
but if you like you know if you have


---------07:25----------
someone who's emotionally angry


---------07:27----------
they can get angry about anything and it


---------07:29----------
actually if you really pay attention it


---------07:31----------
seems like the anger is not


---------07:33----------
caused by politics or the smash brothers


---------07:35----------
meta


---------07:36----------
but that those are triggers for the


---------07:38----------
anger that's already inside


---------07:41----------
so we may talk about that and the last


---------07:43----------
thing that um


---------07:45----------
really i think this could be interesting


---------07:46----------
is we can try to understand like


---------07:48----------
why do you have these goals in the first


---------07:50----------
place like where do goals come from how


---------07:53----------
does our mind decide


---------07:54----------
hey i want to do this thing because what


---------07:56----------
you're doing is you're kind of setting a


---------07:58----------
goal for yourself and you're buying


---------07:59----------
yourself frustration


---------08:01----------
by not achieving it yeah


---------08:05----------
yeah it's a like a discounted price of


---------08:08----------
the anger ticket i guess exactly right


---------08:11----------
so that's a great that's a great way to


---------08:13----------
put it so what


---------08:14----------
does that sound okay to you do those


---------08:16----------
topics seem like they would interest you


---------08:17----------
or


---------08:18----------
be honest maybe okay i mean especially


---------08:20----------
because it's like


---------08:22----------
how i've seen i've seen streams i've


---------08:23----------
watched i love this i love this channel


---------08:25----------
dude this place is


---------08:26----------
this is not a cult no matter what uh


---------08:28----------
chat says


---------08:30----------
but i'm part of the dr k colts so


---------08:33----------
there it is it was a pro cult face


---------08:37----------
phrase there is of course and


---------08:40----------
so yeah i know how these streams can


---------08:43----------
kind of go


---------08:44----------
where we didn't even expect it so it's


---------08:45----------
like as long as we just get going and


---------08:47----------
get rolling


---------08:48----------
let's do it i'm telling you pumped and


---------08:50----------
excited how


---------08:51----------
are computer games ruining your life um


---------08:55----------
they i use them i use them to cope and i


---------08:59----------
use them


---------09:00----------
to use them instead of things that i


---------09:04----------
wish i was doing


---------09:06----------
that includes the talents and the things


---------09:07----------
i'm working on that includes hanging out


---------09:09----------
with friends or going on


---------09:10----------
with dates and i don't like playing


---------09:13----------
video games


---------09:14----------
as much as i used to um and


---------09:19----------
when i say as much as i used to i wanna


---------09:20----------
i wanna like go into that


---------09:22----------
like explain that a bit because uh


---------09:25----------
although i have a little bit like


---------09:26----------
sure like i have a touch of the chad


---------09:27----------
within me um it's it


---------09:30----------
i was the lucky one in my family to get


---------09:31----------
the chad within me


---------09:33----------
none of my friends none of my brothers


---------09:34----------
or sisters are athletic


---------09:36----------
uh my dad uh


---------09:39----------
actually i can't play basketball


---------09:41----------
ironically


---------09:43----------
because when i asked my dad to


---------09:46----------
teach me how to play basketball he said


---------09:47----------
he didn't know how to either then he


---------09:49----------
just took me inside and showed me his


---------09:50----------
gamecube because he loved gamecube


---------09:52----------
right and then we played rts's online


---------09:55----------
and dawn of war lord of the rings battle


---------09:58----------
for middle earth i mean


---------10:00----------
what all the age of empires uh


---------10:04----------
that i just gamed with him that's how we


---------10:06----------
bonded right


---------10:08----------
so video games kind of became


---------10:12----------
that thing for me right i


---------10:15----------
wouldn't just a quick question


---------10:19----------
why the the when you say it's ironic


---------10:21----------
that i can't play basketball is that


---------10:23----------
because you're black is that what you're


---------10:25----------
saying it's hard to see something there


---------10:27----------
uh there's a touch of it it's all jokes


---------10:29----------
have it's like a pie chart right so it's


---------10:31----------
like i am black


---------10:32----------
i'm athletic um i'm tall i'm like six


---------10:35----------
three and i have big hands and everyone


---------10:36----------
always assumes


---------10:38----------
i play basketball okay okay so it's not


---------10:40----------
just the color of your skin it's also


---------10:42----------
your height


---------10:42----------
and yeah i just wanted to understand why


---------10:45----------
why


---------10:46----------
is it ironic that you know a gamer can't


---------10:49----------
play basketball


---------10:50----------
i just lost me there yes i people people


---------10:52----------
i mean people never see me as a gamer


---------10:54----------
right they never


---------10:56----------
they never pictured me to be that guy


---------10:58----------
you know


---------11:00----------
um funny funny thing


---------11:03----------
well when i when i was a kid um i moved


---------11:06----------
into this new area and i was hanging out


---------11:07----------
with a bunch of guys


---------11:08----------
and these people were talking about


---------11:10----------
naruto and


---------11:12----------
one of my good friends today he wasn't a


---------11:14----------
good friend then because i was just


---------11:15----------
meeting him


---------11:16----------
he turned to me he's like don't pay


---------11:17----------
attention to those losers right he


---------11:18----------
literally said that


---------11:19----------
i was like dude what's wrong with naruto


---------11:21----------
like that show's sick and all the


---------11:23----------
losers like freaked out they're like oh


---------11:25----------
this guy knows


---------11:27----------
and he's one of us he's one of us


---------11:31----------
and uh it's funny though


---------11:35----------
he looks like a chad he had the heart of


---------11:37----------
a weeb


---------11:38----------
dude oh no i i try not to be a weeb


---------11:42----------
i try not to i can't sorry it sounded


---------11:45----------
like you're about to say something


---------11:46----------
important i couldn't help myself


---------11:47----------
well it kind of like it kind of goes


---------11:49----------
into


---------11:51----------
another facet of like why video games


---------11:53----------
and manga


---------11:55----------
and anime and comics are ruining my life


---------11:57----------
because


---------11:58----------
although like once i said like what's


---------12:01----------
wrong with naruto


---------12:02----------
all the chads in that group like


---------12:05----------
immediately dismissed me


---------12:06----------
like immediately like oh he's one of


---------12:08----------
them right not one of us


---------12:10----------
one of them and


---------12:13----------
throughout the school year like they


---------12:14----------
just they didn't invite me out as much


---------12:17----------
as they did


---------12:17----------
within that first week of me meeting


---------12:20----------
them


---------12:20----------
um i kind of hung out with those losers


---------12:24----------
quote unquote


---------12:25----------
um but their schedules and their


---------12:27----------
motivations and their goals didn't line


---------12:29----------
up


---------12:30----------
so much with what i kind of wanted to do


---------12:32----------
with my life


---------12:34----------
so i ended up just distancing myself


---------12:36----------
from that group


---------12:37----------
without having a connection to any other


---------12:39----------
group and i kind of just ended up alone


---------12:41----------
you know i kind of just


---------12:42----------
ended up playing video games by myself


---------12:44----------
for a long time


---------12:46----------
um and it that that kind of happens


---------12:49----------
uh a lot throughout my life and


---------12:53----------
it's that weird balance between being a


---------12:56----------
weeb


---------12:57----------
and being big gamer reddit mode


---------13:00----------
reddit chad uh


---------13:03----------
and kind of just being a normal person


---------13:05----------
quote unquote right


---------13:07----------
um it's it's caused a lot of friction


---------13:10----------
especially in high school and especially


---------13:12----------
in college like i'm in the middle of


---------13:13----------
college right now


---------13:14----------
and i mean people all they want to do is


---------13:18----------
party dude


---------13:19----------
i just i just want to play hearthstone


---------13:21----------
that's all i want to do


---------13:24----------
how do you feel about yourself for just


---------13:26----------
wanting to play hearthstone


---------13:28----------
dude at times like a loser i'm like dude


---------13:31----------
i really am a loser like what


---------13:32----------
what the heck i can't not go out right


---------13:36----------
or i can't not stay in


---------13:38----------
um i mean a couple weeks ago i like


---------13:41----------
binged all of attack on titan in like


---------13:43----------
three days


---------13:43----------
from friday to sunday instead of doing


---------13:46----------
anything else


---------13:47----------
including working out right um and that


---------13:49----------
like i i skipped


---------13:50----------
i got sent workouts by my coach for the


---------13:52----------
summer he's like hey use these


---------13:54----------
uh and get in shape and i just stayed in


---------13:57----------
watched anime all day at night and


---------14:03----------
i'm super ashamed to it i know he'll


---------14:05----------
never watch this so i can say it


---------14:06----------
i mean i ended up lying to him on monday


---------14:08----------
i was like yeah i did the workout and


---------14:09----------
these were my times


---------14:11----------
this is what i did


---------14:14----------
i just felt super ashamed and angry at


---------14:16----------
myself for that right


---------14:18----------
like not only can i not just go work out


---------14:20----------
because the workout only took like an


---------14:21----------
hour and a half right i can


---------14:23----------
pause attack on titan for an hour and a


---------14:24----------
half and come back and watch it right


---------14:27----------
but i mean i apparently didn't then


---------14:30----------
you'll lose the race


---------14:31----------
of watching attack on titan within a


---------14:33----------
whole weekend before anyone else and


---------14:35----------
then it's just like


---------14:37----------
i even watched it and it's it's not done


---------14:39----------
right it's not caught up to the manga


---------14:40----------
immediately as soon as the last episode


---------14:42----------
ended i just hopped onto my manga


---------14:44----------
website and just read the rest of it


---------14:46----------
like i just i couldn't not stop i needed


---------14:49----------
to consume


---------14:51----------
the whole thing


---------14:55----------
and then i was done you know and it's


---------14:58----------
it's kind of with everything right uh i


---------15:01----------
read the boys all in one weekend the


---------15:03----------
comic out there


---------15:04----------
like the boys in berserk are two two


---------15:07----------
comics that i read when i was relatively


---------15:08----------
young


---------15:09----------
when i was like 13 14. and those are


---------15:12----------
pretty heavy manga and comics to read


---------15:16----------
you know heavy subject heavy


---------15:19----------
concepts and i just read it all in a


---------15:21----------
weekend even though it's like training


---------15:23----------
on me mentally


---------15:23----------
and i just and like looking back now


---------15:26----------
when i think about my 13 year old little


---------15:27----------
brother i was like dude


---------15:28----------
i don't even want him to think about


---------15:29----------
berserk right it's just such a


---------15:32----------
kind of graphic subject matter


---------15:36----------
and i even though i felt drained


---------15:40----------
reading it i just flew right through it


---------15:43----------
i needed to right


---------15:44----------
i wouldn't allow myself to not stop


---------15:48----------
what does it mean to need to consume


---------15:50----------
what does that need


---------15:55----------
it's it feels like


---------16:00----------
at times like i i'll end up looking at


---------16:02----------
myself i'm like man i'm just a machine


---------16:04----------
like i just i input these i input this


---------16:07----------
material whether it's the primal tv show


---------16:10----------
right the cartoon network samurai jack


---------16:12----------
or adventure time or anything and


---------16:16----------
i log it right i catalog it like oh i


---------16:18----------
know all of this stuff


---------16:20----------
i know all the lurthering fun facts


---------16:22----------
right i know all the harry potter


---------16:24----------
secrets


---------16:25----------
and then i just move on to the next one


---------16:27----------
you know it's like i


---------16:28----------
i feel like i'm just trying to fill


---------16:30----------
something that i can't be filled


---------16:32----------
you know when i look back at it when i


---------16:34----------
when i'm in it when i'm in the mode


---------16:36----------
i'm just enjoying it right i'm watching


---------16:38----------
it i'm just doing what feels natural


---------16:40----------
you know and it's in a sense and like


---------16:42----------
i'm like oh just watch just watch just


---------16:44----------
watch


---------16:45----------
when i look back i'm like man what did i


---------16:46----------
just do like i just skipped workouts for


---------16:49----------
this


---------16:49----------
i just it's going to be there right it's


---------16:51----------
going to be there in 10 years


---------16:53----------
watch it then you know don the way that


---------16:57----------
you're


---------16:57----------
talking about it actually makes me think


---------17:00----------
about addiction


---------17:02----------
so what you're describing to me like


---------17:04----------
actually reminds me of like


---------17:05----------
patients that go on benders


---------17:09----------
you know like like and they kind of like


---------17:12----------
wake up


---------17:13----------
the next like you wake up on wednesday


---------17:15----------
morning and you kind of look around and


---------17:16----------
you're like oh my god


---------17:19----------
where did where what happened where did


---------17:22----------
my


---------17:22----------
time go what have i been it's like it's


---------17:24----------
sort of like there's like a very cloudy


---------17:26----------
awareness


---------17:27----------
that feels like primal and hedonistic


---------17:32----------
you know and then and you're not really


---------17:34----------
like you just need to consume it sounds


---------17:37----------
very


---------17:39----------
you know base to me yeah yeah


---------17:42----------
i can definitely see it like that


---------17:44----------
especially


---------17:47----------
i mean it's like the hangover gamer


---------17:49----------
edition right i guess


---------17:50----------
like it just


---------17:54----------
i don't text people while i do it i


---------17:56----------
guess as well like i just


---------17:58----------
like if someone reaches out to me i like


---------18:01----------
won't respond


---------18:02----------
or i'll say like sorry i'm busy doing


---------18:04----------
something else


---------18:06----------
and what goes through your head when you


---------18:09----------
say sorry i'm busy


---------18:12----------
not much it kind of just


---------18:18----------
like that's it like i just say like


---------18:19----------
sorry i got it


---------18:21----------
like i don't want to it's not saying


---------18:22----------
like man i gotta think of this


---------18:24----------
convoluted plot to convince them i'm


---------18:27----------
busy


---------18:28----------
it's like i i don't want to go hang out


---------18:30----------
with them so i'm just going to tell them


---------18:31----------
i'm busy


---------18:32----------
yeah not not so much like oh i got a


---------18:35----------
front that i'm so active outside you


---------18:38----------
know


---------18:39----------
yeah so i i know it sounds kind of weird


---------18:42----------
but


---------18:43----------
you know what what do you think it is


---------18:44----------
that you're trying to fill up


---------18:46----------
with all of the anime


---------18:50----------
um it could just be time uh


---------18:55----------
it's always come to a point like the


---------18:58----------
reason why i'm reaching out now


---------18:59----------
in a sense is because i've never before


---------19:02----------
skipped workouts


---------19:03----------
to watch anime or watch a show or play


---------19:05----------
video games


---------19:06----------
or read a comic i've always been able to


---------19:08----------
like


---------19:10----------
parallel them within my life you know


---------19:12----------
keep them separate like i got to work


---------19:13----------
out now i got to get up for 4 a.m


---------19:15----------
workouts so i'm going to bed at 8 30


---------19:17----------
right i'm gonna


---------19:18----------
i'm gonna do what i need to do to make


---------19:20----------
sure my outside life


---------19:22----------
is successful um


---------19:26----------
within the past within the past year


---------19:28----------
it's kind of just


---------19:30----------
spiraled out of control you know yeah


---------19:32----------
and a lot a lot of it could be


---------19:34----------
because like school canceled and


---------19:36----------
workouts were canceled i was like dude


---------19:38----------
all the time in the world to play video


---------19:39----------
games like i can do what i've been


---------19:41----------
wanting to do


---------19:42----------
since i was 11 years old and


---------19:46----------
man again i just consumed like i just i


---------19:48----------
got this game


---------19:49----------
called vermintide 2 for my dad for my uh


---------19:52----------
for birthday present


---------19:54----------
and i just played the heck out of it i


---------19:56----------
mean all summer i just played and played


---------19:58----------
and played


---------19:59----------
and then i got guild wars 2. it like it


---------20:01----------
doesn't matter what kind of game


---------20:02----------
you know like whatever game i just get


---------20:05----------
attached to


---------20:06----------
slay the spire played a lot of like


---------20:09----------
i'll get it for one weekend and i'll


---------20:12----------
play it for like


---------20:13----------
30 40 hours within five six days


---------20:17----------
and then i'll kind of get sick of it and


---------20:19----------
then i'll move on and


---------20:21----------
i mean perfect example is this last


---------20:23----------
christmas break when school was a thing


---------20:25----------
so in


---------20:26----------
2019 to 2020 christmas break


---------20:29----------
um i bought myself a christmas present


---------20:32----------
of


---------20:33----------
uh star wars knights of the republic one


---------20:35----------
and two


---------20:36----------
and for those two weeks i i spent


---------20:39----------
like 41 hours on the first game and then


---------20:42----------
the next week i spent like 36 hours on


---------20:44----------
the second game


---------20:45----------
i just beat it and i just played right


---------20:47----------
through and then like


---------20:50----------
i'll like look at like snapchat like


---------20:52----------
instagram and i'll be like seeing all


---------20:53----------
these people going on trips


---------20:55----------
and hanging out with hanging out with


---------20:57----------
each other and like


---------20:58----------
hanging out like down the street right


---------21:00----------
they're hanging out in the city right


---------21:02----------
next to i live


---------21:03----------
i'm like man it'd be fun to it'd be fun


---------21:04----------
to uh go hang out


---------21:06----------
i'll just continue to game right i won't


---------21:09----------
even reach out to them


---------21:11----------
i like i'll get angry at them for not


---------21:13----------
reaching out to me


---------21:14----------
i'd be like oh i wouldn't be playing


---------21:16----------
this video game if they reached out to


---------21:17----------
me


---------21:17----------
you know and like these guys love me


---------21:20----------
they would be so down to hang out with


---------21:22----------
me if i reached out to them


---------21:23----------
like i get in this point where i'm like


---------21:25----------
angry at them for not reaching out to me


---------21:27----------
so i like


---------21:28----------
just continue playing you know


---------21:31----------
that makes sense is that is that a makes


---------21:33----------
a lot of sense


---------21:34----------
can maybe i can share with you what i


---------21:37----------
heard and then you tell me if it makes


---------21:38----------
sense


---------21:40----------
so i i am getting the sense that you you


---------21:42----------
really do have like almost like this


---------21:43----------
kind of


---------21:44----------
compulsion kind of thing where like


---------21:46----------
you'll you'll sort of like willingly


---------21:48----------
kind of


---------21:48----------
dive into this right and you'll come up


---------21:51----------
for


---------21:52----------
air like a week later and then it it's


---------21:55----------
in those moments of like


---------21:56----------
when your head breaks the surface of the


---------21:58----------
water and you're like looking around


---------22:00----------
that you're like oh


---------22:01----------
hold on there's a life that exists


---------22:03----------
outside of this


---------22:05----------
and then you'll kind of blame yourself


---------22:07----------
for diving underwater for so long you'll


---------22:10----------
blame other people for not pulling you


---------22:12----------
above water


---------22:14----------
there's like some amount of


---------22:15----------
self-loathing like you know you'll blame


---------22:17----------
anything and everything for


---------22:20----------
putting you into these situations and


---------22:22----------
then you take a deep breath and then you


---------22:23----------
play cotor2


---------22:27----------
yeah right that's well put that's why


---------22:30----------
you're the doctor man the cult leader


---------22:32----------
i mean you're the one who shared it bro


---------22:35----------
i'm just


---------22:36----------
repeating it back um


---------22:40----------
and so what do you think it is that you


---------22:42----------
know what goes through your head between


---------22:44----------
kotor 1 and kotor 2


---------22:48----------
um or is that is that really was it was


---------22:51----------
there not did you not come up for air


---------22:53----------
between those two


---------22:54----------
yeah i don't think i came up here


---------22:55----------
between those two i mean it just


---------22:57----------
and the the problem is is i those games


---------23:01----------
are


---------23:01----------
some of the best games of all time i


---------23:03----------
freaking i love those games and i


---------23:05----------
recommend them to everybody


---------23:06----------
i bought them for my cousin because i


---------23:08----------
was like yo dude you need


---------23:09----------
this game and it's like i enjoy


---------23:13----------
the things i do like these binges i


---------23:15----------
enjoy the the characters


---------23:17----------
i enjoy reading like i read the


---------23:19----------
invincible comics


---------23:20----------
like when i was like 18 and i read them


---------23:24----------
all in like


---------23:24----------
a week like again a weekend and i just


---------23:26----------
loved it and


---------23:28----------
then the show came out and i was like


---------23:29----------
dude i'm so


---------23:31----------
pumped and it's actually actually a


---------23:33----------
funny story because i was hanging out


---------23:34----------
with a girl and i was scrolling through


---------23:36----------
youtube


---------23:37----------
and we were talking and i could like


---------23:39----------
tell like things were moving to a point


---------23:41----------
of like


---------23:41----------
physical intimacy right and then i saw


---------23:44----------
the trailer for invincible


---------23:45----------
on youtube i was like there i have to


---------23:47----------
watch this like you


---------23:49----------
are going to be put on pause for like 10


---------23:51----------
minutes so i can watch this


---------23:53----------
and then i then i think jk simmons was


---------23:56----------
like the voice act i was just losing my


---------23:57----------
mind i was like there's


---------23:58----------
and i ended up nothing happening because


---------24:00----------
i was so worked up on invincible in this


---------24:03----------
new show coming out and it was it's just


---------24:05----------
a funny thing


---------24:06----------
kind of just like how my priorities like


---------24:09----------
shift to like these


---------24:11----------
these mediums of entertainment you know


---------24:14----------
whatever it is


---------24:16----------
don i'm getting the sense that you're


---------24:17----------
kind of stuck between two worlds


---------24:21----------
like yeah yeah uh


---------24:25----------
continue sorry sorry i was just agreeing


---------24:27----------
with you


---------24:29----------
how tell me about that


---------24:32----------
um


---------24:35----------
and again you guys know i'm i run track


---------24:37----------
and field and it's not that i just run


---------24:38----------
track and field like i'm


---------24:39----------
i'm pretty good and i have a lot of


---------24:42----------
potential


---------24:43----------
and i mean like putting it say i


---------24:45----------
wouldn't be able to pay for college


---------24:46----------
without track and field you know


---------24:48----------
like without it's basically like a job


---------24:51----------
and it's not


---------24:51----------
only it's


---------24:55----------
it can be a lifestyle there's people


---------24:59----------
and new people who would go to college


---------25:00----------
just to be the track athlete


---------25:02----------
at their favorite college and


---------25:05----------
to me it was always kind of just like


---------25:07----------
something that i saw and i was like


---------25:08----------
that's weird that they


---------25:10----------
care about track this much and


---------25:13----------
then i would come you know come to these


---------25:15----------
binges and i come out and kind of be


---------25:16----------
jealous


---------25:16----------
of them right because they're going to


---------25:18----------
the parties they're


---------25:21----------
you know like them just running track


---------25:23----------
and field is like what they


---------25:25----------
desire and what they strive for right


---------25:27----------
and me being blessed and talented


---------25:30----------
at kind of just being a means to the end


---------25:34----------
a means to an end


---------25:35----------
right i just i feel like what's


---------25:39----------
like i want to be part of that right and


---------25:40----------
like like we've kind of pointed out


---------25:42----------
before it's like


---------25:42----------
so i'll try to push myself towards that


---------25:44----------
right but it'll be friction and it'll be


---------25:46----------
kind of unwanted because i've never been


---------25:48----------
a partier you know i don't drink i don't


---------25:50----------
smoke i don't


---------25:51----------
know do anything like that and kind of


---------25:54----------
just trying to like fit myself in these


---------25:56----------
placeholders and like


---------26:01----------
cause


---------26:08----------
um


---------26:11----------
when i think about it i'm really


---------26:15----------
really close with my family and i'm


---------26:18----------
really close with


---------26:19----------
friends that are like like family you


---------26:21----------
know um


---------26:24----------
and i think when i when i kind of self


---------26:26----------
analyze myself like that's where a lot


---------26:28----------
of this is coming from


---------26:30----------
uh my fam they game that that's my thing


---------26:33----------
that's my family thing we have this huge


---------26:34----------
land room in our living room where like


---------26:36----------
there's four pcs set up


---------26:38----------
and all of us have steam accounts and


---------26:39----------
all of us buy these games and we'll just


---------26:41----------
play from


---------26:42----------
like 3 p.m to 2 a.m right we'll buy


---------26:45----------
terraria when there's a


---------26:47----------
when it's on sale and we'll just grind


---------26:49----------
and we'll just play it and play it and


---------26:50----------
play it


---------26:51----------
we'll order pizza it doesn't matter


---------26:54----------
that's just


---------26:55----------
what we do and


---------26:59----------
it didn't it didn't like really occur to


---------27:00----------
me like how unhealthy that can be


---------27:04----------
uh for kids because i mean i started


---------27:07----------
doing that when i was like 11.


---------27:09----------
i when terraria first came out like my


---------27:11----------
dad and i played terraria until like


---------27:13----------
3 a.m for like four nights in a row and


---------27:16----------
that's one of like some of the greatest


---------27:17----------
memories i have with my dad you know


---------27:20----------
but when i think back to him like i'm a


---------27:22----------
nutrition major right i'm learning about


---------27:23----------
how


---------27:24----------
important sleep is for young kids i was


---------27:26----------
like holy cow what was my dad doing like


---------27:28----------
why didn't he just tell me to go to bed


---------27:29----------
and we could just play in the morning


---------27:30----------
you know


---------27:31----------
and i come back and i see i see my


---------27:33----------
younger brothers doing that thing


---------27:34----------
the same the same type of patterns and


---------27:36----------
safe type of things and like going


---------27:37----------
through the same struggles


---------27:39----------
i went through you know as a teenager


---------27:41----------
and a lot of that's just teenager


---------27:42----------
struggles right


---------27:44----------
it's tough being a junior high kid um


---------27:48----------
and i get angry right like like like


---------27:51----------
like like we said earlier i get i get


---------27:52----------
mad


---------27:54----------
and i also get mad that like that's how


---------27:57----------
we


---------27:58----------
again like that's what i care about like


---------27:59----------
i care about my family


---------28:01----------
that's how we bond you know why does


---------28:03----------
that make you angry


---------28:07----------
um a big thing


---------28:10----------
is because i've put so much time so much


---------28:12----------
of my time


---------28:14----------
as a youth into


---------28:18----------
these useless games like on war 3 is one


---------28:21----------
of the greatest


---------28:22----------
rts games of all time in my mind right


---------28:25----------
and i put


---------28:25----------
hundreds of hours into it like i look at


---------28:28----------
them think of myself like what if i put


---------28:29----------
hundreds of hours


---------28:30----------
into like drawing right or theater


---------28:34----------
or bass guitar or skateboard right


---------28:37----------
something that would something that just


---------28:40----------
doesn't


---------28:41----------
leave me empty you know something that


---------28:44----------
doesn't


---------28:46----------
kind of just drain me like it does and i


---------28:48----------
get mad


---------28:49----------
because i get mad that i didn't have


---------28:53----------
the supervisors or like the adult


---------28:55----------
supervision to


---------28:57----------
ward me against that you know and i i i


---------29:00----------
don't have a problem with video games in


---------29:02----------
moderation


---------29:03----------
like but when i go through these binges


---------29:05----------
and i go


---------29:06----------
and i look back how many hours i've


---------29:08----------
wasted on cs go


---------29:09----------
like that's just it's so pointless


---------29:13----------
right i'm not i don't want to go pro why


---------29:14----------
am i spending so much time on this


---------29:16----------
like i could be doing literally anything


---------29:18----------
and it's like i could be reading you


---------29:20----------
know i've so


---------29:20----------
i've bought so many books i've gotten to


---------29:22----------
like the last four chapters


---------29:24----------
and then like i just fizzle out you know


---------29:28----------
don it sounds to me like you've wasted a


---------29:30----------
fair amount of your life or lost a fair


---------29:33----------
amount of your life


---------29:36----------
yeah yeah it's a it's a big


---------29:39----------
it could be especially especially from


---------29:41----------
ages like 10


---------29:43----------
to like 17 i just as so my parents got


---------29:47----------
divorced when i was


---------29:48----------
10 years old and


---------29:52----------
they


---------29:56----------
it's hard seeing your parents go through


---------29:58----------
divorce


---------29:59----------
when you're not old enough to kind of


---------30:00----------
understand why you're not young enough


---------30:03----------
to like just accept it as is you know um


---------30:08----------
it's it's hard seeing like kind of


---------30:11----------
seeing your parents


---------30:12----------
break down because you have these these


---------30:14----------
like immortal pictures of your parents


---------30:16----------
in your mind and then seeing them just


---------30:19----------
kind of be


---------30:21----------
human and like worthless in your mind uh


---------30:25----------
like again i just like there was one


---------30:27----------
time


---------30:29----------
my dad was like feeding us you know fish


---------30:31----------
sticks because that's all he had and


---------30:33----------
he just couldn't stop shaking because of


---------30:34----------
how sad he was and i remember like


---------30:36----------
looking like


---------30:37----------
like he like that's so like that's so


---------30:40----------
sad you know i just thought that and


---------30:42----------
then my mom kind of just


---------30:44----------
reclused herself right and i guess


---------30:47----------
i guess from that point like it's where


---------30:49----------
these


---------30:51----------
i just kind of threw myself into video


---------30:52----------
games and i we had the lurthering discs


---------30:55----------
at home the lord movie discs i just


---------30:58----------
consumed all of it


---------31:00----------
i went through every special features i


---------31:02----------
went through every second of the movie


---------31:04----------
and i watched every little bit of it


---------31:05----------
i did that with like every movie i ended


---------31:07----------
up going through like this


---------31:09----------
because back in the 2000s right we had


---------31:10----------
these huge cd


---------31:12----------
cases or like these little pan flips


---------31:14----------
like


---------31:15----------
cd books right and i would we had tons


---------31:19----------
of them and i would just watch


---------31:20----------
over and over and over and i'd went


---------31:22----------
through every single one of them it


---------31:23----------
didn't matter what it was right


---------31:24----------
i remember watching uh live laugh love


---------31:27----------
when i was like 10 years old or like 11


---------31:28----------
years old


---------31:29----------
and it's super chick flicky movie but it


---------31:32----------
just it didn't matter to me


---------31:33----------
right it was like that's the next one


---------31:35----------
next cd


---------31:37----------
right and it's like thinking back i'm


---------31:38----------
like wow like that's that was a


---------31:40----------
real girly movie but


---------31:44----------
don what was it like


---------31:48----------
what did you understand about your


---------31:50----------
parents divorce can you


---------31:53----------
um i just understood they were splitting


---------31:57----------
uh they're pretty volatile at times


---------32:01----------
and i under i i knew within myself that


---------32:04----------
it wasn't good


---------32:06----------
like what was going on um


---------32:10----------
and that that's about it i didn't


---------32:13----------
you know when they uh i feel like every


---------32:16----------
kid


---------32:16----------
like secretly has like the good guy


---------32:20----------
in their mind when parents get divorced


---------32:24----------
um unless it's just outright bad or it's


---------32:26----------
actually done really well um


---------32:29----------
what is it a good guy like


---------32:32----------
uh the the aggressor in the divorce and


---------32:36----------
like


---------32:36----------
the one who's getting the short end of


---------32:38----------
the stick right or the one


---------32:39----------
once you did nothing wrong in your mind


---------32:41----------
the villain right the villain and the


---------32:44----------
i see the villain and the hero so who is


---------32:46----------
the who is the villain


---------32:47----------
and who is the hero in your parents


---------32:49----------
divorce


---------32:51----------
for me like i just saw them both as


---------32:53----------
villains in a sense like it i was like


---------32:55----------
this is


---------32:56----------
like there wasn't both of them


---------33:00----------
had their issues right like i can see


---------33:02----------
that and i was like this


---------33:03----------
like i don't like this i don't like this


---------33:05----------
at all you know


---------33:07----------
i wasn't like oh if mom would stop


---------33:09----------
yelling at him or if like


---------33:10----------
if dad would stop hitting her like like


---------33:13----------
like my dad


---------33:14----------
didn't you know do anything super


---------33:16----------
destructive and it's like


---------33:19----------
there was no moments like oh like i need


---------33:21----------
to protect so and so in my mind right or


---------33:24----------
like i'm gonna put up it's like i kind


---------33:26----------
of just like that's like this is bad


---------33:28----------
this is not good i don't like any of


---------33:30----------
this


---------33:32----------
you know what what was in your mind


---------33:36----------
i don't remember a lot of it i remember


---------33:40----------
feelings you know the feelings of it bad


---------33:42----------
but like a lot of it was kind of


---------33:45----------
not blocked out or forgotten but i don't


---------33:46----------
know i just i remember


---------33:48----------
like few key moments i remember watching


---------33:50----------
my dad walk out of the house


---------33:53----------
from the window and his friend came and


---------33:55----------
picked him up


---------33:56----------
um


---------34:00----------
and that's that's about it from like it


---------34:03----------
was like


---------34:05----------
from ages like one to


---------34:09----------
like eight i remember


---------34:12----------
you know just being a normal kid growing


---------34:14----------
up playing ghost in the graveyard


---------34:16----------
outside


---------34:18----------
um and then


---------34:21----------
again like those few key things i


---------34:23----------
remember going on a trip


---------34:25----------
with my dad when they were still


---------34:26----------
together so my parents were still


---------34:27----------
together


---------34:28----------
i went on a trip with my dad to montana


---------34:30----------
and my mom didn't want to come with us


---------34:33----------
i remember that and i remember being


---------34:35----------
weirded out by that like my mom and my


---------34:36----------
older sister like stayed home


---------34:38----------
like why it's a family trip we should


---------34:39----------
all go um and it just didn't make sense


---------34:41----------
to me


---------34:43----------
um and that


---------34:46----------
and that like those few big things and


---------34:49----------
like a general feeling of like


---------34:50----------
i don't like this like i don't like this


---------34:53----------
uneasiness i don't like this tension


---------34:55----------
i don't like how quiet the house is you


---------34:57----------
know or things like that


---------35:01----------
and what were things like after they got


---------35:02----------
divorced


---------35:06----------
um


---------35:09----------
you know physically it was pretty


---------35:13----------
weird uh going from one house to the


---------35:16----------
other


---------35:17----------
i didn't like that very much um


---------35:21----------
it was also weird because we moved


---------35:25----------
within the same neighborhood


---------35:26----------
so like my parents my mom the original


---------35:29----------
house was right here


---------35:30----------
and then my mom just moved like two


---------35:33----------
streets down


---------35:34----------
so we're so my dad kept well


---------35:38----------
how initial out initially what my dad


---------35:40----------
left


---------35:41----------
and was staying with friends and we'd go


---------35:44----------
to the friend's house


---------35:45----------
and like spend time with his with his


---------35:47----------
friends or


---------35:49----------
with him and then my mom ended up


---------35:52----------
leaving the original house two doors


---------35:54----------
down like two streets down


---------35:56----------
then my dad ended up moving back into


---------35:58----------
the original house


---------35:59----------
and like i'd we'd just walk back and


---------36:04----------
forth


---------36:05----------
like the weekends and it was really


---------36:06----------
weird because i mean he was just down


---------36:08----------
the street


---------36:08----------
you know and like mentally in my mind he


---------36:11----------
was just down the street but like we


---------36:12----------
couldn't go see him


---------36:13----------
i couldn't go hang out with him and that


---------36:15----------
was kind of weird it was also weird


---------36:17----------
because he didn't have like any


---------36:18----------
furniture


---------36:19----------
so it was just like an empty house and


---------36:22----------
we got we got pretty poor at times


---------36:24----------
because like one time like the water was


---------36:25----------
turned off


---------36:26----------
and like i had to go to the neighbor's


---------36:27----------
house and ask for water so we can like


---------36:29----------
pour it into the uh


---------36:31----------
into the toilet so we can flush that was


---------36:33----------
that was really gross all the time


---------36:34----------
especially if like my younger siblings


---------36:36----------
didn't tell us they used the restroom


---------36:38----------
because they just forgot and i was like


---------36:39----------
oh and i'd come to an awful surprise


---------36:42----------
um


---------36:46----------
then then we moved again my mom moved


---------36:48----------
again


---------36:49----------
like down the street to like another


---------36:51----------
apartment


---------36:53----------
and like the reason why we did this is


---------36:55----------
we wanted to stay within the


---------36:56----------
neighborhood and


---------36:57----------
stay within school right we didn't want


---------36:59----------
to move schools sure


---------37:01----------
and then my dad ended up moving


---------37:04----------
all over the place all over the state we


---------37:07----------
lived in


---------37:08----------
and again i just i didn't didn't like it


---------37:11----------
i didn't like going to different houses


---------37:12----------
for the weekend


---------37:14----------
i didn't like the fact that like we


---------37:16----------
couldn't just get back together


---------37:18----------
right because i remember watching mrs


---------37:19----------
doubtfire


---------37:21----------
right and like thinking to myself i'm


---------37:23----------
like wow like


---------37:26----------
they're just so good for each other they


---------37:28----------
should just get back together right


---------37:29----------
that's what you kind of think when


---------37:30----------
you're a kid you're like


---------37:31----------
robin williams is such a hero right then


---------37:34----------
you know they


---------37:34----------
now i look back i'm like well they


---------37:36----------
didn't end back together because you


---------37:37----------
know they're adults and they make their


---------37:38----------
decisions


---------37:40----------
um as a kid i kind of really didn't see


---------37:42----------
that i was like


---------37:43----------
just say sorry figure it out right like


---------37:46----------
let's let's raise above


---------37:49----------
our sinful states i guess


---------37:54----------
what's wrong with that with wanting to


---------37:57----------
raise above


---------37:58----------
yeah i don't think there's much i don't


---------38:01----------
think


---------38:03----------
there's much to the desire but kind of


---------38:06----------
like my reaction it kind of just made me


---------38:07----------
angry like again it just made me


---------38:09----------
upset that they weren't doing what i


---------38:11----------
wanted right


---------38:12----------
it made me angry say that with them that


---------38:14----------
you wanted them to get back together


---------38:17----------
um i don't think so


---------38:21----------
uh we didn't there wasn't a lot of


---------38:25----------
parent-to-kid communication


---------38:29----------
i should say i should say there wasn't a


---------38:30----------
lot of mother-to-son communication


---------38:33----------
or father-to-son communication there was


---------38:35----------
a lot of parent-to-kid communication as


---------38:36----------
in they fed me


---------38:37----------
they kept me warm they kept me clothed


---------38:40----------
right they made sure i was in sports


---------38:43----------
they sent me to school but i mean when i


---------38:46----------
would come home from school


---------38:48----------
i'd say like how was your day i was like


---------38:49----------
sick it was fun super pogers


---------38:51----------
right then i just sit on the computer


---------38:56----------
watch some movies and then i wouldn't


---------38:59----------
see them again until dinner


---------39:00----------
then we'd have some dinner and i


---------39:02----------
wouldn't see them for the rest of the


---------39:04----------
night


---------39:04----------
you know how does your dad feel about


---------39:06----------
your gaming


---------39:10----------
um just sees it as normal


---------39:14----------
i feel about his gaming yeah i don't


---------39:17----------
like it


---------39:18----------
i don't like it at all i don't like kind


---------39:21----------
of


---------39:21----------
any of the family gaming because i can


---------39:23----------
see i see my


---------39:25----------
again like that period where i just go


---------39:26----------
hide in the computer


---------39:28----------
i see that in my younger siblings you


---------39:30----------
know i see that and what


---------39:32----------
is going on with them and i'm like dad


---------39:35----------
like that


---------39:35----------
that's your kid man go talk to him i'm


---------39:38----------
like


---------39:39----------
oh have an argument and then next week


---------39:42----------
make up


---------39:43----------
and then next week have another argument


---------39:44----------
right and then make up and then


---------39:46----------
develop that kind of bridge between them


---------39:49----------
you know


---------39:51----------
and i'm confused who's who's having an


---------39:53----------
argument


---------39:54----------
are you saying that you argue with your


---------39:55----------
dad or that your dad should argue with


---------39:57----------
the kids so that you guys would kill


---------39:58----------
your relationship


---------40:00----------
you should argue with the kid to build a


---------40:01----------
relationship right


---------40:03----------
um i said argue but it could be like


---------40:06----------
anything go talk with them go


---------40:07----------
do anything um like where we are now


---------40:11----------
is like my dad will be playing a video


---------40:13----------
game


---------40:15----------
and then


---------40:18----------
my two younger brothers will get in this


---------40:20----------
huge fight and then one of them will


---------40:22----------
start crying and then my dad's attentive


---------40:25----------
he's like what's going on


---------40:25----------
right what's what's happening right and


---------40:27----------
then he has to play catch up for


---------40:29----------
everything he wasn't paying attention to


---------40:31----------
and then it just you know ends up


---------40:35----------
and the thing is we live in like we i


---------40:37----------
used i don't live with them anymore but


---------40:40----------
we used to live in like a two-room


---------40:41----------
apartment so like


---------40:43----------
everybody in the room had to pay


---------40:46----------
attention


---------40:47----------
to the argument that was going on with


---------40:49----------
between


---------40:50----------
like the discussion and there are times


---------40:52----------
like six of us in a two-room apartment


---------40:53----------
so it's like


---------40:55----------
you get a lot of emotions and i don't


---------40:57----------
know and i like seeing that now


---------40:59----------
i'm like either a


---------41:02----------
the argument would be avoided because


---------41:06----------
my dad would be able to nip the problem


---------41:07----------
behavior of one of the little brothers


---------41:09----------
in the butt


---------41:10----------
or the aftermath


---------41:13----------
of trying to discuss the argument or


---------41:15----------
discuss the problem


---------41:17----------
will be a lot smoother because my dad


---------41:19----------
kind of understands where


---------41:21----------
the younger brother is coming from or


---------41:22----------
the the slightly older brother is coming


---------41:24----------
from


---------41:24----------
don how does your mom feel about your


---------41:26----------
gaming


---------41:28----------
um she doesn't care either because i'm


---------41:31----------
able to keep track and field up


---------41:33----------
right she's like as long as your grades


---------41:34----------
are good as long as you are performing


---------41:36----------
at sports


---------41:37----------
like you can do whatever you want on the


---------41:39----------
weekends right


---------41:40----------
um how does your mom feel about your


---------41:42----------
dad's gaming


---------41:44----------
yeah you know i don't think she


---------41:45----------
understands kind of like how much


---------41:47----------
because they don't they don't know what


---------41:48----------
goes on


---------41:49----------
in between the homes right they don't


---------41:50----------
they don't know what goes on


---------41:52----------
in and home um


---------41:56----------
and i know she doesn't she does not like


---------41:58----------
a lot of the things about my dad


---------42:00----------
um and i there's just a lot of


---------42:04----------
there's a lot of residual anger between


---------42:07----------
both of them


---------42:08----------
that to me seems childish do you think


---------42:11----------
that


---------42:12----------
your life would be better if your dad


---------42:13----------
did a better job


---------42:16----------
i mean it's


---------42:20----------
it's hard to see it's hard to say yes


---------42:22----------
because i don't want to say yes


---------42:24----------
because my dad tried that's


---------42:28----------
that's the hard part he


---------42:32----------
he was raised a nerd i mean he was


---------42:33----------
raised he


---------42:35----------
his dad my grandpa was a huge star trek


---------42:38----------
fan


---------42:39----------
huge i mean and he


---------42:42----------
he worked for nasa he had tons he was


---------42:44----------
just that guy right that


---------42:46----------
that 70s nerd dad right and my dad looks


---------42:49----------
up to him


---------42:50----------
and i look up to him like you know


---------42:52----------
there's no other


---------42:53----------
and i think my dad kind of tried to


---------42:55----------
replicate that sense of


---------42:58----------
wonder in these imaginary worlds


---------43:02----------
within me right whether it was star trek


---------43:04----------
or


---------43:05----------
star wars or dune right he was a big


---------43:08----------
dune fan


---------43:10----------
um don does your dad have a job


---------43:15----------
um i he just got rehired um


---------43:18----------
poet's done a lot of hard stuff to him


---------43:21----------
the kind of


---------43:25----------
habits that he had right it kind of


---------43:27----------
really doubled down on these habits that


---------43:29----------
he already had build up


---------43:31----------
and they kind of just took over his life


---------43:32----------
in a sense um


---------43:34----------
what about so you guys had the water


---------43:36----------
turned off


---------43:39----------
again floating through um


---------43:43----------
what does that mean floating through uh


---------43:45----------
he's like


---------43:46----------
he was kind of like a contract like he'd


---------43:47----------
do side jobs for


---------43:50----------
uh x amount of money and then he'd be


---------43:52----------
okay for a little bit and then


---------43:54----------
he'd end up doing this one acting gig


---------43:56----------
for x amount of money then he'd be okay


---------43:57----------
for a bit and then he'd do this one


---------43:58----------
computer thing


---------44:00----------
and then he ended up getting a job then


---------44:01----------
got screwed over in the job and then got


---------44:03----------
a new job right and then


---------44:04----------
at times like he'd be working like two


---------44:07----------
or three jobs and it's


---------44:08----------
it's really it was really volatile and


---------44:10----------
he never


---------44:11----------
again one thing i'm super thankful is


---------44:13----------
like he never gave up


---------44:15----------
right he never gave up on us and


---------44:18----------
he ended up he like he got food on the


---------44:20----------
table he


---------44:22----------
paid for what he could right whether the


---------44:24----------
water turned off or the gas was turning


---------44:25----------
off


---------44:26----------
he always made sure we had blankets we


---------44:28----------
always made sure we had


---------44:29----------
pillows and mattresses so it's like


---------44:32----------
again it's hard for me to say yes i


---------44:34----------
think he would have done better if he


---------44:35----------
did a better job but we could say that


---------44:36----------
about any parent right


---------44:38----------
i can say that what i can say is i know


---------44:41----------
he tried his best


---------44:43----------
or how flawed he is you know


---------44:46----------
and i love him and i love him so much


---------44:48----------
for that


---------44:49----------
right and the the greatest thing the


---------44:52----------
greatest thing about it is i'm not


---------44:53----------
biologically his kid


---------44:55----------
um he he married my mom when i was about


---------44:58----------
two years old


---------44:59----------
so he kind of he kind of stepped up and


---------45:02----------
picked up this extra weight right and


---------45:04----------
when the parents got divorced he offered


---------45:06----------
to pay


---------45:06----------
child support for me as well even though


---------45:08----------
legally he didn't have to because i


---------45:09----------
wasn't his kid


---------45:10----------
so it's in my eyes


---------45:15----------
the greatest honor a man and a choir


---------45:19----------
is picking up the slack of another


---------45:21----------
worthless man


---------45:22----------
you know and in regards to their kid


---------45:26----------
and that's what he did you know as


---------45:28----------
flawed as he was


---------45:29----------
he gave me an awesome childhood he


---------45:32----------
spent as much time as he could with me


---------45:34----------
whether you know whether he developed


---------45:36----------
this


---------45:36----------
video game addiction right whether he


---------45:38----------
helped facilitate that


---------45:41----------
you know he he loves me i mean


---------45:44----------
i'm a 6'3 black guy right but he's he's


---------45:46----------
a 510 white nerd right


---------45:48----------
and he looks at me


---------45:51----------
like i'm his son you know and he hugs me


---------45:54----------
like i'm his son


---------45:56----------
and i love him eternally for that


---------46:02----------
i you know i i can acknowledge his flaws


---------46:04----------
i can say how messed up his habits are


---------46:06----------
you know i can say anything


---------46:08----------
but it'll never you know give away that


---------46:12----------
love that he gave me


---------46:14----------
and that love that i offer him


---------46:28----------
it sounds like a real hero


---------46:32----------
yeah yeah


---------46:36----------
it's interesting it's interesting when


---------46:37----------
you mentioned you know he was white i'd


---------46:39----------
already i


---------46:40----------
you know i'd assumed that he was your


---------46:41----------
biological dad yeah


---------46:43----------
yeah and i like the i'm sorry


---------46:47----------
i can only imagine how much more


---------46:50----------
challenging it is


---------46:51----------
to accept a child that


---------46:54----------
clearly everyone knows is not your child


---------46:58----------
and so how much more he


---------47:01----------
deserves our respect yeah yeah


---------47:05----------
um i like to call ourselves the jigsaw


---------47:08----------
family


---------47:10----------
because i have a i have an older sister


---------47:12----------
who has her own dad


---------47:13----------
another older sister who has her own dad


---------47:15----------
and then me has my own dad and then the


---------47:17----------
three younger siblings all have the same


---------47:19----------
dad who's the guy i call dad


---------47:21----------
um you know and again dude it's like


---------47:25----------
i have so much love for both my parents


---------47:27----------
because


---------47:28----------
my mom i mean that does not sound like


---------47:31----------
an easy family situation


---------47:32----------
to mother right that's a lot of ties


---------47:35----------
and that's a lot of emotions and


---------47:39----------
my mom never gave up on us you know she


---------47:42----------
did so much for me um


---------47:46----------
she's she's the reason i run track and


---------47:48----------
field because after


---------47:49----------
seventh grade my first year running


---------47:51----------
track and field i wanted to quit because


---------47:52----------
i was like this is hard


---------47:53----------
running sucks like i gotta i gotta work


---------47:56----------
out i gotta sweat


---------47:57----------
i gotta get tired and she pulled over


---------47:59----------
the car she's like you are running track


---------48:01----------
whether or not like before i die right


---------48:04----------
or something you know she said something


---------48:05----------
super dramatic


---------48:06----------
and she saw it because it was the only


---------48:08----------
way i was getting to college right we


---------48:10----------
couldn't pay for it


---------48:11----------
getting to college without student loans


---------48:13----------
um


---------48:15----------
and now she didn't she didn't really


---------48:18----------
teach me how to do homework very well


---------48:20----------
uh she didn't i took a lot of her


---------48:23----------
procrastination within myself right


---------48:26----------
and a lot of her bad habits within


---------48:27----------
myself but you know


---------48:29----------
just like my dad like as flawed as he is


---------48:31----------
and as flawed as she is like i'm only


---------48:33----------
running track and field because she made


---------48:34----------
me


---------48:35----------
and i have that chad within me because


---------48:38----------
she made me


---------48:39----------
you know i have a future an education


---------48:42----------
and


---------48:42----------
college because she made me she did the


---------48:45----------
mom's job and


---------48:48----------
so it's like again i don't have hate for


---------48:49----------
my parents i have nothing but love


---------48:51----------
and wholesome you know


---------48:55----------
hog champs from i think it's more than


---------48:58----------
love


---------48:59----------
i think that's what makes this heart


---------49:01----------
because once again what i'm kind of


---------49:02----------
detecting don is that you're a little


---------49:04----------
bit stuck between two things


---------49:08----------
so you said that the greatest thing that


---------49:09----------
a man can do is to make up for the


---------49:11----------
failings of another man


---------49:13----------
yeah it's like it's pretty it's pretty


---------49:16----------
uh


---------49:17----------
big greatest honor i think is what i


---------49:19----------
said i like to say the honor


---------49:20----------
you know kind of nightly yeah so i kind


---------49:23----------
of wonder don are you making up for the


---------49:24----------
failings of your dad


---------49:33----------
what do you mean by that i mean so when


---------49:44----------
i asked you


---------49:45----------
you know a little bit about what you


---------49:47----------
thought about your dad you kind of said


---------49:48----------
i


---------49:48----------
was like you know could your dad i don't


---------49:50----------
remember exactly what the question was


---------49:51----------
but it was sort of like a


---------49:52----------
could your dad have done a better job or


---------49:54----------
do you think your dad let you down i


---------49:56----------
asked some question like that right


---------49:58----------
given you a chance to poop on dad and


---------50:01----------
i was like would you like to poop on dad


---------50:03----------
and you were like it's hard to say yes


---------50:07----------
right you said i don't want to say yes


---------50:10----------
you didn't say no


---------50:14----------
right and then and then we kind of


---------50:15----------
touched on then what you started to do


---------50:17----------
quite gallantly may i add is


---------50:20----------
rush to dad's defense and so


---------50:24----------
magnificently


---------50:26----------
because who can possibly think that


---------50:27----------
you're there's anything wrong like the


---------50:29----------
dude is


---------50:30----------
he's a white five foot ten nerd who's


---------50:32----------
raising


---------50:33----------
who calls the six three black kid his


---------50:36----------
son


---------50:37----------
and genuinely loves you as a son like


---------50:39----------
how can


---------50:40----------
how can we toss any shade on on that guy


---------50:45----------
right yeah yeah and and i


---------50:48----------
i get that there's a lot of genuine love


---------50:50----------
i get that your dad went above and


---------50:52----------
beyond and like deserves


---------50:54----------
a ton of love and respect


---------50:57----------
and at the same time you face certain


---------50:59----------
challenges


---------51:01----------
and when you get angry i think you get


---------51:03----------
angry with your parents


---------51:06----------
what i heard over and over again is you


---------51:08----------
didn't like it


---------51:12----------
and it felt it was weird and you didn't


---------51:14----------
like it


---------51:16----------
and i think that there's like there's a


---------51:18----------
you know


---------51:19----------
an adult within you who can understand


---------51:21----------
that


---------51:22----------
you know adults have problems and


---------51:24----------
sometimes divorce is what it comes down


---------51:26----------
to


---------51:26----------
and that like on balance they did a


---------51:28----------
fantastic job your mom


---------51:30----------
you know helped you get into track and


---------51:32----------
field your dad gave you a love for


---------51:33----------
gaming your dad gave you love in general


---------51:36----------
and so like on the pro and con column


---------51:38----------
like your


---------51:39----------
your parents both win overwhelmingly so


---------51:43----------
but when i hear about your struggles


---------51:48----------
there's like an understory here that i


---------51:51----------
think part of the reason that you may be


---------51:53----------
stuck is because like you're not


---------51:54----------
willing to acknowledge it


---------51:58----------
right i mean like when you you kind of


---------52:01----------
it's it's interesting because you said


---------52:03----------
that you used to be able to keep the


---------52:05----------
external the reason you reached out now


---------52:07----------
is because


---------52:08----------
you could keep it in check you said that


---------52:11----------
you used to be able to keep your


---------52:12----------
external life and your internal life


---------52:15----------
parallel but i'm still hearing that


---------52:18----------
there's like


---------52:19----------
one foot in two different lives


---------52:22----------
you know and i think that i know this


---------52:24----------
may sound like one of these weird like


---------52:26----------
spiritual positive things that no one


---------52:29----------
knows how to do


---------52:30----------
but as long as you you're living two


---------52:32----------
parallel lives like dawn it's never


---------52:34----------
gonna work


---------52:38----------
right like you can't be like you have to


---------52:41----------
live your life and like i know it's kind


---------52:43----------
of weird cause you're like how do you


---------52:44----------
we'll get there


---------52:46----------
so there's a lot of practical stuff here


---------52:47----------
but like you know when when there's the


---------52:49----------
losers


---------52:50----------
and the jocks and you're like


---------52:54----------
you know halfway between those two


---------53:00----------
you know you you can't i don't know i


---------53:02----------
mean i think there's needs to be some


---------53:03----------
kind of like


---------53:04----------
internal resolution about the life that


---------53:07----------
you want


---------53:09----------
and i think some of that stuff is


---------53:12----------
i mean i'm not out to make your dad seem


---------53:15----------
like a bad dude i mean clearly he's


---------53:16----------
you've played the ultimate ace card in


---------53:19----------
terms of


---------53:20----------
you know no one can ever think your dad


---------53:21----------
and i i i i


---------53:23----------
mean like you know it's it's sort of


---------53:25----------
like 50 of a joke but like


---------53:26----------
definitely i mean he gets away with a


---------53:29----------
lot if he does that


---------53:31----------
yeah right yeah yeah and so the reason i


---------53:35----------
kind of bring it up is not to like put


---------53:37----------
badness on him but like to acknowledge


---------53:39----------
that the things that


---------53:40----------
hold you back are all the


---------53:44----------
like all the things that he gets a pass


---------53:45----------
for


---------53:47----------
can still negatively impact you and what


---------53:49----------
we're talking about is you it's not


---------53:50----------
i'm not out there and i you know i know


---------53:52----------
i do this a lot where people like


---------53:54----------
i get people to [ __ ] talk their parents


---------53:56----------
it's not that like i'm not trying to


---------53:57----------
[ __ ] talk your parents


---------53:59----------
yeah it's that we need to understand


---------54:01----------
that like your dad is propagating


---------54:03----------
probably like


---------54:05----------
quite unhealthy behavior


---------54:08----------
in all of his kids which


---------54:12----------
all parents do right he's not unique


---------54:16----------
they're like i propagate on healthy


---------54:17----------
behavior in my kids


---------54:19----------
that's impossible i don't even say that


---------54:21----------
dude so my kid will wake up at 7 30 in


---------54:23----------
the morning


---------54:24----------
and she'll try to come wake me up and


---------54:26----------
then


---------54:27----------
and i'll like like she'll grab the ipad


---------54:29----------
and she's like dad can i


---------54:30----------
can i be on the ipad and i'm like yeah


---------54:32----------
sure absolutely


---------54:34----------
so you know it's terrible but the first


---------54:35----------
45 minutes of her day or like spent on


---------54:37----------
like you know


---------54:39----------
melting her brain on youtube which is


---------54:40----------
not what you want for a five-year-old


---------54:42----------
oh no but we all propagate bad behavior


---------54:46----------
in our kids like i'm not a perfect


---------54:48----------
parent there's no such thing


---------54:49----------
and the challenge for you though is it's


---------54:51----------
not about


---------54:53----------
bashing your parents for blame it's


---------54:55----------
about understanding what is the


---------54:57----------
impact that you have to deal with and as


---------54:59----------
long as we're giving your dad a pass


---------55:03----------
and we're ignoring his effects on you


---------55:05----------
then like how are you going to fix them


---------55:09----------
yeah you know and so and so i i get why


---------55:12----------
you


---------55:13----------
it's not bash your dad stream


---------55:17----------
yeah and you know he really does sound


---------55:19----------
like a truly


---------55:20----------
amazing guy like no doubt in my mind


---------55:24----------
and at the same time like you know


---------55:26----------
you're a nutrition major and like


---------55:28----------
you're starting to learn a little bit


---------55:29----------
about the world and you're beginning to


---------55:31----------
realize that like maybe some like fish


---------55:33----------
sticks and


---------55:34----------
you know gaming till three a.m you said


---------55:35----------
you guys did that four days in a row so


---------55:37----------
like was it summer vacation or was it


---------55:39----------
like


---------55:40----------
dude it was probably spring break it was


---------55:42----------
okay i mean


---------55:43----------
it's good especially even if it's just


---------55:45----------
like a friday


---------55:47----------
if there's if they're like it kind of


---------55:49----------
gets the point like if there is no


---------55:51----------
responsibility


---------55:52----------
that i have to equip equate to tomorrow


---------55:54----------
right i'll show up to tomorrow


---------55:56----------
i'm gonna throw away right now you know


---------55:59----------
that kind of that's kind of like how it


---------56:01----------
lines up you know and like the more i


---------56:03----------
learn about habits right


---------56:04----------
building habits we are our habits right


---------56:07----------
i'll know


---------56:08----------
i'll never be rid of this until you know


---------56:12----------
i get rid of that


---------56:13----------
habit of throwing away my night


---------56:17----------
if i don't have anything at 8 a.m the


---------56:18----------
next morning right i should just go to


---------56:20----------
bed


---------56:21----------
right or something like that you know so


---------56:25----------
you know when it was spring break when


---------56:26----------
it was summer vacation or anything


---------56:28----------
he would do that as long as we didn't


---------56:30----------
have anything to do tomorrow


---------56:32----------
yeah so let me ask you


---------56:36----------
you know don i don't know exactly if


---------56:39----------
this has been helpful


---------56:40----------
yet but


---------56:44----------
you know i i certainly feel like i


---------56:45----------
understand you a little bit better and i


---------56:47----------
think it'll like clarify i don't know i


---------56:48----------
don't have a clear sense of


---------56:50----------
let me just think for a second


---------57:00----------
why do you want to play bass guitar


---------57:04----------
dude i think


---------57:07----------
personally it's the sexiest instrument


---------57:10----------
known to man um


---------57:13----------
when i was getting into music


---------57:17----------
um because you know when you're when


---------57:19----------
you're a kid you always listen to what


---------57:20----------
your parents listen to


---------57:22----------
so when i turned


---------57:25----------
you know 1314 i kind of you know started


---------57:28----------
touching my own music i was listening to


---------57:30----------
these kids or listen to music at school


---------57:32----------
you know whatever they were listening to


---------57:34----------
and i went through a lot of stuff i went


---------57:35----------
through like a little bit of an emo


---------57:36----------
phase like mcr because my crush was


---------57:38----------
faith lap and she hit the


---------57:40----------
you know she was emails like i gotta


---------57:41----------
listen to this stuff you know


---------57:43----------
um then my 10th grade year i started


---------57:45----------
listening to like


---------57:46----------
my own music like things that i really


---------57:49----------
liked


---------57:50----------
and a lot of it was bass guitar uh steve


---------57:53----------
lacey


---------57:53----------
plays a lot of bass guitar and he plays


---------57:55----------
his own bass fit thundercat was a huge


---------57:57----------
one


---------57:57----------
i love thundercat tyler crater has some


---------58:00----------
really good


---------58:02----------
bass lines in his songs and


---------58:05----------
i just i didn't understand it was bass


---------58:08----------
until i started looking into the music i


---------58:10----------
was like oh that's


---------58:11----------
that's the bass that's the bass line um


---------58:14----------
then my best friend's dad um


---------58:18----------
he asked me out of the blue he's like


---------58:20----------
you play bass


---------58:21----------
i was like no like oh that's that's


---------58:23----------
[ __ ] like


---------58:24----------
every black person can play bass you


---------58:26----------
could play bass and then that kind of


---------58:27----------
like solidified it for me as like okay i


---------58:29----------
need to learn to play bass right now


---------58:30----------
so i can prove this guy that i can play


---------58:33----------
bass


---------58:33----------
i'm sick right and so along with like


---------58:36----------
all my love for music


---------58:37----------
you know so it kind of it was kind of


---------58:39----------
like a two-factor humor sense and


---------58:41----------
actual love for the bass


---------58:45----------
okay so don


---------58:48----------
okay can i think for a second please


---------58:52----------
please


---------58:59----------
so you've watched a fair number of our


---------59:00----------
streams


---------59:02----------
yeah yeah i always usually turn tune


---------59:04----------
into the vods


---------59:05----------
okay so like you're familiar with like


---------59:08----------
the concepts and stuff that we


---------59:09----------
discuss yeah yeah i watch a lot of the


---------59:13----------
youtube channel as well


---------59:14----------
okay so like do you know what a sum


---------59:15----------
squad is um


---------59:18----------
refresher please okay so like sometimes


---------59:21----------
we have


---------59:21----------
emotion that gets


---------59:25----------
so when our mind experiences emotion


---------59:28----------
we can either bury it or process it


---------59:32----------
okay and generally speaking a lot of the


---------59:35----------
emotion that gets buried


---------59:37----------
then manifests later in life in


---------59:39----------
particular circumstances


---------59:42----------
so what i um


---------59:46----------
i'm gonna try to like put together


---------59:50----------
i'm gonna try to like summarize what i


---------59:53----------
understand as your situation


---------59:56----------
and i'm gonna give you like a couple of


---------59:58----------
options


---------59:59----------
okay


---------60:04----------
give me just a second


---------60:40----------
okay


---------60:42----------
dawn you know it was interesting when


---------60:45----------
you were telling me a little about


---------60:46----------
yourself you know when i


---------60:47----------
when i mentioned that it seems to me


---------60:49----------
like you're stuck between two worlds


---------60:53----------
it's interesting because what i was


---------60:54----------
thinking about you are you have any


---------60:56----------
experience with d and d


---------60:58----------
yeah yeah okay so like you know i almost


---------61:00----------
said you seem to me like a half elf


---------61:04----------
because you're not in the human world


---------61:05----------
and you're not in the elf world


---------61:08----------
my characters are always half works my


---------61:09----------
characters are always half works


---------61:11----------
even better right so so like


---------61:14----------
and i'm really glad i steered clear that


---------61:16----------
because like i i almost


---------61:18----------
because given the the racial dynamics in


---------61:21----------
your family like i'm glad i didn't call


---------61:23----------
you just something like that


---------61:25----------
really dodged a bullet there really but


---------61:27----------
but but


---------61:28----------
i i i do get the sense that there's


---------61:30----------
there's really like


---------61:31----------
in so many different ways man like you


---------61:33----------
were stuck between two worlds


---------61:36----------
it's like do you become a jock or do you


---------61:39----------
become a nerd


---------61:40----------
you know like like do you play bass


---------61:42----------
guitar like you can't play


---------61:44----------
basketball but you're gonna learn bass


---------61:47----------
guitar


---------61:47----------
so you're gonna take advantage of your


---------61:49----------
racial bonuses


---------61:51----------
you know like absolutely and and so like


---------61:53----------
you know there's just so much there


---------61:55----------
about you know i think who you're trying


---------61:56----------
to be


---------61:57----------
[Music]


---------61:58----------
that and and i think that that's gonna


---------62:01----------
so if if your problem


---------62:02----------
you kind of come up with this problem of


---------62:04----------
like i spend too much time on the


---------62:05----------
computer


---------62:06----------
and we can call that escapism we can say


---------62:08----------
it's due to like some


---------62:09----------
internal conflict or whatever but i'd


---------62:12----------
say the reason you spend too much time


---------62:13----------
on the computer is a couple of things


---------62:15----------
one is i do believe that there's like an


---------62:17----------
addictive


---------62:17----------
aspect to it so like straight up like


---------62:20----------
like what you're describing to me sounds


---------62:23----------
like a dopaminergic


---------62:24----------
binge where you're just like you know


---------62:27----------
you like you need to get that dopamine


---------62:29----------
from like attack on titan what's gonna


---------62:31----------
happen next what's gonna happen


---------62:32----------
i have to know i have to know i have to


---------62:34----------
know you kind of get caught up in it


---------62:36----------
the other interesting thing is that


---------62:37----------
given your upbringing


---------62:40----------
one of the things that we've discovered


---------62:41----------
from studying addictions is that


---------62:43----------
generally speaking the earlier you get


---------62:44----------
exposed


---------62:45----------
the more powerful the addiction so


---------62:49----------
um you know when we look at things like


---------62:50----------
pornography addiction like there's a


---------62:52----------
very good chance that


---------62:54----------
people who are exposed to pornography at


---------62:56----------
like a very young


---------62:57----------
age will be more likely to be addicted


---------63:01----------
to it the same is true


---------63:02----------
for like alcohol and cigarettes and


---------63:03----------
marijuana and stuff like that


---------63:05----------
so you know if you start smoking pot at


---------63:07----------
the age of 12 it's like


---------63:08----------
way harder to kick than like if you


---------63:10----------
start smoking a pot at the age of 50.


---------63:14----------
so there's some stuff around developing


---------63:15----------
brains and and building habits and stuff


---------63:17----------
like that


---------63:18----------
so i i do think that there's like a


---------63:20----------
dopaminergic aspect


---------63:22----------
to your behavior which can be kind of


---------63:24----------
addressed on that level


---------63:27----------
but i i also get the sense that you know


---------63:31----------
when you're choosing between two goals


---------63:33----------
what i'm really getting the sense of is


---------63:34----------
that there's like this conflict about


---------63:36----------
like who you want to be


---------63:38----------
it's like who does don want to wind up


---------63:40----------
like does he want to wind up being a


---------63:42----------
weeb or does he want to wind up being


---------63:44----------
you know black guy who can play bass and


---------63:47----------
because generally speaking we don't


---------63:49----------
think about those people


---------63:50----------
as the same kind of person which is why


---------63:52----------
i think the next thing to really


---------63:53----------
understand if we had to summarize who


---------63:54----------
you are


---------63:55----------
you're the chosen one


---------63:59----------
i'm the main character yeah you're all


---------64:01----------
side characters


---------64:02----------
so so it's it it's it's like and this is


---------64:05----------
where like i i think a lot of this is


---------64:07----------
gonna come from


---------64:08----------
really a lot of like introspection about


---------64:11----------
you know where do your goals


---------64:13----------
come from are they your goals


---------64:16----------
or are they the goals that come from


---------64:19----------
either


---------64:19----------
part of your human and your elven


---------64:21----------
heritage


---------64:24----------
and i i sort of get you know i i think


---------64:26----------
the you know the story about how you got


---------64:28----------
into base


---------64:29----------
i'm sure will upset a lot of people for


---------64:31----------
a lot of reasons but i think it's like a


---------64:33----------
great story


---------64:34----------
right genuinely speaking it's it's when


---------64:37----------
it come


---------64:37----------
you know our racial identity forms so


---------64:40----------
much of like who we are and what we


---------64:42----------
choose to identify with and stuff like


---------64:44----------
that i think you know i'm i'm


---------64:45----------
brown i'm indian and so i you know i did


---------64:48----------
wind up becoming a doctor and i do do


---------64:50----------
yoga so it's sort of like


---------64:52----------
you know i have racial advantages there


---------64:55----------
um so i think it is there's an element


---------64:58----------
of truth to


---------64:59----------
that but i i think what i'm sort of


---------65:00----------
really getting from you is that


---------65:02----------
a couple of different things one is you


---------65:05----------
know you're stuck between these two


---------65:06----------
worlds and i think a lot of the goals


---------65:09----------
that arrive in your mind that you


---------65:12----------
fall short of are not truly your goals


---------65:16----------
i think as you really make them your


---------65:18----------
goals and you sort of deal with that


---------65:20----------
addiction piece


---------65:21----------
then it'll help so like as they truly


---------65:24----------
become your goals as opposed to like


---------65:26----------
societally imposed goals that'll help


---------65:29----------
you achieve them and then you've got


---------65:30----------
habit and dopamine related stuff that


---------65:33----------
you've got to overcome for sure


---------65:36----------
the last thing is from an emotional


---------65:37----------
standpoint you know this is where


---------65:39----------
i'm sure we could ask you more questions


---------65:40----------
but like


---------65:42----------
i i think that they're you know it seems


---------65:44----------
like the primary thing that you feel


---------65:45----------
towards yourself is like


---------65:47----------
anger and frustration and where do you


---------65:50----------
think that anger and frustration comes


---------65:51----------
from


---------65:54----------
i think a big thing can come to be like


---------65:57----------
me


---------65:58----------
not being what i think i should be in a


---------66:01----------
lot of aspects right


---------66:03----------
um


---------66:06----------
it's i get when you when you met like


---------66:08----------
mentioning porn like that's a that's a


---------66:09----------
huge thing for all young adults right


---------66:12----------
especially young males like that i hate


---------66:14----------
it right


---------66:16----------
and i hate that i you know could be


---------66:18----------
addicted to porn


---------66:19----------
especially growing up as a teenager like


---------66:21----------
a lot of that anger


---------66:22----------
you know you get that post-nut clarity


---------66:24----------
it's just so it's so hard you know


---------66:25----------
post-nut depression


---------66:27----------
is not a it's not a healthy thing to


---------66:30----------
move on about it's


---------66:31----------
hard to talk about right no one wants to


---------66:32----------
talk about their own


---------66:34----------
struggles with that but i'm telling you


---------66:37----------
now because that to me


---------66:39----------
is the clearest point of like where my


---------66:42----------
anger could be coming from like that


---------66:43----------
self


---------66:45----------
loathing from what i could be right i'm


---------66:47----------
like i'm not there


---------66:48----------
i'm right here and i'm angry about it


---------66:50----------
and it's my fault


---------66:52----------
you know you just lost me a little bit


---------66:55----------
sorry what is this stuff about post not


---------66:58----------
depression


---------67:01----------
uh so there's there's a joke right


---------67:04----------

---------67:04----------

---------67:06----------

---------67:12----------
over the water and you're like this is


---------67:14----------
gross stuff like i do not like this


---------67:16----------
right


---------67:16----------

---------67:19----------
post


---------67:20----------
depression is just the depression you


---------67:22----------
feel


---------67:23----------
of being attached to this being tied to


---------67:25----------
it all right being tied to the computer


---------67:28----------

---------67:34----------
joke like a play on words


---------67:36----------

clearly able to


---------67:48----------
because like you're free of all of your

---------71:32----------
the weekend watching


---------71:33----------
anime what happens to your progress


---------71:36----------
towards each of those goals


---------71:41----------
it decreases it goes back incorrect


---------71:45----------
there's no difference


---------71:50----------
right so like how many to get to the


---------71:52----------
life of your dreams how many days does


---------71:54----------

---------72:02----------
get a smoking hot wife become a


---------72:03----------

---------72:05----------
contract how much time does that take


---------72:08----------
a lot of time uh you know years how many


---------72:10----------
years


---------72:12----------
um probably take about four


---------72:17----------
at a minimum right


---------72:20----------
yeah so four years is like


---------72:24----------
1300 days sure


---------72:28----------
if you take a if you take a break


---------72:32----------
for three days what difference does it


---------72:35----------
make


---------72:38----------
see i see i see what you're saying i get


---------72:40----------
it


---------72:41----------
right so what's the cost of you spending


---------72:43----------
a week or two playing kotor two


---------72:45----------
coach or one and two


---------72:51----------
well you know you could look at it you


---------72:53----------
know grand scheme is saying like oh it


---------72:55----------
doesn't cost much in the grand scheme


---------72:56----------
but


---------72:57----------
then within these little little deals


---------72:59----------
right i didn't go spend time with my


---------73:01----------
friends


---------73:01----------
playing culture until i didn't go


---------73:03----------
outside much i didn't spend time with a


---------73:05----------
lot of my family you know


---------73:07----------
i guess that is the cost that's the cost


---------73:10----------
with


---------73:11----------
yeah now we get to a really tricky thing


---------73:14----------
which is which way does your brain look


---------73:16----------
at it


---------73:18----------
so your brain calculates behavior right


---------73:21----------
it calculates to engage in a behavior or


---------73:23----------
not engage in a behavior


---------73:25----------
when you have five years to do something


---------73:30----------
which way like you know i know it sounds


---------73:32----------
good actually i'll just sort of


---------73:34----------
say it but like your brain calculates it


---------73:38----------
in the long term not in the short term


---------73:41----------
which is why procrastination is


---------73:42----------
conserved across the human race


---------73:46----------
right so if you have a month like no


---------73:48----------
one's studying for a test that's one


---------73:50----------
month away


---------73:51----------
and like if you think about it you know


---------73:52----------
if all like not all but you know 90


---------73:56----------
the human beings that have not been


---------73:57----------
conditioned or built


---------73:59----------
habits to start studying 30 days before


---------74:03----------
the test


---------74:03----------
the default human behavior is to wait


---------74:05----------
until the last minute


---------74:07----------
and i think your biggest issue and this


---------74:09----------
is where like it doesn't matter which


---------74:10----------
world you're stuck in because in either


---------74:12----------
case like what's the cost of a weekend


---------74:14----------
is absolutely nothing


---------74:15----------
and this is why our generation is


---------74:19----------
screwed from weekend to weekend because


---------74:22----------
what's the cost


---------74:23----------
nothing it's just a couple of days


---------74:26----------
there's more days


---------74:28----------
what's gonna happen seven days from now


---------74:30----------
you're gonna get another weekend


---------74:32----------
you can do it then


---------74:36----------
and i i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------74:37----------
like you know i i think there's a lot to


---------74:39----------
like understanding


---------74:40----------
you know your internal conflict and


---------74:42----------
stuff like that


---------74:44----------
i do think there's a lot to understand


---------74:45----------
about your anger towards yourself


---------74:48----------
because that i think is is to a certain


---------74:50----------
degree like related to


---------74:52----------
[Music]


---------74:53----------
a lot of anger that you have from other


---------74:55----------
places and you're kind of taking it out


---------74:57----------
on yourself


---------74:59----------
so so this is sort of where like you


---------75:01----------
know you're you're upset with your dad


---------75:04----------
for helping you get into this situation


---------75:08----------
right like do we want to we want to


---------75:11----------
forgive him sure


---------75:12----------
on balance did he do an awesome job


---------75:15----------
absolutely


---------75:17----------
and like don't tell me because when


---------75:19----------
you're walking around and you're


---------75:20----------
steaming right like who are you blaming


---------75:26----------
myself and your parents


---------75:30----------
you said that earlier it did i did say i


---------75:32----------
was getting angry at my parents


---------75:34----------
and and what what kind of thoughts does


---------75:36----------
your mind produce


---------75:39----------
yeah so like can you give me an example


---------75:42----------
of like what in what way you get angry


---------75:44----------
with your parents


---------75:46----------
parents specifically i just get


---------75:49----------
get jealous of my friends and their


---------75:51----------
parents um


---------75:53----------
good tell me what are you jealous of


---------75:56----------
between your friends and their parents


---------75:58----------
stability that's a big one my


---------76:01----------
in my area it's really low divorce rate


---------76:04----------
in my area


---------76:05----------
and get really jealous


---------76:08----------
i mean because again it's like that


---------76:10----------
adult side of you tells yourself right


---------76:12----------
you're like


---------76:13----------
every every you know past problems you


---------76:16----------
know every family has issues


---------76:18----------
right but then you know my kids side


---------76:21----------
looks i'm like man i'd rather have those


---------76:22----------
issues


---------76:23----------
the issues they're having and the issues


---------76:25----------
i'm having right


---------76:26----------
what especially yeah go ahead sorry i


---------76:29----------
was gonna say especially when i get grow


---------76:30----------
closer um just saying like uh it takes a


---------76:34----------
village to raise a kid


---------76:35----------
right or raise a whatever that was


---------76:38----------
really


---------76:39----------
really true in my sake um


---------76:42----------
outside of my own family i have like


---------76:43----------
four families where i could just walk


---------76:45----------
into the door


---------76:46----------
right and they'll say like oh hey dom


---------76:48----------
and you know they already have a plate


---------76:49----------
set up for me


---------76:50----------
right um and i'm really close and really


---------76:53----------
thankful for those families so i know


---------76:55----------
kind of their family issues i see


---------76:57----------
the sibling arguments i see the parents


---------76:59----------
doing whatever


---------77:01----------
um when i was a kid


---------77:04----------
to answer your question like what


---------77:05----------
specific issues when i was a kid i just


---------77:07----------
hated having to move


---------77:08----------
from week into weekend especially when


---------77:11----------
my parents moved further away


---------77:14----------
i couldn't see my friends on some


---------77:15----------
weekends just because i didn't have a


---------77:17----------
car


---------77:18----------
my parents were at work we can't we


---------77:19----------
can't make the 40-minute drive


---------77:21----------
down to such-and-such city go hang out


---------77:24----------
with your friends right you're just


---------77:25----------
gonna have to sit and


---------77:26----------
hang out right and i hated that and i


---------77:27----------
was like man i wish i was the whole


---------77:28----------
family family's just in one spot


---------77:30----------
right another one is kind of just


---------77:36----------
reassurance that your parents love each


---------77:38----------
other you know


---------77:40----------
um don't take for granted like if your


---------77:43----------
parents truly love each other


---------77:45----------
um that's a wonderful example to you


---------77:47----------
about true love right as a for a kid


---------77:50----------
and i kind of really didn't have that


---------77:53----------
growing up you know i didn't have that


---------77:56----------
golden globe of like this is what a


---------77:58----------
marriage could be this is


---------78:00----------
this is what you could produce like look


---------78:01----------
at that look how wonderful this family


---------78:03----------
is


---------78:03----------
right we have all these kids and they


---------78:05----------
are married now and you're getting


---------78:06----------
nieces and nephews


---------78:07----------
and we're all here spending time


---------78:09----------
together uh my family can't really do


---------78:11----------
that


---------78:12----------
you know and i just i get angry and i


---------78:14----------
get jealous and i just get


---------78:16----------
sad you know because not only do i want


---------78:18----------
that


---------78:19----------
there's the realization that i truly


---------78:21----------
don't have that i have to go to sleep


---------78:23----------
with that knowledge you know i have to


---------78:24----------
wake up with that knowledge i have to go


---------78:25----------
to fourth


---------78:26----------
like going to two christmases as a kid


---------78:29----------
sounds like a cool idea right


---------78:30----------
two two birthday presents dude the pain


---------78:35----------
of driving away from one of my parents


---------78:36----------
homes from christmas morning


---------78:38----------
and seeing them wave on the sidewalk


---------78:42----------
just tears me up inside especially as i


---------78:44----------
get older especially because i'm the one


---------78:45----------
driving my siblings around right


---------78:47----------
you wake up at my dad's house and


---------78:51----------
having to say goodbye to a parent on


---------78:53----------
christmas morning


---------78:55----------
go to another christmas morning is


---------78:57----------
sickening and i hate it


---------79:00----------
and seeing the pain in their eyes


---------79:02----------
because they love us right they don't


---------79:03----------
want to be alone on christmas morning


---------79:05----------
they don't want to be alone


---------79:06----------
anytime and


---------79:10----------
going 11 years like that it's just so


---------79:13----------
draining and i don't think


---------79:17----------
people you know they don't acknowledge


---------79:19----------
those moments within the divorce you


---------79:21----------
know they don't acknowledge


---------79:22----------
those 15 sentence 15 second interactions


---------79:26----------
that you have nightmares about and it's


---------79:28----------
just


---------79:29----------
it's awful


---------79:32----------
yeah man it's it's you know i know we


---------79:36----------
so like there's i think a bias in


---------79:38----------
western society


---------79:40----------
towards like the individual


---------79:43----------
over the unit so generally speaking


---------79:46----------
you know there's this sentiment that


---------79:49----------
it's better to have


---------79:50----------
two happy people that are divorced


---------79:53----------
rather than


---------79:54----------
raise a kid in an unhappy marriage


---------79:59----------
which as a psychiatrist i mean i have a


---------80:02----------
bias in terms of my sample size right


---------80:04----------
because the people who come to me are


---------80:06----------
the ones who are a little bit unhappy


---------80:08----------
i'm not so sure that's actually the case


---------80:10----------
though


---------80:11----------
i i i when i hear stories like yours and


---------80:14----------
the problem is basically


---------80:15----------
every story of divorce that i've heard


---------80:18----------
i'd say


---------80:19----------
easily eighty percent are like yours


---------80:23----------
where it does actually and this is


---------80:25----------
something that i think is a


---------80:27----------
is something that gets propagated like


---------80:30----------
you know parents will tell themselves


---------80:32----------
all kinds of things


---------80:33----------
to justify being able to get a divorce


---------80:36----------
and they can't tolerate the idea that


---------80:38----------
like this could actually hurt your child


---------80:42----------
and we as a society sort of say that


---------80:44----------
divorce doesn't hurt children whereas


---------80:46----------
i haven't seen that i've seen that


---------80:49----------
just about in all cases divorce does


---------80:51----------
hurt


---------80:52----------
children i'm not saying that it's not a


---------80:55----------
good idea to get divorced i'm not saying


---------80:57----------
that there aren't


---------80:58----------
good reasons to get divorced it's just


---------81:00----------
i'm the one you know the kid walks into


---------81:02----------
my office


---------81:03----------
20 years later and and so that's just


---------81:07----------
what i see


---------81:09----------
um but i i think it's it's kind of


---------81:11----------
dangerous because like when you said you


---------81:13----------
know


---------81:13----------
everyone thinks two christmases is good


---------81:16----------
oh man that can


---------81:17----------
the most consistently terrible thing


---------81:19----------
that i've heard


---------81:20----------
from kids of divorced parents or


---------81:22----------
holidays


---------81:25----------
never do you feel so trapped so there's


---------81:28----------
no way to make every anyone happy


---------81:31----------
and it's it's just it's a it's just [ __ ]


---------81:34----------
for everyone involved


---------81:36----------
and this this time that's supposed to be


---------81:38----------
like happy and celebrating


---------81:40----------
ends up being just like painful for


---------81:42----------
everyone and it happens every year


---------81:45----------
and even especially with all the


---------81:46----------
marketing it's just


---------81:49----------
it's bad continue sorry i mean it even


---------81:51----------
gets to the point where sometimes i'll


---------81:53----------
you know when i work with like patients


---------81:55----------
like we'll even have to set limits so i


---------81:56----------
have some patients that over time


---------81:58----------
have grown to actually tell their


---------82:00----------
parents


---------82:01----------
i actually can't come home for the


---------82:03----------
holidays anymore and see either of you


---------82:06----------
because the toxicity is just so high i


---------82:08----------
don't have the bandwidth for it


---------82:11----------
i'm gonna just be by myself during


---------82:13----------
christmas and i will come and visit each


---------82:15----------
of you for one week at a time and we're


---------82:17----------
gonna hang out and i'll fill you in but


---------82:19----------
i just can't do it during the holidays


---------82:20----------
because there's just no peaceful way to


---------82:22----------
do it it's crazy


---------82:25----------
uh where things end up but kind of


---------82:28----------
coming back to you don i mean here's


---------82:30----------
what i think like


---------82:32----------
so there's a lot of that anger pent up


---------82:34----------
frustration with your self frustration


---------82:36----------
with your


---------82:36----------
your parents i think the more that you


---------82:38----------
acknowledge that i think the better off


---------82:40----------
you're gonna be


---------82:42----------
um not to say that you i mean i think it


---------82:46----------
does sound like you


---------82:46----------
you know you feel it and stuff but i i


---------82:48----------
think the real issue here and i want to


---------82:50----------
talk a little bit about goal setting is


---------82:52----------
that


---------82:53----------
so when you look at your life and you


---------82:55----------
say i wish it wasn't like this


---------82:57----------
i wish it was this and then you build


---------82:59----------
together this five-year plan because


---------83:01----------
you're


---------83:01----------
you know you have a touch of the chad


---------83:03----------
within you your chad touched


---------83:05----------
not fae touched not fien touched your


---------83:07----------
chad touched


---------83:09----------
all right um you're


---------83:12----------
you're a chad touched half work totally


---------83:15----------
totally


---------83:16----------
and and and so then what happens is your


---------83:18----------
mind still builds these


---------83:20----------
kinds of like goals for you you're like


---------83:22----------
okay i want to be a twitch streamer i


---------83:24----------
want to be this i want to be this


---------83:26----------
um look at the chad drinking milk yes


---------83:29----------
this is strong strong bones it's not


---------83:32----------
like an energy drink


---------83:34----------
no no [ __ ] so so


---------83:38----------
that's a lesson for everyone who's


---------83:39----------
watching by the way you're gonna


---------83:42----------
you know i'll i'll do one more


---------83:45----------
um so i think that one of the


---------83:49----------
you know i think when it comes to your


---------83:51----------
goals and what you want to do


---------83:52----------
but what i would say to you don is to


---------83:54----------
really think a little bit about a given


---------83:56----------
day


---------83:57----------
and don't think about the goal but ask


---------83:59----------
yourself in a weird way like


---------84:00----------
who do you want to be today like do you


---------84:03----------
want to be


---------84:04----------
someone who i know it may it may bring


---------84:07----------
up the self-loathing but i'd say


---------84:08----------
actually tackle it


---------84:10----------
head-on and sort of you know ask


---------84:12----------
yourself like as you're about to watch


---------84:14----------
like what are you gonna do this weekend


---------84:16----------
don i'm asking it's a genuine question


---------84:18----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------84:19----------
uh my buddy's getting married um i'm


---------84:22----------
gonna go i'm gonna


---------84:23----------
be groomsmen we're gonna hang out and


---------84:24----------
swim and


---------84:26----------
chillax you know some play some video


---------84:29----------
games maybe


---------84:30----------
smash bros meta who knows so so let me


---------84:32----------
ask you don


---------84:33----------
is that the person that you want to be


---------84:37----------
yeah yeah it is especially


---------84:41----------
it's especially because it is like a


---------84:43----------
especially these people


---------84:44----------
these people i'm going to um luckily


---------84:47----------
throughout the years i've been able to


---------84:48----------
acquire


---------84:50----------
uh companions in my dnd campaign because


---------84:52----------
i'm the main character right


---------84:54----------
um people who just


---------84:58----------
love me right both the website and the


---------85:01----------
chad side right


---------85:02----------
they they understand that like they come


---------85:04----------
to me with star wars questions because


---------85:05----------
they know i've read every single comic


---------85:07----------
book and every single


---------85:08----------
eu book like i know everything right um


---------85:12----------
they come to me with comic


---------85:13----------
recommendations when they when they want


---------85:16----------
so but they also you know they support


---------85:17----------
me at track meets they support my


---------85:19----------
healthy activities


---------85:20----------
so these guys i i really


---------85:24----------
want to like be with them so yes


---------85:28----------
these like that's these people are


---------85:29----------
awesome so like like


---------85:31----------
at the end of the weekend are you gonna


---------85:33----------
feel drained


---------85:34----------
or be filled with self-loathing


---------85:38----------
um


---------85:42----------
this this kind of gets into like a


---------85:45----------
different


---------85:45----------
material uh


---------85:49----------
because and i it feels weird you know


---------85:51----------
we're already a bit into it and opening


---------85:52----------
up a new can of worms is a bit weird


---------85:54----------
but especially this past few years it's


---------85:56----------
been really hard


---------85:58----------
connecting the people who like actually


---------86:00----------
love me but like feeling connected


---------86:02----------
um


---------86:05----------
because there are times when i'll go


---------86:06----------
hang out with my best friend brian right


---------86:09----------
and then you know something will go


---------86:13----------
wrong


---------86:13----------
or um you know specifically


---------86:17----------
uh he'll ditch me or like something like


---------86:20----------
that will go on and i'll come home and


---------86:22----------
i'll just feel like


---------86:24----------
awful i'll just feel like wow this this


---------86:27----------
really sucks because when


---------86:28----------
when i have so few of like the real


---------86:30----------
friends


---------86:32----------
when my own mind senses that it's not


---------86:34----------
going right it just kind of


---------86:37----------
spins out of control um it's like it


---------86:40----------
could be like i can go into this wedding


---------86:42----------
and i can go


---------86:43----------
and i can just you know my jokes are


---------86:44----------
firing off i'm killing it


---------86:46----------
and i feel loved and i feel accepted and


---------86:48----------
i feel on top of my game


---------86:50----------
but if i go and like something doesn't


---------86:52----------
feel right to me


---------86:53----------
or it doesn't like i don't feel loved or


---------86:57----------
something like that


---------86:58----------
i get i get into pretty deep dark places


---------87:01----------
and that that kind of


---------87:04----------
game has been what i've been playing for


---------87:07----------
like the past


---------87:08----------
four months um four or five months with


---------87:14----------
can you help me understand what you mean


---------87:16----------
by a deep dark place


---------87:18----------
um


---------87:22----------
one of you my favorite stream that i've


---------87:24----------
watched of you


---------87:26----------
was the suicidality one because


---------87:29----------
it explained the the phases and the


---------87:33----------
spectrum


---------87:33----------
of all of it and how every single one is


---------87:37----------
dangerous and every single every single


---------87:40----------
step of it is


---------87:41----------
important um because


---------87:45----------
i think one of the ways you phrased it


---------87:46----------
was how i was sleeping like man i don't


---------87:49----------
want to wake up tomorrow


---------87:50----------
and i'm going to like actively stop


---------87:52----------
myself from waking up tomorrow and


---------87:53----------
things like that


---------87:53----------
i'm like on the left side of like i


---------87:55----------
don't want to wake up tomorrow because


---------87:58----------
if it gets to that point it's where i'm


---------87:59----------
like kind of just running through in my


---------88:01----------
head


---------88:02----------
i feel that like man i don't want to go


---------88:04----------
to sleep i don't want to wake up


---------88:05----------
tomorrow so i'm just like i'm just going


---------88:07----------
to stay up but i don't want to i don't


---------88:08----------
want to stay up i just want this night


---------88:09----------
to be over


---------88:10----------
and i like end up running through the


---------88:11----------
circle and


---------88:13----------
what's helped me with that is writing


---------88:14----------
actually i've become big


---------88:16----------
big into writing i actually i i


---------88:19----------
restarted my high school blog


---------88:21----------
and i've been writing i've been writing


---------88:23----------
on stuff like that and


---------88:27----------
um especially these last like three


---------88:29----------
weeks


---------88:30----------
it's been pretty pretty bad because a


---------88:33----------
lot of stuff


---------88:34----------
that's happened in the past is coming up


---------88:35----------
and like specifically my my best friend


---------88:38----------
uh itching me um i'll just kind of


---------88:42----------
explain what happened um in new year's


---------88:43----------
new year's eve of 2000


---------88:46----------
just just this last new year's eve i had


---------88:48----------
three buddies that i really really


---------88:50----------
wanted to hang out with


---------88:51----------
like each one of them bailed on me and


---------88:54----------
went to their own parties


---------88:56----------
and it wasn't like oh like i'm doing


---------88:58----------
this instead of this dom like come hang


---------89:00----------
out with me


---------89:01----------
like i called him i was like hey what


---------89:02----------
time do you want me to pick you up he's


---------89:03----------
like oh sorry dude like


---------89:05----------
i'm so plastered right now i'm already


---------89:06----------
at this one thing i gotta i'm gonna stay


---------89:08----------
here and then he hung up right and i was


---------89:09----------
like


---------89:11----------
cool like awesome and


---------89:14----------
then i ended up going to this one other


---------89:15----------
party with someone else and he ended up


---------89:17----------
leaving halfway through the party


---------89:19----------
and like i had to find a ride home


---------89:20----------
talking you know talking to other people


---------89:22----------
and


---------89:23----------
when


---------89:26----------
i don't think i really processed it then


---------89:29----------
because


---------89:29----------
now when something like that happens


---------89:33----------
i just fall apart i just


---------89:36----------
i i fall apart and and again i need to


---------89:40----------
go take a walk


---------89:41----------
and i need to go take a thing and like


---------89:43----------
again


---------89:45----------
when you fall apart what is happening in


---------89:47----------
your mind


---------89:50----------
not wanting to exist i'm just going to


---------89:51----------
be honest i'm just going to be frank i'm


---------89:53----------
just going to be honest and i


---------89:54----------
i'm not going to try and because i don't


---------89:56----------
know who's going to


---------89:57----------
watch this right it's it's scary


---------89:59----------
speaking this to the world


---------90:01----------
um because who knows in a week my


---------90:03----------
buddies


---------90:04----------
i'm talking about watch this and i freak


---------90:06----------
you know they're like why didn't you


---------90:07----------
talk to me


---------90:08----------
and it's like dude so continuing


---------90:11----------
um just not wanting to exist it's truly


---------90:14----------
like that it's not like man i want to


---------90:16----------
kill myself


---------90:17----------
it's like i just don't want to be here i


---------90:19----------
don't i don't want to


---------90:21----------
have this you know what is your


---------90:23----------
experience of existence


---------90:24----------
in that moment dude it's


---------90:28----------
it's it's it's weird it


---------90:32----------
it one one


---------90:35----------
one way is like i'll like look at myself


---------90:36----------
in the mirror i'll be like


---------90:38----------
seeing someone else like look at me like


---------90:41----------
that like i don't want that


---------90:42----------
right like it's it kind of gets like


---------90:44----------
that like i need to get outside right so


---------90:45----------
i'll go outside


---------90:49----------
what does the other person see when they


---------90:51----------
look in the mirror dude that thing is


---------90:53----------
like i don't know it's not like


---------90:54----------
something like


---------90:56----------
it's not like i'm like talking to it or


---------90:59----------
like communicating


---------91:00----------
it's like that's just like i look at it


---------91:02----------
and like that's not me right


---------91:04----------
so i end up needing like a sensation so


---------91:05----------
like i'll splash cold water in my face


---------91:07----------
i'll go outside like feel


---------91:09----------
wind right if i'm inside there's like no


---------91:11----------
wind and like if i feel the wind i'm


---------91:12----------
like okay like cool


---------91:13----------
cool right um something that i actually


---------91:17----------
uh do a lot now after watching your


---------91:21----------
suicidality stream


---------91:23----------
is i used to i used to want


---------91:26----------
to just go get drunk i've never drank


---------91:29----------
before which was the weirdest thing to


---------91:30----------
me


---------91:31----------
right and i didn't think much of it


---------91:32----------
until i watched your suicidality stream


---------91:35----------
and you're telling me about how


---------91:38----------
quickly the decision of suicide is how


---------91:41----------
quickly decision of suicide is made


---------91:43----------
and how much alcohol propagates that


---------91:45----------
like how much it


---------91:46----------
swings that um because one


---------91:49----------
for some reason i've always been


---------91:51----------
fascinated quote-unquote like my suicide


---------91:53----------
side's always been fascinated


---------91:55----------
with getting hit by a car and like


---------91:58----------
stepping in front of a train and just


---------92:00----------
something quick like a


---------92:01----------
hard impact and i get the sense that


---------92:03----------
like when i do


---------92:05----------
like i'll just i'll just free fall and


---------92:07----------
i'll fall through the air and i'll roll


---------92:09----------
and then like my life is out of my hands


---------92:11----------
you know


---------92:12----------
and like it's it's so it's so weird


---------92:15----------
because i got


---------92:17----------
i after watching again after watching


---------92:18----------
your suicidality stream


---------92:20----------
um i look back at my life and realize


---------92:22----------
like that's been a thing


---------92:24----------
throughout my whole life i'd drive to


---------92:25----------
track practices or track workouts or


---------92:27----------
track


---------92:28----------
meets where i really didn't want to go


---------92:30----------
i'd say to myself like man i really wish


---------92:31----------
a car would just hit me like man i just


---------92:33----------
i really wish i just not have to do


---------92:36----------
what i'm about to do right and i used to


---------92:39----------
not think it was a big deal because i


---------92:41----------
didn't have a plan


---------92:42----------
right i didn't i'm not planning on


---------92:43----------
suicide it's not like this and you're


---------92:44----------
telling me


---------92:45----------
you are telling me you're like this is


---------92:47----------
scary right


---------92:49----------
and then i believed it so instead of


---------92:51----------
indulging in alcohol when i go on these


---------92:52----------
walks i'll buy a bunch of candy


---------92:54----------
i'll just eat all the candy i'll drink


---------92:57----------
soda


---------92:58----------
um i'll you know get an energy and i eat


---------93:02----------
healthy i drink milk


---------93:03----------
so like these moments i kind of like


---------93:04----------
indulge myself and


---------93:07----------
step away from that kind of stuff so


---------93:11----------
anyways sorry how long have you been


---------93:14----------
having these um


---------93:15----------
thoughts of just wanting to escape from


---------93:17----------
your situation


---------93:18----------
um a long time


---------93:22----------
a really really long time it's not it's


---------93:24----------
not like an everyday thing


---------93:29----------
yeah do you do you remember how old you


---------93:31----------
were when you first had these kinds of


---------93:34----------
thoughts


---------93:39----------
i guess the first like prevalent


---------93:41----------
sentence of like i want to escape


---------93:44----------
was my had to have been


---------93:49----------
sophomore year of high school because i


---------93:50----------
had dreads i had long dreads


---------93:52----------
back in high school it was super cool um


---------93:56----------
i was driving and i just finished a


---------93:58----------
track meet and we actually won the track


---------94:00----------
meet and i destroyed


---------94:02----------
i was carrying the big trophy i had four


---------94:04----------
gold medals


---------94:05----------
and we went to we went to a restaurant a


---------94:08----------
popular burger joint


---------94:09----------
that it's tradition in my community that


---------94:12----------
when when your sport


---------94:13----------
your team does well you go to the burger


---------94:15----------
joint right you go eat the burgers


---------94:17----------
and we went to the burger joint the bus


---------94:19----------
dropped us off and everything


---------94:21----------
and had a great time when i was driving


---------94:24----------
home


---------94:26----------
i just felt so alone and i just felt


---------94:30----------
like everyone there was just like


---------94:31----------
congratulating me only because


---------94:34----------
um because i was an athlete and i was


---------94:36----------
good right


---------94:37----------
um because i also i grew up in a really


---------94:39----------
really white area and like they only


---------94:41----------
talked to me because i was black and


---------94:42----------
things like that


---------94:43----------
and i was driving and i was driving and


---------94:46----------
i just i started speeding up


---------94:48----------
i was like i don't want this i don't


---------94:48----------
want this or i want this and there was a


---------94:50----------
there was a stone wall


---------94:51----------
at the end of the street and like i was


---------94:53----------
fixated on like driving into the stone


---------94:56----------
wall


---------94:56----------
and just like getting in a car wreck


---------95:00----------
and i ended up slowing down you know i


---------95:02----------
didn't i didn't go through with it but i


---------95:03----------
think that was like the first


---------95:05----------
like sentence of like i don't want this


---------95:08----------
like first like conscious thought


---------95:10----------
because i guess you can you know we


---------95:11----------
could talk about escapism through movies


---------95:13----------
and video games


---------95:14----------
throughout my whole life like that was


---------95:15----------
the first time where it like


---------95:17----------
manifested into action you know yeah


---------95:20----------
sounds quite scary yeah


---------95:24----------
and i just again like i don't know i


---------95:26----------
didn't really acknowledge it


---------95:28----------
until you know recently where i was like


---------95:30----------
oh wow


---------95:31----------
like so dawn that's the first time it


---------95:34----------
became manifest


---------95:37----------
but i feel like we've talked about


---------95:40----------
the sentiment of i don't want this


---------95:42----------
before over the course of this


---------95:43----------
conversation


---------95:47----------
does anything come to your mind about


---------95:49----------
what we've talked about that you really


---------95:51----------
didn't want and really didn't like


---------95:54----------
yeah i mean especially within this


---------95:56----------
conversation like my own parents


---------95:57----------
didn't want my parents uh


---------96:02----------
a life situation i didn't want to be


---------96:04----------
poor growing up you know


---------96:05----------
i didn't want to move around a bunch um


---------96:08----------
i mean even if you really if you really


---------96:10----------
look deep into what we've talked about


---------96:12----------
but i can no because like i didn't want


---------96:13----------
to be a track athlete


---------96:15----------
i had before i was forced to be a track


---------96:16----------
athlete in a sense by my mom


---------96:19----------
um i didn't i d sometimes you know


---------96:23----------
i don't want to be black especially


---------96:25----------
growing up around here


---------96:26----------
um with with my own dad i mean it's it's


---------96:29----------
the little things because we'd be at a


---------96:30----------
gas station right


---------96:32----------
i'm like six one right i'm 12 years old


---------96:34----------
and i'm like six one


---------96:36----------
my dad's still i'm still like that's


---------96:38----------
still 5-2


---------96:39----------
and all my younger siblings are tiny


---------96:42----------
white people right


---------96:44----------
and we're at the gas station getting


---------96:47----------
drinks and treats


---------96:48----------
and i put my stuff next to my siblings


---------96:51----------
the register


---------96:52----------
person said like is he with you to my


---------96:54----------
family right


---------96:56----------
um because you know no fault on them


---------96:59----------
because i looked like a young man trying


---------97:02----------
to sneak some


---------97:03----------
kibbles and freaking with this with this


---------97:06----------
nice white family right


---------97:08----------
so it's like even a sense of like i


---------97:09----------
don't want to be white or black


---------97:11----------
i want to be white you know and like


---------97:13----------
dude i remember


---------97:14----------
oh my gosh this is a weird memory that


---------97:16----------
just showed up i remember


---------97:18----------
wanting my hair to look like justin


---------97:19----------
bieber's because it wouldn't because


---------97:22----------
everyone loved justin bieber i was a kid


---------97:25----------
i was like man i want to look like that


---------97:26----------
but my hair curls you know my hair


---------97:28----------
doesn't


---------97:29----------
do that right i remember getting like


---------97:32----------
gel


---------97:34----------
and like making it like a mohawk like


---------97:36----------
like like all the other kids in like


---------97:38----------
2006 you know 2007


---------97:41----------
they all have that like spiky mohawk and


---------97:42----------
they're wearing their monster shirts


---------97:44----------
right


---------97:44----------
and i wanted to look like that because


---------97:45----------
that's what everybody else looks like


---------97:47----------
you know


---------97:48----------
and my siblings didn't even look like me


---------97:50----------
you know no one looked like me growing


---------97:52----------
up


---------97:53----------
and i guess like even that can be like a


---------97:55----------
sense of like i don't want this


---------97:57----------
i don't want to be you know to be or


---------98:00----------
not to be what makes the difference


---------98:03----------
that's that's one of my writing that's


---------98:05----------
from that's from my blog so


---------98:06----------
maybe i'll post a link in chat go read


---------98:08----------
my blog


---------98:11----------
all right don so i i think um


---------98:16----------
thank you so much for sharing all that


---------98:19----------
uh


---------98:20----------
don't worry you know for what it's worth


---------98:21----------
i i say this with love i think you'd


---------98:23----------
look


---------98:23----------
absolutely ridiculous with the justin


---------98:25----------
bieber haircut


---------98:28----------
he did i looked so bad i went to the


---------98:30----------
museum with it because my friends were


---------98:31----------
taking me to the museum


---------98:33----------
it was so bad dude oh


---------98:36----------
poor poor ten-year-old dom he just


---------98:38----------
wanted to be cool he just wanted to look


---------98:40----------
good


---------98:41----------
you know and i i think i think here we


---------98:43----------
see the


---------98:44----------
you know the stuck between two worlds


---------98:46----------
right like it makes sense man like you


---------98:48----------
have


---------98:48----------
you have this conflict you really are


---------98:51----------
like the chosen one in


---------98:52----------
in the last of you're like the last of


---------98:54----------
the uchiha it's like do you want to be


---------98:56----------
in


---------98:57----------
do you want to be like one of these good


---------98:59----------
homies from konoha like which one do you


---------99:01----------
want to be i'd rather be


---------99:02----------
freaking i'd be sure i'd be shikamaru


---------99:04----------
i'd want to be shikamara if i was a


---------99:06----------
naruto character but


---------99:08----------
it's tough dude because i i mean i i'm


---------99:12----------
seeing the


---------99:12----------
the you know 10 year old with justin


---------99:14----------
bieber haircut


---------99:15----------
or the bass playing dreadlock


---------99:19----------
style


---------99:22----------
oh the two the two sides of the same


---------99:24----------
coin man


---------99:25----------
same person though that's the craziest


---------99:26----------
thing to me it's like it's


---------99:28----------
all side that's the same person that's


---------99:30----------
all within me you know


---------99:32----------
it's hard to like hate one side of it


---------99:35----------
and be like oh


---------99:36----------
i can't do that because that's it's i


---------99:38----------
truly want that right


---------99:40----------
that's something that not it's not


---------99:41----------
foreign right so


---------99:43----------
don i'm gonna actually disagree with you


---------99:45----------
a little bit


---------99:46----------
i don't think either of those is you


---------99:50----------
okay i think it's fine for you to want


---------99:52----------
those things i think that want is


---------99:54----------
genuine but i think actually your


---------99:56----------
journey is about figuring out who you


---------99:58----------
are


---------99:59----------
not what you want to be what you want to


---------100:02----------
be is not who you are


---------100:05----------
it's what you want to be


---------100:08----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------100:10----------
i don't think either of those things is


---------100:12----------
you


---------100:13----------
make sense you are not an orc and you


---------100:15----------
are not a human


---------100:17----------
you're a half orc it's its own thing has


---------100:20----------
its own racial bonuses


---------100:22----------
has its own stat adjustments


---------100:27----------
and play a half or like you're gonna


---------100:29----------
lose dude if you play a half work like a


---------100:31----------
human


---------100:32----------
you're gonna lose oh no right so i think


---------100:35----------
it's like justin bieber haircut bass


---------100:37----------
playing anime t-shirt


---------100:39----------
milk drinking i actually i almost


---------100:43----------
i almost wore my house moving castle


---------100:44----------
shirt on stream yeah and i've been like


---------100:46----------
oh no


---------100:47----------
i can't do that right and i i don't know


---------100:50----------
exactly what i mean by that i don't know


---------100:52----------
how you figure out who you are


---------100:54----------
but i i do think that i am getting the


---------100:57----------
sense of


---------100:58----------
um you know just in terms of the you


---------101:01----------
know it sounded like an ad for the


---------101:02----------
suicidality stream


---------101:04----------
which is kind of dude it's awesome dude


---------101:06----------
that stream


---------101:08----------
literally changed my life literally so


---------101:10----------
you know i don't


---------101:12----------
i should probably say this for legal


---------101:13----------
reasons but seriously don


---------101:15----------
i don't know if you've ever worked with


---------101:16----------
a therapist i don't know if you you know


---------101:18----------
if you're in college and stuff there may


---------101:19----------
be like student health resources i think


---------101:21----------
it's like not a bad idea


---------101:23----------
um especially in your case i think


---------101:25----------
there's a lot that you could work


---------101:26----------
through in terms of your parents divorce


---------101:28----------
kind of figuring out who you are and


---------101:30----------
most importantly if you really do having


---------101:33----------
thoughts of not wanting to be there is


---------101:34----------
actually like a normal human experience


---------101:37----------
uh going to bed and wishing you never


---------101:39----------
wake up is a normal human experience


---------101:42----------
and also you know driving down a road


---------101:46----------
and speeding up and looking longingly at


---------101:48----------
a brick wall is [ __ ] dangerous


---------101:52----------
right and and so this has been my


---------101:53----------
experience as a psychiatrist which is


---------101:55----------
like it's almost like


---------101:56----------
rng it's like you're opening a loot box


---------101:58----------
and 99 times


---------102:00----------
out of 100 you won't you'll slow down


---------102:04----------
but the whole point of that suicidality


---------102:05----------
stream was explaining to people that


---------102:07----------
like


---------102:08----------
it can be and ultimately it's usually an


---------102:09----------
impulsive decision


---------102:11----------
i'm not worried about you like in this


---------102:13----------
moment it doesn't


---------102:14----------
you know i'm not gonna pick up the phone


---------102:15----------
and call 9-1-1 because i'm not getting


---------102:17----------
that sense from you and at the same time


---------102:20----------
it's worth taking very seriously


---------102:23----------
um i also don't want this


---------102:26----------
conversation to turn into that i think


---------102:29----------
we're still talking about you


---------102:30----------
and and what i'm hearing from that is


---------102:32----------
it's just a part of who you are i think


---------102:33----------
it's a


---------102:34----------
manifestation of some of you trying to


---------102:37----------
figure out like who you want to be and


---------102:38----------
what you want


---------102:40----------
i am detecting one hell of a some scar


---------102:43----------
though that there's something really


---------102:44----------
here about like


---------102:45----------
i don't like this i don't want it this


---------102:48----------
is not


---------102:49----------
and and it's interesting because you


---------102:51----------
really describe it


---------102:52----------
um like a trigger right like if if you


---------102:55----------
have


---------102:56----------
an interpersonal letdown


---------102:59----------
by someone that you care about you feel


---------103:02----------
very acutely unloved


---------103:05----------
and that that can feel like a very


---------103:07----------
intolerable state


---------103:10----------
um that is absolutely something that it


---------103:12----------
is worth seeing a therapist about


---------103:14----------
because


---------103:14----------
the real the real thing there is you


---------103:16----------
know we don't we haven't asked you much


---------103:17----------
about your personal relationships but


---------103:19----------
the reason i think that's really work


---------103:21----------
worth working on if you or anyone else


---------103:23----------
has that kind of experience is that


---------103:25----------
if you do wind up in a romantic


---------103:27----------
relationship that's important to you


---------103:28----------
that will rear its ugly head because


---------103:31----------
they are not going to be available to


---------103:32----------
you 24 7.


---------103:34----------
right so you're going to get that thing


---------103:36----------
is going to be triggered even


---------103:38----------
if you're in a relationship with someone


---------103:40----------
who really loves you and cares about you


---------103:42----------
so understanding that experience is kind


---------103:45----------
of


---------103:46----------
important and being able to work through


---------103:48----------
it


---------103:51----------
you know i


---------103:55----------
i feel like i should advise you or guide


---------103:58----------
you in some way what do you think don


---------104:01----------
is it enough to talk about what we


---------104:03----------
talked about or do you want some sort of


---------104:04----------
like


---------104:08----------
plan it's been it's been it's been nice


---------104:11----------
to just


---------104:11----------
talk about it um because i've tried


---------104:14----------
talking about it with people in my life


---------104:15----------
but it never


---------104:17----------
came out like this in like a cohesive


---------104:20----------
way


---------104:20----------
you know always be like i'll start


---------104:23----------
talking and we'll hyper focus on one


---------104:25----------
thing


---------104:26----------
and i'll feel like nothing happened you


---------104:27----------
know like i didn't talk about anything


---------104:29----------
actually


---------104:30----------
um so much as like a plan


---------104:34----------
i i'm a bit unsure like again like


---------104:39----------
you're kind of just like disagreeing


---------104:40----------
with me in like the sense that i'm i'm


---------104:42----------
not who i want to be like that's that's


---------104:44----------
a that's a cool thought like i've never


---------104:45----------
thought about that


---------104:47----------
and like a big reason i did want to


---------104:48----------
reach out was i i saw how you talked and


---------104:51----------
like


---------104:52----------
bug ideas out of people you know with


---------104:55----------
your your probing questions


---------104:57----------
and i was like man like that's that's


---------104:59----------
awesome and like even like the life


---------105:00----------
coaches


---------105:01----------
like i think those would be you know


---------105:03----------
they're trained to do the


---------105:04----------
basically the same things and like that


---------105:07----------
i don't


---------105:08----------
i don't think i'm helpless you know i


---------105:10----------
don't think


---------105:12----------
like sometimes sometimes i do feel like


---------105:14----------
chained to the ground


---------105:16----------
right and like all these chains or my


---------105:17----------
vices you know


---------105:20----------
like i don't i think i think the key is


---------105:23----------
within me to those chains you know and


---------105:25----------
like i have i have to find them


---------105:27----------
whether or not i go like a psychiatrist


---------105:29----------
isn't going to fix me


---------105:31----------
psychiatrists will help me fix me right


---------105:33----------
a psychiatrist will do all that within


---------105:34----------
their power to


---------105:36----------
fix me like that kind of applies to you


---------105:38----------
like i don't i don't think


---------105:42----------
i don't think anything that we figure


---------105:43----------
out within you know the next whatever


---------105:45----------
minutes we have left or


---------105:46----------
we do is going to be like the golden


---------105:50----------
standard


---------105:50----------
it'll definitely help and anything you


---------105:52----------
do say that helps but like again


---------105:54----------
i think listening has helped and like


---------105:57----------
just discussing


---------105:58----------
and a throwback back and forth and


---------106:01----------
talking to someone who knows nothing


---------106:02----------
about me


---------106:03----------
like exploring me with that person is i


---------106:06----------
think valuable and i've


---------106:09----------
it's like you have helped in a sense


---------106:11----------
you've made me feel better within as


---------106:13----------
well like as


---------106:14----------
as cheesy as that sounds like that


---------106:16----------
morale bonuses are no jokes


---------106:19----------
well set yeah so don i'm very happy to


---------106:23----------
hear that uh


---------106:24----------
uh and i think i think that you know


---------106:26----------
that if if you take one thing away from


---------106:28----------
the conversation it's


---------106:31----------
you know what you kind of said about


---------106:33----------
you're not who you want to be


---------106:35----------
because yeah and and because i i think


---------106:38----------
that like who you because i know it


---------106:40----------
sounds kind of weird but i think twitch


---------106:41----------
chat knows the real you


---------106:44----------
that's scary i think i know the real you


---------106:47----------
and i think that dude's absolutely a


---------106:49----------
chat he's not a chat in the way


---------106:50----------
that like you're you know not in the


---------106:53----------
traditional sense but i i think we've


---------106:54----------
gotten to see the real you today


---------106:57----------
and i have like absolute faith in that


---------106:59----------
person i think the only problem is you


---------107:00----------
get so confused


---------107:02----------
about being what you think you should be


---------107:08----------
like being human or being orc


---------107:11----------
either direction that you don't really


---------107:14----------
acknowledge that


---------107:15----------
you're really a half work because i


---------107:17----------
think it's fine for you to have a


---------107:19----------
you know house moving castle t-shirt


---------107:21----------
when you play bass


---------107:23----------
and i think we we actually all know we


---------107:24----------
know who you are i mean you've made it


---------107:26----------
pretty clear


---------107:27----------
yeah from the get-go that you can eat


---------107:30----------
healthy


---------107:30----------
and like you know take care of yourself


---------107:33----------
and be physically in shape and learn how


---------107:34----------
to play


---------107:35----------
bass guitar and spend you know weekend


---------107:37----------
here there watching attack on titan like


---------107:39----------
that's act that sounds great


---------107:40----------
sounds sounds like you're done actually


---------107:43----------
you know


---------107:44----------
like and that's that's the really weird


---------107:46----------
thing which i'd really


---------107:47----------
encourage you to think about is that you


---------107:49----------
have all these goals for like what you


---------107:51----------
want to be but like


---------107:52----------
i think if you just keep on growing the


---------107:54----------
person that you are


---------107:56----------
as opposed to striving for a particular


---------107:57----------
goal you'll


---------107:59----------
end up in a really good place


---------108:02----------
i think if you even i know it sounds


---------108:04----------
kind of weird but i think you're in a


---------108:06----------
pretty decent place it sounds like you


---------108:07----------
do deal with a lot of like negative


---------108:09----------
emotions that can come up


---------108:11----------
but you'll you know that process


---------108:15----------
how can i say this


---------108:18----------
you know the goal the way you deal with


---------108:20----------
those emotions is by


---------108:22----------
living through them with a certain


---------108:25----------
amount of like


---------108:26----------
thoughtfulness and attention right like


---------108:29----------
it could be journaling on your blog


---------108:31----------
it could be seeing a therapist it could


---------108:33----------
be you know


---------108:35----------
talking to your coach i don't know if


---------108:37----------
your parents know about your struggles


---------108:40----------
it sounds like they kind of don't but


---------108:42----------
like that's where you know giving them


---------108:44----------
an opportunity to like


---------108:46----------
letting your dad be your dad you know


---------108:48----------
telling him hey dad


---------108:50----------
did you ever like think that like maybe


---------108:53----------
playing games like did it ever interfere


---------108:55----------
with your life because i feel like


---------108:57----------
you know sometimes like you know you


---------108:59----------
tell them the story you told us about


---------109:00----------
the coach and the training schedule and


---------109:02----------
stuff like that


---------109:02----------
tell your mom right and be prepared for


---------109:05----------
them to not


---------109:06----------
be able to listen to you because your


---------109:08----------
mom will be like what the hell is wrong


---------109:09----------
with you


---------109:10----------
stop playing games right just stop so


---------109:12----------
you'll get that from your mom sorry


---------109:14----------
whoops


---------109:15----------
just turn off the computer silly yeah


---------109:17----------
but i mean


---------109:18----------
you know i i think it could be a really


---------109:20----------
like connecting conversation to ask your


---------109:23----------
dad like really


---------109:24----------
not in a judgment sort of way but say


---------109:26----------
hey dad i'm struggling with this did you


---------109:28----------
ever struggle with it


---------109:31----------
and i think the last bit that i would


---------109:33----------
tell you is you know on a given day i


---------109:35----------
know it sounds kind of weird but i think


---------109:36----------
when you think about the goal


---------109:39----------
you can afford to lose a day you can


---------109:41----------
afford because


---------109:42----------
well remember the attack on titan binge


---------109:44----------
is not a


---------109:45----------
you don't binge the whole week in a day


---------109:49----------
you binge one day and then the next day


---------109:51----------
can i afford to watch attack on titan


---------109:53----------
yeah i can kind of get away with it


---------109:55----------
and then the next day can i kind of get


---------109:56----------
away with it it's like yeah i can get


---------109:58----------
away with it


---------110:00----------
and so i if there's one question that i


---------110:02----------
encourage you to ask yourself is that


---------110:04----------
when it comes to a given task as best as


---------110:07----------
you can


---------110:08----------
with awareness ask yourself who do i


---------110:11----------
want to be today


---------110:13----------
do i want to be someone who spends this


---------110:16----------
hour


---------110:16----------
watching attack on titan do i want to


---------110:18----------
spend the day


---------110:19----------
being like what's more important to me


---------110:23----------
on this day maybe that's actually the


---------110:25----------
better question


---------110:26----------
and you may be surprised this is going


---------110:28----------
to be challenging but you may be


---------110:29----------
surprised because oftentimes the answer


---------110:31----------
may be


---------110:32----------
it's actually really hard for me to go


---------110:34----------
and meet up my friends


---------110:36----------
meet up with my friends down the street


---------110:38----------
and actually like on this day and in


---------110:40----------
this moment this is actually what i want


---------110:42----------
to do


---------110:42----------
there can be self-loathing that comes


---------110:44----------
with that which is fine


---------110:46----------
but you don't want to like pile up the


---------110:48----------
self-loathing and then experience it at


---------110:49----------
the end of the weekend i want you to


---------110:51----------
like


---------110:52----------
deal with each piece as it arises


---------110:57----------
and really just think about you know who


---------110:59----------
do you want to be today


---------111:03----------
and i think you will find that like the


---------111:05----------
answer will be a half work like you're


---------111:07----------
not going to be an orc and you're not


---------111:08----------
going to be human


---------111:11----------
today i do today i want to practice bass


---------111:13----------
and you know what today


---------111:14----------
anime is more important than bass and on


---------111:17----------
another day bass is going to be more


---------111:18----------
important than anime


---------111:23----------
thoughts thank you thank you i mean


---------111:26----------
that's first thought is thankfulness i


---------111:28----------
mean


---------111:29----------
that's that's some powerful stuff i like


---------111:33----------
i really like the idea that i am not


---------111:34----------
what i want to be you know


---------111:36----------
it's not it doesn't define


---------111:40----------
who i am like who i am is the person i


---------111:42----------
wake up as


---------111:44----------
you know and that can change you know


---------111:47----------
the ability to change


---------111:48----------
is hard but powerful you know


---------111:51----------
it's slowly i always i like to say well


---------111:54----------
there's a quote


---------111:55----------
history turns on hinges and i


---------111:58----------
i think that's the same for people as


---------112:00----------
well


---------112:01----------
you know it takes data day by day to


---------112:04----------
[Music]


---------112:06----------
become yourself you know and as long as


---------112:10----------
i'm


---------112:11----------
taking two days to become this person


---------112:13----------
and two days to become


---------112:14----------
the other person i'm always going to be


---------112:16----------
one day in the middle you know


---------112:18----------
and so i'm always going to be


---------112:21----------
just in that weird friction place or you


---------112:23----------
know i can


---------112:25----------
kind of like accept my person in the


---------112:27----------
middle you know instead of


---------112:29----------
they're like oh i need to only be


---------112:31----------
athlete chad gekko chad you know


---------112:33----------
and the other side is like i need to be


---------112:35----------
a cheesy eating


---------112:38----------
vermintide two player or whatever you


---------112:39----------
know who cares like


---------112:42----------
i'm you know i'm thankful and it's like


---------112:43----------
it's also something to chew on right


---------112:45----------
because within these like these dark


---------112:47----------
weekends like i feel like i just sit and


---------112:49----------
like again just look in the mirror or


---------112:52----------
not know what to think about and then i


---------112:54----------
end up thinking about things i don't


---------112:55----------
want to think about


---------112:56----------
you know hard things hurtful things you


---------112:59----------
know and


---------113:01----------
having that kind of sense of mind


---------113:04----------
that i can kind of like direct where my


---------113:08----------
thoughts are going


---------113:10----------
it gives me comfort you know gives me


---------113:12----------
stability i think so i thank you for


---------113:14----------
that


---------113:15----------
well you're very welcome don


---------113:19----------
you're kind of a gig of chad yourself


---------113:21----------
you know what


---------113:23----------
i did not i know it's


---------113:26----------
kind of weird but what makes you think


---------113:29----------
i'm a giga chad


---------113:30----------
dude i have a personal belief that chad


---------113:33----------
it's a mentality thing it's not a


---------113:35----------
physique thing it's not a what is the


---------113:37----------
mentality of a giga chad


---------113:40----------
i raise others up that's the thing i


---------113:42----------
mean it kind of that kind of


---------113:43----------
ties into you know what my dad did for


---------113:45----------
me but like


---------113:47----------
we're on this planet together bro like


---------113:49----------
let's raise each other up when i think


---------113:51----------
about you know people at the gym


---------113:53----------
help out the weaker one you know or the


---------113:54----------
person who's not doing good form just


---------113:56----------
helping each other out that's a geeky


---------113:57----------
chat you know not the


---------113:58----------
200 pound person who's only looking at


---------114:00----------
himself you know 200 pound uh


---------114:03----------
bodybuilder you know so when i think


---------114:06----------
when i think of giga chat i think of


---------114:07----------
people like you you know who's kind of


---------114:09----------
who has his life set up has his life in


---------114:13----------
a situation


---------114:14----------
that can you know he can live the rest


---------114:17----------
of his life


---------114:18----------
than you know on the side like you said


---------114:19----------
you're not a streamer


---------114:21----------
here you are on twitch helping out


---------114:24----------
little me


---------114:25----------
you know with with my mentality and how


---------114:27----------
many people are watching what


---------114:29----------
5k people watching you know


---------114:32----------
who knows if two people in there are


---------114:35----------
being changed to me that that's that's a


---------114:37----------
good chat so when i say you're a giga


---------114:39----------
chat i


---------114:39----------
that's that's what i think so i'm sure


---------114:41----------
that i look like a


---------114:43----------
giga chad from the outside but i would


---------114:46----------
say to you don that


---------114:48----------
you and i are exactly the same and


---------114:51----------
and i i'm not just i know it sounds kind


---------114:53----------
of like oh like that's what a giggy chad


---------114:55----------
would say


---------114:56----------
you know i got that i understand that


---------114:58----------
yeah but but i think this really


---------115:00----------
importantly needs to be understood


---------115:02----------
the problem dawn is that when you wake


---------115:04----------
up


---------115:05----------
and you try to be anything that's the


---------115:08----------
mistake


---------115:10----------
like you are what you are right and in


---------115:12----------
that moment you need to ask yourself


---------115:14----------
like what do i want to do right now


---------115:16----------
because we think about who i am is


---------115:18----------
something that's longitudinal over time


---------115:21----------
but it's not who you are is only present


---------115:25----------
in the moment so i'd agree with you that


---------115:28----------
a lot of giga chads have a mentality and


---------115:30----------
that mentality is to not try to be a


---------115:32----------
chat at all but just like what do i want


---------115:33----------
to be in this moment


---------115:34----------
devote yourself fully to like when you


---------115:36----------
were like today i don't know where you


---------115:38----------
are what time zone you're in but it's


---------115:39----------
friday


---------115:40----------
right it's 2 15 in central time


---------115:43----------
and so like what are you gonna do for


---------115:45----------
the rest of the day that's who you are


---------115:48----------
you cannot like who you are is defined


---------115:51----------
by your thoughts and your actions


---------115:53----------
more importantly your actions and so


---------115:56----------
like what are you gonna do today


---------115:58----------
and be like and it's okay for you to


---------116:00----------
like


---------116:01----------
you know be a d-gen person from time


---------116:04----------
like i do it too


---------116:07----------
you know like dinner for me last night


---------116:09----------
like oftentimes i eat healthy but dinner


---------116:11----------
for me last night was like a leftover


---------116:12----------
taco


---------116:14----------
and like a glass of milk and some indian


---------116:17----------
snacks because it was just


---------116:18----------
it had been a long day and then today


---------116:21----------
i'm gonna like eat better


---------116:23----------
you know and and so just you are you're


---------116:25----------
already exactly what you need to be


---------116:28----------
and the giga chad is one who realizes


---------116:29----------
that that it's okay to like not be


---------116:32----------
where you want to be i like that


---------116:36----------
right and like the more that you like


---------116:39----------
are you gonna be a professional athlete


---------116:41----------
one day sure why not


---------116:43----------
but today are you going to be someone


---------116:45----------
who does your practice or not because


---------116:46----------
forget about the professional athletes


---------116:48----------
like what are you going to be today


---------116:50----------
yeah yeah


---------116:54----------
powerful stuff you can't can't skip


---------116:57----------
today man


---------116:58----------
it's i always want to montage rocky


---------117:01----------
montage my way


---------117:03----------
through through life you know then show


---------117:06----------
up at the end


---------117:06----------
but exactly so


---------117:10----------
so one of my mentors once told me that


---------117:14----------
no one wants to write a book everyone


---------117:17----------
wants to


---------117:17----------
have written a book yeah


---------117:21----------
that's the problem with the goal


---------117:22----------
mentality right you want like oh i want


---------117:24----------
a backyard i want a barbecue


---------117:26----------
you want you want to be at the end like


---------117:28----------
you want to be at the end of the story


---------117:32----------
no one wants to live through it yeah


---------117:35----------
dude


---------117:36----------
it's true and the biggest paradox is


---------117:38----------
it's the people who chase the end that


---------117:41----------
never get there


---------117:42----------
and it's the people who let go of the


---------117:44----------
end that are the ones that become the


---------117:46----------
giga chats


---------117:52----------
so i do you meditate i i've been trying


---------117:55----------
to


---------117:56----------
um usually in the mornings sometimes i


---------117:59----------
just fall asleep and it's


---------118:00----------
i always laugh myself that's okay so if


---------118:03----------
you fall asleep


---------118:04----------
while meditating um


---------118:08----------
i that just means your body needs sleep


---------118:12----------
so so that's okay


---------118:15----------
um but i i'd give you one practice


---------118:20----------
uh let me just think about this


---------118:24----------
so you say that sometimes you look in


---------118:26----------
the mirror


---------118:28----------
and you don't like what you see


---------118:32----------
yeah it's it's like a mix of like not


---------118:34----------
liking what i see and like not


---------118:35----------
recognizing it and that it's kind of


---------118:37----------
like why i don't like it like


---------118:38----------
it's not it's not me you know it's not


---------118:43----------
i just don't like it you know whether or


---------118:45----------
not how i get there


---------118:48----------
i don't like it so i know it sounds kind


---------118:50----------
of weird but i'd say do any one of our


---------118:52----------
meditation practices


---------118:54----------
like uh alternate nostril breathing or


---------118:56----------
anything like that


---------118:57----------
and then i want you to go and look in a


---------119:00----------
mirror and then


---------119:02----------
you're gonna say to yourself that's not


---------119:04----------
me which is great then i want you to go


---------119:06----------
and sit and close your eyes and then ask


---------119:08----------
yourself


---------119:09----------
what about that person is not you and if


---------119:12----------
that isn't you


---------119:13----------
then who are you


---------119:16----------
and try to figure out like if this


---------119:18----------
because i agree actually


---------119:20----------
what you see in the mirror is not you


---------119:23----------
then


---------119:25----------
who are you


---------119:28----------
be careful about doing this when you're


---------119:30----------
in a dark place though okay the reason i


---------119:31----------
say like doing alternate nostrils


---------119:33----------
do something else first because if


---------119:34----------
you're in a dark place what you'll


---------119:36----------
notice you can even do this


---------119:37----------
but what you'll notice is that all of


---------119:40----------
the things that are not you


---------119:41----------
or all of the things that you loathe


---------119:43----------
about yourself i wish i was this i


---------119:45----------
should be this you don't want to like


---------119:46----------
give in to that so in a calm way


---------119:50----------
just look in the mirror and try to see


---------119:51----------
like is this me


---------119:53----------
and if not then what am i yeah


---------119:59----------
i like that seems easy enough you know


---------120:04----------
so if you fall asleep during formal


---------120:06----------
practice it seems like you're a


---------120:07----------
contemplative guy


---------120:08----------
so i'd say that you may be someone who


---------120:10----------
benefits from a non-formal meditation


---------120:13----------
practice


---------120:14----------
i definitely recommend one for you down


---------120:16----------
the road but for now


---------120:17----------
like put some structure around your


---------120:20----------
thoughts


---------120:21----------
and every day like you look in a mirror


---------120:22----------
every day


---------120:26----------
yeah so then i'd ask yourself what am i


---------120:28----------
today


---------120:29----------
and is this person me


---------120:33----------
you know and that can be your meditation


---------120:35----------
for now


---------120:38----------
are you giving us a link to your blog by


---------120:39----------
the way


---------120:42----------

---------121:21----------

---------121:52----------
okay um yeah so dom thanks a lot for


---------121:56----------
coming on man


---------121:57----------
oh no thanks for having me you guys


---------121:59----------
really


---------122:01----------
you know put a smile on my face and


---------122:02----------
that's that goes a long ways


---------122:04----------
for a lot of people so i'm gonna leave


---------122:08----------
one last thing for you


---------122:09----------
okay this could be hard but i want you


---------122:13----------
to recognize that at some point


---------122:15----------
somewhere around down the line someone


---------122:18----------
here


---------122:19----------
may be listening to you and be like wow


---------122:20----------
dom seems a lot like me


---------122:23----------
or maybe they'll think he isn't because


---------122:24----------
he's he's more chat he's


---------122:26----------
chad touched and i'm not but


---------122:29----------
dom i'm gonna put some awkward


---------122:31----------
responsibility on you which may be a


---------122:33----------
little bit unfair but i


---------122:34----------
think you need to learn how to


---------122:37----------
be the person that you really want to be


---------122:40----------
if that involves playing bass


---------122:42----------
then learn how to play bass and then


---------122:45----------
come back and


---------122:46----------
tell us what you've learned or how


---------122:48----------
you've grown


---------122:51----------
i know it's it's a lot of responsibility


---------122:55----------
but i i want people to understand that


---------122:57----------
like if they connect with you like


---------122:59----------
you now have a responsibility to each


---------123:02----------
and every person


---------123:02----------
who's watching to see if like


---------123:06----------
you can do it and maybe this is a


---------123:10----------
mistake maybe i'm burdening you too much


---------123:12----------
but like


---------123:14----------
there are people out there who are going


---------123:15----------
to think that it can't be done


---------123:19----------
and you need to prove them wrong


---------123:23----------
i could do that you know what


---------123:27----------
everyone you know


---------123:32----------
it's crazy to me to think that


---------123:35----------
someone else has invested you know


---------123:37----------
someone i've never met


---------123:39----------
is now invested in me


---------123:43----------
and


---------123:46----------
always you look up to heroes and media


---------123:48----------
who


---------123:49----------
do what you're asking me to do and


---------123:53----------
i'm i think i'm willing to commit to


---------123:54----------
that i'm willing to commit to


---------123:57----------
not only improving myself for myself


---------124:00----------
but for someone else that that seems


---------124:02----------
pretty good


---------124:03----------
like for me you know to me good


---------124:06----------
really figuring it out i can i'll accept


---------124:08----------
