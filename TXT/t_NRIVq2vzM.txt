---------00:00----------
and then like i go to sleep the next day


---------00:02----------
i wake up i go to class and what do i


---------00:04----------
feel as i walk into the classroom that


---------00:07----------
shame arises again and says hey go sit


---------00:09----------
at the back


---------00:10----------
and then suddenly that some scar is now


---------00:12----------
controlling my behavior now i've made a


---------00:14----------
shift in my personality and i go and sit


---------00:16----------
at the back of the classroom so


---------00:18----------
today we're going to talk a little bit


---------00:20----------
about personality and the interesting


---------00:21----------
thing about personality is that we tend


---------00:23----------
to view personality as static right and


---------00:26----------
so we say like oh i am this way or i am


---------00:29----------
that way but there's actually


---------00:30----------
overwhelming evidence that personality


---------00:32----------
changes over time so for example there


---------00:35----------
are even things called personality


---------00:37----------
disorders which are when someone's


---------00:39----------
personality is so extreme in a


---------00:41----------
particular dimension that it interferes


---------00:44----------
with their ability to like form


---------00:45----------
relationships and be successful in life


---------00:47----------
and so we actually diagnose it as a


---------00:49----------
pathological condition


---------00:51----------
the good news is that even if you have a


---------00:53----------
personality disorder it's treatable and


---------00:55----------
changeable right so you can like if you


---------00:57----------
have a personality disorder like if


---------00:58----------
you're a narcissist there are things


---------01:00----------
that you can learn and change about your


---------01:02----------
personality to shape it in the right


---------01:04----------
direction


---------01:06----------
so today what i'm going to talk to you


---------01:07----------
all about is how do we shape our


---------01:09----------
personality


---------01:10----------
now this is something that we're going


---------01:11----------
to lean heavily on sort of the eastern


---------01:14----------
perspective and i'm going to start by


---------01:16----------
explaining kind of why


---------01:17----------
so western understanding of personality


---------01:20----------
tends to be at a population level right


---------01:22----------
so if we look at the best


---------01:24----------
validated western scientific construct


---------01:26----------
of personality it's the five factor


---------01:29----------
model which divides personality into


---------01:31----------
five dimensions and you can assess


---------01:33----------
someone's like


---------01:34----------
level on each of these dimensions so how


---------01:37----------
open are they how agreeable are they how


---------01:39----------
extroverted are they how conscientious


---------01:41----------
are they so how neurotic are they so


---------01:43----------
those are like the five dimensions


---------01:46----------
but the thing about western personality


---------01:47----------
analysis is it's not individual so it's


---------01:50----------
like population based so what you could


---------01:52----------
say is that you can you know rank


---------01:54----------
someone's neuroticism and you can say


---------01:55----------
this person is highly neurotic and you


---------01:57----------
can give them an individual you can give


---------01:59----------
a scenario and you can say okay how is


---------02:01----------
this person going to behave


---------02:03----------
what are they going to how are they


---------02:04----------
going to interact in this scenario and


---------02:05----------
you can't really make


---------02:07----------
a concrete behavioral prediction right


---------02:09----------
you can sort of say in general


---------02:11----------
highly neurotic people or highly


---------02:13----------
agreeable people will behave this way


---------02:16----------
versus low agreeable people are less


---------02:18----------
likely to behave that way so you're


---------02:20----------
talking about populations you're talking


---------02:22----------
about probabilities which is very good


---------02:23----------
it's like kind of how western science


---------02:25----------
works


---------02:26----------
but


---------02:26----------
it's not individual right so if you have


---------02:29----------
high neuroticism


---------02:31----------
how you specifically behave and how to


---------02:33----------
shape your individual personality


---------02:36----------
is not something that western science is


---------02:38----------
actually like an expert at because


---------02:40----------
western science tends to look at the


---------02:42----------
population level in averages right so


---------02:45----------
even the model of the five factor model


---------02:47----------
is to try to average out


---------02:50----------
a bunch of individuals to figure out


---------02:53----------
what are these five characteristics that


---------02:54----------
are like generally speaking applicable


---------02:57----------
to everyone so it's a very


---------02:58----------
population-based system


---------03:01----------
so this is not


---------03:02----------
and people may sort of assume for a


---------03:04----------
moment that that's the only way you can


---------03:05----------
do things right how can you measure


---------03:07----------
things at an individual level and like


---------03:08----------
you absolutely can that's literally what


---------03:10----------
you do as a clinician right so as a


---------03:12----------
clinician i have all of this data about


---------03:14----------
personality and depression and


---------03:16----------
epidemiology but at the end of the day


---------03:19----------
an individual comes into my office and i


---------03:21----------
have to make individual decisions based


---------03:23----------
on their individual personality and try


---------03:25----------
to help them move forward right so you


---------03:27----------
can have an evidence-based treatment


---------03:29----------
that works for a personality disorder


---------03:31----------
but once you get in the room with an


---------03:32----------
individual you have to apply that


---------03:34----------
treatment at a level that there's no


---------03:36----------
there's going to be no randomized


---------03:38----------
controls trial that is going to teach


---------03:40----------
you


---------03:41----------
what is going to work 100 for an


---------03:43----------
individual patient in your office


---------03:46----------
the eastern perspective on personality


---------03:48----------
though i think is far more applicable to


---------03:51----------
an individual level and the reason for


---------03:54----------
that is because the yogis were like


---------03:55----------
looking at an n of one right they


---------03:57----------
weren't studying external things they


---------04:00----------
were studying things internally so they


---------04:01----------
asked the question how does my mind work


---------04:04----------
right and they looked at what was going


---------04:05----------
on in their mind and so they had perfect


---------04:07----------
information on one person


---------04:09----------
but questionable whether it applied to


---------04:11----------
anyone else so we're going to use that


---------04:13----------
model today so the way that we're going


---------04:15----------
to understand how to shape our


---------04:16----------
personality has a few steps the first is


---------04:18----------
that we're going to talk a little bit


---------04:20----------
about what is personality how do we


---------04:22----------
define personality like like literally


---------04:24----------
what is it once we understand what it is


---------04:26----------
we can move on to okay so now that we


---------04:29----------
know what it is how does it get


---------04:31----------
constructed so like where does it come


---------04:32----------
from


---------04:33----------
once we understand how it gets


---------04:35----------
constructed and where it comes from we


---------04:37----------
can start to make alterations in the way


---------04:40----------
that we are shaping our personality


---------04:42----------
because now we understand how it gets


---------04:43----------
put together so we can change how we put


---------04:45----------
it together


---------04:47----------
at this point we're going to talk a


---------04:48----------
little bit about how most people shape


---------04:50----------
their personalities and then an


---------04:52----------
alternative to the way that most people


---------04:54----------
do it okay let me use some gaming


---------04:56----------
analogies there and then we'll hopefully


---------04:58----------
leave you with sort of an idea of how


---------05:00----------
you can go about shaping your


---------05:02----------
personality in a particular direction


---------05:05----------
and this this sort of makes sense


---------05:06----------
because if you look at monks for example


---------05:09----------
right so like people who are very


---------05:10----------
spiritually adept they seem chiller they


---------05:13----------
seem calmer they're more open to things


---------05:15----------
they're able to be like more resilient


---------05:18----------
there's all kinds of you know data we


---------05:20----------
talked about adhd and parenting the


---------05:22----------
other day where we there was a study


---------05:23----------
that showed that mindful parenting


---------05:25----------
reduces symptoms of child adhd and


---------05:28----------
improves like parenting behaviors and so


---------05:30----------
if you kind of think about that like how


---------05:31----------
does that work right like what's going


---------05:33----------
on in the mind of the person of the


---------05:35----------
parent where you can teach them a


---------05:37----------
particular way of behaving which then


---------05:39----------
over time will shape their personality


---------05:41----------
which results in like all kinds of


---------05:43----------
benefits so you can absolutely adjust


---------05:45----------
your personality through essentially


---------05:47----------
spiritual practices like meditation


---------05:49----------
things like that right maybe not


---------05:51----------
spiritual anymore they're starting


---------05:52----------
starting to become scientific this is


---------05:54----------
what the yogis did they like learned how


---------05:55----------
to be like less reactive to stuff more


---------05:58----------
open to things um they're more motivated


---------06:00----------
more driven like more focused uh you


---------06:03----------
know they're able to control what they


---------06:05----------
eat so they shape all kinds of things


---------06:06----------
about themselves


---------06:08----------
and so we're going to share that with


---------06:09----------
y'all okay


---------06:10----------
so the first


---------06:12----------
is what is personality so how do we know


---------06:14----------
whether your personality is like


---------06:17----------
different from someone else's


---------06:18----------
personality right you are an individual


---------06:20----------
you have your own personality maybe


---------06:22----------
you've got a friend you've got a partner


---------06:23----------
you've got a parent you've got a sibling


---------06:25----------
and they have a different personality so


---------06:27----------
if i was an alien


---------06:29----------
observing people from space how would i


---------06:32----------
figure out whether two people have


---------06:34----------
different personalities or the same


---------06:35----------
personality right


---------06:37----------
and so essentially what personality is


---------06:39----------
is our individual way of reacting to a


---------06:42----------
particular scenario


---------06:44----------
so if someone rings my doorbell do i you


---------06:47----------
know open it up right away or do i like


---------06:49----------
peek through the window to see who it is


---------06:52----------
so like people will do all kinds of


---------06:53----------
different behaviors


---------06:55----------
given a common scenario the first day


---------06:58----------
when i go to class where in the


---------07:00----------
classroom do i sit do i sit in the front


---------07:02----------
do i sit all the way in the back do i


---------07:03----------
sit somewhere in the middle do i try to


---------07:05----------
sit away from other people do i try to


---------07:07----------
sit next to certain people how do i


---------07:09----------
select who i sit


---------07:11----------
close to right so all of these even if


---------07:14----------
we take an individual scenario


---------07:17----------
and we present


---------07:18----------
10 people with the same scenario it is


---------07:21----------
their reaction to that scenario and how


---------07:23----------
they behave that shapes their


---------07:24----------
personality so my personality is a


---------07:27----------
combination of where i sit in the


---------07:29----------
classroom with what i do first thing in


---------07:31----------
the morning how i open the door to my


---------07:33----------
house you know what i do when someone


---------07:35----------
cuts me off when i'm driving you know


---------07:38----------
like how i relate to someone who is 15


---------07:40----------
minutes late for a date that we're


---------07:42----------
supposed to be on so all of this


---------07:44----------
constellation of how i behave


---------07:47----------
with the outside world determines my


---------07:50----------
personality right


---------07:52----------
and so like each of these individual


---------07:53----------
things i may overlap with some people in


---------07:56----------
some ways so for example


---------07:58----------
at the very beginning of of my college


---------08:00----------
career i started sitting at the front


---------08:02----------
because i was a try-hard and up at the


---------08:04----------
front were all of the other tryhards and


---------08:07----------
then gradually over time as i started to


---------08:09----------
fail my classes and stuff like that i


---------08:11----------
started to sit towards the back because


---------08:12----------
then i was ashamed and i didn't answer


---------08:14----------
any of the questions and i tried to


---------08:15----------
disappear into my seat most of the time


---------08:18----------
i was in the class right and then


---------08:20----------
towards like medical school i sort of


---------08:22----------
sat off to the side because i was just


---------08:23----------
kind of like doing my own thing i'll let


---------08:25----------
the tryhards be in the front i'll let


---------08:26----------
the failures be in the back and i'm just


---------08:28----------
going to be like chilling like doing my


---------08:29----------
own thing on the side and then there


---------08:31----------
were the side sitters that came and


---------08:32----------
joined me and we got along great right


---------08:35----------
so there are these like shared


---------08:36----------
personality characteristics which you


---------08:38----------
can see in an individual scenario


---------08:40----------
but it's not like all the side sitters


---------08:43----------
are also like all the door peekers right


---------08:45----------
like there's all kinds of different


---------08:47----------
they're not the same people as the road


---------08:49----------
ragers


---------08:50----------
and so while there are shared


---------08:51----------
characteristics essentially personality


---------08:54----------
is the way that you respond to a


---------08:57----------
particular scenario and when we take all


---------09:00----------
of the different ways that you respond


---------09:02----------
or react or you're inclined to behave in


---------09:05----------
a particular scenario and we put them


---------09:06----------
all together that is the personality


---------09:09----------
that is the individual you okay


---------09:11----------
so then the question kind of becomes


---------09:13----------
okay like where does the personality


---------09:15----------
come from right so if these are all your


---------09:17----------
individual reactions to particular


---------09:19----------
scenarios how does your mind know how to


---------09:22----------
behave


---------09:23----------
what is your in where does your


---------09:24----------
inclination come from


---------09:26----------
so this is where we're going to move to


---------09:27----------
a little bit of sunscreen okay


---------09:30----------
so


---------09:31----------
in


---------09:36----------
so the yogis essentially came up with


---------09:40----------
a handful of terms to understand the


---------09:42----------
mind okay


---------09:45----------
so we talked about what is personality


---------09:48----------
right


---------09:50----------
so


---------09:52----------
let's just run through what we're going


---------09:54----------
to talk about today


---------09:55----------
so what is personality


---------10:01----------
right it is a constellation


---------10:06----------
of reactions


---------10:09----------
to scenarios


---------10:12----------
right it's the way that we interact with


---------10:13----------
the world


---------10:15----------
oh i see a little bit of lagging okay


---------10:18----------
next is


---------10:20----------
you know what are the components so like


---------10:21----------
where does personality come from


---------10:26----------
so then it kind of follows


---------10:32----------
that


---------10:33----------
you know like


---------10:36----------
our reactions to scenarios are going to


---------10:38----------
be based on our experiences right


---------10:42----------
so for example let's say i'm a front


---------10:44----------
sitter so i walk into the classroom and


---------10:46----------
i sit at the front and then i make an


---------10:48----------
observation


---------10:50----------
that if you're in the front you get


---------10:52----------
called on a lot more


---------10:54----------
as a result i get called on i don't know


---------10:56----------
the answer to a question i feel stupid


---------10:58----------
and then what's gonna happen is i've


---------11:00----------
been shaped a little bit right i've been


---------11:02----------
altered i've had an experience that then


---------11:05----------
makes me now


---------11:07----------
sit in the back


---------11:08----------
right so suddenly like in that moment my


---------11:10----------
personality has been shaped okay


---------11:13----------
so let's try to understand a little bit


---------11:15----------
about what are the components of the


---------11:16----------
mind so how did the yogis sort of figure


---------11:18----------
this out


---------11:20----------
the first thing that they noticed is


---------11:21----------
that there are there's a part of the


---------11:22----------
mind called the manus for those of you


---------11:24----------
that have watched dr k's guide you'll be


---------11:26----------
very familiar with this okay


---------11:28----------
so the minus is the emotional mind


---------11:32----------
and is judgmental


---------11:34----------
so it's like reactive


---------11:37----------
okay so for example


---------11:39----------
do you like pineapple on pizza some


---------11:41----------
people will say yes it's delicious some


---------11:42----------
people will say it is disgusting and it


---------11:45----------
is it is the sin of the greatest


---------11:47----------
magnitude


---------11:48----------
but if you think a little bit about how


---------11:50----------
you determine whether you like whether


---------11:53----------
you like it or not is irrelevant let's


---------11:54----------
think a little bit about how you decide


---------11:56----------
which camp you're in you take a bite of


---------11:58----------
it and then some part of your being says


---------12:00----------
yes this is amazing or oh this is awful


---------12:03----------
right oysters are another good example


---------12:04----------
of like some people are super into it


---------12:06----------
some people like this is slimy and cold


---------12:08----------
and


---------12:09----------
overly salty right


---------12:12----------
so the monus is essentially our reactive


---------12:15----------
mind that also experiences emotions


---------12:17----------
because emotions are also reactive right


---------12:18----------
so let's say that


---------12:20----------
you know i'm i walk into class one day


---------12:23----------
and then someone asked me a question


---------12:25----------
like hey how did you sleep last night


---------12:27----------
and then like i noticed everyone is


---------12:28----------
looking at me and they're like grinning


---------12:30----------
a little bit and it's like


---------12:32----------
what on earth is going on right so i


---------12:34----------
feel a little bit embarrassed i don't


---------12:35----------
understand what's happening logically


---------12:37----------
but my mind reacts to that scenario i


---------12:39----------
recognize that i'm the butt of the joke


---------12:40----------
in some way there's something weird


---------12:42----------
going on right so i'm on my guard i


---------12:44----------
answer very carefully so that that sort


---------12:47----------
of emotional response


---------12:49----------
is


---------12:50----------
like from the mana so it's like reactive


---------12:52----------
it's sudden it's quick


---------12:54----------
the next thing is our ahamkar


---------12:57----------
or our ego


---------13:00----------
or sense of self


---------13:04----------
okay so this is like our identity this


---------13:07----------
is not a reaction


---------13:09----------
it's not an emotion it is a sense of


---------13:11----------
self it's also not logical or analytical


---------13:14----------
it's just i believe i am this right so


---------13:16----------
it's like an ego generally speaking the


---------13:19----------
ahamkar acts to protect you from things


---------13:22----------
in the manus so when i'm feeling ashamed


---------13:25----------
of myself my ego my my ego or sense of


---------13:28----------
identity will do something to actually


---------13:31----------
alleviate that shame and sometimes it


---------13:32----------
can be kind of paradoxical


---------13:34----------
right so i'll give you guys just a


---------13:36----------
simple example of this if i'm feeling


---------13:38----------
like i'm a bad person i'm ashamed of


---------13:40----------
myself


---------13:42----------
the ahamkar can actually tell me yeah


---------13:44----------
you deserve that because you're nothing


---------13:46----------
you know you don't deserve any love so


---------13:48----------
if i like tell myself that i don't


---------13:50----------
deserve love


---------13:51----------
then i can't feel rejected because i


---------13:53----------
never should have gotten it in the first


---------13:55----------
place even though paradoxically


---------13:58----------
it may seem like that is actually


---------14:00----------
hurting you to determine your identity


---------14:02----------
as someone who doesn't deserve love if


---------14:04----------
you really think about it it's actually


---------14:06----------
really good armor right so if it's a


---------14:08----------
part of the natural order for you to not


---------14:10----------
be loved by another human being then


---------14:13----------
like life is far less painful because


---------14:15----------
everything sort of makes sense there's


---------14:16----------
like no hope you're just like insulated


---------14:18----------
from it right you start to become numb


---------14:20----------
so ego can be kind of bizarre


---------14:24----------
next thing is a some scar


---------14:27----------
so in the east


---------14:28----------
a constellation of some scars is our


---------14:31----------
personality so a samskar is


---------14:35----------
sort of an impression in the mind


---------14:43----------
that


---------14:44----------
is recalled


---------14:47----------
in a particular scenario


---------14:52----------
so it's like


---------14:53----------
activating programming okay in western


---------14:56----------
psychology the closest thing is a schema


---------14:58----------
from the cognitive behavioral


---------15:00----------
uh realm


---------15:02----------
so like for example


---------15:04----------
you know if i walk into the bathroom


---------15:07----------
like even if i've never been to that


---------15:08----------
bathroom before let's say i'm at a


---------15:10----------
restaurant my mind knows how to operate


---------15:13----------
the toilet in the bathroom right and how


---------15:15----------
does my mind know that it's because when


---------15:16----------
it sees the bathroom it recalls


---------15:19----------
particular programming it says oh we


---------15:20----------
need to access bathroom.exe


---------15:23----------
but


---------15:24----------
some scars are not just that simple so


---------15:26----------
they also get to be quite complex so


---------15:29----------
let's say that i'm in a relationship


---------15:30----------
where my partner has cheated on me and


---------15:33----------
as a result of like my partner cheating


---------15:35----------
on me i start to become distrustful and


---------15:37----------
then when i start to get into the next


---------15:40----------
relationship and my partner is 15


---------15:42----------
minutes late for a date


---------15:44----------
like


---------15:45----------
cheating.exe or cheatingparanoia.exe


---------15:48----------
starts to activate and so these like


---------15:50----------
pent-up emotions from my past


---------15:51----------
relationship start to project and come


---------15:54----------
out as malware in my current


---------15:56----------
relationship okay


---------15:58----------
and so that's another example of a sum


---------15:59----------
scar so we talk about some scars


---------16:01----------
oftentimes as like negative things


---------16:04----------
but they don't necessarily have to be


---------16:05----------
negative they're just programming in the


---------16:07----------
mind


---------16:08----------
okay


---------16:10----------
so then if we think a little bit about


---------16:11----------
personality


---------16:14----------
personality is a collect uh oh gg


---------16:17----------
okay that's okay we don't need it


---------16:20----------
so if we think about a little bit about


---------16:21----------
programming in the mind


---------16:23----------
we got to the sanskrit stuff which is


---------16:25----------
the important thing


---------16:26----------
okay


---------16:27----------
so we think about programming in the


---------16:29----------
mind


---------16:30----------
it's essentially like a collection of


---------16:32----------
some scars and then our collection of


---------16:34----------
some scars is our personality right


---------16:36----------
because like when we respond to


---------16:37----------
different things in different ways


---------16:39----------
whether i'm a


---------16:40----------
a front sitter or a back sitter depends


---------16:43----------
on the some scar of


---------16:46----------
getting called on in class so when i get


---------16:48----------
called on in class and i don't know the


---------16:50----------
answer that shame


---------16:52----------
make like makes an impression in my mind


---------16:55----------
goes dormant in my mind


---------16:57----------
and then like sits around and then


---------16:59----------
reactivates in particular scenarios okay


---------17:02----------
so the way that we form some scars is


---------17:04----------
essentially by improper digestion of


---------17:07----------
experiences so i'll give you guys just a


---------17:09----------
simple let's use that example okay so


---------17:12----------
if i have


---------17:14----------
um


---------17:15----------
so let's say i sit at the front of the


---------17:16----------
classroom and i get called on by my


---------17:18----------
teacher


---------17:19----------
and then like i don't know the answer so


---------17:21----------
then i feel ashamed of myself and then


---------17:23----------
there's like two different options at


---------17:24----------
that point right so i can sit i can


---------17:27----------
process the shame and i can kind of talk


---------17:28----------
to my friends about it i can talk to my


---------17:30----------
parents about it whatever and if i have


---------17:32----------
like a supportive group and i share my


---------17:34----------
feelings and i work through it you know


---------17:36----------
like maybe my dad says something like


---------17:38----------
well you know like i understand that it


---------17:39----------
was embarrassing for you so you've got


---------17:40----------
like two choices right you can either


---------17:42----------
study harder and therefore be prepared


---------17:45----------
and get called on or what you can do is


---------17:48----------
retreat to the back of the class you've


---------17:49----------
got either of those two options


---------17:51----------
but even understanding that you have


---------17:53----------
those two options involves a certain


---------17:55----------
amount of like processing and thinking


---------17:58----------
about your situation


---------18:00----------
okay so most people as they go through


---------18:02----------
life don't really process and think


---------18:05----------
through scenarios when they happen to


---------18:06----------
them right and generally speaking we're


---------18:08----------
not like actively processing stuff day


---------18:11----------
in and day out as stuff happens to you


---------18:13----------
in life you're not like sitting there


---------18:14----------
and like reflecting on it on a daily


---------18:16----------
basis you just kind of get up and live


---------18:18----------
your day and you have an accumulation of


---------18:20----------
experiences


---------18:22----------
as those experiences happen they tend to


---------18:24----------
go dormant right so let's say that


---------18:26----------
the school scenario again so i get


---------18:28----------
called on and uh sitting in the front


---------18:30----------
row i feel ashamed of myself and then i


---------18:32----------
go home and i feel shame right i feel


---------18:34----------
like kind of crappy so what do i do do i


---------18:36----------
sit there and think about it do i


---------18:38----------
process it no i turn on a video game


---------18:40----------
log on to some kind of social media or


---------18:42----------
content you know consumption website


---------18:45----------
and my mind disappears into the void for


---------18:48----------
like four hours


---------18:50----------
and then by then the shame is kind of


---------18:51----------
like calmed down some it hasn't been


---------18:54----------
processed


---------18:55----------
and then like i go to sleep the next day


---------18:57----------
i wake up i go to class and what do i


---------18:59----------
feel as i walk into the classroom that


---------19:02----------
shame arises again and says hey go sit


---------19:04----------
at the back


---------19:05----------
and then suddenly that some scar is now


---------19:08----------
controlling my behavior now i've made a


---------19:10----------
shift in my personality and i go and sit


---------19:12----------
at the back of the classroom and then i


---------19:13----------
feel a little bit relieved because okay


---------19:15----------
now i won't be called on it's like not a


---------19:17----------
big deal


---------19:18----------
as i leave class that day once again i


---------19:20----------
kind of remembered like oh maybe i could


---------19:22----------
have like sat at the front maybe i


---------19:24----------
should have read yesterday


---------19:26----------
instead of playing video games but like


---------19:28----------
that kind of makes me feel guilty i go


---------19:30----------
home


---------19:31----------
i'm feeling kind of guilty ah it's not


---------19:34----------
that big of a deal okay let me just play


---------19:35----------
games again so i play games again now i


---------19:38----------
don't feel even as prepared for school


---------19:40----------
the next day so the next day i go in i


---------19:42----------
kind of like go sit in the back and then


---------19:44----------
suddenly i've lost


---------19:46----------
right


---------19:47----------
it's like


---------19:48----------
my personality has been altered the way


---------19:50----------
that i've reacted to situations has been


---------19:52----------
altered


---------19:53----------
i'm now starting to be controlled by


---------19:55----------
some of these behaviors like shame and


---------19:57----------
guilt and stuff like that i'm starting


---------19:59----------
to dig a hole for myself and it's kind


---------20:00----------
of like gg


---------20:02----------
right so the way that we actually live


---------20:04----------
most of our life is the way that most


---------20:06----------
people play video games so i know this


---------20:08----------
sounds kind of weird but like if you


---------20:09----------
think about a competitive game


---------20:11----------
so once you calibrate for example to a


---------20:13----------
particular mmr in a competitive game


---------20:15----------
let's call it overwatcher lol or dota or


---------20:18----------
whatever


---------20:19----------
most people historically if you look at


---------20:21----------
most of the player base they will stay


---------20:23----------
at their particular skill for their


---------20:25----------
entire lifespan right so like


---------20:28----------
1500 mmr players will stay 1500 mmrs


---------20:31----------
like if you go to like if you play a


---------20:32----------
game of dota for example i just play


---------20:34----------
dota but this is true of law or


---------20:35----------
overwatch or call of duty or whatever if


---------20:38----------
you have a particular mmr there are


---------20:39----------
people who will have thousands of hours


---------20:41----------
played


---------20:42----------
and like will still suck at the game


---------20:45----------
right and if you kind of think about


---------20:46----------
that


---------20:47----------
it's kind of surprising like how can


---------20:49----------
thousa how can you play for thousands


---------20:51----------
and thousands and thousands of


---------20:53----------
hours and like still suck at the game


---------20:56----------
and like not get better


---------20:58----------
and this is the other interesting thing


---------20:59----------
is if you look at people who are at the


---------21:00----------
top of like let's say you look at the


---------21:02----------
challenger level in law or immortal rank


---------21:04----------
and in dota or whatever right or like


---------21:06----------
diamond rank and starcraft or masters


---------21:08----------
and starcraft or whatever game you want


---------21:10----------
to


---------21:11----------
a lot of times they don't they haven't


---------21:13----------
played more than like people who are


---------21:15----------
5000 mmr below them right there does not


---------21:18----------
appear to be thank you


---------21:20----------
there does not appear to be


---------21:22----------
a correlation between how many hours you


---------21:26----------
play and how good you are at the game


---------21:28----------
so you can be a professional player


---------21:30----------
right so like for example team spirit


---------21:32----------
one ti last year and i don't know how


---------21:34----------
many hours they've played dota but i can


---------21:36----------
guarantee you that there are people who


---------21:37----------
are 2000 mmr who have played the same


---------21:40----------
number of hours of dota so what this


---------21:42----------
sort of implies is actually something


---------21:44----------
that's quite staggering


---------21:46----------
which is that


---------21:48----------
most of like when we play video games we


---------21:50----------
don't think about the game afterward


---------21:53----------
right so how do we stay


---------21:55----------
low mmr despite thousands of hours of


---------21:57----------
play it's because we're like robots so i


---------22:00----------
play a game i like pick a random hero i


---------22:02----------
don't really like think about the game


---------22:03----------
after i don't watch my own replays


---------22:06----------
i don't like process or


---------22:08----------
credit like you know think about what


---------22:09----------
i'm doing critically i just queue up for


---------22:10----------
the next game i'm just kind of like on


---------22:11----------
autopilot


---------22:13----------
and as a result like i don't actually


---------22:15----------
get better right so i'm not gonna


---------22:17----------
improve my personality at dota the way


---------22:20----------
that i react to scenarios in the game


---------22:22----------
does not change because i'm not thinking


---------22:24----------
about them afterward so if i lose my


---------22:27----------
lane i'm just going to go and tp there


---------22:29----------
three times and just continue to feed


---------22:30----------
i'm not going to make any adjustments


---------22:32----------
because i haven't been critical about


---------22:34----------
the way that i played the game


---------22:36----------
and it actually happens to be exactly


---------22:38----------
the same way in real life right so as i


---------22:40----------
go through negative experiences


---------22:43----------
i don't actually process or think


---------22:45----------
critically about how i'm like what's


---------22:48----------
going on here right


---------22:49----------
i just sort of like autopilot it and so


---------22:51----------
i say the same damn mmr we start to


---------22:54----------
think about personality is static


---------22:57----------
and then we like just live our lives


---------22:59----------
with this personality right so then we


---------23:00----------
assign labels to ourselves we say i'm


---------23:03----------
lazy


---------23:04----------
i'm not a morning person


---------23:06----------
right i just can't do that i can't


---------23:08----------
handle parties


---------23:09----------
i'm like


---------23:11----------
i'm just not like i am not like that and


---------23:14----------
so you start to define things about


---------23:16----------
yourself which then start to doom you


---------23:18----------
right because now like if you're lazy


---------23:20----------
like gg noob like what can you do you


---------23:23----------
can try to biohack your way to whatever


---------23:24----------
you want to but like laziness plus all


---------23:27----------
these and this is why the biohacking


---------23:29----------
life hacking industry is so big it's


---------23:31----------
because people assign themselves with a


---------23:33----------
personality attribute


---------23:34----------
that is static and then like since


---------23:36----------
that's unchangeable i need to use some


---------23:39----------
kind of like broken op technique to


---------23:42----------
bypass my core personality


---------23:44----------
right that's like that's why this


---------23:46----------
industry is so big it's because you


---------23:47----------
don't need to change


---------23:49----------
you just need to take this herbal


---------23:50----------
supplement and your life will transform


---------23:53----------
right


---------23:55----------
so then the question becomes but like


---------23:56----------
can we gain mmr in a game of dota in in


---------23:59----------
the game of dota and the answer is


---------24:00----------
absolutely yes we can gain mmr right we


---------24:02----------
can think about what we do we can


---------24:05----------
reflect on what we can do


---------24:07----------
we can start to be intentional about how


---------24:09----------
we behave how we react to experiences


---------24:12----------
is actually not step away from


---------24:14----------
intentional intentionality of action for


---------24:16----------
a second but how we react and process


---------24:18----------
and digest experiences


---------24:20----------
will result in mmr gains right so if i


---------24:22----------
lose my lane i go watch the replay and i


---------24:24----------
realize okay this is a scenario where i


---------24:27----------
did a and i should have done b


---------24:29----------
so if i learn from that mistake then my


---------24:32----------
mmr will increase a little bit


---------24:34----------
and the interesting thing is that is


---------24:36----------
absolutely true in real life so the


---------24:38----------
first group of people who did this were


---------24:40----------
the yogis i mean maybe there were other


---------24:42----------
people i don't you know i don't know the


---------24:43----------
ancient history of africa for example so


---------24:45----------
there may have been people who predated


---------24:46----------
the yogis there but generally speaking


---------24:48----------
you know yoga is about five to six


---------24:50----------
thousand years old so like you know


---------24:53----------
3000 4000 bc or bce


---------24:56----------
you know like people were figuring this


---------24:58----------
out and essentially what even now we


---------25:00----------
sort of get this right we have a class


---------25:02----------
of people


---------25:03----------
like monks or yogis who we sort of


---------25:06----------
assume are like in control of their crap


---------25:08----------
right they're able to like wake up at


---------25:10----------
4am every day and like meditate for


---------25:12----------
three hours and like do yoga they're


---------25:14----------
able to like not be tempted by sexual


---------25:17----------
desires not be tempted or be able to


---------25:18----------
resist their sexual desires be able to


---------25:21----------
resist dietary desires be like be like


---------25:24----------
non-monetary things like that so we have


---------25:26----------
yogis out there who are like capable of


---------25:28----------
controlling all this crap


---------25:30----------
and we look at them and we're like you


---------25:32----------
know that that person does that because


---------25:33----------
they're a monk right that's their job


---------25:36----------
but if you really think about it now the


---------25:38----------
way that they react to scenarios is


---------25:41----------
is transformed drastically


---------25:44----------
because you had someone who used to


---------25:46----------
react this way this way this way this


---------25:47----------
way


---------25:48----------
and now the way they react to all those


---------25:50----------
scenarios has changed a lot so


---------25:51----------
essentially what they've done is altered


---------25:53----------
their personality right they've


---------25:56----------
literally changed the way that they


---------25:57----------
react to scenarios therefore that


---------25:58----------
becomes a personality alteration


---------26:00----------
and so then


---------26:02----------
if we kind of stop and think about it


---------26:03----------
for a second like there's a way they did


---------26:05----------
that right they consistently do that


---------26:07----------
this is a profession that consistently


---------26:09----------
trains people


---------26:11----------
to alter the way they react to scenarios


---------26:14----------
so this is like a group of super high


---------26:16----------
mmr people right this is like an


---------26:19----------
in-house league that only has immortal


---------26:20----------
players


---------26:23----------
so what i want to share with y'all today


---------26:26----------
is essentially like how to do that right


---------26:29----------
and it turns out to be actually


---------26:30----------
relatively simple


---------26:32----------
so if you want to start shaping your


---------26:33----------
personality instead of focusing on what


---------26:36----------
you do right so this is what everyone


---------26:38----------
focuses on they focus on the behavior


---------26:40----------
they're like how do i wake up early in


---------26:41----------
the morning


---------26:42----------
how do i study more how do i do this


---------26:44----------
this is my problem this is my problem


---------26:45----------
this is my problem they're always


---------26:47----------
focused on the problem and looking


---------26:49----------
forward


---------26:50----------
instead what you need to do is look at


---------26:53----------
your reactions to things


---------26:55----------
right so


---------26:56----------
if i lose a game of dota i'm thinking


---------26:58----------
how do i win the next game how what


---------27:00----------
should i pick and you guys may have


---------27:01----------
fallen into this trap where you get


---------27:03----------
crushed by a particular hero you're like


---------27:04----------
that hero is so freaking op i'm gonna


---------27:07----------
pick that hero i'm gonna win the game


---------27:08----------
it's gonna be easy i'm always looking


---------27:10----------
forward how do i fix this problem how do


---------27:12----------
i fix this our entire society is like


---------27:14----------
based on fixing problems right oh we've


---------27:16----------
got this thing that will help you fix


---------27:18----------
your problem we've got this biohack here


---------27:20----------
you know we're trying to fix this we're


---------27:21----------
trying to fix this is always moving


---------27:22----------
forward how do we increase quarterly


---------27:24----------
profits how do we increase how do we


---------27:26----------
sign bigger deals how do we have more


---------27:27----------
customers how do i get a raise how do i


---------27:30----------
get promoted it's always like looking


---------27:31----------
forward how to do better better better


---------27:33----------
better better better


---------27:35----------
so what we don't look at


---------27:37----------
is the way we react we react to things


---------27:39----------
and this is how we get stuck right so


---------27:41----------
what happens in the game of dota if i


---------27:42----------
get crushed by a particular hero and i


---------27:45----------
pick that hero because that hero's opie


---------27:47----------
i lose


---------27:49----------
right and then but hold on a second but


---------27:51----------
like that hero is so op


---------27:53----------
right so i need to be less lazy i need


---------27:55----------
to start drinking this supplement and


---------27:57----------
then my life will transform


---------27:59----------
you're always looking forward and so


---------28:01----------
your personality doesn't shape it


---------28:03----------
doesn't change because how is


---------28:04----------
personality shaped personality is not


---------28:07----------
shaped by what you do is shaped by how


---------28:09----------
you react


---------28:11----------
to particular scenarios it is your


---------28:13----------
default response two things and if you


---------28:16----------
can change your default response to


---------28:18----------
things your life will transform


---------28:20----------
i kid you not let's go back to the the


---------28:23----------
person who sits at the front of the


---------28:24----------
classroom answers a question in a


---------28:26----------
particular way


---------28:27----------
they get the question wrong they feel


---------28:29----------
ashamed of themselves and remember


---------28:31----------
there's two options right


---------28:34----------
so on the one hand i can


---------28:36----------
it's okay screw this i'm gonna avoid the


---------28:37----------
scenario i'm gonna sit at the back


---------28:39----------
option number one or wow like this


---------28:41----------
really felt bad i feel ashamed of myself


---------28:43----------
how am i going to react to that i'm


---------28:45----------
actually going to make sure i study


---------28:46----------
tomorrow i'm going to study tonight so


---------28:48----------
that tomorrow whenever i get asked a


---------28:50----------
question i'm going to be ready for it


---------28:52----------
and if you think about these two people


---------28:54----------
you say that these two people have


---------28:56----------
different personalities i wish i had


---------28:58----------
that other personality i wish when life


---------29:01----------
you know when i lost a game of dota i


---------29:03----------
learned from my mistake and went into


---------29:05----------
the next game like prepared to do even


---------29:06----------
better i wish that when i did poorly in


---------29:09----------
life when i got dumped by a boyfriend or


---------29:10----------
girlfriend that


---------29:13----------
i reacted stronger so that i would be


---------29:14----------
like a stronger human being instead of


---------29:16----------
resentful in my next relationship right


---------29:18----------
this is what we wish and what we all


---------29:20----------
focus on is how do i be healthier in my


---------29:22----------
next relationship how do i find a


---------29:24----------
successful relationship this is the


---------29:26----------
other problem that we run into with


---------29:27----------
relationships


---------29:28----------
is that when we have a bad relationship


---------29:30----------
we go and look for the perfect partner


---------29:32----------
right we look for a partner who will


---------29:34----------
like be less this way and more this way


---------29:37----------
and so you end up with online dating


---------29:38----------
profiles where everyone is looking for


---------29:40----------
like the perfect thing they're like oh


---------29:42----------
now i have access to the internet which


---------29:44----------
has like a hundred thousand people on it


---------29:46----------
so let me list out all of my


---------29:47----------
requirements and as long as i find the


---------29:50----------
right person i'm looking for mr right


---------29:52----------
i'm looking for mrs wright right all the


---------29:54----------
good ones are taken they're not


---------29:56----------
available anymore what i want is not


---------29:58----------
available it's out of stock


---------30:01----------
but instead what they should be doing is


---------30:03----------
if this particular person if this


---------30:04----------
relationship didn't go well


---------30:06----------
what was my contribution to it and this


---------30:09----------
is why people like it's so hard to date


---------30:10----------
online right now is because people have


---------30:12----------
stopped being like self-reflective like


---------30:14----------
people are just like instead of changing


---------30:16----------
myself at all what i'm looking for is


---------30:19----------
like some weird


---------30:20----------
you know frankenstein's monster or


---------30:23----------
chimera of like different pieces of


---------30:25----------
things that is assembled into the


---------30:27----------
perfect human that i want and i'm


---------30:29----------
looking for that thing and then like the


---------30:31----------
problem is that you may have found that


---------30:32----------
thing but that thing may not want to


---------30:33----------
date you because have you done any kind


---------30:35----------
of self-reflection


---------30:37----------
and so if we want to shape our


---------30:38----------
personality it's not about fixing the


---------30:40----------
problem


---------30:41----------
it's about looking at how we react to


---------30:44----------
particular scenarios because that's the


---------30:46----------
training of a monk the core training of


---------30:48----------
a monk is to look at their reactions to


---------30:50----------
things


---------30:51----------
right it's to eat something that they


---------30:53----------
find tasty or not tasty and study your


---------30:57----------
reaction to a particular thing


---------30:59----------
as you process that reaction as you work


---------31:02----------
through that reaction you will be free


---------31:04----------
of that personality change


---------31:06----------
now there is an overwhelming amount of


---------31:08----------
evidence that this is successful forget


---------31:10----------
about monks for a second let's go to


---------31:12----------
actual let's go back to science so the


---------31:14----------
practice of clinical psychotherapy is


---------31:16----------
essentially a formalized process of this


---------31:19----------
okay so when someone comes into my


---------31:21----------
office with a personality disorder this


---------31:24----------
is an aspect of their personality which


---------31:26----------
through


---------31:27----------
helping them change the way that they


---------31:29----------
react and study the way that they react


---------31:31----------
i can actually like help them over the


---------31:34----------
course of a year or two no longer become


---------31:36----------
narcissistic and if you think about that


---------31:38----------
like how on earth does that work and


---------31:39----------
what literally happens is someone will


---------31:40----------
come in and they'll say


---------31:42----------
you know christmas was a mess and i'll


---------31:43----------
say what happened well like someone like


---------31:46----------
didn't like they invited me but like


---------31:48----------
they didn't even think to ask me about


---------31:50----------
my dietary restrictions


---------31:52----------
and i'm kind of confused i'm like okay


---------31:54----------
well like you know they're your parents


---------31:56----------
don't they know your dietary


---------31:57----------
restrictions like why would they need to


---------31:59----------
ask you about them they're like well i


---------32:01----------
decided to go vegan three months ago and


---------32:02----------
they like didn't ask about that


---------32:04----------
it's like okay so your parents are 72


---------32:07----------
you're 41


---------32:09----------
and you're upset because your parents


---------32:11----------
didn't think to ask about dietary


---------32:13----------
restrictions


---------32:14----------
right like


---------32:15----------
i'm confused but that's what the


---------32:17----------
narcissistic person thinks they're like


---------32:18----------
i've made such a big change you know


---------32:20----------
they didn't even think to ask about it


---------32:22----------
and so i went there and there was like


---------32:23----------
no vegan food


---------32:24----------
and and so i you know i'm kind of


---------32:26----------
confused but like this is the mind of a


---------32:29----------
narcissistic person


---------32:31----------
so as we sit there and we sort of think


---------32:32----------
a little bit about okay so like what's


---------32:34----------
your expectation


---------32:36----------
right like what do you think they should


---------32:37----------
do like at what interval should they ask


---------32:39----------
you if you've made dietary restrictions


---------32:41----------
right and if you start to like ask these


---------32:44----------
kinds of questions it's it's quickly


---------32:46----------
becomes absurd


---------32:47----------
that you know your parents are gonna ask


---------32:49----------
you like what once every three months


---------32:50----------
once a year by the way if you decided to


---------32:52----------
go vegan like


---------32:54----------
you know people don't do that but in the


---------32:56----------
mind of a narcissistic person they don't


---------32:58----------
sort of realize that right so like their


---------33:00----------
reaction to this scenario is to feel


---------33:02----------
hurt and this in turn has to do with


---------33:04----------
their ahm god and prior some scars


---------33:07----------
because remember narcissism itself is a


---------33:09----------
consequence of some scottish and am god


---------33:12----------
so this person wasn't born narcissistic


---------33:14----------
they became narcissistic that way


---------33:16----------
so somewhere along the way people either


---------33:18----------
neglected their needs or they had a


---------33:20----------
parent who was narcissistic right so


---------33:22----------
like the parent was like always blaming


---------33:24----------
other people for like not asking them


---------33:26----------
questions or whatever so you can start


---------33:28----------
to like look at how that reaction formed


---------33:31----------
so in clinical psychotherapy what you


---------33:33----------
essentially do


---------33:34----------
is show people how they react to


---------33:37----------
scenarios


---------33:38----------
and as you focus on how you react to a


---------33:41----------
scenario you start to alter your own


---------33:44----------
perceptions you start to alter your


---------33:45----------
personality literally and you start to


---------33:48----------
change the way that you you behave it


---------33:50----------
becomes automatic right so and this is


---------33:52----------
the kind of thing if you guys have


---------33:53----------
played video games you understand this


---------33:54----------
like if i do replay analysis of my own


---------33:57----------
thing and i make a conclusion right i


---------34:00----------
realize oh i should have done this i


---------34:01----------
should have done this i should have done


---------34:02----------
this the next time i go into a game


---------34:05----------
that learning is gonna be like operating


---------34:08----------
in the background and it's gonna


---------34:09----------
automatically shape my behavior right


---------34:11----------
it's like if i decide oh i didn't buy


---------34:13----------
enough regen in lane


---------34:14----------
it's like oh crap so the next time like


---------34:16----------
i just go into the game i buy more regen


---------34:18----------
i walk into the lane and then like the


---------34:20----------
problem has solved itself


---------34:22----------
it's like and this is the most shocking


---------34:24----------
thing that i think people don't realize


---------34:26----------
everyone thinks fixing problems is hard


---------34:28----------
and it's like yes fixing problems is


---------34:30----------
hard but what's way easier is actually


---------34:33----------
fixing yourself


---------34:34----------
and then the problems downstream become


---------34:36----------
like easy to solve because you yourself


---------34:39----------
have changed your default mode of


---------34:40----------
operation has changed your personality


---------34:43----------
has changed so how do you do that


---------34:46----------
it comes down to studying your reactions


---------34:48----------
this is the biggest issue is we're so


---------34:50----------
focused on fixing the problem that we're


---------34:51----------
not looking at how we react to things so


---------34:53----------
now i know it sounds kind of like super


---------34:55----------
simple


---------34:56----------
but focus on your reaction so in a


---------34:58----------
particular situation this is like you


---------35:00----------
know we're gonna teach all of meditation


---------35:02----------
right so


---------35:04----------
consider a scenario and like when you go


---------35:06----------
into the scenario just notice yourself


---------35:08----------
okay i want you to pay attention to your


---------35:11----------
heartbeat pay attention to your pulse


---------35:13----------
pay attention to your you know your


---------35:16----------
breathing rate whether you're sweating


---------35:18----------
whether you're relaxed whether you're


---------35:19----------
like you know whatever is going on just


---------35:21----------
pay attention to yourself and notice


---------35:24----------
what your mind or your body is telling


---------35:26----------
you right so it's saying don't sit at


---------35:27----------
the front don't sit at the front don't


---------35:28----------
sit at the front so the first step is to


---------35:30----------
notice something okay


---------35:32----------
the next step is to play the tape


---------35:34----------
through to the end so as you sit down


---------35:37----------
and you kind of think about it i want


---------35:39----------
you to like this is tricky because


---------35:42----------
fears


---------35:43----------
don't live up under scrutiny okay so the


---------35:46----------
way that you kind of like overcome this


---------35:47----------
is like if your mind is telling you


---------35:50----------
like okay if we sit at the front


---------35:53----------
don't sit at the front front is bad


---------35:54----------
that's gonna be an instinctive reaction


---------35:56----------
it comes from the manus okay you're


---------35:58----------
gonna say don't sit at the front and so


---------36:00----------
instead your mind is like okay let's go


---------36:01----------
sit at the back and so play the tape


---------36:03----------
through to the end so ask yourself what


---------36:05----------
will happen if i sit in the front and


---------36:06----------
then your mind will be like we don't


---------36:08----------
want to get called on


---------36:09----------
and then


---------36:10----------
you know like you'll think okay so like


---------36:11----------
what will happen if we get called on


---------36:13----------
well we're not going to know the answer


---------36:15----------
well hold on a second like we may know


---------36:17----------
the answer right we may know the answer


---------36:18----------
we may not know the answer but in our in


---------36:20----------
our mind that fear assumes that we don't


---------36:23----------
know the answer so it's kind of like


---------36:25----------
bizarre right so like now we're being


---------36:26----------
shaped by a possibility it's not even a


---------36:29----------
probability like there's eight people in


---------36:30----------
the front row they the teacher asked us


---------36:32----------
yesterday there's actually a decent


---------36:34----------
chance we won't get asked at all


---------36:36----------
so play the tape through the end okay if


---------36:38----------
we get asked the question what maybe we


---------36:40----------
know the answer maybe we don't know the


---------36:42----------
answer okay what's the consequence of


---------36:44----------
not knowing the answer well i'm gonna


---------36:46----------
feel stupid


---------36:48----------
are you gonna


---------36:49----------
get a bad grade no


---------36:52----------
well i'm gonna feel dumb


---------36:55----------
okay


---------36:57----------
so what


---------36:58----------
well i don't like to feel dumb okay


---------37:01----------
so like


---------37:02----------
are you willing to like give it a shot


---------37:04----------
like let's just see what happens let's


---------37:05----------
like see just pay attention and so like


---------37:08----------
when you combat that fear like at the


---------37:10----------
end of the day you're going to kind of


---------37:11----------
hit up that fear of like i don't want to


---------37:13----------
feel dumb


---------37:14----------
and now you've got two options so if i


---------37:16----------
know it sounds kind of bizarre but even


---------37:18----------
doing this amount of study may be enough


---------37:20----------
for you to sit at the front of the


---------37:21----------
classroom


---------37:22----------
and if you do get called on and you


---------37:24----------
don't know the answer notice your


---------37:25----------
reaction to that and just tell yourself


---------37:27----------
okay this is an experiment that like


---------37:29----------
we're gonna sit at the front we're gonna


---------37:30----------
see what happens


---------37:32----------
this is not a game that i'm trying to


---------37:33----------
win


---------37:34----------
this is a game that i'm trying to learn


---------37:37----------
right which is how do you climb mmr you


---------37:39----------
play games not to win necessarily you


---------37:41----------
play games sometimes to learn like i'm


---------37:44----------
going to try this thing with


---------37:45----------
intentionality i'm going to try to buy


---------37:47----------
more regen in lane and i'm gonna see


---------37:49----------
what happens


---------37:51----------
right so whether you win the game or you


---------37:52----------
lose the game suddenly you've created


---------37:54----------
some degree of detachment from the


---------37:56----------
outcome of the game because you know


---------37:57----------
going in that this could be rough


---------38:00----------
but you're gonna learn a lot more and


---------38:01----------
you'll actually shape a scar


---------38:04----------
and you'll alter your personality as a


---------38:05----------
result you'll learn


---------38:07----------
right and so let even if that happens


---------38:10----------
i i would say that you know 85 chance in


---------38:13----------
this scenario that your worst fears are


---------38:15----------
not realized like i know it's kind of a


---------38:17----------
completely arbitrary percentage but


---------38:19----------
generally speaking the fears that we


---------38:20----------
have in our mind are not realized if we


---------38:24----------
behave with intention what we realize is


---------38:26----------
that like our fears are way worse in our


---------38:28----------
mind than usually what reality is


---------38:32----------
and so even if we do get called on then


---------38:34----------
just like notice your reaction you'll be


---------38:35----------
amazed that like what you sort of


---------38:36----------
realize is like actually doesn't affect


---------38:38----------
my grade in fact now that i feel stupid


---------38:40----------
like i i feel either like distracting


---------38:43----------
myself or studying so now i've got a


---------38:45----------
choice


---------38:46----------
do i want to distract myself or do i


---------38:48----------
want to study well i actually kind of


---------38:49----------
want to study like i want to feel good


---------38:51----------
tomorrow when i sit in the class i want


---------38:53----------
to feel good about like being prepared


---------38:55----------
to answer questions


---------38:56----------
right and then so like it's kind of


---------38:58----------
bizarre but that's like literally how


---------39:00----------
you change your personality by studying


---------39:01----------
the reaction you will naturally start


---------39:03----------
gravitating towards the right thing


---------39:05----------
because here's the thing sitting at the


---------39:07----------
back of the class


---------39:08----------
is actually a strategy to feel good


---------39:10----------
about yourself


---------39:12----------
right so like this is the big thing


---------39:13----------
about you know altering your personality


---------39:16----------
is that through studying your own


---------39:18----------
reactions what you can do is essentially


---------39:20----------
feel the same way but in a more


---------39:22----------
successful manner so if the goal is to


---------39:24----------
feel good about myself because that's


---------39:26----------
why i'm sitting in the back of the class


---------39:27----------
right i don't want to feel bad about


---------39:28----------
myself


---------39:30----------
if i one day make the discovery and this


---------39:32----------
is done through studying your reactions


---------39:34----------
that i can sit at the front of the


---------39:36----------
classroom and feel even better


---------39:39----------
than what i could if i sat at the back


---------39:40----------
of the classroom if i'm prepared for


---------39:42----------
class and i know the right answer


---------39:44----------
it feels amazing it actually feels


---------39:46----------
better than sitting at the back of the


---------39:48----------
classroom


---------39:49----------
then suddenly what i've done is i've


---------39:50----------
changed something very important because


---------39:53----------
all of our avoidance strategies are


---------39:54----------
there to help us right they're there to


---------39:57----------
help us avoid pain and feel good about


---------39:59----------
ourselves but if i suddenly have a


---------40:01----------
strategy that allows me to feel good


---------40:03----------
about myself and even feel better than


---------40:06----------
sitting at the back of the classroom


---------40:07----------
then i'm gonna actually start picking


---------40:08----------
that strategy and i know it sounds kind


---------40:10----------
of weird but i'm gonna start studying


---------40:12----------
more i'm gonna start preparing for class


---------40:14----------
and once you make that shift things


---------40:16----------
become way easier in your life because


---------40:18----------
not only do you feel better about


---------40:20----------
yourself but you are starting to be


---------40:22----------
objectively more successful because


---------40:24----------
you're making better decisions


---------40:26----------
and so shaping your personality


---------40:27----------
ultimately comes down to


---------40:30----------
understanding your reactions to things


---------40:32----------
and playing the tape through to the end


---------40:34----------
and studying as you make an intentional


---------40:37----------
change in the world


---------40:38----------
studying what you're how your reaction


---------40:40----------
changes and as you keep doing this over


---------40:42----------
and over and over again whether it be


---------40:44----------
the narcissistic person in psychotherapy


---------40:46----------
who's sort of like studying their


---------40:47----------
reaction playing the tape through what


---------40:48----------
does it truly mean okay like


---------40:50----------
how would it feel to tell people that


---------40:52----------
you're vegan next time


---------40:54----------
oh it actually feels totally fine oh


---------40:56----------
it's actually easier than like not


---------40:58----------
telling them and then throwing a fit


---------40:59----------
afterward and so essentially what what


---------41:01----------
happens with narcissistic people is they


---------41:03----------
discover that not being narcissistic is


---------41:05----------
actually the more winning strategy so


---------41:07----------
they stop being narcissistic once they


---------41:09----------
sort of internalize and truly realize


---------41:11----------
that this is not working well right


---------41:14----------
and so in that same way if you want to


---------41:16----------
shape your personality don't focus on


---------41:18----------
fixing the problem


---------41:20----------
focus on studying your reaction and then


---------41:23----------
playing the tape through to the end and


---------41:25----------
then your third step is going to be


---------41:27----------
implementing an intentional experiment


---------41:30----------
where you're like watching your reaction


---------41:31----------
to that thing and as you start doing


---------41:34----------
this i guarantee your mmr in real life


---------41:36----------
will start to climb


---------41:40----------
questions


---------41:50----------
someone's asking does dbt work for


---------41:52----------
narcissism i'm going to go ahead and say


---------41:53----------
sure


---------41:55----------
so i think that dbt involves a


---------41:58----------
a component to mindfulness right which


---------42:01----------
like the is rooted in meditation in the


---------42:04----------
yogic tradition and the yogic tradition


---------42:06----------
was like a cure for narcissism


---------42:09----------
so you're going to get some deluding


---------42:11----------
effects because dbt is specifically


---------42:13----------
focused on bpd so the mindfulness


---------42:15----------
practices are like you know


---------42:17----------
geared towards


---------42:20----------
bpd as opposed to narcissism but there


---------42:22----------
are some good effects


---------42:24----------
so i have a different like meditation


---------42:26----------
regimen for


---------42:28----------
narcissism than dvt


---------42:31----------
okay so there's good questions here the


---------42:33----------
first is how do i change things i can't


---------42:35----------
control like impulsive emotions


---------42:37----------
so


---------42:39----------
nowhere have i said that you should


---------42:41----------
change your behavior right so you don't


---------42:43----------
need to control impulsive emotions


---------42:45----------
what you need to do is pay attention to


---------42:47----------
your reactions


---------42:49----------
so once i have an impulsive emotion


---------42:52----------
there's going to be a reaction that


---------42:54----------
results in a behavior like you can't


---------42:55----------
control the emotion that's the whole


---------42:57----------
point of like understanding the manas is


---------42:59----------
that you can't control the manas like


---------43:00----------
you can't control whether you like


---------43:02----------
pineapple on pizza or you don't like


---------43:04----------
pineapple on pizza


---------43:05----------
so your initial response to things is


---------43:08----------
not something that you can control


---------43:10----------
what you can adjust is your reactivity


---------43:13----------
to that initial thing


---------43:15----------
so when i walk into the room if i have a


---------43:17----------
some scar that makes me feel like an


---------43:18----------
idiot every time i walk into a classroom


---------43:20----------
i cannot control that some scar


---------43:23----------
the some scar the programming will


---------43:25----------
activate right i'll walk into the


---------43:26----------
classroom i'll feel like an idiot what i


---------43:28----------
can control though is the way that i


---------43:30----------
react to that stimulus


---------43:33----------
so i can pay attention i can take a deep


---------43:34----------
breath i can engage in physiology right


---------43:37----------
so check out breath and mind and dr k's


---------43:39----------
guide if you guys haven't


---------43:41----------
so you can like take a deep breath and


---------43:42----------
you can say okay we're going to sit at


---------43:44----------
the front it's going to be terrifying so


---------43:46----------
be it let me go and sit at the front


---------43:48----------
terror here we come


---------43:50----------
and then you can't control the terror


---------43:51----------
like you're going to feel terror as you


---------43:53----------
sit down in the front seat you're gonna


---------43:54----------
be like sweating okay we're gonna


---------43:56----------
breathe we're gonna breathe and then


---------43:57----------
you're gonna realize oh my god


---------43:59----------
i've survived i did it success good job


---------44:03----------
so you can control the way that react


---------44:05----------
you react to things but not your initial


---------44:07----------
thing


---------44:08----------
not your initial response to something


---------44:13----------
okay


---------44:17----------
can you back up your claims with science


---------44:19----------
yeah so like


---------44:21----------
this is kind of interesting right so


---------44:23----------
like


---------44:24----------
i mean these things are so


---------44:29----------
so like you can look at the clinical


---------44:31----------
efficacy of any paper on dbt and


---------44:35----------
borderline personality disorder


---------44:38----------
right like if you want to see the


---------44:39----------
clinical like the scientific


---------44:42----------
response to this you can also look at


---------44:44----------
things like mbt


---------44:46----------
and bpd or narcissism so there's like


---------44:48----------
tons of research out there about


---------44:50----------
psychotherapy for personality disorders


---------44:52----------
which shows that it's effective there's


---------44:53----------
tons of research out there about


---------44:55----------
you know five factor model so i would


---------44:57----------
start with like honestly just wikipedia


---------44:59----------
and just like look at some of the


---------45:00----------
references for the five factor model


---------45:03----------
right and then if you actually go and


---------45:04----------
you talk to someone who like studies


---------45:05----------
five factor model like and you ask them


---------45:07----------
based on five factor can you predict how


---------45:09----------
an individual will respond in a scenario


---------45:13----------
they will say no i cannot


---------45:14----------
they can give you a general idea that


---------45:16----------
these kinds of people are more likely to


---------45:18----------
respond this way so this is like super


---------45:20----------
fundamental stuff


---------45:22----------
yeah where's my phone


---------45:24----------
uh i think it's in the


---------45:27----------
in the where my wallet is


---------45:31----------
um


---------45:33----------
okay


---------45:35----------
how much does this help getting past


---------45:36----------
mental disabilities


---------45:38----------
i'm not quite sure so generally speaking


---------45:41----------
i think this is independent of mental


---------45:42----------
disabilities so like i don't think it's


---------45:45----------
mental disabilities apply at all


---------45:47----------
unless your disability has something to


---------45:49----------
do with your ability to observe yourself


---------45:52----------
so the key thing here is that you need


---------45:54----------
to be able to observe your reaction to


---------45:55----------
things and if you have difficulty doing


---------45:57----------
that like that may be a slow road to


---------45:59----------
climb right


---------46:01----------
so a good example of this is if you have


---------46:03----------
very very high emotional reactivity you


---------46:06----------
may not be able to do this react


---------46:09----------
studying your reaction to things like


---------46:11----------
very easily so you may just have to


---------46:13----------
start with like smaller things right so


---------46:15----------
you need to grind on weak mobs before


---------46:18----------
you start to tackle the bigger stuff


---------46:22----------
um


---------46:24----------
doesn't being critical to oneself breed


---------46:27----------
anxiety sure


---------46:29----------
so there's a key thing


---------46:31----------
i'm not saying be critical right so


---------46:34----------
critical is a judgment


---------46:36----------
we're not talking about being critical


---------46:38----------
we're talking about observation


---------46:41----------
so and you're correct that being


---------46:42----------
critical breeds anxiety because like


---------46:44----------
then you're beating yourself up and you


---------46:45----------
feel bad about yourself and you're


---------46:46----------
worried but observation actually breeds


---------46:49----------
the opposite right so critical is to


---------46:51----------
being critical is to make a judgment is


---------46:53----------
to like conclude something but our


---------46:55----------
observation is not making a conclusion


---------46:57----------
it's just making an observation we're


---------46:58----------
actually super hands off we're just


---------47:00----------
gonna see what happens


---------47:02----------
and so by adopting that non-judgmental


---------47:04----------
error we actually reduce anxiety so you


---------47:06----------
are correct that being critical


---------47:10----------
can breed anxiety but we're not being


---------47:12----------
critical we're being observational we're


---------47:14----------
studying our reaction


---------47:16----------
right


---------47:16----------
so it's actually very different and this


---------47:18----------
is it's a really good question because


---------47:20----------
oftentimes when we are self-reflective


---------47:23----------
we default to a critical mode


---------47:27----------
right when i study myself all i can see


---------47:29----------
is criticisms


---------47:31----------
i'm not truly observational i'm very


---------47:33----------
harshly self-judgmental


---------47:35----------
that too


---------47:36----------
is part of a hum god and a samskar


---------47:39----------
because i've decided somewhere along the


---------47:40----------
way that like i'm someone who like


---------47:42----------
isn't perfect and i can always be better


---------47:45----------
i can always be better i can always be


---------47:46----------
better and if that is your identity


---------47:49----------
of never being satisfied never being


---------47:50----------
perfect and never being enough then any


---------47:53----------
kind of reaction that you have to


---------47:54----------
yourself which you're not even aware of


---------47:56----------
it becomes so automatic right because


---------47:58----------
then you're beating yourself up it's


---------47:59----------
like simple so like it happens like that


---------48:02----------
oh i could have done this better i could


---------48:03----------
have done this but i'm so stupid


---------48:04----------
this person is better than i am that


---------48:06----------
person is better that's not studying


---------48:07----------
yourself it's being self-critical


---------48:09----------
that's the activation of the some squad


---------48:11----------
it's not actually like observing the the


---------48:13----------
samskara it's within the some scar if


---------48:15----------
that makes sense


---------48:18----------
so like the right thing to do if you're


---------48:20----------
hyper critical is to observe yourself


---------48:21----------
and just ask yourself


---------48:24----------
why am i being so critical of myself


---------48:26----------
here where do i get the idea that like i


---------48:29----------
you know i everyone is better than me


---------48:30----------
like where does that come from


---------48:32----------
so like play the tape through to the end


---------48:34----------
like ask yourself why why why why until


---------48:37----------
you'll get to something at the you know


---------48:40----------
at the bottom


---------48:41----------
and this is the kind of thing that you


---------48:43----------
know if you work with a therapist or


---------48:44----------
coach or something like that like they


---------48:45----------
will help you get there faster


---------48:47----------
therapists aren't really trained in this


---------48:48----------
model but they do the same work


---------48:51----------
okay


---------48:59----------
um


---------49:01----------
okay


---------49:04----------
okay so this is a great question so


---------49:06----------
y'all are asking good questions that are


---------49:08----------
sort of missing the point how do we


---------49:10----------
trust that our analysis of our reactions


---------49:12----------
is correct


---------49:13----------
great question


---------49:15----------
so remember the first step is not your


---------49:17----------
analysis of your reaction


---------49:20----------
but it's the observation of the reaction


---------49:22----------
and is the observation of the reaction


---------49:24----------
if done with that like properly right so


---------49:27----------
just


---------49:29----------
so like you know how do you know if your


---------49:31----------
observation is correct it just is an


---------49:33----------
observation the analysis is what comes


---------49:35----------
afterward right so like science doesn't


---------49:37----------
lie but interpretations are very


---------49:39----------
critical so you're correct that analysis


---------49:42----------
needs to be done at some point


---------49:44----------
but make sure that you understand


---------49:45----------
clearly that the first step is just data


---------49:47----------
collection it's just observe your


---------49:49----------
reaction notice your reaction


---------49:51----------
as you play the tape through to the end


---------49:53----------
you know be aware so here's like one tip


---------49:56----------
which is how emotional or numb do you


---------49:59----------
feel


---------50:00----------
if you feel calm when you are doing your


---------50:03----------
analysis then it is likely that your


---------50:05----------
analysis is more correct if you feel


---------50:07----------
emotional it is unlikely that your


---------50:10----------
analysis will be correct here's another


---------50:11----------
tricky thing here's the thing that trips


---------50:13----------
everyone up if you feel numb when you do


---------50:16----------
your analysis it is unlikely to be


---------50:17----------
correct


---------50:19----------
so numbness


---------50:20----------
is a sign of like a high level of


---------50:23----------
emotion that is present but is


---------50:25----------
suppressed so it'll be shaping your your


---------50:27----------
analysis quite heavily this is the big


---------50:29----------
problem that people run into when they


---------50:31----------
think they are hyperlogical


---------50:32----------
is that they're they're not like it's


---------50:34----------
not like their limbic system their


---------50:35----------
emotional cortex of their brain is like


---------50:37----------
non-functional right it's just being


---------50:40----------
suppressed but it's still shaping their


---------50:42----------
thoughts


---------50:43----------
so the key thing to understand about


---------50:45----------
analysis is you want your mind to be


---------50:46----------
calm and balanced


---------50:48----------
which is what tends to happen when you


---------50:49----------
guys watch our interviews and stuff when


---------50:51----------
people have this like emotional


---------50:52----------
catharsis there's a high level of


---------50:54----------
emotion which we then process right we


---------50:56----------
decompress it we don't numb it out and


---------50:58----------
then afterward people are left in a


---------51:00----------
space of mind where they like have a


---------51:02----------
realization and so then you know your


---------51:04----------
analysis is correct


---------51:10----------
can you lose some scars the scheme is


---------51:12----------
due to a stressful amend have in mind


---------51:14----------
ptsd absolutely right so ptsd is


---------51:17----------
actually the one diagnosis in the west


---------51:21----------
that perfectly overlaps with the eastern


---------51:24----------
concept of the mind


---------51:26----------
so this is true right like so the mind


---------51:28----------
works in one way and so i think good


---------51:31----------
evidence that this is correct is that


---------51:33----------
the western path of exploration


---------51:35----------
discovered ptsd the eastern path of


---------51:38----------
exploration essentially discovered the


---------51:39----------
same thing so you have two independent


---------51:42----------
investigators that are arriving at the


---------51:44----------
same conclusion so what is ptsd i have a


---------51:47----------
particular event that happens which has


---------51:50----------
a powerful impact on me which does not


---------51:52----------
get processed or digested


---------51:54----------
and then sits in my mind and then arises


---------51:57----------
in particular scenarios right this is


---------51:59----------
why people have flashbacks they have


---------52:02----------
nightmares they have hypervigilance when


---------52:04----------
they have ptsd their mind is on


---------52:05----------
constantly on the lookout for like the


---------52:07----------
source of danger so now our personality


---------52:10----------
has almost altered right the way that we


---------52:12----------
react to scenarios has changed


---------52:15----------
and so that's what ptsd is and the good


---------52:17----------
news is that there are treatments for


---------52:18----------
ptsd right you can do psychotherapy


---------52:20----------
which is literally the process of like


---------52:23----------
bringing up some of these things and


---------52:24----------
emotionally digesting them and then you


---------52:26----------
can no longer have ptsd you can be cured


---------52:29----------
of it


---------52:30----------
so ptsd is actually a really really good


---------52:32----------
example of the fact that some scars can


---------52:34----------
be cleansed


---------52:35----------
and if you look at that in in the yogic


---------52:37----------
process right so like that's a big part


---------52:40----------
of it so as people you know go and do


---------52:42----------
spiritual study and stuff like all this


---------52:43----------
kind of stuff comes up so for me for


---------52:46----------
example like i originally went to you


---------52:48----------
know india to become a monk out of ego


---------52:51----------
because i sucked at real life i was


---------52:53----------
super low mmr and i was like oh cool


---------52:55----------
like instead of sucking at this game i'm


---------52:58----------
gonna go play this game and then like


---------52:59----------
i'm gonna tell everyone that my game is


---------53:01----------
better than their game so the way that


---------53:03----------
i'm gonna feel better


---------53:06----------
about myself is to become a monk and


---------53:08----------
then all these materialistic noobs that


---------53:10----------
get better grades than i do i'm gonna be


---------53:12----------
better than them because my game is more


---------53:15----------
important than the their game law is for


---------53:17----------
noobs and dota is for experts so i'm


---------53:18----------
going to get good at dota because i suck


---------53:20----------
at lol and then i'm going to lord it


---------53:22----------
over all the law noobs for playing la la


---------53:24----------
la la right so that's what happened in


---------53:26----------
my mind and as i went through this


---------53:27----------
process i uncovered that i was like holy


---------53:29----------
crap


---------53:30----------
this is all ego like the reason i'm


---------53:32----------
becoming a monk is out of ego it's like


---------53:34----------
the fundamentally like wrong decision


---------53:37----------
so you can sort of discover that your


---------53:39----------
some scars are like there through


---------53:41----------
spiritual practice and then you can go


---------53:42----------
through the process of digesting them so


---------53:44----------
i realized this i was like oh crap like


---------53:46----------
i suck at life so that's when i decided


---------53:48----------
like okay so using a calm and collected


---------53:50----------
mind i was like


---------53:52----------
if i become a monk to run away from my


---------53:54----------
problems that will be running away


---------53:57----------
so instead what i need to do to really


---------53:59----------
become a monk is i need to stop


---------54:01----------
pretending to be a monk go and succeed


---------54:03----------
in the real world


---------54:04----------
so i have to go back and like i need to


---------54:06----------
be the best damn student that ever could


---------54:08----------
be because that's where i suck so i have


---------54:10----------
to like focus on the things that i'm bad


---------54:12----------
at so i ended up going back and like


---------54:15----------
still lazy right so but the way that i


---------54:17----------
reacted to things changed


---------54:19----------
the way that i've like approached school


---------54:21----------
changed my personality changed whereas i


---------54:24----------
used to run away from things and i


---------54:25----------
started like embracing them right i


---------54:27----------
understood it was gonna be hard i didn't


---------54:29----------
get a 4.0


---------54:30----------
i didn't like come back transform that's


---------54:32----------
the other thing is people like assume


---------54:33----------
you come back and you're like


---------54:34----------
transformed and then suddenly you're


---------54:35----------
getting four points no like my first


---------54:37----------
semester back i got like a 3.0


---------54:40----------
3.2 3.4 every semester i got a little


---------54:42----------
bit better a little bit better a little


---------54:44----------
bit better graduated with a 2.5


---------54:47----------
so be it


---------54:48----------
right i'm not gonna let like i noticed


---------54:50----------
oh well like this sucks okay so like i'm


---------54:52----------
gonna acknowledge that it sucks i'm


---------54:54----------
gonna notice my reaction and i'm gonna


---------54:56----------
take the right steps forward


---------54:57----------
irrespective of how i feel


---------54:59----------
and that's when your personality changes


---------55:01----------
right so then i got into medical school


---------55:03----------
at tufts


---------55:04----------
did that for a while you know noticed


---------55:06----------
some ego at the beginning of that and i


---------55:07----------
was like okay i need to step aside from


---------55:09----------
that


---------55:10----------
just going to focus on doing what i need


---------55:11----------
to do


---------55:13----------
notice my reactions to things


---------55:15----------
decide how how much i'm going to study


---------55:17----------
ironically i didn't like try to be the


---------55:19----------
best in my class because i was like


---------55:20----------
that's ego


---------55:21----------
i'm here to learn medicine so i'm going


---------55:22----------
to study what i'm capable of okay i


---------55:24----------
can't study for eight hours a day so i


---------55:26----------
can study for like two three hours a day


---------55:28----------
that's the most i'm capable of and


---------55:30----------
instead of sort of assuming that that


---------55:32----------
means oh god i'm gonna fail it's like


---------55:33----------
okay like let's see what happens let's


---------55:35----------
observe what happens if i can study for


---------55:37----------
two hours a day can i optimize that


---------55:39----------
studying for two hours and can it be


---------55:41----------
enough can i pass


---------55:43----------
turns out i can do way better than pass


---------55:45----------
right so then it's bizarre like using


---------55:47----------
that kind of strategy ending up with


---------55:48----------
like an award of academic achievement at


---------55:51----------
the end of medical school


---------55:53----------
and so


---------55:54----------
first academic achievement award i've


---------55:56----------
gotten after a string of like c's and


---------55:58----------
d's and


---------56:00----------
f's and crap like that


---------56:02----------
right


---------56:03----------
so just focus on your reactions


---------56:06----------
understand yourself and then you will


---------56:08----------
naturally start to move in the right


---------56:09----------
direction


---------56:12----------
and you can absolutely alter ptsd and


---------56:15----------
you can absolutely alter


---------56:18----------
like you can alter it


---------56:21----------
right


---------56:23----------
that's the whole point of this lecture


---------56:24----------
is that that which you assume you are


---------56:26----------
can be changed and the way to change it


---------56:29----------
is to understand your reactions


---------56:31----------
because your reactions and how you


---------56:33----------
process


---------56:34----------
that individual moment is going to form


---------56:37----------
how you behave tomorrow


---------56:40----------
so pay attention to your reactions


---------56:42----------
i'm going to give y'all one last story


---------56:44----------
about this okay


---------56:46----------
so i had a


---------56:48----------
um


---------56:49----------
a patient


---------56:51----------
who


---------56:51----------
[Music]


---------56:53----------
whose mom


---------56:54----------
was in an abusive relationship


---------56:57----------
so mom and dad dad was abusive


---------57:00----------
mom and dad divorce


---------57:03----------
uh mom


---------57:06----------
is a way to process all of these like


---------57:08----------
difficult emotional things


---------57:10----------
started going to church


---------57:13----------
and then became like hyper religious so


---------57:15----------
like her entire personality like changed


---------57:18----------
over the course of like


---------57:20----------
five to seven years


---------57:22----------
and then my patient had all kinds of


---------57:24----------
problems because mom would like pressure


---------57:26----------
them to go to church all the time


---------57:27----------
because for mom church was like there


---------57:30----------
for her and was her source of like


---------57:32----------
comfort and safety and salvation when


---------57:34----------
she was going through a really really


---------57:35----------
hard time


---------57:36----------
and so then suddenly like for mom the


---------57:38----------
world became a dangerous place where


---------57:40----------
like there are like people out there who


---------57:42----------
don't have morals who will do to you


---------57:44----------
what your dad did to me


---------57:46----------
but in the church i found safety and so


---------57:49----------
she became super paranoid for her


---------57:50----------
daughter


---------57:52----------
and was like you need to go to church


---------57:53----------
like don't date anyone outside of church


---------57:55----------
you need to go to church like church is


---------57:56----------
the only safe place


---------57:58----------
right that's basically like what her mom


---------57:59----------
kind of like she didn't realize that


---------58:02----------
like consciously


---------58:03----------
but that's what through therapy we sort


---------58:05----------
of uncovered and once like daughter


---------58:06----------
understood this she was like okay like


---------58:08----------
this was the way that my mom survived


---------58:10----------
this experience this is how she's


---------58:12----------
changed and shaped


---------58:14----------
like she's been altered by this and


---------58:15----------
church was like kind of there for her


---------58:16----------
right so that's an example of a powerful


---------58:19----------
some scar forming


---------58:21----------
and as a result a personality change


---------58:23----------
and then like that personality views the


---------58:25----------
rest of the world as dangerous except


---------58:27----------
there's one safe space


---------58:29----------
and so of course she's gonna push her


---------58:31----------
daughter to like be in that safe space


---------58:32----------
because she doesn't want her daughter to


---------58:34----------
ever end up in a relationship like she


---------58:36----------
she had


---------58:38----------
and so once daughter understood that


---------58:39----------
when she understood where she's coming


---------58:40----------
from like that started to like she


---------58:42----------
started to get a lot better she


---------58:43----------
understood you know why her mom was so


---------58:45----------
pushy for church she was able to set


---------58:48----------
boundaries with her mom in a much


---------58:49----------
healthier way now that she understood


---------58:51----------
everything and then her own reactions


---------58:53----------
towards her mom started to change her


---------58:55----------
own reactions towards church and like


---------58:57----------
not church and things like that started


---------58:59----------
to change


---------59:01----------
so personality can absolutely be altered


---------59:03----------
it comes from understanding your


---------59:05----------
reaction


---------59:07----------
okay


---------59:21----------
you
