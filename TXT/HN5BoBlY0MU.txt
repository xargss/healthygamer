---------00:00----------
all right


---------00:01----------
so you know there's been a lot of


---------00:03----------
interest in our community about adhd


---------00:05----------
recently and um


---------00:08----------
you know we've been talking we gave up


---------00:10----------
we did a lecture on why adhd people with


---------00:13----------
adhd wind up with addiction so easily we


---------00:16----------
also talked about why people with adhd


---------00:18----------
wind up with depression so easily and


---------00:20----------
like what are the correlations between


---------00:22----------
those two things


---------00:24----------
but one of the key things that i tend to


---------00:26----------
talk to just about all of my adhd


---------00:28----------
patients about which we haven't really


---------00:29----------
talked about here


---------00:31----------
is uh


---------00:32----------
why adhd exists


---------00:34----------
so if you if you guys check out dr k's


---------00:36----------
guide to depression and dr k's guide to


---------00:38----------
anxiety there's sections in there about


---------00:40----------
why depression and anxiety exist


---------00:43----------
like these are essentially illnesses


---------00:46----------
that are


---------00:48----------
hyper activations of existing circuitry


---------00:51----------
so in the case of depression we have


---------00:53----------
this thing called the default mode


---------00:54----------
network which gives us the capacity to


---------00:57----------
self-reflect


---------00:58----------
and it's when our self-reflection


---------01:00----------
capacity gets overblown and turned on


---------01:04----------
stuck in the on position that we wind up


---------01:06----------
with depression


---------01:08----------
so people who are depressed for example


---------01:09----------
always think about themselves like in a


---------01:12----------
weird way right they're like oh the


---------01:13----------
world would be better off without me


---------01:15----------
where it's like the world doesn't really


---------01:17----------
you know


---------01:18----------
it's like


---------01:19----------
gonna be okay if you're there or not


---------01:20----------
there right


---------01:22----------
you start to think like very very


---------01:24----------
you get stuck thinking about how bad you


---------01:27----------
are like literally the thoughts in your


---------01:28----------
mind are stuck on you and your sadness


---------01:32----------
in anxiety for example anxiety is


---------01:34----------
nothing but the ability to predict


---------01:36----------
danger in the future like that's a very


---------01:38----------
useful circuit to have in the brain


---------01:40----------
right like we want the ability to


---------01:42----------
predict problems when that circuit gets


---------01:44----------
stuck in the on position


---------01:46----------
we end up sort of like always seeing


---------01:48----------
danger everywhere because any


---------01:50----------
uncertainty becomes a source of


---------01:52----------
danger and so this is the kind of thing


---------01:55----------
where like you know


---------01:56----------
as we understand depression anxiety and


---------01:58----------
if you really want to overcome them you


---------02:00----------
have to understand like why these things


---------02:02----------
exist in our brains and where they come


---------02:05----------
from to truly like understand how they


---------02:07----------
work and then ultimately master them


---------02:10----------
so what i'd like to do today we've


---------02:11----------
talked a lot about adhd and depression


---------02:13----------
adhd and addiction this and that yadda


---------02:14----------
yadda procrastination whatever but we've


---------02:17----------
never talked about why adhd exists or


---------02:20----------
what is it truly and so my hope today is


---------02:23----------
to share with you all some information


---------02:24----------
about my understanding of like why


---------02:26----------
humans have adhd how adhd is changing


---------02:30----------
over time and how it may not necessarily


---------02:32----------
be


---------02:34----------
a may not necessarily be as maladaptive


---------02:38----------
as people think


---------02:40----------
so the first thing to understand uh


---------02:41----------
before we kind of


---------02:43----------
dive in is that i'm going to be talking


---------02:45----------
about adhd


---------02:47----------
in sort of a broad term and i just want


---------02:49----------
to acknowledge that for example like


---------02:52----------
if we look at the


---------02:54----------
level of adhd across the population


---------02:57----------
that it kind of varies okay and what i


---------02:59----------
mean by that is that there's sort of


---------03:00----------
like a bell curve of attention so let's


---------03:03----------
do this


---------03:05----------
okay


---------03:06----------
so if we want to understand adhd what we


---------03:08----------
want to do we just have to start by kind


---------03:11----------
of acknowledging this


---------03:13----------
so if we look at like people's attention


---------03:19----------
so the capacity to attend to something


---------03:21----------
society looks like this


---------03:23----------
so there's like you know most people


---------03:26----------
like can sort of control their attention


---------03:28----------
this is where like most people kind of


---------03:30----------
exist right so one standard deviation


---------03:32----------
includes 85 percent of the population


---------03:35----------
if my statistics is pretty good


---------03:39----------
but then there are some people over here


---------03:41----------
who have very strong attention


---------03:46----------
and then some people down here who have


---------03:48----------
attention that wanders a lot


---------03:53----------
so what we're going to talk about is why


---------03:55----------
human beings have fluctuating or like a


---------03:59----------
wide span of attention right so if we


---------04:01----------
look at human beings if we look at


---------04:02----------
something like let's say we just look at


---------04:04----------
height


---------04:06----------
as a quality


---------04:08----------
or tendency to get anger angry


---------04:11----------
so like we look at anger or height we


---------04:14----------
see essentially the same thing so most


---------04:17----------
attributes within human populations are


---------04:19----------
going to follow this kind of bell curve


---------04:20----------
where like 85 percent of people are


---------04:22----------
going to be here and then some people


---------04:24----------
get super angry


---------04:26----------
and then some people are doormats


---------04:29----------
and that's just how human beings work


---------04:32----------
so the question is sort of like why and


---------04:34----------
it tends to be that you know human


---------04:35----------
beings


---------04:36----------
have variability in situations that like


---------04:40----------
variability is beneficial for people so


---------04:43----------
if we look at something like anger you


---------04:45----------
know we don't want everyone to be


---------04:46----------
getting super pissed all the time we


---------04:48----------
want some people to be like get angry


---------04:51----------
easily right and maybe they're going to


---------04:52----------
be our warriors and then we want some


---------04:54----------
people who are going to be like a little


---------04:56----------
bit more passive and maybe they're going


---------04:57----------
to be our farmers


---------04:59----------
and so we tend to see across human


---------05:01----------
populations that we have


---------05:03----------
you know a bell curve of cognitive


---------05:05----------
ability


---------05:06----------
and attention is no different so then


---------05:08----------
the question becomes like why wouldn't


---------05:10----------
we want everyone having like a super


---------05:12----------
focused attention you know why do we


---------05:14----------
want people that have attention that


---------05:16----------
wanders


---------05:17----------
and so the the short answer is like


---------05:19----------
there's a very interesting theory about


---------05:21----------
hunters versus farmers


---------05:24----------
so some people did some personality


---------05:26----------
research and essentially concluded that


---------05:28----------
there are two types of people


---------05:29----------
the farmer


---------05:31----------
is someone who like likes routine


---------05:34----------
doesn't get bored so like you know


---------05:37----------
wants stability


---------05:39----------
so the farmer will like wake up at 5am


---------05:41----------
every day like go out to the fields do


---------05:43----------
the same thing like day after day after


---------05:44----------
day after day and they derive a lot of


---------05:47----------
pleasure or enjoyment from like things


---------05:49----------
like routine and stability they really


---------05:51----------
like they dislike being disrupted so


---------05:53----------
they don't want like random events to


---------05:55----------
happen they just want they want to be


---------05:56----------
able to predict things and they derive a


---------05:58----------
lot of like pleasure enjoyment and


---------06:00----------
satisfaction out of routine


---------06:03----------
and then we have hunters


---------06:05----------
so hunters are a little bit different


---------06:07----------
the idea of waking up and doing the same


---------06:08----------
thing over and over and over again is


---------06:10----------
like very very like annoying or


---------06:12----------
frustrating to them they get bored


---------06:15----------
easily


---------06:16----------
so what they need to do is they need to


---------06:18----------
be like more dynamic so they like you


---------06:20----------
know walking through the jungle and


---------06:21----------
paying attention to lots of different


---------06:23----------
stimuli so they're like oh like look


---------06:25----------
there's like something happening over


---------06:26----------
here and then this looks like a animal


---------06:28----------
footprint and what is that that i smell


---------06:30----------
it seems like something's going on i


---------06:32----------
smell something strange and then there's


---------06:33----------
birds circling overhead oh they're like


---------06:35----------
vultures over there so maybe there's


---------06:37----------
like some kind of predator over there so


---------06:39----------
hunters are people that integrate a lot


---------06:41----------
of in information


---------06:46----------
and so what we kind of see is that in


---------06:48----------
like old human society we sort of needed


---------06:51----------
both right we needed some people to go


---------06:53----------
out and hunt and we needed some people


---------06:55----------
to like kind of stay at home and farm


---------06:57----------
and that the more successful societies


---------06:59----------
were the ones that had like both


---------07:01----------
cognitive types okay


---------07:03----------
so in a sense like what we see is that


---------07:05----------
attention variation


---------07:09----------
within populations


---------07:13----------
is selected for is a positive


---------07:18----------
so what does that mean for us


---------07:19----------
okay


---------07:21----------
what that means for us is that


---------07:23----------
our society has been shaped over the


---------07:25----------
last year primarily by farmers right so


---------07:28----------
like if you kind of look ever since the


---------07:30----------
industrial revolution like we've had you


---------07:32----------
know this idea of like fixed time jobs


---------07:37----------
right like


---------07:38----------
as as things got more centralized what


---------07:41----------
we started to see is like okay you go to


---------07:42----------
the same place every day you have your


---------07:44----------
job like even the concept of a job like


---------07:47----------
a thing that you do instead of lots of


---------07:49----------
things that you do


---------07:50----------
is like a farmer-oriented society right


---------07:53----------
because the farmers basically took over


---------07:56----------
and they're like everyone's gonna have a


---------07:57----------
job


---------07:59----------
and this is gonna be your job and i'm


---------08:00----------
gonna do my job and we're all gonna do


---------08:02----------
our jobs and then like society will work


---------08:04----------
wonderfully and then we've got our


---------08:06----------
hunters who are like i'm bored of my job


---------08:08----------
i want to do something else and the


---------08:09----------
farmers were like no


---------08:11----------
you have to if you want to be outside


---------08:13----------
instead of being indoors you can deliver


---------08:14----------
mail become a postal worker


---------08:18----------
and so our society since the industrial


---------08:20----------
revolution got heavily shaped by farmers


---------08:23----------
and so what ended up happening is our


---------08:24----------
society became more and more methodical


---------08:26----------
more structured where everyone is the


---------08:29----------
cog in their you know in in the


---------08:31----------
particular machine that they're a part


---------08:32----------
of and the farmers love that kind of


---------08:34----------
thing they're like fantastic like


---------08:36----------
everyone is a cog there's perfect order


---------08:39----------
there's stability and the world is is


---------08:41----------
going well


---------08:42----------
and then there's a group of people who


---------08:44----------
are the hunters who started to struggle


---------08:46----------
in this society so they actually started


---------08:48----------
to like move into potentially like more


---------08:51----------
um dynamic professions right so as


---------08:53----------
schooling got implemented


---------08:56----------
we started selecting for people who can


---------08:58----------
sit in a chair from eight to three


---------09:03----------
so now we started selecting people for


---------09:05----------
their ability to sit in a chair and then


---------09:07----------
we added college which is like okay who


---------09:10----------
is like farmer enough


---------09:12----------
to not be forced into learning and kind


---------09:14----------
of can kind of learn on their own


---------09:16----------
so then we added something like a gpa


---------09:19----------
right and what we did is we selected for


---------09:20----------
people in college who are like not


---------09:22----------
dynamic they're people who can force


---------09:24----------
themselves to go to class or they don't


---------09:25----------
have to force themselves they like going


---------09:27----------
to class because they're structured they


---------09:29----------
go to their 8 a.m class they study on


---------09:31----------
time they do everything on time they


---------09:32----------
don't procrastinate and we're going to


---------09:34----------
reward these people so over time what


---------09:36----------
happened


---------09:37----------
is society


---------09:39----------
became pro-farmer


---------09:44----------
and then we did something interesting


---------09:46----------
okay what we did is we took the hunter


---------09:49----------
kids


---------09:50----------
in school


---------09:52----------
and we said oh my god these hunter kids


---------09:54----------
are they're not able to sit and do what


---------09:57----------
they're supposed to


---------09:59----------
right


---------09:59----------
and so then we started diagnosing them


---------10:01----------
with adhd so there's a couple of


---------10:03----------
interesting things here


---------10:04----------
the first is that studies have been done


---------10:06----------
that the student teacher ratio


---------10:10----------
determines the likelihood of getting


---------10:12----------
diagnosed with adhd if you have one


---------10:14----------
teacher to 30 students versus one


---------10:16----------
teacher to 15 students adhd will be like


---------10:19----------
twice as likely to be diagnosed in this


---------10:22----------
group than this group and that's


---------10:24----------
controlling for number of kids so if i


---------10:26----------
have


---------10:27----------
two uh let's put it this way


---------10:30----------
you know like if i have two classrooms


---------10:34----------
one that has


---------10:38----------
30 kids and two teachers and one that


---------10:40----------
has 30 kids and one teacher like the


---------10:42----------
number of adhd diagnoses in this


---------10:44----------
classroom is going to be way higher


---------10:47----------
and so what we begin to see is something


---------10:49----------
that's interesting about a disorder


---------10:51----------
which is that a disorder especially


---------10:53----------
mental illnesses


---------10:54----------
disorders aren't just disorders by


---------10:57----------
themselves a disorder evolves when


---------10:59----------
there's a genetic vulnerability


---------11:06----------
plus environmental


---------11:12----------
circumstance so what we see in adhd is


---------11:15----------
that if you literally look at the term


---------11:18----------
disorder there's a lack of order or


---------11:20----------
function within a particular environment


---------11:23----------
and so for people who have adhd what it


---------11:25----------
is is their mind is dynamic


---------11:27----------
right so that may be the genetic


---------11:29----------
vulnerability they may be a hunter and


---------11:31----------
what we're doing is we're putting them


---------11:33----------
in a classroom


---------11:34----------
right we're sticking them on a farm and


---------11:36----------
so this is where the disorder the


---------11:38----------
disorder arises between within this gap


---------11:41----------
and this is what adhd is now this is


---------11:44----------
where we have to go back for a second to


---------11:45----------
our


---------11:47----------
bell curve and acknowledge that like


---------11:50----------
for a lot of people that i work with


---------11:52----------
with adhd it's about finding the right


---------11:54----------
environment for them to to thrive in and


---------11:57----------
then their illness no longer becomes a


---------11:59----------
disorder it can actually become a


---------12:00----------
disadvantage i mean an advantage but


---------12:03----------
there are there are certainly people who


---------12:06----------
have very disordered attention to where


---------12:08----------
like they lit like really it is like


---------12:11----------
feels like a very serious like illness


---------12:13----------
to me but i would say that the majority


---------12:16----------
of people that i work with with adhd


---------12:18----------
even though it is an illness or a


---------12:21----------
disorder or uh makes their life hard


---------12:24----------
that i would say like two-thirds of them


---------12:27----------
about 70 of them can function very well


---------12:29----------
with their adhd in the right


---------12:31----------
circumstance and in fact it's even


---------12:33----------
advantageous


---------12:34----------
so there are some professions that we'll


---------12:36----------
talk about so event planner is actually


---------12:37----------
surprisingly one


---------12:40----------
other examples are like twitch streamer


---------12:45----------
esports athlete


---------12:47----------
so actually a lot of professions


---------12:50----------
even working in the emergency room


---------12:54----------
um can that or being a paramedic


---------12:59----------
being a plumber


---------13:01----------
there are several professions that


---------13:03----------
bizarrely enough seem to like work


---------13:05----------
totally fine with people with adhd


---------13:07----------
and there are some situations where adhd


---------13:10----------
in having a dynamic mindset because


---------13:12----------
remember that the reason you're getting


---------13:13----------
diagnosed


---------13:15----------
is because you're unable to sit in a


---------13:16----------
classroom for like


---------13:18----------
seven hours a day right so like there


---------13:20----------
are even some professions which are


---------13:22----------
actually geared towards adhd


---------13:25----------
and if you actually like go back and


---------13:26----------
watch all of the uh interviews we've


---------13:29----------
done with streamers what you'll find is


---------13:32----------
that like like a greater percentage of


---------13:34----------
streamers compared to the normal


---------13:35----------
population have adhd just based on their


---------13:38----------
own self-report right like so many


---------13:40----------
people like will say like oh yeah i have


---------13:42----------
adhd


---------13:43----------
and it turns out that this kind of


---------13:45----------
hunter mentality can actually be


---------13:47----------
advantageous in some some situations


---------13:50----------
so


---------13:52----------
um


---------13:52----------
just to kind of recap i think the key


---------13:54----------
point here is that there are two kinds


---------13:56----------
of people there's like farmers and


---------13:57----------
they're hunters


---------13:58----------
and when you stick a hunter in a


---------14:00----------
farmer's society there you'll create an


---------14:02----------
environmental circumstance that allows


---------14:04----------
their dynamic mind to start to become


---------14:07----------
like a disorder or not function well


---------14:09----------
there's also sort of evidence to this


---------14:11----------
where like when kids get individualized


---------14:13----------
attention


---------14:14----------
they're able to perform better in school


---------14:16----------
and don't get kind of evaluated or


---------14:18----------
diagnosed for adhd


---------14:20----------
so there's a lot of stuff about like you


---------14:22----------
know just the amount of structure that


---------14:23----------
people can tolerate the other thing that


---------14:25----------
tends to go on in a lot of schools is


---------14:27----------
that people will medicate children


---------14:30----------
for the purpose of obedience right so


---------14:32----------
like if i have if i'm a if i'm a teacher


---------14:35----------
and i've got like 30 rowdy kids and i


---------14:37----------
medicate the five rowdiest of them then


---------14:39----------
it's like easy for me to like teach my


---------14:41----------
class right


---------14:42----------
and what we tend to see is like the most


---------14:44----------
disruptive kids get diagnosed with adhd


---------14:47----------
because they can't restrain their


---------14:48----------
attention


---------14:50----------
so next thing that we're going to talk


---------14:51----------
about is like what is


---------14:53----------
attention deficit disorder add or adhd


---------14:57----------
and we're going to talk a little bit


---------14:58----------
about some myths around adhd and some


---------15:00----------
like tricky things about diagnosis so


---------15:03----------
the first thing to understand is that it


---------15:05----------
is a disorder


---------15:07----------
of attention


---------15:09----------
okay so this is where a lot of people


---------15:12----------
get tripped up so disorders of attention


---------15:15----------
basically the way that i think about it


---------15:17----------
is an inability


---------15:20----------
to control


---------15:23----------
your attention


---------15:26----------
so this is


---------15:27----------
this


---------15:29----------
the lack of this understanding is why i


---------15:31----------
think adhd is the most over diagnosed


---------15:34----------
and the most under diagnosed psychiatric


---------15:37----------
diagnosis and you may wonder how can


---------15:39----------
something be over-diagnosed and


---------15:41----------
under-diagnosed at the same time


---------15:43----------
the reason that you can have that is


---------15:44----------
because you get a lot of people who


---------15:46----------
don't have the disorder that are getting


---------15:47----------
a diagnosis


---------15:49----------
and you are missing a lot of the people


---------15:51----------
that do have a diagnosis but you don't


---------15:53----------
catch it because of other things so here


---------15:56----------
are a couple of common misnomers about


---------15:58----------
adhd that people don't get


---------16:00----------
the first is that people with adhd can't


---------16:02----------
focus


---------16:05----------
this is actually incorrect


---------16:07----------
so with adhd we see a disorder of


---------16:09----------
attention so what we see with adhd is


---------16:12----------
actually hyper focus


---------16:14----------
plus a lack of focus


---------16:17----------
so what is actually very common in


---------16:19----------
people with adhd is that they can sit


---------16:21----------
and do one activity for four hours at a


---------16:23----------
stretch provided it is the right


---------16:25----------
activity


---------16:26----------
so what you see is a disorder of


---------16:28----------
attention where once an adhd kid is


---------16:31----------
doing something it is very very hard to


---------16:34----------
get them to change gears


---------16:36----------
so once they almost have like an


---------16:38----------
obsessive quality to their attention


---------16:44----------
okay


---------16:45----------
so this is one of the reasons that it


---------16:46----------
gets misdiagnosed because like parents


---------16:48----------
will be sitting there with their kids


---------16:49----------
and they'll be like he never pays


---------16:51----------
attention to school but once he starts


---------16:52----------
playing with legos like you have to


---------16:54----------
physically pull him away like it is so


---------16:56----------
hard to get his attention once they are


---------16:59----------
doing something that they're super into


---------17:02----------
so this sort of disruption of focus


---------17:04----------
or this like inability to control your


---------17:06----------
attention can result in hyper focus and


---------17:09----------
it's because parents or teachers or


---------17:11----------
other people will see the hyper focus


---------17:13----------
they'll even see it with a particular


---------17:14----------
subject it's like


---------17:16----------
my kid can't pay attention in math but


---------17:19----------
like as long as it's history he can sit


---------17:21----------
there and read books like you can give


---------17:22----------
him like a history book at the age of


---------17:24----------
seven and he'll like read it for four


---------17:26----------
hours at a time


---------17:27----------
so people with adhd can absolutely hyper


---------17:30----------
focus on particular things and in this


---------17:33----------
situation it can also be like


---------17:34----------
maladaptive because you can't change


---------17:36----------
your your focus you can't stop uh


---------17:39----------
studying history and start studying


---------17:40----------
mathematics


---------17:42----------
plus a lack of focus so when it comes to


---------17:44----------
mathematics you have once again like an


---------17:46----------
inability


---------17:48----------
to focus


---------17:50----------
so when i think about disordered


---------17:52----------
attention what i really when i think


---------17:54----------
about adhd i think about disordered


---------17:56----------
attention when i think about disordered


---------17:57----------
attention it is both a combination of


---------18:00----------
hyper focus and lack of focus okay


---------18:04----------
so the next thing to kind of think a


---------18:05----------
little bit about


---------18:07----------
is um


---------18:10----------
let me just think for a second


---------18:13----------
whether i want to say anything about


---------18:14----------
this does this make sense to people


---------18:18----------
okay


---------18:20----------
so the next thing to talk a little bit


---------18:21----------
about i'm going to go over just a couple


---------18:23----------
of other like reasons why adhd is


---------18:25----------
misdiagnosed


---------18:27----------
so the first is that we just kind of


---------18:29----------
talked about is that


---------18:31----------
adhd kids sometimes hyper focus


---------18:34----------
therefore people think oh since they're


---------18:36----------
capable of hyper focus


---------18:38----------
they uh


---------18:39----------
don't actually have adhd so other


---------18:41----------
reasons are good grades


---------18:45----------
so oftentimes what you'll have is kids


---------18:47----------
with adhd


---------18:48----------
who have high iqs plus


---------18:52----------
adhd and what this results in is good


---------18:54----------
grades and just because a kid is like


---------18:58----------
brute force iq their way through things


---------19:00----------
or develops compensatory mechanisms for


---------19:03----------
studying so like they're not actually


---------19:05----------
able to sit in focus but they may


---------19:07----------
develop all kinds of compensatory


---------19:09----------
mechanisms like group studying


---------19:12----------
another example of self-medication with


---------19:14----------
drugs


---------19:16----------
another example is being a night owl


---------19:19----------
and you may wonder what does being a


---------19:21----------
night owl have to do with adhd well let


---------19:23----------
me explain to you


---------19:24----------
so people with adhd sometimes find that


---------19:27----------
a certain amount of fatigue


---------19:29----------
slows down their mind


---------19:32----------
and allows them to study


---------19:36----------
right


---------19:37----------
and so you'll also see this this kind of


---------19:39----------
pattern will they'll do other things to


---------19:41----------
slow their mind down either drugs or


---------19:43----------
they'll even play video games


---------19:45----------
they'll do things that kind of make them


---------19:46----------
like half exhausted so that their mind


---------19:48----------
is able to like sit properly


---------19:50----------
so we see a lot of misdiagnosis actually


---------19:52----------
because kids have good grades because


---------19:54----------
kids are smart so we miss the diagnosis


---------19:56----------
another reason that we've already talked


---------19:58----------
about is things like class size


---------20:01----------
so this is another reason why kids are


---------20:03----------
diagnosed with adhd is because like you


---------20:05----------
know there's just too many kids in the


---------20:06----------
class and so normally like if you think


---------20:08----------
about a six-year-old like a six-year-old


---------20:10----------
is only supposed to be able to hold


---------20:12----------
their attention for a certain amount of


---------20:13----------
time


---------20:14----------
but depending on external pressures


---------20:16----------
class size things like that


---------20:19----------
you can actually get like over diagnosis


---------20:21----------
of adhd


---------20:22----------
there's also remember uh another reason


---------20:24----------
that it's misdiagnosed is like you know


---------20:27----------
uh how can i say this like


---------20:29----------
development idiosyncrasies


---------20:35----------
so remember that


---------20:37----------
the primary reason the regions of the


---------20:39----------
brain that are involved in adhd are the


---------20:41----------
frontal lobes


---------20:43----------
or executive function which if you guys


---------20:45----------
watch either of my other lectures on


---------20:47----------
depression or


---------20:49----------
addiction you'll realize this statement


---------20:51----------
is a huge oversimplification because we


---------20:53----------
go over all the different regions of the


---------20:54----------
brain that adhd affects


---------20:57----------
so


---------20:58----------
executive dysfunction


---------21:00----------
is kind of what we're looking at right


---------21:01----------
and so we also have to remember that


---------21:03----------
like


---------21:04----------
kids develop at different rates so not


---------21:06----------
all seven-year-olds are gonna behave the


---------21:08----------
same right just like


---------21:11----------
height or appetite or puberty or all


---------21:13----------
manner of other like developmental


---------21:15----------
milestones


---------21:17----------
our frontal lobes ability and our


---------21:19----------
executive dysfunction or function


---------21:21----------
develops at its own idiosyncratic rate


---------21:24----------
and so some people are just like you


---------21:26----------
know some people start puberty early


---------21:28----------
some people start puberty late in the


---------21:30----------
same way some people's frontal lobes


---------21:32----------
develop earlier some people's frontal


---------21:33----------
lobes develop later like i see this even


---------21:36----------
in my two kids because my older kid has


---------21:38----------
like a super developed frontal lobe for


---------21:40----------
her age and my younger kid like by


---------21:42----------
comparison it doesn't have frontal lobe


---------21:44----------
that's quite as developed or not


---------21:46----------
anywhere near and that's just like


---------21:48----------
individually the way they are like the


---------21:49----------
younger one will get there and this is


---------21:51----------
going to take her some amount of time


---------21:53----------
so there are developmental


---------21:55----------
idiosyncrasies that will cause people to


---------21:57----------
diagnose kids with adhd and you may get


---------21:59----------
a label and once you get a label you're


---------22:01----------
like oh i have adhd even though as your


---------22:03----------
frontal lobe develops you may grow out


---------22:05----------
of adhd and if you guys kind of think


---------22:08----------
like how is it possible to grow out of


---------22:09----------
adhd just think about the attention span


---------22:11----------
of a 2 year old versus 4 year old versus


---------22:13----------
14 year old versus 40 year old right the


---------22:15----------
attention span naturally changes over


---------22:18----------
time so even if you get diagnosed at the


---------22:20----------
age of 12 with adhd you may not have


---------22:22----------
adhd when you're 22. it doesn't


---------22:24----------
necessarily have to be a lifelong


---------22:25----------
diagnosis


---------22:26----------
so this is another reason that people


---------22:28----------
get misdiagnosed with adhd


---------22:32----------
so class size or environment


---------22:37----------
so there's another thing that oftentimes


---------22:39----------
like these are the ways in which adhd


---------22:41----------
gets missed this is why it gets


---------22:42----------
misdiagnosed this is sort of how it gets


---------22:45----------
misdiagnosed


---------22:50----------
so what i mean by that


---------22:51----------
is that a lot of times like kids with


---------22:53----------
adhd will be labeled with behavioral


---------22:56----------
problems


---------22:58----------
okay so like you'll get a kid and


---------23:01----------
they'll they'll be like oh they like oh


---------23:03----------
here's another one actually


---------23:06----------
so doesn't listen


---------23:12----------
or is defiant


---------23:14----------
okay this is really really common we


---------23:17----------
remember that the problem with adhd is


---------23:19----------
like attentional control so if an adhd


---------23:22----------
kid is playing with legos their parents


---------23:25----------
will say that this person doesn't listen


---------23:28----------
and oftentimes like like you know let's


---------23:30----------
say you have a kid with adhd and you


---------23:32----------
tell them go wash your hands and then


---------23:34----------
the kid like on the way to the bathroom


---------23:36----------
will get distracted by something because


---------23:37----------
they'll see like a toy on the floor and


---------23:39----------
they'll start picking it up they'll


---------23:40----------
start playing with the toy and the


---------23:42----------
parents will get mad at them


---------23:44----------
right and once they get mad at they're


---------23:45----------
like like you you're not listening to me


---------23:47----------
you never listen bad child bad child bad


---------23:50----------
child and so this not listening thing


---------23:53----------
gets sometimes perceived as defiance and


---------23:55----------
then the punishment that they get


---------23:59----------
then leads to shame


---------24:02----------
and self-esteem problems and a lack of


---------24:04----------
agency


---------24:05----------
so we talked about this in the


---------24:06----------
depression lecture as well where a lot


---------24:08----------
of times like


---------24:10----------
you know kids with adhd will get


---------24:13----------
like


---------24:14----------
punished or they'll have different kinds


---------24:16----------
of experiences either social experiences


---------24:19----------
behavioral experiences like school


---------24:21----------
experiences they're perceived as not


---------24:23----------
being obedient right so that's kind of


---------24:25----------
like the defiant thing


---------24:27----------
so we'll get all these kids who actually


---------24:29----------
have adhd who are labeled as bad kids so


---------24:32----------
they have behavioral problems they don't


---------24:33----------
listen they're defiant you know they're


---------24:36----------
argumentative


---------24:37----------
um there are all kinds of problems that


---------24:39----------
these kids will kind of get labeled as


---------24:40----------
but that's not they don't actually have


---------24:42----------
those problems they're not being defiant


---------24:44----------
it's not like the kid is like walking to


---------24:46----------
the bathroom and is like screw my


---------24:47----------
parents i'm gonna play something


---------24:49----------
what they end up doing is they just get


---------24:51----------
distracted by something and then they


---------24:52----------
like they just get distracted by it and


---------24:54----------
then they get punished for it and then


---------24:55----------
they feel bad because they don't even


---------24:57----------
really realize what they did wrong right


---------24:59----------
they sort of connect the dots afterward


---------25:01----------
but in the moment their mind just like


---------25:03----------
switches gears and they forget


---------25:06----------
there's another thing they get perceived


---------25:08----------
as forgetful


---------25:10----------
right so oh like this person is just


---------25:12----------
forgetful like their memory is terrible


---------25:16----------
i've even had this


---------25:18----------
so i one time had um a dude come into my


---------25:21----------
office and say like


---------25:22----------
i think i may have dementia and the dude


---------25:24----------
was like in his like late 20s


---------25:26----------
and i was like why do you think you have


---------25:27----------
dementia i was like that's bizarre like


---------25:29----------
i don't hear that every day they're like


---------25:31----------
well my memory is just terrible and i


---------25:33----------
was like well tell me about that and


---------25:34----------
he's like well my wife tells me i forget


---------25:35----------
stuff all the time


---------25:37----------
so we started talking about it and then


---------25:38----------
like the more that i realized like oh


---------25:40----------
this guy doesn't have a memory problem


---------25:41----------
he has like an attention problem so this


---------25:43----------
is where if we remember so if we think


---------25:44----------
about like memories stored in our brain


---------25:46----------
let's say this is where memories are


---------25:47----------
stored


---------25:48----------
remember they have to get in they have


---------25:50----------
to get put in somewhere and then they


---------25:52----------
have to get recalled


---------25:55----------
and so if if this is missing


---------25:58----------
or you can't recall it properly we think


---------26:00----------
oh like


---------26:01----------
it it you know i wasn't able to recall


---------26:03----------
it but the truth is it never got planted


---------26:05----------
in in the first place so a good example


---------26:07----------
of this is if someone tells me if i ask


---------26:09----------
like this is a classic example okay the


---------26:12----------
easy example of understanding attention


---------26:13----------
versus recall


---------26:15----------
who here meets a bunch of people at a


---------26:17----------
party and forgets their names right like


---------26:20----------
it doesn't have to be a bunch of people


---------26:21----------
it can even be one person you meet one


---------26:23----------
person you you're like hey my name is


---------26:24----------
olok and they say my name is whatever


---------26:26----------
like it doesn't never even sinks in


---------26:28----------
like and you're like oh i forgot


---------26:30----------
that person's name


---------26:31----------
right and it's like how can you forget


---------26:33----------
that person's name so quickly like


---------26:35----------
within five seconds of introducing


---------26:37----------
yourself you forget their name within


---------26:38----------
two seconds of introducing yourself


---------26:40----------
you're like what was that person's name


---------26:41----------
again and then you just or they just


---------26:43----------
introduced themselves you've already


---------26:44----------
forgotten the name so you don't like


---------26:46----------
think that you're like oh well it's


---------26:48----------
stupid i can't just ask them like right


---------26:49----------
away like what is your name right so why


---------26:52----------
does that happen it's an intentional


---------26:54----------
thing because when you introduce


---------26:55----------
yourselves your attention is on your


---------26:58----------
introduction so you're not listening to


---------26:59----------
them so the name never gets implanted in


---------27:02----------
your brain in the first place


---------27:04----------
right so it's never being entered in


---------27:08----------
and so this is why people with adhd have


---------27:10----------
like


---------27:11----------
they they get perceived as forgetful


---------27:13----------
it's not because they have any problem


---------27:15----------
with recall they don't have dementia


---------27:17----------
it's just that their attention is


---------27:18----------
wandering so the stuff never gets put in


---------27:20----------
in the first place


---------27:22----------
okay


---------27:23----------
so this is like


---------27:24----------
when we kind of look at the misdiagnosis


---------27:26----------
of adhd or let's start from the top so


---------27:28----------
like adhd essentially is a disorder of


---------27:30----------
attention and that attentional disorder


---------27:33----------
can result in hyper focus which leads to


---------27:35----------
a lot of misdiagnosis because parents


---------27:37----------
are like oh like you know he can like do


---------27:39----------
roblox all day long no big deal also


---------27:41----------
gaming


---------27:42----------
right so we'll talk about let's talk


---------27:43----------
about gaming in a second but


---------27:46----------
uh it's both hyper focus plus a lack of


---------27:48----------
focus it tends to get misdiagnosed or


---------27:50----------
missed in a lot of people


---------27:52----------
due to their ability to get good grades


---------27:54----------
which oftentimes has to do with like


---------27:56----------
compensatory mechanisms that they'll set


---------27:58----------
up


---------27:59----------
um can get misdiagnosed due to things


---------28:00----------
like class size or environment because


---------28:02----------
remember a psychiatric diagnosis tends


---------28:05----------
to be a vulnerability plus an


---------28:07----------
environmental factor combined


---------28:10----------
and then um another reason that it gets


---------28:12----------
misdiagnosed is because people just


---------28:14----------
develop at their own pace


---------28:16----------
so it's like you can't expect all


---------28:18----------
seven-year-olds to be able to sit in the


---------28:19----------
classroom at the same


---------28:21----------
level right some kids are going to


---------28:23----------
really love it some kids it's going to


---------28:24----------
be hard and then like people will sort


---------28:26----------
of grow out of it


---------28:28----------
so oftentimes kids with adhd get


---------28:30----------
misdiagnosed with things like behavioral


---------28:32----------
problems problems like oh they don't


---------28:34----------
listen they get punished for defiance or


---------28:36----------
lack of obedience um for being forgetful


---------28:39----------
oh my kid is like they're just


---------28:41----------
completely forgetful like i can't rely


---------28:43----------
on them for you know to remember


---------28:44----------
anything and it's not an issue of recall


---------28:46----------
it's an issue of attention


---------28:49----------
so let's talk about gaming for a second


---------28:50----------
in adhd


---------28:52----------
why do kids with adhd love gaming it's


---------28:56----------
because games demand your attention


---------29:01----------
okay


---------29:02----------
so like this is the cool thing about a


---------29:04----------
video game right like it doesn't ever


---------29:06----------
kind of get boring it just like and and


---------29:08----------
people with adhd will self select for


---------29:11----------
particular video games that um will


---------29:13----------
demand their attention in the right way


---------29:16----------
so the game is constantly giving you


---------29:17----------
stimuli


---------29:19----------
right so it's like oh like there's a


---------29:20----------
random encounter here if i'm playing


---------29:21----------
like fortnite or a battle royale like


---------29:23----------
now there's someone over here or like i


---------29:26----------
can queue up for a game of league and


---------29:27----------
there's always like some kind of thing


---------29:29----------
that is like triggering and pulling in


---------29:30----------
your attention


---------29:32----------
and so this is also where people will


---------29:34----------
get misdiagnosed because parents will be


---------29:36----------
like i don't understand why my kid can't


---------29:38----------
study he can sit there and literally


---------29:39----------
play on you know on a computer for like


---------29:42----------
12 hours like without stopping for food


---------29:45----------
and that is once again because it is


---------29:46----------
disordered attention


---------29:51----------
right so they can hyper focus


---------29:53----------
so video games are are very very


---------29:55----------
addictive to people with adhd because


---------29:58----------
they allow your mind to be fully focused


---------30:01----------
and it's sort of like a never ending


---------30:03----------
like ability to get focused and this is


---------30:05----------
where we can almost take a quick


---------30:07----------
spiritual detour


---------30:09----------
and we can acknowledge that if you look


---------30:11----------
at like old texts on yoga and meditation


---------30:14----------
they say that focus


---------30:15----------
equals bliss


---------30:18----------
that the happy mind is not an anxious


---------30:21----------
mind or a distracted mind but a focused


---------30:23----------
mind so if you do something like watch a


---------30:25----------
sunset


---------30:27----------
why do sunsets look so cool it's because


---------30:29----------
they like allow you to focus your mind


---------30:31----------
if we look at the nature of like


---------30:33----------
um you know


---------30:35----------
unhappiness in the mind it's usually


---------30:37----------
like unfocused thoughts


---------30:40----------
so a good example of this is


---------30:42----------
anxiety


---------30:44----------
when you're thinking about one thing and


---------30:46----------
you're thinking about another thing and


---------30:47----------
you're thinking about a third thing you


---------30:48----------
may think that it's all the same thought


---------30:50----------
but if you really pay attention to


---------30:52----------
anxiety it's actually rapidly moving


---------30:54----------
thoughts you may be anxious about a


---------30:56----------
party


---------30:57----------
but you may think oh does that mean that


---------30:59----------
i'm focused on the party no if you


---------31:00----------
actually pay attention to your thoughts


---------31:01----------
you're not focused on the party when you


---------31:04----------
have anxiety about going to a party


---------31:06----------
you're like oh what if i'm wearing the


---------31:07----------
wrong thing and then what if people


---------31:08----------
think i'm stupid and then people won't


---------31:10----------
like me and who am i gonna talk to am i


---------31:12----------
gonna be standing in the corner with a


---------31:13----------
drink not talking to myself and


---------31:15----------
everyone's gonna think i'm a loser and


---------31:17----------
then like i'm gonna walk up and try to


---------31:18----------
join a conversation and that's gonna


---------31:20----------
seem super awkward because i'm just like


---------31:21----------
walking up and not saying anything so


---------31:23----------
you kind of think about like all these


---------31:25----------
15 different things it's not one thought


---------31:27----------
it's not like watching a sunset where


---------31:29----------
you're not like thinking oh like the


---------31:31----------
sunset has this sunspot here and then


---------31:33----------
it's got this and then it's got this and


---------31:34----------
then it's got this you're just absorbed


---------31:36----------
in the experience


---------31:39----------
so yogi sort of figured out that focus


---------31:41----------
equals bliss and if you can be absorbed


---------31:43----------
in one thing that will lead to a mental


---------31:46----------
feeling of like calmness and enjoyment


---------31:48----------
and so this is what's so addictive about


---------31:50----------
gaming is that gaming sort of gives us a


---------31:53----------
sense of focus


---------31:54----------
and so even though the game is rage


---------31:56----------
inducing we find ourselves drawn to it


---------31:59----------
why because we can be absorbed within it


---------32:01----------
right so like a good example of this is


---------32:03----------
like if you if you play something like


---------32:05----------
dark souls like while you're fighting


---------32:06----------
the boss you have like laser focus and


---------32:09----------
it's after you get one-shotted that you


---------32:11----------
throw your controller down and smash


---------32:12----------
everything right but it's it's the sh


---------32:14----------
because when you get one shot at in dark


---------32:16----------
souls what happens it shatters your


---------32:18----------
beautiful focus


---------32:20----------
when you're playing like league of


---------32:21----------
legends or valerant or whatever you're


---------32:22----------
like hyper focused and it's when your


---------32:24----------
teammate ins down mid


---------32:26----------
that it shatters your focus and then you


---------32:28----------
start raging why because this thing gets


---------32:31----------
taken away from you


---------32:32----------
okay


---------32:34----------
so we see kind of that gaming and adhd


---------32:36----------
are like really really great because


---------32:38----------
they take your disordered attention and


---------32:40----------
allow you to hyper focus on it so easily


---------32:44----------
and the mind just loves that from a


---------32:46----------
spiritual perspective by spiritual


---------32:48----------
perspective i mean this is sort of like


---------32:49----------
the way that the yogi's looked at things


---------32:51----------
it's not really like scientific in the


---------32:52----------
sense that they didn't do like you know


---------32:54----------
a randomized controlled trial on ten


---------32:56----------
thousand humans what they did is look at


---------32:58----------
themselves with like ten thousand


---------33:00----------
intensity they took an n of one and


---------33:02----------
explored it all the way down to the core


---------33:06----------
okay


---------33:07----------
so now let's talk a little bit since


---------33:09----------
we're on the topic of gaming so now


---------33:10----------
let's talk a little bit about like being


---------33:12----------
adhd in the modern world


---------33:19----------
okay and why is this important


---------33:22----------
it's because if we look at our world our


---------33:24----------
world is changing rapidly so remember


---------33:26----------
that the industrial revolution


---------33:31----------
basically made us a society of farmers


---------33:38----------
right where everyone is a cog in the


---------33:39----------
wheel or cog in


---------33:41----------
the machine


---------33:44----------
right we have nine to five


---------33:46----------
all this other stuff there's this idea


---------33:48----------
of high school


---------33:50----------
college


---------33:52----------
career even the word career you guys get


---------33:55----------
this the word career implies like one


---------33:58----------
thing that you do for your entire life


---------34:01----------
it's a farmer biased word you guys get


---------34:03----------
that it's not like


---------34:05----------
and then the there's like the


---------34:07----------
opposite is odd jobs


---------34:10----------
right like and so you guys see like the


---------34:12----------
value judgment difference between these


---------34:14----------
two things so if you look at someone


---------34:16----------
like elon musk like he doesn't have a


---------34:17----------
career


---------34:18----------
he's a dude with odd jobs


---------34:21----------
you all get that like bill gates had a


---------34:23----------
career elon musk has odd jobs he's like


---------34:26----------
uh i'm a i'm gonna start a company that


---------34:28----------
sends people into space


---------34:30----------
i'm gonna start an electric car company


---------34:33----------
i'ma start a company that


---------34:35----------
drills into the ground and like


---------34:37----------
high-speed rail transport like on


---------34:39----------
california


---------34:41----------
right so like this is where if we look


---------34:43----------
at the industrial revolution and the


---------34:44----------
consequence of the industrial revolution


---------34:46----------
what we see is that like there's such a


---------34:48----------
heavy bias


---------34:49----------
about what is successful and what is


---------34:51----------
good versus what is bad and it's very


---------34:53----------
very farmer focused it's very


---------34:55----------
anti-hunter


---------34:58----------
okay


---------34:59----------
but now like the world is changing so


---------35:01----------
like i'll just give you guys a couple of


---------35:03----------
examples okay so like what tends to


---------35:06----------
happen is


---------35:07----------
over time our attention can transform so


---------35:10----------
we can you know make our attention more


---------35:12----------
farmer-like


---------35:17----------
or we can go over here and make it


---------35:20----------
more hunter-like


---------35:22----------
so


---------35:23----------
studies that have been done which


---------35:24----------
basically show that like


---------35:26----------
short content makes people more adhd so


---------35:30----------
there are studies that show that like so


---------35:31----------
people will sometimes ask me okay is it


---------35:34----------
okay if my kid like uses a screen


---------35:36----------
and they're like what do you think about


---------35:38----------
screen time dr k and that's where like i


---------35:40----------
know it sounds kind of weird but not all


---------35:42----------
screen time is the same like there's no


---------35:43----------
such thing i mean there is something is


---------35:45----------
screen time


---------35:46----------
but how you use the screen


---------35:48----------
makes a big difference oh my god that's


---------35:50----------
just completely a legible chat


---------35:52----------
even that's too much for me


---------35:57----------
so for example what i'll advise parents


---------35:59----------
to do is long form content on a on a


---------36:02----------
screen is fine


---------36:04----------
so for example a movie is okay


---------36:07----------
but youtube


---------36:09----------
compilations


---------36:10----------
are bad


---------36:13----------
and let's just think about this so like


---------36:14----------
if i spend my days watching movies


---------36:16----------
my brain is literally going to be


---------36:18----------
entrained


---------36:20----------
to pay attention to something over long


---------36:22----------
periods of time if i watch youtube


---------36:24----------
compilations my attention is shifting


---------36:27----------
like every 60 seconds so ads are another


---------36:30----------
thing that makes things like more


---------36:32----------
hunter-like increases the dynamic nature


---------36:35----------
of our mind so now let's look at a


---------36:37----------
couple of different things okay so like


---------36:39----------
let's look at a couple of categories


---------36:40----------
let's talk about content


---------36:43----------
then let's talk about uh


---------36:46----------
discussion


---------36:50----------
okay


---------36:52----------
and then let's talk about dating


---------36:54----------
so let's look at like how these things


---------36:56----------
have progressed over time


---------36:58----------
so back in the day if i wanted content


---------37:00----------
what i had to do was read a book


---------37:03----------
right and this was like


---------37:04----------
a 30 hour


---------37:06----------
endeavor


---------37:07----------
and then what happened someone like


---------37:08----------
invented television where they're like


---------37:10----------
oh look there's a tv show and now it's


---------37:12----------
like a one hour endeavor


---------37:15----------
right and then someone came along and


---------37:16----------
invented youtube


---------37:18----------
and now it's like


---------37:20----------
anywhere from five to 15 minutes


---------37:24----------
right and then someone came along and


---------37:26----------
was like hey let's do this live


---------37:28----------
and they invented twitch now you can


---------37:30----------
watch a stream for like eight hours at a


---------37:31----------
stretch but like you know there's


---------37:33----------
there's an increase in the dynamic


---------37:36----------
nature of twitch


---------37:38----------
right in which which content platform is


---------37:40----------
growing the most rapidly there it is


---------37:42----------
good job


---------37:44----------
tick tock which is like less than 60


---------37:46----------
seconds bro


---------37:50----------
so what's happening is like we are


---------37:51----------
actually selecting for shorter and


---------37:53----------
shorter attention spans so as kids start


---------37:56----------
watching tick tock and if we kind of


---------37:58----------
look at the adhd diagnosis


---------38:01----------
adhd has been increasing


---------38:05----------
all along


---------38:06----------
right over time if we go down this way


---------38:08----------
we'll see an increase in adhd diagnosis


---------38:12----------
next thing to kind of think about let's


---------38:13----------
think about like discussions


---------38:15----------
for lack of a better term so it used to


---------38:17----------
be like people talking


---------38:19----------
like let's like


---------38:20----------
you know the roman senate


---------38:23----------
and then like people hanging out on


---------38:25----------
porches right so these were like


---------38:27----------
long things like people would talk for


---------38:29----------
hours


---------38:31----------
and then what's happening is like


---------38:33----------
the internet comes along and then we


---------38:34----------
have these things called discussion


---------38:36----------
forums which if you still go to places


---------38:38----------
like rpg codex you'll see like


---------38:40----------
discussion forums that are like years


---------38:42----------
old right you'll have a thread that's


---------38:44----------
like years old where people are still


---------38:45----------
talking about it


---------38:47----------
and then over time we even get things


---------38:48----------
like reddit where it's like there's some


---------38:50----------
discussion but the discussion like tends


---------38:53----------
to happen like temporarily or shortly


---------38:55----------
and then we end up with things like


---------38:56----------
twitch


---------38:58----------
and twitter


---------38:59----------
which is like if you blink you'll miss


---------39:01----------
chat right


---------39:02----------
and so we see the same thing oh no we're


---------39:04----------
lagging gg


---------39:06----------
we have to move


---------39:08----------
um


---------39:09----------
we see things like twitch and twitter


---------39:11----------
where like the the discussion rate is


---------39:13----------
very very rapid


---------39:15----------
and let's even talk about dating


---------39:17----------
okay so dating there used to be


---------39:18----------
courtship


---------39:20----------
this is like a long and drawn out


---------39:22----------
process of like balls and meetings and


---------39:24----------
things like that


---------39:25----------
and then after the courtship process


---------39:27----------
like years later centuries later we


---------39:30----------
started this thing called dating


---------39:32----------
right so people will say are you walking


---------39:34----------
out with someone or whatever terminology


---------39:36----------
they used and that like dating is like a


---------39:38----------
little bit more dynamic you meet a


---------39:39----------
couple more people you kind of do you


---------39:41----------
know


---------39:42----------
it takes a couple months maybe a couple


---------39:44----------
years like courtship is like more


---------39:46----------
structured


---------39:47----------
and then after dating you know more


---------39:49----------
recently i'd say in the last 20 30 years


---------39:51----------
like as the availability of birth


---------39:52----------
control kind of increased


---------39:54----------
we sort of have like a hookup culture


---------39:57----------
right where like it's no longer just


---------39:59----------
about getting married like you don't


---------40:00----------
even need to get married you can just


---------40:01----------
like date for the sake of dating and you


---------40:03----------
can like hook up just to have a good


---------40:05----------
time like there's no there's no value


---------40:06----------
judgment attached to it and now we have


---------40:08----------
tinder and in the courtship you're like


---------40:11----------
dealing with one person


---------40:13----------
and the dating thing let's say you're


---------40:14----------
dealing with like three to five people


---------40:16----------
in the hookup culture maybe you're


---------40:17----------
dealing with like five to


---------40:19----------
20 depending on oh god once again


---------40:22----------
terrible handwriting


---------40:25----------
and then like tinder it's like literally


---------40:27----------
a numbers game so it's like 99 plus


---------40:30----------
right so we see that society is like


---------40:32----------
moving in this direction


---------40:35----------
as we move in this direction we're going


---------40:37----------
to see an increase


---------40:38----------
in adhd like symptoms


---------40:42----------
oh my god


---------40:44----------
chat


---------40:45----------
dr k is on the struggle bus today


---------40:49----------
and as we see an increase in adhd like


---------40:51----------
symptoms


---------40:53----------
like we're gonna see like more people


---------40:54----------
feeling like they have adhd but


---------40:56----------
something interesting is also happening


---------40:59----------
which is that society is moving away


---------41:01----------
from the farmers


---------41:06----------
so


---------41:07----------
if you guys read anything by like


---------41:09----------
charles dickens


---------41:10----------
right like there's like back in the day


---------41:12----------
of like book writing


---------41:15----------
or like tolstoy


---------41:17----------
very very like long attention span


---------41:20----------
authors and long attention span like


---------41:23----------
consumers of content


---------41:25----------
and so what's happening over time is


---------41:27----------
that we're getting like


---------41:29----------
going down this way where like as


---------41:31----------
society becomes adhd the more adhd


---------41:34----------
mindset becomes more advantageous


---------41:37----------
so this is where like it's been my


---------41:39----------
experience for example with twitch


---------41:40----------
streamers


---------41:41----------
that the average twitch streamer is more


---------41:44----------
adhd than the average like


---------41:46----------
person


---------41:47----------
and what that actually does for them is


---------41:49----------
actually gives them a competitive


---------41:50----------
advantage so even this kind of stuck out


---------41:53----------
with me we did an interview with the


---------41:54----------
daily dose of the internet dude


---------41:56----------
so if you you like think about the ddo i


---------41:59----------
guy like what he basically does is like


---------42:01----------
uses his own attention span


---------42:03----------
as like a judge for what the internet


---------42:06----------
will like or not like


---------42:08----------
right so his attention span


---------42:13----------
becomes


---------42:15----------
a tool


---------42:18----------
instead of


---------42:20----------
a problem now remember he still exists


---------42:23----------
in a primarily farmer society where


---------42:25----------
there's like bank accounts and monthly


---------42:27----------
payments and this and that and mortgages


---------42:29----------
and credit scores and all this stuff so


---------42:31----------
we're not saying that like it's


---------42:32----------
necessarily an advantage but i have seen


---------42:35----------
that like as we get more and more


---------42:37----------
twitter oriented our attention spans


---------42:39----------
seem to be shorter so if you look at


---------42:41----------
political discourse


---------42:43----------
over the case over time right so it


---------42:45----------
started off with like let's say the


---------42:47----------
roman senate where people go and


---------42:49----------
construct arguments


---------42:51----------
and like we'll discuss for hours and


---------42:52----------
hours at a time and now we've got like


---------42:55----------
twitter trolls


---------42:57----------
right who will just make like bizarre


---------42:59----------
political statements that no one fact


---------43:02----------
checks has no nuance and just incites


---------43:04----------
emotion


---------43:05----------
so it's almost like being adhd means


---------43:08----------
that you can't be a senator in ancient


---------43:10----------
rome but having adhd in today's society


---------43:12----------
makes you a political pundit like it's


---------43:15----------
easy


---------43:16----------
right


---------43:18----------
so this is like a good example of how


---------43:20----------
our society is actually moving more


---------43:22----------
towards adhd we're sort of cultivating a


---------43:25----------
shorter attention span but bizarrely


---------43:28----------
actually this may serve as an advantage


---------43:30----------
for those of you who feel like you've


---------43:31----------
got adhd


---------43:33----------
and so there are a couple of other


---------43:35----------
trends for example that like some


---------43:36----------
companies have embraced so i don't know


---------43:38----------
if you guys know this but like google


---------43:40----------
for example last time i checked or based


---------43:42----------
on the clients i've worked on does not


---------43:44----------
have a nine to five work culture


---------43:46----------
they're like we don't care when you come


---------43:47----------
in you can work at like two in the


---------43:49----------
morning if you want to just needs to get


---------43:51----------
done on time like we don't care like


---------43:52----------
when you come in and so google also sort


---------43:54----------
of figured out that like okay we're just


---------43:55----------
going to give our engineers like a


---------43:57----------
cafeteria and a place that's open 24


---------44:00----------
hours and they can come and work


---------44:01----------
wherever they want to so they've sort of


---------44:03----------
selected for the night owls and they did


---------44:06----------
something really cool here because


---------44:07----------
remember in the nine to five work


---------44:09----------
culture like these people would not be


---------44:10----------
able to get a job or they wouldn't be


---------44:12----------
able to keep a job even though they're


---------44:13----------
super talented and could be very good


---------44:15----------
programmers and so by google sort of


---------44:17----------
stepping away from the the farmer


---------44:19----------
culture and moving towards like a more


---------44:21----------
free culture they actually allow these


---------44:24----------
people that may be a little bit more


---------44:25----------
adhd maybe late risers maybe circadian


---------44:28----------
rhythm disorder folks


---------44:29----------
to actually be productive programmers


---------44:32----------
another example of this is actually work


---------44:34----------
from home


---------44:36----------
right so work from home like more and


---------44:37----------
more people are moving towards work from


---------44:39----------
home which is like you may wonder okay


---------44:40----------
what does that have to do with adhd but


---------44:42----------
it's like a less structured environment


---------44:44----------
right so we're moving away from


---------44:46----------
structure towards dynamic work


---------44:48----------
environments and the more that we move


---------44:50----------
in those directions i think the more


---------44:51----------
that the adhd crowd will be like more


---------44:54----------
able to like do a good job so i'll give


---------44:56----------
you guys just a very simple example of


---------44:58----------
how work from home like supports adhd so


---------45:01----------
remember people with adhd have hyper


---------45:02----------
focus


---------45:05----------
or disordered focus


---------45:08----------
or lack of focus right and the problem


---------45:11----------
if you've got adhd you guys may know


---------45:12----------
this is that like you know your typical


---------45:14----------
day is like waiting to get inspired to


---------45:17----------
work panicking procrastinating and then


---------45:20----------
every now and then you get a four hour


---------45:22----------
window


---------45:28----------
you get these four magical hours where


---------45:30----------
you do 24 hours of work


---------45:32----------
you guys know what i mean


---------45:35----------
and so it's like you just like wake up


---------45:37----------
one day and you're like let's go and


---------45:38----------
then you just do all the work


---------45:41----------
and then like for the rest of the week


---------45:42----------
you're trying to figure out why couldn't


---------45:43----------
i do that on monday like when is that


---------45:45----------
gonna happen again and so the work from


---------45:47----------
home culture allows these people to


---------45:49----------
succeed because if you're like an adhd


---------45:51----------
person you have to work from nine to


---------45:52----------
five like what happens if your magical


---------45:54----------
four hours doesn't happen in that window


---------45:56----------
you're screwed you're never gonna get


---------45:57----------
promoted you're gonna get fired


---------45:59----------
it's like gg


---------46:01----------
so as we work from home it's sort of


---------46:03----------
like you just kind of work from home you


---------46:04----------
can be in your pajamas but if you've got


---------46:06----------
a flash of inspiration what used to


---------46:07----------
happen is you get a flash of inspiration


---------46:09----------
oh no gotta change out of my pajamas put


---------46:11----------
on my suit commute for an hour and by


---------46:13----------
the time you get to the office it's like


---------46:15----------
you're hungry over caffeinated and like


---------46:18----------
it's shattered


---------46:19----------
your muse is gone


---------46:21----------
and now in the work from home


---------46:22----------
environment it's like if you get that


---------46:23----------
flash of inspiration it's like you don't


---------46:25----------
even need to put on pants you just sit


---------46:27----------
down and like bang out like you program


---------46:28----------
like a madman for four hours


---------46:31----------
and then you can go and like get some


---------46:32----------
pizza afterward


---------46:35----------
right


---------46:36----------
and so like our society is actually


---------46:37----------
moving in an unstructured environment


---------46:40----------
things are getting more adhd but on the


---------46:42----------
flip side if you have if your attention


---------46:45----------
span


---------46:46----------
is more in this realm


---------46:49----------
you may actually find that you have some


---------46:51----------
competitive advantages


---------46:54----------
questions


---------46:56----------
so just to kind of summarize okay so


---------46:59----------
let's like do major points first of all


---------47:02----------
adhd


---------47:04----------
exists


---------47:08----------
for a reason right and this goes into


---------47:12----------
why society needs farmers


---------47:15----------
and hunters


---------47:17----------
okay


---------47:18----------
generally speaking adhd


---------47:21----------
gets


---------47:22----------
over


---------47:24----------
and under


---------47:26----------
diagnosed


---------47:29----------
okay so it gets misinterpreted in a lot


---------47:31----------
of ways


---------47:32----------
what is it it's a disorder


---------47:35----------
of attention


---------47:37----------
which means


---------47:38----------
hyper focus


---------47:43----------
plus


---------47:44----------
lack of focus


---------47:46----------
and this confuses a lot of people


---------47:49----------
point number three society


---------47:52----------
is


---------47:53----------
increasing adhd


---------47:56----------
but on the flip side


---------48:00----------
if you have adhd


---------48:05----------
you may actually have an advantage


---------48:09----------
as long as you're careful about making


---------48:11----------
it an advantage


---------48:13----------
okay so this is why people are adhd if


---------48:16----------
y'all if this kind of resonates with you


---------48:18----------
like now hopefully you have like a big


---------48:20----------
high order sense of like why things are


---------48:22----------
this way


---------48:23----------
and also like just think a lot about


---------48:25----------
this point especially so when i work


---------48:28----------
with with individuals


---------48:30----------
what i'll really do is work really hard


---------48:32----------
to try to figure out okay like what is


---------48:34----------
your unique


---------48:35----------
like advantage that you can bring to a


---------48:37----------
dif like a particular work environment


---------48:39----------
or your goals or whatever and what i


---------48:40----------
found time and time and time again is


---------48:42----------
that we don't need to medicate them


---------48:44----------
to turn them into like essentially


---------48:46----------
farmers


---------48:47----------
what it's really about and sometimes


---------48:48----------
they still need medication but


---------48:51----------
what it's really about is creating sort


---------48:53----------
of a life or structure


---------48:55----------
that allows your dynamic mind to be an


---------48:58----------
advantage instead of a disadvantage


---------49:02----------
okay questions


---------49:09----------
can you have low attention span without


---------49:11----------
adhd absolutely


---------49:12----------
right so like that's what i'm saying is


---------49:14----------
that as a whole society is shrinking our


---------49:17----------
attention span


---------49:20----------
you all get that


---------49:22----------
because you don't need an attention span


---------49:24----------
the way that you used to like


---------49:25----------
entertainment used to involve reading a


---------49:27----------
book


---------49:28----------
so like think about this every time that


---------49:30----------
like 200 years ago every time someone


---------49:32----------
read a book what they're doing is in


---------49:34----------
training their attention span to be


---------49:36----------
longer


---------49:37----------
and now if like if i'm just like chain


---------49:40----------
watching stuff like and that too you can


---------49:42----------
you know you can tell they're different


---------49:43----------
kinds of content consumers there's the


---------49:46----------
long form podcast content consumer


---------49:48----------
there's the high energy twitch chat


---------49:50----------
consumer and there's like something in


---------49:51----------
the middle which is like the 25 minute


---------49:53----------
video essay on youtube


---------49:55----------
and so depending on where your attention


---------49:57----------
span is you may gravitate towards a


---------49:59----------
particular kind of content and depending


---------50:01----------
on which kind of content you watch you


---------50:03----------
will be in training your attention span


---------50:05----------
a particular way


---------50:07----------
if all you watch is youtube compilations


---------50:09----------
of memes a podcast is gonna feel super


---------50:11----------
boring


---------50:18----------
what if i watch both well that's like


---------50:19----------
that's totally normal right so like


---------50:22----------
the mind doesn't always want the same


---------50:24----------
kind of thing so there's also a


---------50:25----------
variation


---------50:27----------
in like


---------50:28----------
how consistently you like your content


---------50:31----------
like some people only like to read books


---------50:33----------
and can't stand movies and some people


---------50:35----------
are like i like game of thrones books


---------50:38----------
i like game of thrones tv show and


---------50:40----------
season 8 is the best tv is the best


---------50:43----------
season of


---------50:44----------
television that has ever been created in


---------50:46----------
the history of humanity there's


---------50:48----------
variation within populations


---------50:51----------
right


---------51:01----------
it's truly a masterpiece


---------51:17----------
right so now we understand like the


---------51:18----------
advantage this by the way


---------51:21----------
so i love lecturing like in person


---------51:24----------
so like i love teaching


---------51:26----------
but like i can't make a youtube video


---------51:28----------
for the life of me like i just can't sit


---------51:30----------
down like i've tried it a thousand times


---------51:31----------
where i'm just like talking to the


---------51:32----------
camera i just can't do it i need some


---------51:34----------
amount of like actual energy to like


---------51:36----------
keep my mind going


---------51:44----------
uh so someone's saying i thought drugs


---------51:46----------
were a big part of treatment for adhd


---------51:49----------
so oftentimes


---------51:50----------
medicine is used for adhd so let's go


---------51:52----------
over like basic evidence around adhd


---------51:54----------
treatments okay first thing to


---------51:56----------
understand is that medication is as


---------51:58----------
effective as therapy so if you go to


---------52:00----------
like a cognitive behavioral therapist


---------52:02----------
who teaches you how to focus your mind


---------52:06----------
and like map things out and all these


---------52:07----------
other skills you can learn skills that


---------52:10----------
are just as effective as taking like


---------52:12----------
adderall or methylphenidate or whatever


---------52:14----------
it's taking


---------52:16----------
adhd medication this is something that


---------52:18----------
is very very poorly like understood in


---------52:21----------
society is that you can get the benefit


---------52:24----------
of medication without medication like


---------52:27----------
the effect sizes are the same


---------52:29----------
second thing to understand is that the


---------52:30----------
reason that people do medication is


---------52:32----------
because it's easy


---------52:34----------
right so it's like very easy especially


---------52:36----------
if you've got a 13 year old like taking


---------52:38----------
your 13 year old to therapy twice a week


---------52:40----------
so they can entrain the right kind of


---------52:41----------
skills


---------52:42----------
is like very expensive


---------52:45----------
and cumbersome it's like you gotta get


---------52:47----------
in the car


---------52:49----------
drive them to their appointment they


---------52:50----------
have an hour-long appointment as a


---------52:52----------
parent you have to wait around


---------52:54----------
pick them up and bring them home


---------52:55----------
so it's like a two-hour investment twice


---------52:57----------
a week


---------52:58----------
which is like four hours and it's just


---------53:00----------
easier to medicate them


---------53:02----------
and it's like the medication works right


---------53:04----------
away


---------53:06----------
right the kids love it too you guys are


---------53:08----------
just bashing on the parents like the


---------53:09----------
kids love it they're like i take a pill


---------53:11----------
and suddenly my mind works like everyone


---------53:13----------
else's that's easy i don't want to sit


---------53:14----------
here and map out my week for an hour


---------53:16----------
twice a week it's torture


---------53:24----------
does that make sense


---------53:33----------
other questions


---------53:39----------
uh is that why adults get meds since


---------53:41----------
their brains are already developed it's


---------53:43----------
harder to train those skills no so sort


---------53:45----------
of so the reason that


---------53:47----------
adults get meds is because their brain


---------53:49----------
is naturally developed maybe as much as


---------53:51----------
it will but even then your frontal lobes


---------53:53----------
develop until the age of about 30 or 32


---------53:56----------
and i suspect that we're even delaying


---------53:58----------
the amount of time that it takes our


---------54:00----------
frontal lobes to mature so i think that


---------54:02----------
if you do a study in 10 years about when


---------54:04----------
the frontal lobes mature it'll like


---------54:06----------
they'll mature by 35 so i think that's


---------54:08----------
changing so our frontal lobes are


---------54:11----------
maturing slowly


---------54:13----------
than before or there's more maturation


---------54:16----------
to be had


---------54:17----------
the reason that adults get meds sure


---------54:19----------
you're not you just can't count on your


---------54:21----------
frontal lobes developing more if you're


---------54:22----------
like over 32


---------54:25----------
but they can train those skills in cbt


---------54:27----------
just as well as kids can argue yeah so


---------54:29----------
most of the studies are done in adults


---------54:31----------
so that's not the issue the issue is


---------54:33----------
once again if you're an adult it's just


---------54:34----------
easier right


---------54:39----------
uh what's the link to


---------54:40----------
uh


---------54:42----------
is there any link between giftedness and


---------54:43----------
adhd that's an excellent question and


---------54:46----------
one that we're actively researching


---------54:47----------
right now so we do a lot of different


---------54:49----------
research here at hg and we're actually


---------54:51----------
looking into that question so we've


---------54:53----------
noticed that there's a lot of people in


---------54:55----------
our community who are gifted kids


---------54:57----------
and there are a lot of people in our


---------54:58----------
community who have adhd so is there an


---------55:00----------
overlap it's something we're actively


---------55:02----------
investigating


---------55:04----------
how do i confirm if i have adhd or not


---------55:07----------
you go get a professional evaluation so


---------55:09----------
someone saying


---------55:11----------
dr russell barkley makes the point that


---------55:13----------
medication for adhd is like providing a


---------55:15----------
wheelchair to someone with a mobility


---------55:17----------
issue i completely agree


---------55:19----------
and let's just look at that


---------55:21----------
statement more closely so providing a


---------55:24----------
wheelchair to someone with a mobility


---------55:26----------
issue


---------55:28----------
is like


---------55:30----------
more complicated than it seems so


---------55:32----------
depending on the mobility issue is this


---------55:34----------
person able to walk like if they've been


---------55:36----------
in a car accident and they need to go to


---------55:38----------
rehab and learn to walk again


---------55:41----------
or are they missing their legs


---------55:43----------
can they learn to use prostheses so much


---------55:46----------
like adhd is providing a wheelchair


---------55:49----------
sometimes you need a wheelchair and


---------55:51----------
sometimes that person will need the


---------55:52----------
wheelchair for the rest of their life


---------55:55----------
but there are populations of people that


---------55:57----------
we are sticking in wheelchairs and we're


---------55:59----------
never teaching them how to walk again


---------56:02----------
and so that's a problem because i think


---------56:03----------
much like mobility issues


---------56:05----------
there's a differential diagnosis for


---------56:07----------
what's causing your mobility issue and


---------56:10----------
there are different treatment options to


---------56:11----------
see that to address your mobility issue


---------56:14----------
it may be a prosthetic it may be a


---------56:16----------
wheelchair it may be that you can walk


---------56:18----------
without either


---------56:19----------
you just have to train it up the right


---------56:20----------
way


---------56:25----------
why do people say adhd is fake so you'd


---------56:27----------
you'd probably have to ask them first of


---------56:29----------
all but i'd say it has to do with a lot


---------56:31----------
of the misdiagnosis stuff that i talked


---------56:33----------
about earlier so adhd is oftentimes


---------56:36----------
perceived


---------56:38----------
as a different kind of problem like oh


---------56:40----------
this person is defiant or isn't


---------56:41----------
listening


---------56:42----------
the other reason that i think people say


---------56:44----------
adhd is fake is because they have a


---------56:46----------
neurotypical brain


---------56:48----------
and so like it's easy for them they take


---------56:50----------
it for granted that their mind is able


---------56:52----------
to focus and they cannot imagine a world


---------56:55----------
in which their mind just like gets


---------56:57----------
unplugged at random times or switches


---------56:59----------
the channel on you right so like imagine


---------57:02----------
that you're watching television


---------57:04----------
and you control what channel you're


---------57:06----------
watching and then like


---------57:09----------
imagine a different scenario where like


---------57:11----------
your channel randomly changes


---------57:13----------
if you've had a remote control your


---------57:15----------
entire life it can be very hard for you


---------57:17----------
to understand that like other people's


---------57:19----------
channels are just randomly changing and


---------57:20----------
they have no control over that


---------57:22----------
it's such a given in their life that


---------57:24----------
they have some degree of attentional


---------57:25----------
control


---------57:27----------
what are the downsides to meds there are


---------57:29----------
some downsides


---------57:31----------
it it's very kind of individualistic so


---------57:33----------
like remember that prescribing


---------57:35----------
medication is about a balance of


---------57:37----------
benefits versus hindrances


---------57:39----------
so i try to steer clear of medications


---------57:41----------
in general like so about 30 of people in


---------57:44----------
my practice have medication i have no


---------57:46----------
value judgment like i'm not saying that


---------57:48----------
you shouldn't be on medication i


---------57:49----------
prescribe this stuff after all


---------57:51----------
but i think that oftentimes like i was


---------57:53----------
saying with the wheelchair analogy that


---------57:55----------
medication will sometimes be a


---------57:57----------
substitute for some amount of like


---------57:59----------
growth or change


---------58:01----------
which sometimes people just don't have


---------58:02----------
the bandwidth for like i have a patient


---------58:04----------
for example who's got like you know two


---------58:07----------
teenagers and they just don't have the


---------58:09----------
time


---------58:10----------
to like


---------58:12----------
do yoga and like a juice cleanse


---------58:15----------
right so it's like just take your ssri


---------58:17----------
like don't worry about it like you can


---------58:19----------
take care of yourself like down the road


---------58:20----------
but right now you have like more


---------58:22----------
important things to worry about so so


---------58:24----------
medication is like useful because it is


---------58:26----------
easy right


---------58:29----------
so with adhd for example some of the


---------58:31----------
things that i get concerned about are is


---------58:33----------
the brain development but we don't


---------58:34----------
really know exactly how that how


---------58:36----------
stimulants affect brain development over


---------58:38----------
time


---------58:39----------
um it's not clear that it's really


---------58:40----------
harmful at all there are definitely


---------58:43----------
concerns for a lot of stimulant


---------58:44----------
medication with being underweight and


---------58:46----------
appetite suppression so remember when


---------58:48----------
you take a medication it gets dissolved


---------58:51----------
and distributed throughout your entire


---------58:52----------
body so medications will have effects in


---------58:55----------
many places besides your brain


---------58:57----------
and so one example of like stimulant


---------58:59----------
medication is that it suppresses


---------59:00----------
appetite so if you have a 13 year old


---------59:03----------
who is going undergoing a growth spurt


---------59:05----------
and normally they're consuming a high


---------59:07----------
amount of calories


---------59:08----------
and you give them like adhd medication


---------59:11----------
sometimes they won't feel as hungry how


---------59:13----------
will that affect their long-term growth


---------59:15----------
so it does appear that there are weight


---------59:16----------
changes that happen with adhd medication


---------59:18----------
which you have to be careful about


---------59:19----------
that's just one example so would you


---------59:21----------
recommend a forcefully extended tension


---------59:23----------
span it depends on where you are on the


---------59:26----------
spectrum so i'd recommend that you


---------59:28----------
should be in control of your attention


---------59:30----------
span and so if you tell your mind to do


---------59:32----------
something it should listen


---------59:34----------
so if i tell it hey it's time to stream


---------59:36----------
forget about dota it should listen it


---------59:38----------
can kick and scream a little bit like


---------59:39----------
mine did today but then it sort of gets


---------59:41----------
in gear


---------59:43----------
if you tell it hey it's time to study it


---------59:45----------
should sit and listen


---------59:47----------
that's what i'd recommend


---------59:52----------
how do you deal with an inferiority


---------59:54----------
complex caused by adhd so i don't know


---------59:56----------
if you've seen the


---------59:58----------
the


---------59:59----------
um adhd and depression lecture but i'd


---------60:02----------
start by watching that you can also


---------60:04----------
check out dr k's guide to depression so


---------60:06----------
for those of y'all that are dealing with


---------60:08----------
inferiority complexes


---------60:10----------
so the guide to depression has a lot of


---------60:12----------
stuff about some scars and like the way


---------60:14----------
that those complexes form which maybe we


---------60:16----------
can talk about today


---------60:18----------
but there's like more detail about how


---------60:19----------
to digest those dissolve those etc in


---------60:22----------
the guide


---------60:24----------
we'll talk about that today though


---------60:26----------
some scott is excellent


---------60:28----------
someone's doing their homework


---------60:35----------
okay shall we move on


---------60:39----------
so bro i'm dealing with every complex


---------60:41----------
and it ain't pretty like i get that


---------60:43----------
that's why in the guide we talk about


---------60:46----------
how to deal with all of the complexes so


---------60:48----------
this is something that i like about


---------60:49----------
eastern psychology more so than western


---------60:51----------
psychology so western psychology is


---------60:54----------
really good at like diagnosing the


---------60:56----------
content of the mind so i'll say like oh


---------60:58----------
this person has an ethical edible


---------61:00----------
complex this person has narcissistic


---------61:02----------
personality disorder this person you


---------61:04----------
know like has borderline personality


---------61:06----------
disorder this person is a sociopath or


---------61:09----------
psychopath


---------61:10----------
so they'll they're really good at like


---------61:13----------
describing the content of the person's


---------61:14----------
mind


---------61:15----------
but i think eastern psychology has a


---------61:18----------
better handle on the process of mind so


---------61:21----------
how fundamentally does a complex form


---------61:24----------
where do complexes come from


---------61:26----------
and how do we get rid of them and then


---------61:28----------
the particulars of it are like whatever


---------61:30----------
you want but that's why like we kind of


---------61:32----------
go into detail we'll talk about this


---------61:33----------
today i'll teach something about it


---------61:36----------
but if you guys are interested in this


---------61:37----------
that's why we have five of the common


---------61:39----------
some scars that lead to depression so


---------61:41----------
these are five complexes that people


---------61:43----------
experience that cause them to be


---------61:44----------
depressed one example is like i'm


---------61:47----------
hopeless therefore like there's no point


---------61:49----------
in doing anything it's almost almost


---------61:51----------
this nihilism doomer complex another


---------61:53----------
example is falling behind i've fallen


---------61:56----------
behind


---------61:56----------
therefore


---------61:59----------
you know


---------62:00----------
like


---------62:01----------
it's too late


---------62:02----------
so there are a lot of different things


---------62:04----------
that you can kind of examine


---------62:08----------
um so if you guys are interested in the


---------62:10----------
nature of how complexes form like


---------62:12----------
definitely check out the depression


---------62:14----------
guide


---------62:17----------
okay let's talk about


---------62:18----------
uh uh


---------62:20----------
how do i deal with micromanaging parents


---------62:22----------
and the consequences in my mid-20s we'll


---------62:25----------
talk about we'll do a holiday stream


---------62:27----------
about parents and micromanagement or


---------62:28----------
something let me think about that


---------62:30----------
so someone saying structure and


---------62:31----------
discipline are hard need tips so this is


---------62:34----------
why where i'd say


---------62:36----------
agreed structure and discipline are hard


---------62:37----------
but remember that you don't necessarily


---------62:39----------
have to


---------62:40----------
rely on structure and discipline right


---------62:42----------
you can rely on like inspiration and


---------62:44----------
environment


---------62:46----------
so what i'd say is if you guys have


---------62:47----------
difficulties here's like a quick


---------62:49----------
nutshell if you have difficulties with


---------62:51----------
structure and discipline and that's not


---------62:53----------
what you're good at just don't bother in


---------62:55----------
a weird way so all the discipline you


---------62:57----------
need is like set up a study group for


---------63:00----------
example and then like just make all the


---------63:02----------
discipline you need is not to study for


---------63:03----------
eight hours because if you're studying


---------63:05----------
by yourself


---------63:06----------
right like you


---------63:08----------
are going to


---------63:11----------
yeah


---------63:12----------
if you you're studying by yourself every


---------63:14----------
hour you have to make a check like a


---------63:15----------
willpower check and if you fail your


---------63:17----------
check you start playing a video game


---------63:19----------
but if you're studying with a group of


---------63:20----------
friends like you just have to make one


---------63:22----------
willpower check to get there and then


---------63:24----------
they will keep you involved


---------63:26----------
when i say inspire that's where your


---------63:28----------
company is very important if you're


---------63:29----------
around a bunch of people who are like


---------63:31----------
you know entrepreneurs like you will


---------63:33----------
naturally have a more entrepreneurial


---------63:35----------
bend if you're around a bunch of people


---------63:37----------
who are like game developers and like


---------63:39----------
there's a discord server for game


---------63:40----------
development and you hang out on that


---------63:42----------
discord instead of like a league of


---------63:44----------
legends discord


---------63:45----------
you're more likely to develop games in


---------63:47----------
one than the other right though all


---------63:48----------
discord is going to cause you to play


---------63:50----------
games the development discord server is


---------63:52----------
going to cause you to make games


---------63:54----------
uh what effect does weed have on adhd


---------63:56----------
not a good one


---------64:00----------
in essence


---------64:01----------
all right so like like weed is like not


---------64:04----------
a very good drug


---------64:06----------
especially if you have a developing


---------64:08----------
brain like if you want to get if you


---------64:09----------
want to become 35


---------64:11----------
you have your life established and then


---------64:13----------
you want to like use weed and it's legal


---------64:15----------
and stuff i'd say go for it


---------64:16----------
so i'd say that most


---------64:19----------
we'll do comparison we'll answer


---------64:21----------
questions for like 10 more minutes then


---------64:22----------
we'll do comparison okay


---------64:25----------
um so like cannabis is one of these why


---------64:28----------
does cannabis feel like it helps because


---------64:30----------
it does help certain things and it


---------64:32----------
screws you over in other ways


---------64:35----------
so like the reason that cannabis feels


---------64:36----------
like it helps is because it helps it


---------64:38----------
just also hurts


---------64:41----------
right so like here's the it's almost


---------64:43----------
just like the adhd medication in the


---------64:45----------
wheelchair analogy where let's say you


---------64:47----------
use cannabis for your anxiety like it


---------64:49----------
can help with your anxiety but then not


---------64:51----------
only will you potentially get rebound


---------64:53----------
anxiety which is when and so if you use


---------64:55----------
substances to regular treat anxiety and


---------64:57----------
you take the substance away you will


---------64:59----------
actually worsen your anxiety so you get


---------65:02----------
stuck in this cycle of being dependent


---------65:04----------
on the substance and that doesn't even


---------65:05----------
help anymore it's like caffeine where


---------65:07----------
your body develops a tolerance and then


---------65:09----------
there's no net positive you become


---------65:11----------
dependent on it to function


---------65:13----------
and then it's not actually helping your


---------65:15----------
anxiety it's just like you've developed


---------65:17----------
a tolerance


---------65:18----------
so weed is a problem because it is very


---------65:20----------
very effective at making your problems


---------65:23----------
go away


---------65:25----------
the problem is that it only makes it


---------65:27----------
makes you feel like your problems go


---------65:29----------
away it doesn't actually make your


---------65:30----------
problems go away


---------65:31----------
it makes your problems usually worse so


---------65:33----------
like people who drown themselves in


---------65:35----------
substances


---------65:36----------
well like oh like once i'm drunk like i


---------65:38----------
can forget all all of my cares but like


---------65:40----------
they're your cares for a reason right so


---------65:43----------
you can do that and you can delay the


---------65:45----------
clock by 24 hours but all the problems


---------65:47----------
are still going to be there


---------65:50----------
um and and this is where you know a lot


---------65:52----------
of people think that so that's the basic


---------65:54----------
problem with weed it also tends to mess


---------65:56----------
with your habit formation circuitry


---------65:58----------
so like the ability to form good habits


---------66:01----------
is more difficult while you're using


---------66:02----------
marijuana so there's a common


---------66:04----------
misconception that weed like causes iq


---------66:07----------
problems i don't think it causes iq


---------66:08----------
problems


---------66:09----------
what it does is far far more insidious


---------66:11----------
which is that it causes motivational


---------66:13----------
problems and habit formation problems


---------66:18----------
right that's why there's sort of this


---------66:19----------
idea of a pothead which is like someone


---------66:21----------
who sits around all day and does nothing


---------66:23----------
now chances are there's a little bit of


---------66:25----------
a reciprocal relationship there


---------66:27----------
that people who who sit around and do


---------66:30----------
nothing gravitate towards pot and pot


---------66:32----------
makes people want to sit around and do


---------66:34----------
nothing so it's not all the pot


---------66:37----------
the other general thing that you should


---------66:38----------
be careful about is like if you have a


---------66:40----------
developing brain and you add substances


---------66:42----------
to it how does that affect the


---------66:44----------
development of your brain the short


---------66:45----------
answer is we don't know


---------66:47----------
so i'd say like steer clear that stuff


---------66:49----------
especially if you're like a teenager or


---------66:51----------
even your earlier early 20s


---------67:04----------
um


---------67:06----------
so one person saying how do i deal with


---------67:08----------
the imposter syndrome of whether i might


---------67:09----------
actually have adhd or i'm just normal


---------67:12----------
and lazy especially since the waiting


---------67:14----------
list for formal assessment is so long


---------67:15----------
here so if you're stuck


---------67:18----------
between trying to figure out am i lazy


---------67:21----------
or do i have adhd really common problem


---------67:24----------
excellent question what do you do about


---------67:26----------
it and this is where it's kind of


---------67:27----------
interesting


---------67:28----------
but the short answer is it sort of


---------67:30----------
doesn't matter right so like i know it


---------67:33----------
sounds kind of weird but whether you


---------67:35----------
have a diagnostic reason for being the


---------67:37----------
way that you are or you are lazy


---------67:40----------
you still have the same shared problem


---------67:42----------
which is that you're unable to do things


---------67:44----------
that problem needs to be fixed whether


---------67:46----------
you have adhd or you're lazy like that's


---------67:48----------
sort of in a weird way it's almost


---------67:50----------
irrelevant it does become relevant


---------67:52----------
because adhd may open up


---------67:54----------
additional ways to fix it so i'm not


---------67:57----------
saying it's truly irrelevant but what


---------67:59----------
i'm saying is that the situation is what


---------68:01----------
it is


---------68:02----------
the adhd is just a label that you put


---------68:05----------
upon it right it may give you some


---------68:07----------
amount of tools may give you some amount


---------68:08----------
of options but this is where i'd say


---------68:11----------
that you know if there are tools to


---------68:12----------
organize yourself with adhd they may


---------68:15----------
help you even if you're lazy


---------68:18----------
so this is where you know your situation


---------68:20----------
is what it is


---------68:22----------
irrespective of what label someone will


---------68:24----------
give you


---------68:25----------
and so there are things that you can do


---------68:27----------
irrespective of what label you have


---------68:29----------
right so what is the nature and


---------68:30----------
experience of your inability to work


---------68:34----------
ask yourself that question that question


---------68:35----------
is the same whether you have adhd or


---------68:37----------
don't have adhd


---------68:39----------
and then you ask yourself okay so like


---------68:41----------
what is like what is it that makes it


---------68:42----------
hard for me to work is it is it i feel


---------68:45----------
unmotivated what does that mean


---------68:47----------
what does unmotivation mean like what


---------68:49----------
does that mean to feel unmotivated is it


---------68:52----------
that your mind is distracted is it that


---------68:54----------
you're afraid of the consequences is it


---------68:56----------
that when you start to work like you you


---------68:59----------
automatically compare yourself to other


---------69:00----------
people and you think there's no point in


---------69:02----------
studying because this person is going to


---------69:03----------
do a better job than i i am there are


---------69:06----------
all kinds of things that can impact your


---------69:08----------
motivation


---------69:09----------
and so you have to understand the nature


---------69:12----------
of your experience you're going to get


---------69:14----------
more answers studying yourself


---------69:17----------
than you will from like getting a


---------69:19----------
particular label and finding external


---------69:21----------
answers


---------69:22----------
and that may sound weird you're like but


---------69:24----------
wait if i have adhd doesn't that mean


---------69:26----------
that there are all these solutions out


---------69:27----------
there


---------69:29----------
news flash is someone who treats people


---------69:30----------
with adhd they're all on the struggle


---------69:32----------
bus anyway it certainly can help and


---------69:35----------
there can be transformative


---------69:37----------
uh you know interventions that you can


---------69:38----------
do for adhd i'm not downplaying those


---------69:41----------
but i'd say like 70 of people that i


---------69:43----------
diagnosed with adhd still have to go


---------69:45----------
through the process of like


---------69:46----------
self-discovering and figuring out what


---------69:48----------
works for them and that's because adhd


---------69:50----------
isn't homogeneous it's heterogeneous


---------69:53----------
right so not everyone's adhd is the same


---------69:55----------
way


---------69:57----------
it's at the end of the day like that


---------69:58----------
personal exploration of what is holding


---------70:01----------
you back i think is worth way more than


---------70:04----------
getting a label that applies to a mass


---------70:06----------
of people for whom different things may


---------70:09----------
work


---------70:10----------
right because not all it's not like


---------70:11----------
there's one medication for adhd there's


---------70:13----------
like


---------70:14----------
half a dozen and why is that it's


---------70:16----------
because different people need different


---------70:17----------
things


---------70:18----------
so even the label does not fix your


---------70:20----------
problems and magically make them go away


---------70:30----------
so dr k i limited my my caffeine use to


---------70:33----------
one drink per day and now i'm having


---------70:35----------
trouble with motivation and focus i was


---------70:37----------
self-medicating with it


---------70:39----------
and i now realize it was helping me


---------70:41----------
function what else can i do cut out that


---------70:43----------
last cup of caffeine bro


---------70:45----------
or girl you're fatal dave so i assume


---------70:48----------
you're a dude but you never know


---------70:51----------
so this is where like just cut out the


---------70:53----------
rest of it get completely off of it


---------70:55----------
that's the right move either go to two


---------70:57----------
cups a day or no cups a day


---------71:00----------
so if you needed to so here's okay so


---------71:02----------
people are wondering why two or none


---------71:05----------
so caffeine has a half-life which is the


---------71:07----------
amount of time it takes to like


---------71:09----------
metabolize the caffeine okay


---------71:11----------
so when you drink a cup of coffee


---------71:13----------
there's a period of time where like you


---------71:15----------
have a high level of caffeine in which


---------71:18----------
it probably gives you like a work debuff


---------71:20----------
i mean sorry work buff but then over


---------71:23----------
time it like the buff declines and then


---------71:25----------
you may hit this point where it no


---------71:26----------
longer buffs you and then can actually


---------71:28----------
you can enter a period of caffeine


---------71:30----------
withdrawal which is a debuff


---------71:32----------
which is why people sometimes need


---------71:34----------
caffeine twice per day right so you like


---------71:36----------
you get that first buff and as your


---------71:38----------
level wanes you get that second


---------71:39----------
afternoon cup of masala chai and then


---------71:42----------
like that carries you like through the


---------71:43----------
rest of the day


---------71:44----------
so you got these like two peaks so for


---------71:47----------
some people one cup of coffee is enough


---------71:49----------
to where like they get a mild buff and


---------71:51----------
they kind of like their half-life is


---------71:53----------
such that it carries them through the


---------71:54----------
day without a problem but depending on


---------71:56----------
your individual metabolism if you're


---------71:58----------
like me and you're avata


---------72:00----------
one cup is never enough so it's either


---------72:02----------
two or bust


---------72:05----------
so that has to do with your individual


---------72:07----------
metabolism dr k do you think diagnosing


---------72:09----------
adhd during drug addiction is possible


---------72:11----------
yes i think it's possible but it's hard


---------72:14----------
so what i would do to so the people that


---------72:16----------
i've diagnosed with adhd who are on


---------72:18----------
drugs


---------72:20----------
are the ones that i usually make a


---------72:22----------
historic diagnosis so i won't send them


---------72:24----------
for neuropsych testing i'll ask them or


---------72:26----------
their parents like what was this person


---------72:28----------
like as a kid


---------72:29----------
and so you can sort of get enough from a


---------72:31----------
history to see oh this person probably


---------72:33----------
had a has adhd even though they're on


---------72:35----------
substances now and that becomes very


---------72:37----------
very important because oftentimes adhd


---------72:40----------
itself being under diagnosed


---------72:43----------
can keep someone from ever becoming


---------72:45----------
sober


---------72:46----------
so there's a whole video on this we did


---------72:48----------
a lecture on adhd and addiction where we


---------72:50----------
kind of explored how adhd is a


---------72:52----------
vulnerability for


---------72:54----------
for drug use


---------72:55----------
right so if you are impulsive because


---------72:57----------
you have adhd and your ability to like


---------73:01----------
restrain your impulses and act more


---------73:03----------
emotionally we go through a bunch of


---------73:04----------
neuroscience and stuff like that there


---------73:06----------
are a lot of reasons why having


---------73:07----------
untreated adhd makes sobriety very


---------73:09----------
difficult


---------73:11----------
and so interestingly enough sometimes


---------73:12----------
what i'll have to do is prescribe people


---------73:15----------
stimulants


---------73:16----------
get the adhd under control even while


---------73:18----------
they're like abusing marijuana or


---------73:19----------
opiates


---------73:21----------
and then like once the adhd gets under


---------73:23----------
control then they can actually like get


---------73:25----------
control of their substance use


---------73:27----------
so sometimes you have to do it like that


---------73:31----------
it's tricky


---------73:38----------
alcohol can be really bad too for adhd


---------73:41----------
absolutely like we said some people with


---------73:43----------
adhd use alcohol as like a cognitive


---------73:46----------
like


---------73:48----------
depressant right so it slows your mind


---------73:50----------
down so that you can like focus more


---------73:51----------
easily


---------73:52----------
so do i have adhd myself no


---------73:55----------
i don't think so i probably would have


---------73:57----------
gotten diagnosed if i was a kid in


---------73:59----------
today's school system


---------74:00----------
with adhd


---------74:03----------
so i have a high level of vata which i


---------74:05----------
think is quite adhd but i don't think


---------74:07----------
that my function is impaired that's


---------74:10----------
partially because of the way that i've


---------74:11----------
structured my environment


---------74:14----------
i am about that so i think if i was like


---------74:15----------
if i was if i was in school now i would


---------74:18----------
like there's a 50 chance i would get


---------74:19----------
diagnosed with adhd


---------74:22----------
based on like i could never study i


---------74:24----------
could never like if i was interested in


---------74:25----------
something i could pay attention to it if


---------74:27----------
not and i was just like kind of smart so


---------74:29----------
it wasn't that bad of a deal that big of


---------74:31----------
a deal


---------74:39----------
can adhd patients become top students at


---------74:42----------
competitive universities and scientific


---------74:44----------
fields absolutely


---------74:51----------
absolutely


---------74:52----------
i've had those students as my patients


---------75:00----------
do indian schools diagnose adhd a lot i


---------75:02----------
don't know


---------75:03----------
i don't think they they definitely don't


---------75:04----------
go by doshas


---------75:06----------
um it's interesting like in india like


---------75:08----------
the understanding of ayurveda is so like


---------75:10----------
divided like some people are into it and


---------75:12----------
some most people are not so they don't


---------75:14----------
understand like most indian people don't


---------75:16----------
even understand what dosha is


---------75:18----------
based on the people i've talked to


---------75:27----------
okay


---------75:28----------
let's move on


---------75:36----------
someone's asking about ox-carbazapine or


---------75:39----------
trilepto causing adhd or depression


---------75:42----------
that's definitely a question for your


---------75:44----------
provider


---------75:45----------
that's the kind of thing where like


---------75:46----------
ox-carpazzipine and trilaptal can


---------75:48----------
definitely cause depressive kind of


---------75:50----------
symptoms right but like that's


---------75:52----------
definitely something you should in


---------75:53----------
concentration problems sure


---------75:55----------
but that's the kind of discussion you


---------75:57----------
should be having with your provider


---------75:58----------
that's the specificity of like if you


---------76:00----------
guys really want to do a lecture on


---------76:01----------
pharmacology we can


---------76:04----------
but


---------76:05----------
you know because trileptil is a mood


---------76:07----------
stabilizer right so it's going to like


---------76:08----------
slow down your action potentials and


---------76:10----------
stuff which can have a side effect of


---------76:12----------
being depressed and can lead to


---------76:13----------
concentration problems but i would


---------76:15----------
expect trileptal to cause people to have


---------76:17----------
like slow concentration as opposed to


---------76:19----------
like


---------76:20----------
like rapid stuff


---------76:30----------
is it normal for a psychologist to ask


---------76:32----------
for blood work to be checked before they


---------76:34----------
diagnose you with adhd i don't know if


---------76:36----------
it's normal or not is it smart


---------76:38----------
absolutely


---------76:53----------
what do you look for in blood work so we


---------76:55----------
did we did a lecture on this


---------76:57----------
chat


---------76:58----------
there are like six


---------77:01----------
lab tests that everyone in chat should


---------77:03----------
get


---------77:05----------
you guys should get evaluated for six


---------77:07----------
conditions


---------77:08----------
because one out of two human beings will


---------77:10----------
have one of these problems


---------77:12----------
fifty percent of chat will have one of


---------77:14----------
these problems


---------77:15----------
anemia thyroid problems sleep apnea


---------77:18----------
uh what else


---------77:20----------
b12 deficiency may be vitamin d


---------77:22----------
deficiency what was the other one anemia


---------77:25----------
sleep apnea thyroid


---------77:28----------
vitamin d diabetes


---------77:31----------
thanks chad


---------77:32----------
lab tests for gamers yes thank you tech


---------77:34----------
teller


---------77:37----------
yup


---------77:38----------
vitamin d more than b


---------77:40----------
for us


---------77:41----------
chatars


---------77:58----------
you
