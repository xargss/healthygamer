---------00:00----------
when your thoughts are not reality


---------00:02----------
they're just thoughts


---------00:03----------
and the way that you create that


---------00:05----------
separation is through observation


---------00:07----------
not trying to fix it because fixing it


---------00:09----------
is getting into it


---------00:14----------
nice is it's connor yes nice to meet you


---------00:17----------
connor i'm all locker or dr k


---------00:20----------
whatever you prefer right i've watched a


---------00:21----------
lot of your stuff i know okay


---------00:23----------
um yeah so tell me man how how are you


---------00:26----------
doing today


---------00:27----------
i'm doing good i'm doing good i was a


---------00:29----------
little bit nervous


---------00:30----------
for a while i know i talked for a couple


---------00:32----------
months about coming on okay but i wanted


---------00:33----------
to wait until like i


---------00:35----------
knew i could like talk about something i


---------00:36----------
feel like could help a lot of people


---------00:38----------
awesome dude thank you very much


---------00:40----------
yeah because i have a pretty complex


---------00:41----------
case and a lot of history of like


---------00:43----------
going through different kinds of therapy


---------00:45----------
and different kinds of help trying to


---------00:46----------
figure out what's going on


---------00:48----------
okay um so i wanted to help provide some


---------00:50----------
insight on that for people hopefully


---------00:52----------
okay awesome dude that's that's actually


---------00:54----------
really awesome of you and i i think very


---------00:56----------
kind of you


---------00:57----------
um and to also think a little bit about


---------01:00----------
you know a lot of people feel like


---------01:02----------
they share problems with other people


---------01:03----------
but i think it's really thoughtful


---------01:06----------
to spend some time until you're ready


---------01:09----------
you know to sort of talk about things in


---------01:11----------
a productive way which is really cool


---------01:13----------
yeah i think something that i've learned


---------01:15----------
is that like


---------01:16----------
with all that i've dealt with is like


---------01:19----------
the way i see mental health issues is


---------01:21----------
it's really hard for me to put labels on


---------01:22----------
specific things like i might be


---------01:24----------
diagnosed with like depression


---------01:26----------
anxiety ocd all this stuff over the


---------01:27----------
years um


---------01:29----------
but i feel it just manifests in


---------01:30----------
different ways in different people it's


---------01:32----------
like even put a label on something is so


---------01:33----------
like


---------01:35----------
and then like be like for this issue you


---------01:37----------
need this medication or this kind of


---------01:39----------
treatment like


---------01:40----------
over the years i've gone beyond that and


---------01:43----------
thought like you know


---------01:44----------
it can work different for different


---------01:45----------
people that's awesome man i i'd love to


---------01:47----------
hear more about that


---------01:49----------
um do you want to just tell us a little


---------01:50----------
bit about what your journey has been


---------01:52----------
like or


---------01:53----------
i mean where where how do we start yeah


---------01:56----------
i mean um


---------01:58----------
so i mean i started streaming on twitch


---------02:00----------
uh in high school


---------02:02----------
um but that was after all this had


---------02:04----------
started so in like


---------02:06----------
seventh or eighth grade i was doing


---------02:07----------
great i was super social


---------02:09----------
super happy it was never down i was


---------02:13----------
i was always doing great and then around


---------02:15----------
like


---------02:16----------
end of middle school early high school i


---------02:19----------
had


---------02:20----------
began to develop really bad anxiety um


---------02:22----------
and like a lack of motivation


---------02:24----------
to go to school a lot of the time um


---------02:28----------
and i couldn't really pinpoint whether


---------02:29----------
that wasn't like social anxiety whether


---------02:31----------
that was depression what it was


---------02:34----------
but it was uh really difficult the time


---------02:35----------
to deal with um


---------02:37----------
and my family was concerned because i


---------02:39----------
wasn't going to class um


---------02:41----------
and as a couple questions about that


---------02:46----------
yeah what do you mean by anxiety


---------02:49----------
i would wake up in the morning and just


---------02:52----------
have like a pit in my stomach


---------02:54----------
about even getting up and getting out of


---------02:55----------
bed to go to school


---------02:57----------
and i couldn't exactly pinpoint why


---------02:59----------
there were it was felt like a million


---------03:00----------
reasons all at once


---------03:02----------
like my brain was moving so fast i


---------03:04----------
couldn't even uh


---------03:06----------
understand why i didn't want to go i


---------03:08----------
just knew i didn't okay


---------03:10----------
um that's something like as i've begun


---------03:13----------
to understand anxiety it's


---------03:14----------
uh i can pinpoint that feeling


---------03:17----------
and get what it is because at the time i


---------03:19----------
didn't really know


---------03:20----------
i could just kind of blame anything on


---------03:22----------
anxiety okay um


---------03:25----------
and then as i got through high school um


---------03:28----------
everything got progressively worse


---------03:29----------
pretty much throughout the years and


---------03:30----------
that's when i started streaming was to


---------03:32----------
kind of get an escape from it um when


---------03:35----------
you say


---------03:36----------
everything got worse what does that mean


---------03:38----------
what is that like i would


---------03:41----------
not be involved in as many social events


---------03:43----------
i would


---------03:44----------
be kind of to myself a lot a lot of my


---------03:46----------
friends would be concerned but i'd be


---------03:48----------
you know i'm fine i'm fine i'm okay um


---------03:50----------
did you feel okay


---------03:52----------
no not at all i felt terrible all the


---------03:54----------
time um i was very depressed


---------03:57----------
i was very anxious all the time what


---------03:59----------
does depressed mean


---------04:01----------
no motivation and just a complete lack


---------04:03----------
of feeling


---------04:04----------
and then if i do feel something it


---------04:06----------
pretty much always finds a way to


---------04:08----------
manifest itself with sadness


---------04:10----------
um it sounds rough man


---------04:13----------
no yeah it was it was really isolating


---------04:16----------
yeah so then um as i kept going through


---------04:21----------
high school um i did so many different


---------04:24----------
kinds of therapy


---------04:25----------
to try to get help different kinds of


---------04:26----------
medication i've probably been on 10


---------04:28----------
different


---------04:29----------
kinds of medication being an ssri at one


---------04:32----------
point we thought it might be


---------04:33----------
because of adhd so you know vivint stuff


---------04:36----------
like that or


---------04:37----------
anything to like a stimulant um did that


---------04:42----------
i did anxiety meds um


---------04:47----------
i had all that then i did different


---------04:48----------
therapies so uh


---------04:50----------
cbt which i still do i have a therapist


---------04:52----------
that i still work with here and there


---------04:53----------
mainly because i'm really close to them


---------04:56----------
um


---------04:57----------
i i don't really get too much out of it


---------04:59----------
anymore i think but


---------05:00----------
i still do enjoy it like that talking


---------05:02----------
time


---------05:04----------
um i did that i did exposure based


---------05:07----------
therapy last year


---------05:09----------
i've done dbt which i think is like


---------05:13----------
forget how to describe it that was like


---------05:16----------
some like clicking thing


---------05:18----------
you know what that is it's not my


---------05:21----------
understanding of dbt but


---------05:22----------
there is wait which one is hold on i


---------05:25----------
have a couple there's


---------05:26----------
i had a there was one oh emdr that's


---------05:29----------
what it is


---------05:30----------
yeah i did that and then dbt as well


---------05:35----------
um so i've gone through a couple


---------05:38----------
different things


---------05:39----------
just to try to figure stuff out over the


---------05:40----------
years and nothing ever really seemed to


---------05:42----------
click too much


---------05:44----------
um uh once i started getting


---------05:47----------
through high school um with


---------05:49----------
relationships specifically


---------05:51----------
i would be extremely anxious and


---------05:54----------
extremely overwhelmed with emotion


---------05:56----------
and relationships be it friends and


---------05:58----------
especially like romantic relationships


---------06:00----------
like i would um


---------06:04----------
just overthink everything it would


---------06:06----------
consume me every day


---------06:08----------
um i mean there was a time in high


---------06:10----------
school where like before i even could go


---------06:11----------
on a date


---------06:12----------
like i would have to like get there


---------06:14----------
early to throw up in the bathroom


---------06:15----------
before even i'd be so nervous and


---------06:18----------
anxious


---------06:19----------
um and a lot of that stems from a really


---------06:21----------
negative self-image i developed for


---------06:23----------
myself


---------06:24----------
over the years dealing with that um


---------06:30----------
the negative self-image developed from


---------06:32----------
that


---------06:34----------
or cause it's i it's kind of like what


---------06:37----------
came first the chicken or the egg i


---------06:39----------
guess i guess like


---------06:40----------
in um i remember like before i dealt


---------06:43----------
with all this i really was happy with


---------06:45----------
myself


---------06:45----------
and i wasn't down about all the time but


---------06:48----------
then as things got worse it felt like


---------06:50----------
any


---------06:51----------
negative situation in my life i would


---------06:53----------
view myself so negatively


---------06:55----------
and blame it on me um so especially with


---------06:58----------
relationships uh


---------07:00----------
it became any time i was interested in


---------07:03----------
somebody it became like a case of


---------07:04----------
limerence


---------07:07----------
so that is when um so there's like


---------07:10----------
romantic love but then there's like


---------07:12----------
limerence which is romantic love but


---------07:14----------
like you require


---------07:16----------
so much reassurance all the time because


---------07:18----------
i'm constantly questioning myself


---------07:20----------
and the relationship so i'm constantly


---------07:22----------
needing that reassurance for myself


---------07:25----------
and it would just become so destructive


---------07:26----------
in relationships


---------07:28----------
um because i just be like thinking


---------07:30----------
people hate me people are lying to me


---------07:31----------
and all this stuff and


---------07:32----------
it was very difficult um and so around


---------07:35----------
then that's when i got diagnosed with


---------07:37----------
ocd


---------07:39----------
and looking back on like my childhood it


---------07:42----------
made a lot more sense because


---------07:43----------
as a kid i would do a lot of ocd


---------07:45----------
tendencies


---------07:46----------
um and my mom's friend is a


---------07:49----------
is a what is it


---------07:53----------
like a children's behavioral therapist


---------07:56----------
and when i was a kid she thought i had


---------07:58----------
ocd as well just because of


---------07:59----------
how i would tap things when i leave and


---------08:01----------
i'd have freakout attacks over


---------08:03----------
the most mundane things connor how are


---------08:06----------
you feeling right now


---------08:08----------
right now um i'm good i'm just trying to


---------08:10----------
make sure i cover everything


---------08:12----------
okay so i want to pause for a second is


---------08:15----------
that okay


---------08:16----------
so i'm noticing like a slight tremor in


---------08:18----------
your voice


---------08:19----------
um i don't know if it's discord but i


---------08:21----------
kind of like notice you almost


---------08:23----------
um shaking a little bit are you oh i sh


---------08:25----------
yeah i


---------08:26----------
shake all the time regardless i don't


---------08:28----------
even know if that's


---------08:29----------
uh yeah i i've always been shaking for a


---------08:32----------
long time my chat will actually make fun


---------08:34----------
of me


---------08:35----------
and be like whenever i show my hands on


---------08:37----------
stream they'll say like earthquake


---------08:39----------
or something because like i'm just


---------08:41----------
always shaking


---------08:42----------
okay um well i it was my discrete


---------08:44----------
impression that you were not doing that


---------08:46----------
at the beginning of our call


---------08:47----------
so i don't know if it just fluctuates


---------08:49----------
with time or it might just be because


---------08:51----------
i'm really


---------08:52----------
thinking deeply and trying to like dive


---------08:54----------
back into things that i don't usually


---------08:56----------
think about okay um because i kind of


---------08:59----------
suppress a lot of this


---------09:00----------
i think especially now i'm doing better


---------09:02----------
um okay


---------09:04----------
yeah sorry i derailed you i just wanted


---------09:06----------
to check no you're good you're good okay


---------09:07----------
i was i'm just trying to remember


---------09:09----------
everything and so you get the timeline


---------09:11----------
that someone close to your family uh


---------09:14----------
thought that you had ocd growing up


---------09:16----------
because you used to tap things


---------09:18----------
yeah that and just other like uh


---------09:22----------
behaviors that i can't totally remember


---------09:23----------
right now but it was when i was a kid


---------09:25----------
um so then uh after going through the


---------09:28----------
proper


---------09:29----------
channels i got diagnosed officially with


---------09:31----------
ocd specifically rscd


---------09:34----------
relationship-based ocd where it was it


---------09:36----------
doesn't really


---------09:38----------
it's not really as much physical as it


---------09:40----------
is social and mental


---------09:42----------
um you know reassurance different things


---------09:45----------
stuff like that


---------09:46----------
um that became a bit of an issue


---------09:51----------
and so then it was like i had so much


---------09:53----------
diagnose for me that i was like i don't


---------09:55----------
even know what to tackle like i was just


---------09:56----------
like sure


---------09:58----------
like what do i do like do i take a


---------09:59----------
medication for this do i tackle this


---------10:01----------
is there i know you talk a lot about


---------10:03----------
like uh root causes and like looking


---------10:05----------
back


---------10:06----------
so i was like well was there like a


---------10:07----------
trauma or something and i couldn't


---------10:09----------
pinpoint anything


---------10:11----------
um so yeah i did a lot over the years


---------10:15----------
um the most helpful thing was last year


---------10:18----------
when i did


---------10:20----------
uh exposure-based therapy i went to a


---------10:22----------
place in florida


---------10:23----------
for the summer got an apartment and


---------10:24----------
stayed over there


---------10:26----------
and got help for that over the summer


---------10:29----------
and that that was the most helpful thing


---------10:31----------
but it still didn't like fully


---------10:34----------
feel like fix my issues the way i wanted


---------10:36----------
like


---------10:37----------
because my biggest thing was i always


---------10:38----------
felt like i wasn't i felt like i wasn't


---------10:41----------
myself a lot


---------10:42----------
like when i stream and i was like behind


---------10:44----------
the computer


---------10:45----------
i felt like i was being me and i was


---------10:47----------
like this is


---------10:48----------
like i'm me again this was my escape and


---------10:51----------
then whenever i would go out


---------10:52----------
and like my escape from the constant


---------10:56----------
anxiety and the


---------10:57----------
social issues that i was facing and then


---------11:00----------
whenever i'd


---------11:01----------
go off stream i'd instantly kind of go


---------11:03----------
into like a shell again


---------11:04----------
and sort of fall back into anxiety or


---------11:07----------
depression or other things


---------11:09----------
um so that was originally why i started


---------11:12----------
is it was the only way i could really


---------11:14----------
get away from that


---------11:17----------
it's interesting because you use the


---------11:18----------
word escape but i'm not hearing


---------11:20----------
actually that it was an escape i'm


---------11:22----------
hearing that


---------11:24----------
your truest sense of reality is actually


---------11:27----------
when you're streaming


---------11:30----------
yeah yeah


---------11:33----------
it's interesting because people will


---------11:35----------
probably look at streaming in like i i


---------11:36----------
can imagine that mental health


---------11:38----------
professionals may call that an escape is


---------11:40----------
societally we sort of


---------11:41----------
you know call gaming and and streaming


---------11:44----------
and computers and all that kind of stuff


---------11:46----------
like escapes from real life but i think


---------11:48----------
actually what's really bizarre is that


---------11:50----------
sometimes we can be our truest selves


---------11:53----------
through the internet yeah and that's


---------11:55----------
when we don't have to worry about


---------11:57----------
judgment from other people based on what


---------11:59----------
we look like or what our ethnicity is or


---------12:02----------
what our sexuality is we can just be


---------12:04----------
ourselves


---------12:05----------
kind of interested in that that was i


---------12:08----------
had such a negative view of myself


---------12:10----------
um that to have that kind of


---------12:13----------
platform where i felt like there was no


---------12:15----------
preconceived notion of like what i


---------12:16----------
looked like


---------12:17----------
or who i was it was a much easier way to


---------12:20----------
tap into that side of myself


---------12:22----------
um so once i started doing that


---------12:25----------
that was always something i look forward


---------12:27----------
to each day so i don't know how i would


---------12:28----------
have gone through stuff without it


---------12:30----------
um and then


---------12:34----------
i guess the thing now is like


---------12:37----------
over the past year like i mean i used to


---------12:39----------
stream like maybe five to ten people


---------12:41----------
and then in the past year and a half


---------12:42----------
that's gone up to like two thousand


---------12:45----------
so it's it's just absolutely exploded


---------12:47----------
and now like i've got a crew out of this


---------12:49----------
i don't need


---------12:50----------
like i didn't know what i was gonna do


---------12:52----------
in college and now i'm like


---------12:53----------
focused on this and i'm really happy um


---------12:56----------
but now it becomes kind of


---------12:58----------
the voice in the back of my head is well


---------13:00----------
where would you be if that didn't happen


---------13:02----------
like i don't really know what i'd be


---------13:04----------
doing


---------13:05----------
um it almost is like well i'm feeling


---------13:08----------
better but is that because of the


---------13:09----------
circumstances around me


---------13:11----------
or is that because i'm actually better


---------13:14----------
it's one of those things that i've


---------13:15----------
struggled with lately sure


---------13:19----------
i can almost hear like some sense of


---------13:21----------
like fear there


---------13:23----------
yeah there is there's there's like if


---------13:26----------
all this


---------13:27----------
collapsed in a day like if suddenly i


---------13:29----------
couldn't strain anymore something


---------13:30----------
happened or


---------13:32----------
whatever like what would i do um


---------13:35----------
and would i would i go right back to


---------13:37----------
that dark spot i was in in high school


---------13:39----------
yeah it's kind of interesting because


---------13:41----------
you know when we start to feel better


---------13:43----------
and if you're thinking about like


---------13:45----------
circumstances like if i'm better because


---------13:48----------
i have more viewers the the really scary


---------13:52----------
part about that is doesn't really mean


---------13:53----------
you're better at all


---------13:54----------
it just means that you know there's some


---------13:56----------
circumstance in your life that's kind of


---------13:58----------
propping you up


---------13:59----------
and if someone takes that away they take


---------14:02----------
away all your progress


---------14:04----------
yeah i wouldn't say it was the viewer


---------14:06----------
account specifically it was more just


---------14:07----------
like


---------14:07----------
having a career out of it sure where


---------14:10----------
like where i


---------14:11----------
knew i didn't have to pursue college


---------14:13----------
immediately or stuff like that because i


---------14:14----------
went to college for


---------14:16----------
two semesters um once i got out of high


---------14:18----------
school i


---------14:19----------
the only reason i enrolled was because i


---------14:21----------
knew if i saw all my friends go off to


---------14:23----------
college


---------14:24----------
and i was doing nothing still and still


---------14:27----------
dealing with what i was dealing with i


---------14:28----------
would just be even more depressed yep so


---------14:30----------
it's like


---------14:30----------
okay i'm going to enroll and at least do


---------14:32----------
like two or three classes just to be a


---------14:34----------
part of something


---------14:35----------
to get my brain out there but i mean i


---------14:38----------
hated it like


---------14:39----------
it was still school for me and i could


---------14:41----------
not find motivation to do any work um


---------14:45----------
it just wasn't my my place conor can i


---------14:48----------
think for a second


---------14:49----------
are there other things other parts of


---------14:51----------
the story that you want to tell


---------14:53----------
um or is that a pretty good summary it's


---------14:56----------
a pretty good summary for the most part


---------14:57----------
i mean if something comes up later on i


---------14:58----------
can try to


---------14:59----------
sure so that that's why because i


---------15:01----------
thought it was a fantastic


---------15:03----------
summary um thank you and so i just want


---------15:05----------
to


---------15:06----------
pause for a second and think about all


---------15:07----------
the different directions we could take


---------15:09----------
this


---------15:10----------
all right


---------15:15----------
okay so i've got a couple of


---------15:18----------
uh options okay can you let me know what


---------15:21----------
you think would be helpful


---------15:23----------
so one thing that we could talk about is


---------15:25----------
just your experience


---------15:26----------
of like what it's like to be in mental


---------15:29----------
health treatment


---------15:30----------
it sounds to me like you've tried a lot


---------15:32----------
of stuff you've actually worked really


---------15:33----------
hard you've been on medications you've


---------15:35----------
tried all these different kinds of


---------15:35----------
therapy


---------15:36----------
you've gotten lots of different


---------15:37----------
diagnoses just what how can we sort of


---------15:40----------
like think about that and understand


---------15:41----------
that like


---------15:42----------
what's going on like what's helpful what


---------15:44----------
isn't helpful what's it been like to


---------15:46----------
get labeled with all these different


---------15:48----------
things


---------15:49----------
what's been useful about all this if


---------15:51----------
anything


---------15:52----------
um so we could sort of talk a little bit


---------15:54----------
more about mental health in your journey


---------15:56----------
through


---------15:57----------
diagnoses and things like that kind of


---------15:59----------
related to that we could try to


---------16:00----------
understand like what


---------16:01----------
ocd is and like sort of how it works and


---------16:04----------
how we understand ocd from a mental


---------16:06----------
health perspective


---------16:08----------
another thing that we could try to do is


---------16:10----------
sort of think a little bit about like


---------16:12----------
the root cause


---------16:13----------
right so you've tried lots of different


---------16:14----------
therapies and things like that and you


---------16:16----------
mentioned things like


---------16:17----------
viewing yourself negatively and your


---------16:19----------
mind sort of overthinking and


---------16:22----------
you're being consumed by your thoughts


---------16:24----------
um and we can try to really sort of


---------16:26----------
figure out like


---------16:27----------
as you mentioned there's something that


---------16:29----------
transcends


---------16:30----------
diagnosis right there's some kind of


---------16:32----------
like basic


---------16:34----------
suffering i'm just going to call it


---------16:36----------
suffering


---------16:38----------
but it may be like a way that you view


---------16:39----------
yourself or it may be uh


---------16:41----------
the way that your mind works which if


---------16:43----------
you talk to a half a dozen mental health


---------16:45----------
professionals they're gonna call it


---------16:46----------
different things


---------16:48----------
but for you the experience has always


---------16:50----------
been one thing


---------16:51----------
even though your diagnosis may have


---------16:53----------
changed from year to year it's not like


---------16:55----------
you randomly got a different like


---------16:57----------
you started with anxiety then you


---------16:58----------
randomly got depression one year later


---------17:00----------
and then randomly gone


---------17:01----------
rocd it's always been that one thing


---------17:05----------
so what is that thing and how can we


---------17:06----------
understand it


---------17:08----------
yeah another option yeah go ahead


---------17:12----------
i was going to say i like that one so


---------17:14----------
far because i feel like okay that's


---------17:15----------
something that would help me


---------17:16----------
okay so the other thing to think about


---------17:19----------
is that you know sometimes when we think


---------17:20----------
about fixing a problem


---------17:22----------
we can think about the root and we can


---------17:24----------
also think about


---------17:26----------
what's above ground so how we can sort


---------17:29----------
of think a little bit about how your


---------17:30----------
mind


---------17:31----------
functions in the present so what is the


---------17:34----------
nature


---------17:34----------
of your obsessional thoughts where do


---------17:36----------
obsessional thoughts come from why do


---------17:38----------
they come


---------17:38----------
why do they come when they do like sort


---------17:41----------
of almost like a


---------17:43----------
you know if we were to like open up your


---------17:45----------
mind in the here and now and look at


---------17:47----------
its function you know yeah that's


---------17:49----------
actually


---------17:50----------
that's something that i've been doing a


---------17:51----------
lot more lately having watched you


---------17:53----------
is uh think more presently yeah um


---------17:56----------
and like look into like not like i like


---------17:59----------
become a stoic but look into like


---------18:01----------
stoicism kind of


---------18:02----------
thoughts and uh philosophy and all that


---------18:06----------
which helped me so i think a lot of


---------18:08----------
times especially in


---------18:09----------
in psychiatry we kind of focus on the


---------18:11----------
past but i think from if you look at the


---------18:13----------
meditative approach which is a lot like


---------18:15----------
stoicism


---------18:17----------
you know your thoughts there is a rhyme


---------18:19----------
and reason to why


---------18:20----------
you have the thoughts that you do your


---------18:22----------
mind ultimately like case in point


---------18:24----------
you used to need to go to dates early


---------18:26----------
because you would need to vomit in the


---------18:27----------
bathroom ahead of time


---------18:28----------
and that certainly sounds awful but if


---------18:30----------
we stop and think about it there's


---------18:31----------
actually like a science behind that


---------18:33----------
there's a predictive response like you


---------18:35----------
know what's going to happen


---------18:36----------
and then you plan for it which tells us


---------18:39----------
that there's actually some


---------18:40----------
order to like what's going on in your


---------18:43----------
mind


---------18:44----------
even though it like really sucks and


---------18:46----------
there may be value and forget about like


---------18:48----------
where this comes from or if it's some


---------18:49----------
deep rooted problem or whatever


---------18:51----------
but just in that moment you can start to


---------18:53----------
come up with solutions for the here and


---------18:55----------
now without actually worrying about


---------18:57----------
where this all comes from yeah


---------19:00----------
so there's root cause there's in the


---------19:01----------
present and then the last thing that i


---------19:03----------
was kind of thinking about is like you


---------19:04----------
mentioned this term limerence


---------19:06----------
and and relationship rocd and so


---------19:10----------
i think maybe we could just talk a


---------19:11----------
little bit about what those terms mean


---------19:13----------
what the experience of those things are


---------19:16----------
um yeah and and so what would you like


---------19:18----------
to do


---------19:20----------
i think like those last three things


---------19:21----------
that you mentioned um


---------19:23----------
are all things that i'd like to tackle


---------19:24----------
and think i could get into okay the


---------19:27----------
last three points yeah okay so the first


---------19:29----------
two are things i feel like i


---------19:30----------
understand pretty well okay sure so


---------19:33----------
let's um


---------19:34----------
let's actually start with the last one


---------19:35----------
then so you so we can


---------19:37----------
everyone who's watching can also like


---------19:38----------
get a backdrop of what we're talking


---------19:40----------
about so


---------19:40----------
can you tell us what limerence or rocd


---------19:43----------
is


---------19:44----------
yeah so i mean the main thing is rocd


---------19:47----------
that is


---------19:48----------
um ocd that manifests itself in a


---------19:52----------
social context a lot of the time or at


---------19:53----------
least emotional


---------19:55----------
um like a lot of people that struggle


---------19:57----------
with ocd


---------19:59----------
view it as like oh i need things to be


---------20:01----------
in order or something


---------20:02----------
which for most people i've spoken to


---------20:04----------
that that have like more physical


---------20:06----------
uh issues with ocd they don't really


---------20:09----------
even have that a lot of times it's more


---------20:11----------
um contamination based or other things


---------20:15----------
uh like that but for me it's much more


---------20:20----------
on the i think it's kind of how ocd


---------20:23----------
combines with anxiety


---------20:24----------
um to create a


---------20:27----------
sorry it's hard to word but especially


---------20:30----------
with such a strange subject it's hard to


---------20:32----------
explain to people but


---------20:34----------
emotionally the reassurance that's


---------20:36----------
needed is


---------20:38----------
i can't really control that like i can't


---------20:41----------
act make my mind like think the way that


---------20:43----------
i know i should


---------20:45----------
yep that makes sense yep um


---------20:48----------
and so i'll deal with with feelings and


---------20:52----------
anxieties that i know for a fact are


---------20:54----------
like not


---------20:55----------
logical um but it doesn't change the


---------20:58----------
fact that they are completely


---------21:00----------
legitimate in my head and i can't get


---------21:01----------
past them okay


---------21:03----------
that's great that's a great uh


---------21:06----------
explanation


---------21:06----------
so i'm gonna just touch on something for


---------21:08----------
a second so


---------21:10----------
um you know if we listen to conor connor


---------21:12----------
saying that like it


---------21:13----------
a lot of people's perception of ocd is


---------21:16----------
actually what what we call


---------21:17----------
ocpd so there's obsessive-compulsive


---------21:20----------
disorder


---------21:21----------
and then there's obsessive-compulsive


---------21:23----------
personality disorder


---------21:25----------
so one is like when we think about a


---------21:27----------
personality disorder versus a


---------21:30----------
non-personality disorder i think about


---------21:33----------
ocd is something that affects you ocpd


---------21:37----------
is something that you are so


---------21:40----------
people who have ocpd or people that i'd


---------21:42----------
call control freaks


---------21:44----------
so they like want things highly


---------21:46----------
organized they want things done a


---------21:47----------
particular way


---------21:49----------
and if we listen to conor connor is


---------21:51----------
saying that i know the thoughts in my


---------21:53----------
hat


---------21:53----------
in my head are actually crazy but i


---------21:56----------
can't control them


---------21:58----------
right so a big difference between ocpd


---------22:00----------
and ocd


---------22:01----------
is whether you yourself think that your


---------22:04----------
thoughts are a problem


---------22:06----------
so people who are ocpd and one thing


---------22:09----------
things highly organized and are


---------22:10----------
controlled freaks


---------22:11----------
they don't think they have a problem


---------22:13----------
they think that everyone else has a


---------22:14----------
problem


---------22:15----------
that's something that we call ego


---------22:17----------
syntonic in psychiatry which means that


---------22:19----------
it's completely it fits with like your


---------22:21----------
perceptions


---------22:23----------
ocd is is very discreet because people


---------22:26----------
who have ocd


---------22:27----------
know that their thoughts are irrational


---------22:29----------
they just can't do anything about it


---------22:31----------
like you know factually that some of the


---------22:33----------
thoughts in your head are sort of false


---------22:35----------
and yet you are still controlled by your


---------22:38----------
thoughts


---------22:39----------
does that make sense and so the the


---------22:42----------
first thing that i kind of want to point


---------22:43----------
out


---------22:44----------
is that it implies that you and your


---------22:46----------
thoughts are different things


---------22:47----------
they're different entities does that


---------22:50----------
make sense


---------22:51----------
yes are you saying that you agree with


---------22:53----------
that


---------22:54----------
that i'm are you are you saying that


---------22:56----------
that is the truth or


---------22:58----------
yeah yeah i mean that's what i'm


---------22:59----------
perceiving from you yeah


---------23:01----------
is that an accurate perception right


---------23:02----------
because yes absolutely 100


---------23:04----------
so if we listen to conor connor saying


---------23:06----------
my thoughts i know they're factually


---------23:08----------
incorrect


---------23:09----------
and yet i can't do anything about them


---------23:11----------
they end up controlling me


---------23:13----------
i have to seek the reassurance so if we


---------23:16----------
just look at like


---------23:18----------
sentence structure it implies that you


---------23:21----------
are discreet from your thoughts


---------23:25----------
right they're not you which that in and


---------23:28----------
of itself i think is the first and most


---------23:30----------
important thing to realize


---------23:32----------
is that like you were separate from this


---------23:34----------
and the more that we can help you


---------23:37----------
house yourself in


---------23:41----------
your self the better your experience of


---------23:45----------
ocd will be


---------23:46----------
yes absolutely it's funny i like how you


---------23:48----------
ordered that because that's something


---------23:49----------
that like


---------23:50----------
the past few months i've been really


---------23:51----------
like working on my own to like


---------23:54----------
look into different things i've been


---------23:55----------
looking at a lot of your talks and stuff


---------23:57----------
and


---------23:58----------
being really introspective and that's


---------23:59----------
something that's really


---------24:01----------
like worked for me is kind of separating


---------24:04----------
those two things and realizing that i'm


---------24:05----------
not the thoughts


---------24:07----------
um it's helped more than most things


---------24:09----------
that i've learned over the years


---------24:11----------
great i'm thrilled to hear that so like


---------24:12----------
maybe we can help you further along


---------24:15----------
yeah um so


---------24:19----------
i just want to make sure so like is


---------24:22----------
did i know you understood but let me


---------24:25----------
just clarify like


---------24:26----------
so you know the self is different from


---------24:28----------
the thoughts


---------24:29----------
and it sounds like the more that you've


---------24:31----------
come to appreciate that


---------24:33----------
in some ways maybe things have gotten a


---------24:34----------
little bit better and we can talk more


---------24:36----------
about that


---------24:36----------
is that fair is that true for everybody


---------24:39----------
or is that something that only i deal


---------24:41----------
with okay


---------24:42----------
nope that's true for everyone so i think


---------24:44----------
the the


---------24:45----------
the gift and the curse for you


---------24:48----------
is that that separation a lot of people


---------24:51----------
never need to understand because their


---------24:55----------
thoughts


---------24:55----------
never beat the [ __ ] out of them the way


---------24:57----------
that your thoughts beat the [ __ ] out of


---------24:59----------
you right


---------25:00----------
and so a lot of people like our thoughts


---------25:02----------
are more on the same team


---------25:04----------
with us whereas some people's thoughts


---------25:06----------
if we think about people who are like


---------25:08----------
depressed and especially like really


---------25:09----------
self-critical


---------25:11----------
right so some people go around and they


---------25:12----------
beat themselves up like you mentioned


---------25:13----------
that you view yourself negatively in


---------25:15----------
social situations


---------25:16----------
so it's almost like your thoughts are


---------25:18----------
attacking you


---------25:20----------
right so then it becomes a circle of


---------25:23----------
my thoughts are attacking me i end up


---------25:25----------
behaving in a way that i'm not happy


---------25:26----------
with


---------25:27----------
like i'm more enclosed i'm not acting


---------25:29----------
like myself


---------25:30----------
which then makes things actually worse


---------25:32----------
and then i'm sad again


---------25:33----------
and it's just a circle of yep anxiety in


---------25:36----------
that regard


---------25:36----------
and and so so so let's just think


---------25:39----------
through that circle okay so you're a


---------25:42----------
piece of [ __ ]


---------25:44----------
right right and then you close yourself


---------25:46----------
off


---------25:49----------
and then what happens is you start to


---------25:52----------
panic


---------25:53----------
because as you see yourself closing


---------25:54----------
yourself off


---------25:56----------
you know that things are not going to go


---------25:58----------
well socially because you're doing


---------26:00----------
it's not just your thoughts anymore it's


---------26:02----------
like you're not talking when you should


---------26:03----------
be talking


---------26:05----------
you know yes becomes like a blankness


---------26:08----------
almost like i'm not even


---------26:10----------
like i can't even think about what to


---------26:12----------
say i'm just blank


---------26:13----------
yep and then but but the thing is the


---------26:15----------
self in you


---------26:16----------
recognizes that you're blank


---------26:20----------
and then as you recognize your blank you


---------26:22----------
realize like there's this horrible like


---------26:24----------
self-fulfilling prophecy that starts to


---------26:26----------
arise in your mind


---------26:28----------
oh no it's happening again right


---------26:32----------
absolutely yeah oh no it's happening and


---------26:34----------
then what happens


---------26:36----------
is it happens and then people ask you


---------26:38----------
hey connor do you want to go grab


---------26:40----------
dinner after we're done with class and


---------26:43----------
then your mind is blank


---------26:45----------
and you kind of look at them like this


---------26:49----------
and then they like okay man we'll catch


---------26:52----------
you later and then they leave


---------26:54----------
they can yeah something like that right


---------26:57----------
and then what happens


---------26:58----------
is you go back to i'm a piece of [ __ ]


---------27:00----------
except this time


---------27:02----------
it's not an irrational thought this


---------27:06----------
time it's true i am abusive


---------27:10----------
right this time you have evidence


---------27:14----------
like this time like you actually know


---------27:16----------
you just screwed it up again


---------27:18----------
and now we get to the cycle because now


---------27:21----------
that you're you're even more sure you're


---------27:23----------
a piece of crap


---------27:24----------
it's going to make closing yourself off


---------27:27----------
even worse


---------27:28----------
it's going to make the self-fulfilling


---------27:30----------
prophecy even worse


---------27:31----------
you're going to draw even more of a


---------27:33----------
blank


---------27:34----------
and then it happens again yeah


---------27:38----------
and then then you're even worse yep it's


---------27:41----------
that same circle in


---------27:43----------
so many different situations that same


---------27:46----------
process can you tell us just give us an


---------27:49----------
example of one more


---------27:51----------
like with limerence as we were talking


---------27:52----------
about like with romantic relationships


---------27:54----------
like


---------27:55----------
if things will be going fine and then


---------27:57----------
the next day like i'll wake up and be


---------27:59----------
like


---------27:59----------
i don't think that she likes me anymore


---------28:01----------
or something so then


---------28:03----------
you know i need to come up with some


---------28:04----------
excuse to text them something just so i


---------28:06----------
get a response


---------28:07----------
so then i feel even though i know it's


---------28:09----------
completely irrational


---------28:11----------
i'm just it's just something my ocd like


---------28:14----------
requires from me


---------28:15----------
okay i need this reassurance and then


---------28:18----------
i'll do that and then i maybe won't get


---------28:20----------
a response or something


---------28:21----------
and then immediately overthinking


---------28:23----------
everything like oh my god


---------28:24----------
no response this is the worst thing in


---------28:26----------
the world um


---------28:28----------
and i'll collapse on myself then the


---------28:29----------
whole day be completely depressed unable


---------28:31----------
to do anything just


---------28:32----------
shut down okay yeah


---------28:35----------
okay so i i didn't mean to laugh but i i


---------28:38----------
think


---------28:39----------
we're gonna make some progress today and


---------28:41----------
and my hope is that


---------28:43----------
in a sense it'll be simpler but i think


---------28:45----------
it's going to be tough so let's let's go


---------28:47----------
through this play-by-play does that


---------28:48----------
sound okay


---------28:49----------
so now we're shifting to in the present


---------28:52----------
okay so we talked maybe maybe we could


---------28:53----------
talk


---------28:54----------
more about our ocd but so you wake up in


---------28:57----------
the morning so let's start there


---------28:59----------
you wake up in the morning how do you


---------29:00----------
feel


---------29:02----------
um i'm not sure it depends on the day i


---------29:06----------
guess but okay


---------29:07----------
good that's a good answer and then then


---------29:10----------
at some point you have this thought she


---------29:11----------
doesn't like me


---------29:13----------
yeah i mean i haven't really dealt with


---------29:15----------
this right now but it's something that i


---------29:16----------
have dealt with


---------29:17----------
sure yeah so then what happens you have


---------29:19----------
the thought


---------29:20----------
the thought pops into your head she


---------29:22----------
doesn't like me right


---------29:25----------
so then that becomes like i can't really


---------29:29----------
escape that


---------29:30----------
like i can't i can't myself does not go


---------29:33----------
well that's not the case because of x y


---------29:35----------
or z


---------29:36----------
it's this is the case and no matter what


---------29:39----------
i try to do to convince myself it feels


---------29:41----------
like that is the truth in my mind


---------29:43----------
okay so that thought becomes a fact


---------29:46----------
does that make sense yes so in that


---------29:49----------
moment


---------29:50----------
thinking and reality become one


---------29:55----------
yeah the other thing you say is that you


---------29:57----------
can't escape it but it sounds like you


---------30:00----------
try


---------30:01----------
i do yeah so the first thing that


---------30:03----------
happens is that you


---------30:04----------
your some part of your mind starts to


---------30:07----------
fight a war


---------30:08----------
with the other part of your mind there's


---------30:11----------
the


---------30:12----------
she doesn't like me and then tell me


---------30:14----------
what that fight looks like


---------30:17----------
um what do you tell yourself trying to


---------30:20----------
think so it'll be like


---------30:22----------
i'll feel i'll feel that urge or


---------30:24----------
whatever that


---------30:25----------
need for a reassurance and then i try to


---------30:28----------
remind myself of like past situations


---------30:30----------
where i've seeked


---------30:32----------
a kind of reassurance and it's made


---------30:34----------
things actually bad


---------30:36----------
i guess because um so i try to convince


---------30:38----------
myself that way


---------30:40----------
but then it just doesn't compute


---------30:43----------
i don't i just it's still somehow like i


---------30:46----------
might for a half a second almost it


---------30:47----------
feels like because my brain's moving so


---------30:49----------
fast


---------30:50----------
like half a second i might feel like


---------30:52----------
okay i'm good and then


---------30:53----------
immediately the intrusive thoughts are


---------30:55----------
back in and eventually it feels like i


---------30:57----------
give in every time


---------30:59----------
okay you give in yeah


---------31:02----------
no my dude you get exhausted yeah


---------31:05----------
that is a better way to describe it


---------31:06----------
right so it's not that you give in


---------31:08----------
it's that you run out of gas like it's


---------31:11----------
like you try to fight so


---------31:12----------
so the uh and once again conor i think


---------31:14----------
there's a lot of valuable stuff


---------31:16----------
in your representation so you say that


---------31:17----------
there's an urge


---------31:19----------
for reassurance yes and then what fights


---------31:23----------
the urge for reassurance


---------31:25----------
is logic so then your mind


---------31:29----------
your thoughts you conor the self


---------31:33----------
directs your mind and says mind we have


---------31:36----------
this urge for reassurance


---------31:38----------
i know that that urge is false let us


---------31:41----------
come up with evidence


---------31:42----------
and tell the urge that you don't need to


---------31:45----------
belong here


---------31:46----------
yeah this is not true that she doesn't


---------31:48----------
like me is not a fact


---------31:50----------
and then you have this little war


---------31:51----------
between your logic and your urge


---------31:53----------
and you fight that war for a while but


---------31:55----------
then like the urge seems to


---------31:58----------
what happens to the urge as you try to


---------32:00----------
logic against it


---------32:03----------
um i try to like


---------32:07----------
well lately whenever i deal with


---------32:08----------
something like that um


---------32:10----------
i've been trying to like think of like


---------32:12----------
root causes or something


---------32:14----------
for why i need that so that's lately


---------32:16----------
whenever i do


---------32:17----------
[ __ ] like that it that's what kind of


---------32:19----------
becomes and


---------32:21----------
the only thing that i really go back to


---------32:22----------
is like a negative self-image


---------32:24----------
and so i'm like well i feel like i need


---------32:25----------
this reassurance because i feel like i'm


---------32:27----------
not


---------32:28----------
good enough or i'm not like i'm i don't


---------32:30----------
like myself about anybody else like me


---------32:32----------
something like that


---------32:33----------
yeah um so that becomes the circle


---------32:36----------
you're you're doing good


---------32:38----------
with that i think that's a step forward


---------32:40----------
let's actually before you started doing


---------32:41----------
that


---------32:42----------
what would happen um


---------32:45----------
so let me think what was the step before


---------32:48----------
so like when you try to argue with


---------32:50----------
yourself


---------32:51----------
like there's a part of you that has you


---------32:52----------
have the urge for reassurance then you


---------32:54----------
argue with yourself


---------32:55----------
what would happen when you argue with


---------32:56----------
yourself when i argued myself it would


---------32:59----------
feel like almost my thoughts would try


---------33:00----------
to argue with that back


---------33:02----------
yep so i'd be like i would search for


---------33:04----------
reasons to prove myself wrong


---------33:08----------
search for reasons to prove your logical


---------33:11----------
part wrong


---------33:11----------
yes to prove my logical self wrong so


---------33:14----------
literally like a fight in my brain


---------33:15----------
it feels like between two sides to like


---------33:17----------
prove each other wrong or right yep


---------33:19----------
and which side wins always the


---------33:22----------
overthinking


---------33:23----------
ocd the urge right so i'm going to ask


---------33:25----------
you kind of a weird question would you


---------33:27----------
say that the logical part of your brain


---------33:29----------
in a bizarre way actually


---------33:32----------
fuels the urge for reassurance


---------33:36----------
yes yeah that that yeah that's it's


---------33:39----------
weird right because


---------33:41----------
in your mind you're trying to shut it


---------33:42----------
down but actually what you're causing it


---------33:44----------
to do is grow


---------33:46----------
yeah that's actually one thing that one


---------33:47----------
of my doctors told me like a year ago


---------33:49----------
was like


---------33:50----------
the people that are like the most


---------33:52----------
introspective and she used the word


---------33:54----------
smart but like


---------33:56----------
just understanding their mind and really


---------33:58----------
try to like solve this


---------34:01----------
they almost struggle more because they


---------34:04----------
trust themselves


---------34:05----------
and understand themselves and so when


---------34:07----------
they have these distortions


---------34:09----------
like when i have these distortions it's


---------34:10----------
very tough for me to differentiate


---------34:12----------
between


---------34:13----------
what is fact and what is wrong because


---------34:16----------
it feels like i should be able to trust


---------34:17----------
myself yeah


---------34:20----------
i think that makes sense i would use


---------34:21----------
slightly different language but i think


---------34:24----------
the general principle that the more that


---------34:26----------
you argue with let's call them


---------34:27----------
ocd thoughts for lack of a better term


---------34:30----------
or the urge for reassurance


---------34:33----------
the stronger it gets


---------34:37----------
and then your logic eventually gets


---------34:39----------
spent and then you're left with the urge


---------34:41----------
for reassurance and then what do you do


---------34:44----------
what happens when the urge for


---------34:45----------
reassurance wins in a relationship


---------34:49----------
then i become like too clingy i'll be


---------34:52----------
too like i just i just i'm not acting


---------34:54----------
like myself


---------34:56----------
um who are you acting like


---------35:01----------
the ocd anxiety whatever like this


---------35:03----------
separate piece of me that i


---------35:05----------
don't like i don't enjoy seeing but it


---------35:07----------
manifests itself


---------35:08----------
um and the strange thing is that like


---------35:10----------
the same like


---------35:11----------
image that like i get of that feeling i


---------35:14----------
guess when i when i view that in


---------35:15----------
retrospect


---------35:17----------
is the same self-image that i put on


---------35:19----------
myself


---------35:20----------
anytime that like anything negative


---------35:22----------
happens if that makes sense


---------35:24----------
so like that view of myself doing that


---------35:30----------
how i view myself like that very often


---------35:32----------
even when i shouldn't i guess which i


---------35:34----------
think


---------35:35----------
that's a whole nother issue of itself


---------35:37----------
but it's something i've never known


---------35:39----------
it's not a whole other issue that's the


---------35:40----------
crux of it my dude


---------35:42----------
okay so so let's just here let's just


---------35:44----------
make sure we understand what you said


---------35:45----------
right


---------35:46----------
so when you get too clingy so there are


---------35:48----------
a couple of important points here the


---------35:49----------
first is that you say you're not


---------35:51----------
yourself and


---------35:52----------
and this goes back to the idea that like


---------35:54----------
conor is his true self when he's


---------35:56----------
streaming


---------35:57----------
right and that's when you're


---------35:58----------
unencumbered by your thoughts


---------36:00----------
you just get to be you and then you see


---------36:03----------
the urge for reassurance


---------36:05----------
transform you into this like


---------36:08----------
emotion sucking vampire like it's


---------36:12----------
not you you're like clingy and you're


---------36:14----------
hungry and you like need something from


---------36:16----------
someone else


---------36:17----------
you like suck the life like out of like


---------36:19----------
something


---------36:20----------
to sustain this part of you and then you


---------36:22----------
look at yourself there's some


---------36:23----------
part of true connor stuck in the corner


---------36:26----------
of your mind


---------36:27----------
that's like full of despair and rage


---------36:31----------
because you see yourself like losing to


---------36:33----------
this thing


---------36:35----------
and then you're not you're like this


---------36:36----------
isn't me but i don't know how to stop


---------36:39----------
right and when it first started like i i


---------36:42----------
didn't have that sense of self


---------36:44----------
and logic i guess so it was just like a


---------36:45----------
complete like roller coaster


---------36:48----------
but then ever since that like i have


---------36:50----------
realized that


---------36:51----------
now it is what you just described we're


---------36:53----------
like i'm just like


---------36:54----------
i feel like i'm just a passenger


---------36:56----------
watching this happen and


---------36:57----------
you know it's it's stressful and so you


---------37:01----------
said um


---------37:02----------
yeah so we'll get get to that okay so


---------37:05----------
i i don't know how i'm gonna not lose


---------37:07----------
that but um


---------37:08----------
so and then you said that you actually


---------37:10----------
notice that you feel the same way that


---------37:12----------
you do when


---------37:13----------
you sort of equated it to feeling


---------37:15----------
something else


---------37:16----------
negative so i don't have exactly to


---------37:17----------
describe it but it's something i've


---------37:19----------
thought about lately is that like


---------37:20----------
this same negative self-image of myself


---------37:23----------
that i'll get


---------37:24----------
in situations where i really shouldn't


---------37:27----------
be down on myself


---------37:29----------
is that same feeling i get looking at


---------37:31----------
that anxiety looking at that part of me


---------37:33----------
almost like i'm like i am be


---------37:37----------
i think part of my negative self-image


---------37:40----------
is


---------37:40----------
i've kind of placed this anxiety ocd


---------37:44----------
beast as my identity


---------37:46----------
in a lot of places um which i obviously


---------37:48----------
don't like


---------37:50----------
yeah so so then you have a negative you


---------37:52----------
become too clingy


---------37:54----------
you start to beat yourself up for being


---------37:57----------
clingy


---------37:59----------
sure and then the more that you beat


---------38:02----------
yourself up


---------38:04----------
then we sort of complete the cycle and


---------38:07----------
we reinforce


---------38:08----------
she doesn't like me because i am not


---------38:10----------
worth liking


---------38:12----------
right right and then once we get back


---------38:14----------
there the urge for reassurance arises


---------38:16----------
again


---------38:17----------
you become clingy again you view


---------38:20----------
yourself negatively


---------38:21----------
you view yourself as possibly pathetic


---------38:23----------
because you're so clinky


---------38:25----------
that's not who you want to be it's not


---------38:27----------
who you know you are


---------38:29----------
and then since you becoming something


---------38:31----------
that you know you're a


---------38:32----------
good person somewhere buried in there


---------38:34----------
but since as you move away from that


---------38:36----------
it becomes more and more likely that she


---------38:39----------
does not like you


---------38:41----------
and then so the cycle just repeats so


---------38:43----------
like you're right yeah and that's


---------38:45----------
that's just how it manifests in romantic


---------38:46----------
relationships yeah like it's a


---------38:48----------
completely different thing for each


---------38:49----------
situation in my life


---------38:51----------
yes but it's the same circle exactly


---------38:54----------
right so that's the


---------38:55----------
so here's the cool thing connor if it's


---------38:57----------
the same circle


---------38:59----------
if we can break the circle for one


---------39:01----------
dimension of your life we can break it


---------39:03----------
for all dimensions of your life


---------39:06----------
this is also what i think gets diet gets


---------39:09----------
you a thousand different diagnosis


---------39:11----------
because depending on the content of the


---------39:14----------
circle


---------39:15----------
someone will diagnose you with anxiety


---------39:17----------
yeah if the content of the


---------39:19----------
circle is different they'll diagnose you


---------39:21----------
with depression


---------39:23----------
and if the content of the circle


---------39:24----------
involves relationships


---------39:26----------
you get rocd right so what people are


---------39:29----------
doing is they're they're in this kind of


---------39:31----------
goes back to your earlier instinct that


---------39:33----------
there's something like at the root of


---------39:34----------
this


---------39:35----------
and just depending on the flavor of it


---------39:37----------
they'll give you a different diagnosis


---------39:39----------
oh this guy is beating himself up he


---------39:41----------
feels guilty


---------39:43----------
he has no motivation depression oh he's


---------39:46----------
worried about his future


---------39:47----------
he's worried that he won't have a career


---------39:49----------
he's worried worried worried


---------39:51----------
anxiety yeah oh yeah that makes a lot of


---------39:54----------
sense cause like i believe like i've had


---------39:57----------
those things it's just that i've through


---------40:00----------
different people it's been like


---------40:02----------
the things that they target it almost


---------40:04----------
became


---------40:05----------
when i would see different doctors like


---------40:07----------
i would just be exhausted trying to


---------40:08----------
explain everything


---------40:10----------
because i felt like i wasn't


---------40:11----------
encompassing everything and that they


---------40:13----------
weren't getting the full


---------40:14----------
the full picture yeah and and i think


---------40:16----------
what you were giving them


---------40:17----------
is what in a sense they're looking for


---------40:19----------
because this is how we do psychiatrist


---------40:21----------
we get trained


---------40:22----------
to like bucket people because that's how


---------40:24----------
western medicine works okay you're ill


---------40:27----------
is it a physical illness or medic mental


---------40:29----------
illness okay we're gonna


---------40:30----------
bucket you into physical illness oh is


---------40:33----------
it a temporary illness or a chronic


---------40:35----------
illness oh okay it's a temporary


---------40:37----------
okay is it infectious or non-infectious


---------40:39----------
okay it's infectious


---------40:41----------
is it covid or not covid okay so we slot


---------40:44----------
people down that's how we're trained to


---------40:46----------
think


---------40:46----------
it's it's you i mean i'm not saying it's


---------40:48----------
bad it's just it has strengths and


---------40:50----------
weaknesses


---------40:51----------
for some people who do have sort of a


---------40:53----------
simple depression it works really well


---------40:55----------
but then i think sometimes i you know we


---------40:58----------
meet people like you


---------40:59----------
who have a bunch of i'm sure your chart


---------41:01----------
is filled with different diagnoses


---------41:03----------
oh yeah yeah and and so one of my


---------41:05----------
teachers once taught me that if anyone


---------41:07----------
has three diagnoses they're all wrong


---------41:11----------
yeah and and it's just different and


---------41:13----------
that's because we even know as


---------41:15----------
clinicians that we tend to like


---------41:17----------
label people with things but if you know


---------41:19----------
i don't think you have


---------41:20----------
three discrete disease prospects


---------41:22----------
depression anxiety and ocd


---------41:24----------
happening in your mind it does sound to


---------41:26----------
me like for what it's worth that maybe


---------41:28----------
you do have something like ocd that


---------41:29----------
seems to be the


---------41:30----------
the best fit but um at the end of the


---------41:33----------
day what we can see is that there is a


---------41:35----------
cycle


---------41:36----------
right and then the linchpin of the cycle


---------41:39----------
is what do you have any idea


---------41:41----------
um maybe like intrusive thoughts


---------41:45----------
something like that so uh okay so that's


---------41:49----------
definitely a key feature of


---------41:50----------
all of the cycles right the fact that


---------41:52----------
when you use the word intrusive that


---------41:54----------
means that you don't want to think about


---------41:56----------
it


---------41:57----------
and it rings your doorbell and is like


---------41:59----------
here i am


---------42:00----------
right right so i asked you how do you


---------42:02----------
feel when you wake up in the morning


---------42:04----------
you're like it depends on the day and


---------42:05----------
then the thought jumps in


---------42:07----------
she doesn't like that's the intrusion


---------42:09----------
it's the unwanted stranger showing up at


---------42:11----------
your door


---------42:12----------
like i'm having a good day and then


---------42:14----------
you're taking a piss and it's like oh


---------42:15----------
she doesn't like me


---------42:16----------
it's like [ __ ] now we go off on this


---------42:19----------
like you board this roller coaster and


---------42:20----------
then here we go


---------42:21----------
you're strapped in there's nothing you


---------42:23----------
can do to get off


---------42:26----------
so what what do you think let me just


---------42:29----------
it's


---------42:30----------
sort of a read my mind question what let


---------42:33----------
me ask


---------42:34----------
ask it this way what do you think are


---------42:35----------
the comments so if this cycle can


---------42:37----------
manifest as depression or anxiety


---------42:39----------
what is common about the cycle


---------42:43----------
um you go a little bit further with that


---------42:47----------
i'm not sure exactly yeah so like if we


---------42:48----------
think about it


---------42:50----------
i guess what i'm sort of hunting for


---------42:52----------
there are a couple of things one is that


---------42:53----------
i think as you mentioned that there's


---------42:55----------
this idea of a negative self-image that


---------42:57----------
seems to transcend


---------42:59----------
all of these individual cycles what do


---------43:02----------
you think about that


---------43:03----------
yes i yeah i agree i think that


---------43:06----------
that's something that i've come to


---------43:08----------
realize is that


---------43:10----------
at the at the core of it in a lot of


---------43:13----------
ways


---------43:13----------
it always comes back to how i view


---------43:15----------
myself okay


---------43:16----------
so then we get now we get to the


---------43:19----------
theoretically the root of it how do you


---------43:21----------
view yourself


---------43:23----------
[Music]


---------43:24----------
um yeah not not very well a lot of the


---------43:27----------
time


---------43:28----------
tell me about honor i'm really hard on


---------43:30----------
myself a lot


---------43:31----------
um anything that i do wrong or things


---------43:35----------
around me


---------43:35----------
i usually end up blaming myself or think


---------43:38----------
about what i could have done better


---------43:39----------
um physically i i cannot stand seeing


---------43:42----------
myself on camera or in the mirror or


---------43:44----------
anything


---------43:45----------
i just pretty much anything about me


---------43:47----------
like i'm


---------43:48----------
it's i'm very hard on myself um when you


---------43:51----------
see yourself in the mirror


---------43:53----------
what kind of thoughts do you have i


---------43:55----------
immediately get the same


---------43:56----------
anxious down that's the exact feeling


---------43:59----------
that i get when i make that


---------44:01----------
reassurance mistake is what i get when i


---------44:04----------
see myself in the mirror


---------44:05----------
okay um it's just i just get super down


---------44:10----------
on myself it doesn't mean that like i


---------44:11----------
hate myself or anything like that


---------44:12----------
like it's like i i like me the me that i


---------44:16----------
really know that i


---------44:16----------
am like when i'm streaming and stuff or


---------44:18----------
when i'm behaving how i


---------44:20----------
really feel and feel comfortable um


---------44:24----------
but otherwise i i don't otherwise i have


---------44:27----------
this super negative image of myself


---------44:30----------
okay can you tell us like so i'm looking


---------44:32----------
for more


---------44:33----------
color or flavor about super negative


---------44:36----------
image


---------44:36----------
can you tell me like literally what


---------44:38----------
thoughts you have when you look at


---------44:39----------
yourself in the mirror


---------44:41----------
like oh this guy is just


---------44:44----------
dumb annoying um he


---------44:47----------
like he's ugly he isn't funny he tries


---------44:50----------
too hard he's


---------44:53----------
just all this stuff all these really


---------44:54----------
intrusive negative thoughts about myself


---------44:56----------
okay um so the interesting thing i want


---------44:59----------
to point something out to you


---------45:01----------
so when i look at myself in the mirror


---------45:03----------
what i would expect is if i was going to


---------45:05----------
have negative images


---------45:06----------
and negative thoughts about myself i


---------45:08----------
would expect them to be physical in


---------45:10----------
nature does that make sense yeah and a


---------45:13----------
lot of times they are


---------45:14----------
um yeah but here's so much things that


---------45:16----------
like um yeah yeah go ahead


---------45:18----------
no you can keep going i was no i mean i


---------45:20----------
i think it's interesting because you


---------45:21----------
only said


---------45:22----------
the first thing that you said is he's


---------45:23----------
dumb


---------45:25----------
right yeah and i think i might have just


---------45:27----------
been beating around the bush i mean


---------45:28----------
there definitely is a physical element


---------45:30----------
there


---------45:30----------
like that i get really hard on myself


---------45:33----------
for i agree that there's a physical


---------45:34----------
element but what i think is really


---------45:36----------
really notable


---------45:37----------
is that there's a lot more than a


---------45:38----------
physical album


---------45:40----------
so the first thing that i i want to


---------45:42----------
point out to you is that


---------45:44----------
your criticisms of yourself do not


---------45:47----------
stem fundamentally from the outside


---------45:50----------
world


---------45:51----------
right because if they were purely


---------45:53----------
physical


---------45:55----------
then that would make sense in a weird


---------45:57----------
way but the fact that you can look at


---------45:59----------
yourself in the mirror and say this is a


---------46:01----------
guy that tries too hard like


---------46:02----------
how the [ __ ] if i showed you a thousand


---------46:06----------
pictures of people's faces how


---------46:07----------
on earth does anyone know who's a


---------46:09----------
tryhard and who isn't it just


---------46:11----------
completely does not compute so the first


---------46:13----------
thing that i want to point out to you is


---------46:15----------
a lot of what you believe about yourself


---------46:19----------
literally cannot come from outside you


---------46:26----------
yeah yeah okay


---------46:29----------
so then the question uh-huh no yeah i'm


---------46:32----------
i'm processing that it make me make


---------46:35----------
sense absolutely


---------46:36----------
right because like if you just looked at


---------46:37----------
yourself and you're like oh this guy's


---------46:38----------
ugly he's overweight


---------46:40----------
you know his hair is funny he's got a


---------46:42----------
big nose


---------46:43----------
like whatever needs to trim his eye a


---------46:46----------
sideburns


---------46:47----------
like if those are the kinds of thoughts


---------46:49----------
like that would sort of make sense


---------46:50----------
because it's coming from


---------46:51----------
your sense organs like it's you're


---------46:53----------
you're beating yourself up for your


---------46:54----------
appearance but you're beating yourself


---------46:56----------
up


---------46:57----------
when you see yourself in the mirror


---------46:58----------
because it evokes something about


---------47:00----------
you that is not


---------47:03----------
based on your appearance it's just like


---------47:05----------
you have this idea


---------47:07----------
of yourself as being crappy in some way


---------47:10----------
which i think you've started to realize


---------47:12----------
right so the other thing uh


---------47:15----------
okay so let me ask you this when did you


---------47:17----------
start to have that opinion


---------47:20----------
about yourself


---------47:25----------
i think it was around when everything


---------47:27----------
really started to take off like


---------47:28----------
probably around early high school um


---------47:31----------
what happened around early high school


---------47:35----------
i don't think that i'm constantly trying


---------47:38----------
to figure that out it doesn't really


---------47:39----------
feel like anything happened


---------47:41----------
okay it just kind of felt like as i as


---------47:44----------
the world around me was like people were


---------47:46----------
growing up becoming more mature and


---------47:47----------
stuff


---------47:47----------
like i almost felt like thrust into


---------47:50----------
position to grow up as well maybe


---------47:52----------
okay and didn't feel quite ready i don't


---------47:56----------
know


---------47:57----------
i'm trying to feel like you're weren't


---------48:00----------
as good as they were


---------48:02----------
yeah in a lot of ways um i've always


---------48:04----------
been


---------48:05----------
a little bit shorter than everybody so i


---------48:07----------
was like everybody else is going through


---------48:08----------
growth spurts and i'm you know i'm 5'5


---------48:10----------
and everybody is still growing and there


---------48:13----------
was stuff like that


---------48:14----------
there was a sense of


---------48:17----------
well all my friends are playing sports


---------48:19----------
and doing all this cool stuff and you


---------48:21----------
know


---------48:22----------
working out every day and i like playing


---------48:24----------
video games


---------48:25----------
um and i'm not really


---------48:28----------
doing much because this was before my


---------48:30----------
stream and all that so i was


---------48:32----------
pretty uh i felt i felt different from a


---------48:35----------
lot of people


---------48:38----------
and then like the people that shared


---------48:39----------
interests with me like that were


---------48:41----------
that did like video games or stuff like


---------48:43----------
that was not really a crowd that i like


---------48:45----------
to be around


---------48:46----------
uh for a variety of reasons um whether


---------48:49----------
it just didn't work together they didn't


---------48:52----------
like their humor


---------48:54----------
like i had a desire to be social and a


---------48:57----------
lot of these people were no social


---------48:58----------
um so i fit in with a different crowd


---------49:02----------
yeah so you know i think conor sometimes


---------49:05----------
when i ask like where did that start a


---------49:08----------
lot of times


---------49:11----------
people


---------49:15----------
think that it has to be something like


---------49:17----------
big and


---------49:18----------
dramatic you know like oh


---------49:22----------
like for my eight eight my 13th birthday


---------49:26----------
like my dad didn't show up


---------49:28----------
and he told me i was a piece of [ __ ] and


---------49:30----------
then like that shattered me like we try


---------49:32----------
to think about something traumatic but


---------49:33----------
in my experience


---------49:35----------
what happens is like you see how this is


---------49:36----------
a cycle and with each iteration of the


---------49:38----------
cycle


---------49:39----------
it grows yeah


---------49:42----------
so the really interesting thing is that


---------49:44----------
everyone sort of looks for some dramatic


---------49:46----------
source


---------49:47----------
myself included for like the origin of


---------49:50----------
your problems where if we really think


---------49:51----------
about it


---------49:52----------
if it grows with every cycle it can


---------49:53----------
start with a tiny seed


---------49:56----------
the most insignificant of experiences


---------49:59----------
and then you run through the cycle and


---------50:01----------
it levels up


---------50:03----------
and you run through the cycle and it


---------50:04----------
levels up


---------50:06----------
and then in high school it starts


---------50:07----------
leveling up every day


---------50:10----------
at the end of high school it's leveling


---------50:12----------
up twice a day


---------50:14----------
it paid for the xp buff and now it's


---------50:17----------
getting really good at grinding it's got


---------50:19----------
end game gear


---------50:21----------
you know it's got its farm patterns down


---------50:24----------
every relationship it grows and it grows


---------50:26----------
and it grows but it can start from a


---------50:28----------
tiny little seed


---------50:29----------
like i see you're saying like make the


---------50:31----------
video game analogy but that is actually


---------50:33----------
the case right for like any time i would


---------50:34----------
make progress like it would


---------50:37----------
it would almost become stronger in a


---------50:38----------
different way like i would


---------50:41----------
may if i got past it at all in a day


---------50:43----------
then it would


---------50:44----------
come back in a different way yep and


---------50:47----------
defeat me again yeah so and i think that


---------50:50----------
goes back to the urge okay so now


---------50:52----------
i'm gonna can i draw


---------50:56----------
yes okay


---------50:59----------
so we're gonna see if we can help you


---------51:01----------
out how are we doing so far connor any


---------51:02----------
questions


---------51:03----------
i'm good no i'm i'm i'm really getting


---------51:05----------
somewhere


---------51:06----------
okay i'm i'm hoping other people can


---------51:09----------
get help out of it too okay


---------51:14----------
this is definitely a new experience for


---------51:16----------
me because i don't usually go on camera


---------51:19----------
for the most part most of my streams are


---------51:20----------
no camera oh really so uh


---------51:22----------
doing that with talking about serious


---------51:24----------
stuff is definitely


---------51:26----------
new for me how are you feeling about all


---------51:28----------
that i'm a little i've been nervous and


---------51:30----------
i've been like


---------51:31----------
off but i'm it's it's a good kind of


---------51:35----------
nervous i guess because i did when i did


---------51:37----------
exposure-based therapy this was the


---------51:38----------
exact kind of thing that like


---------51:40----------
they encouraged okay hold on one second


---------51:44----------
okay so here's what i we're gonna start


---------51:46----------
with the cycle okay and i apologize for


---------51:48----------
my abysmal handwriting


---------51:50----------
all right


---------51:54----------
no okay so the cycle is


---------51:59----------
stop it she


---------52:02----------
doesn't like me


---------52:06----------
okay so this is interesting because then


---------52:08----------
you said there's an


---------52:09----------
urge for reassurance


---------52:14----------
do you want to place this under like


---------52:16----------
this specific um


---------52:18----------
kind of situation or because like she


---------52:20----------
doesn't like me is just like


---------52:21----------
an example right yeah that's okay yeah


---------52:26----------
unless you have an issue with it i'm


---------52:27----------
just using that because that's what i


---------52:28----------
don't have an issue i'm just trying to


---------52:29----------
think if there's like a better thing we


---------52:31----------
could call it so i could try to like


---------52:32----------
apply it to more things than just


---------52:33----------
okay sure so let's call this the


---------52:35----------
intrusive thought how's that


---------52:37----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------52:40----------
okay and then what happens is logic


---------52:44----------
arises


---------52:46----------
and logic fights right


---------52:49----------
and logic is like i'm


---------52:52----------
a cool guy


---------52:55----------
yeah and then there's like a war


---------52:59----------
and then like the more you fight the


---------53:02----------
more this increases


---------53:04----------
and then eventually you run out of mana


---------53:10----------
and then you end up clinky


---------53:15----------
we good does that make sense then what


---------53:17----------
happens


---------53:18----------
is then there's um


---------53:21----------
think about how to do this


---------53:26----------
so then what happens is that you start


---------53:29----------
to become someone


---------53:32----------
start to become


---------53:36----------
that which


---------53:39----------
you loathe


---------53:42----------
and this i'm gonna call your negative


---------53:44----------
self-attitude


---------53:46----------
right so this is the transcendent part


---------53:51----------
right just like we're saying the


---------53:52----------
intrusive thought is like the part that


---------53:54----------
is not specific


---------53:55----------
this is also not specific this always


---------53:57----------
happens


---------54:00----------
and then you notice changes to your


---------54:01----------
behavior change


---------54:03----------
to behavior


---------54:06----------
and then self-fulfilling prophecy


---------54:16----------
and then we can go all the way back


---------54:20----------
to she doesn't like me make sense yes


---------54:23----------
yeah yeah and i'm i'm seeing how i can


---------54:25----------
apply that to


---------54:27----------
a different situation like different


---------54:28----------
situations as well absolutely


---------54:31----------
so like like for example like at the top


---------54:34----------
it could be like


---------54:35----------
if i'm gonna go hang out with a bunch of


---------54:36----------
my friends from high school that like


---------54:38----------
are here for thanksgiving


---------54:39----------
um then it would be like


---------54:42----------
well i don't want to not act i don't


---------54:46----------
want to


---------54:46----------
be quiet i don't want to not act like


---------54:48----------
myself i want to be me


---------54:49----------
yep um and then that


---------54:53----------
after that it kind of becomes i'm


---------54:54----------
overthinking trying to


---------54:57----------
be me almost yep and so then


---------55:00----------
yeah yep so let's look at something else


---------55:02----------
right so here's the other thing


---------55:04----------
what is the self-fulfilling prophecy do


---------55:06----------
to the negative self-attitude


---------55:10----------
it justifies it it makes it seem makes


---------55:13----------
it seem legitimate


---------55:14----------
plus right and then what happens


---------55:19----------
is so we're also going to call this


---------55:22----------
your ocd self and then there's your true


---------55:26----------
self


---------55:29----------
and what happens is like any time your


---------55:30----------
self negative self attitude increases


---------55:32----------
and the self-fulfilling prophecy


---------55:34----------
increases there's a fight between your


---------55:36----------
ocd self and your true self


---------55:38----------
this is you saying i'm not this way this


---------55:41----------
is not who i


---------55:42----------
am and the ocd self says [ __ ] you


---------55:46----------
this is exactly who i am and see right


---------55:48----------
see


---------55:49----------
and here's here's the proof look at what


---------55:51----------
just happened absolutely and then so


---------55:53----------
this


---------55:53----------
conflict ends up leading to hopelessness


---------56:00----------
we haven't used the word hopeless yet


---------56:02----------
but what do you think about that


---------56:04----------
yeah that's a great way to and how it's


---------56:07----------
felt over the years


---------56:08----------
especially at a lot of different moments


---------56:09----------
because like here's


---------56:11----------
here's conor in the corner of your mind


---------56:13----------
and he's fighting against this thing and


---------56:15----------
he's trying so


---------56:16----------
hard conor you've tried so hard you've


---------56:19----------
seen


---------56:19----------
so many doctors and done so many


---------56:21----------
different therapies and so many


---------56:22----------
different medications


---------56:24----------
yeah and this [ __ ] over here wins


---------56:27----------
every single time and so no wonder


---------56:30----------
you're hopeless


---------56:32----------
right so then the question becomes okay


---------56:34----------
so like what do we do about that


---------56:36----------
yeah like that negative self attitude


---------56:39----------
like that


---------56:40----------
like my true self looking at the


---------56:41----------
negative self attitude


---------56:43----------
like that feeling of myself is what i


---------56:46----------
see in the mirror


---------56:47----------
it's what i it's anything to do with me


---------56:50----------
that i feel i'm not in control over


---------56:52----------
is is that feeling and then that leads


---------56:55----------
that hopelessness again


---------56:57----------
in so many different situations yep so


---------57:00----------
this is the cool thing


---------57:01----------
connor i know it sounds weird that i


---------57:02----------
call it cool but like


---------57:05----------
in so many different situations so this


---------57:08----------
is what i want you to understand


---------57:09----------
it is the very reason that you feel


---------57:11----------
attacked on all sides


---------57:13----------
and you're struggling in so many


---------57:15----------
different places


---------57:17----------
it's all one thing which can feel


---------57:20----------
overwhelming


---------57:22----------
but it's almost like you know like the


---------57:24----------
the


---------57:25----------
one opening of the death star


---------57:28----------
because the cool thing is that since


---------57:29----------
this is all one complex in your mind


---------57:33----------
if you can pull the plug on one you'll


---------57:35----------
pull the plug on everything


---------57:38----------
so the very thing that makes you feel


---------57:40----------
overwhelmed


---------57:41----------
because it's happening in every single


---------57:42----------
place actually means that there's like


---------57:45----------
one


---------57:45----------
common vulnerable spot and if you can


---------57:48----------
make progress this entire thing is going


---------57:50----------
to come tumbling down around you


---------57:51----------
that makes me feel better if anything


---------57:53----------
because over the years it's felt like


---------57:54----------
it is so many different things that it's


---------57:56----------
almost impossible to tackle


---------57:58----------
exactly but the the very thing is that


---------58:00----------
feeling the more impossible it is to


---------58:02----------
tackle bizarrely the more possible it is


---------58:04----------
to tackle


---------58:05----------
because it's attacking you from so many


---------58:07----------
different things dude there may be


---------58:08----------
something wrong with you conor i don't


---------58:10----------
really know but


---------58:11----------
i i know there aren't that many things


---------58:12----------
wrong with you


---------58:14----------
thanks right it just doesn't make sense


---------58:18----------
like sure i'll give you this but it's


---------58:20----------
it's about intrusive thoughts it's about


---------58:21----------
urge for reassurance


---------58:23----------
it's about negative self-attitude and


---------58:25----------
self-fulfilling prophecies and cycles


---------58:28----------
and if we just if we change this we'll


---------58:31----------
give you a different diagnosis


---------58:33----------
that's all and it can feel like all


---------58:35----------
these different dimensions when friends


---------58:36----------
come over from thanksgiving


---------58:38----------
when i go on dates when i look at myself


---------58:39----------
in the mirror any time i stream anytime


---------58:40----------
i go to college any time i do this


---------58:42----------
anytime i do this it's one


---------58:43----------
thing and it comes down to this


---------58:47----------
okay so now i'm going to teach you a


---------58:48----------
couple of tricks


---------58:51----------
okay here's the first trick


---------58:54----------
okay question so far no that's


---------58:58----------
that that's a really good connection


---------59:00----------
because i'm just


---------59:02----------
seeing the cycle and so many different


---------59:04----------
things yeah like be it when i when i


---------59:06----------
would wake up they go to school and i


---------59:07----------
just wouldn't want to go


---------59:08----------
and i wouldn't really know why but it


---------59:10----------
would just be a cycle if you need to go


---------59:12----------
you have to do your schoolwork it's


---------59:13----------
going if you don't go to school you're


---------59:14----------
gonna have more work to do when you get


---------59:15----------
back and it's gonna be worse


---------59:17----------
and then just the cycle of well i don't


---------59:19----------
care i give up


---------59:20----------
i'm not going and then it piles on


---------59:23----------
yeah so yeah so i want to just talk


---------59:26----------
about that for a second


---------59:27----------
one of the worst things that we do to


---------59:29----------
ourself is when we know we need to do


---------59:31----------
something that's good for us


---------59:34----------
there's a whole special kind of


---------59:36----------
shittiness that we put ourselves in


---------59:38----------
when we don't do the thing that we know


---------59:40----------
we need to do


---------59:41----------
yeah that strengthens this guy


---------59:44----------
so much when you know every fiber of


---------59:47----------
your being


---------59:48----------
knows that you just gotta go to school


---------59:51----------
everything in your life would be better


---------59:52----------
if you go to school


---------59:54----------
and then when you don't do it the amount


---------59:57----------
of self-hatred


---------59:58----------
you buy yourself is immense


---------60:02----------
and this is the crazier thing we think


---------60:05----------
that the more important something is the


---------60:08----------
easier it becomes to do


---------60:10----------
but bizarrely the more important the


---------60:12----------
more of a no-brainer


---------60:14----------
it is to do something the more paralyzed


---------60:17----------
we feel


---------60:20----------
but we think it's the exact opposite and


---------60:21----------
then we judge ourselves for that


---------60:23----------
we're like there's no it's a no-brainer


---------60:25----------
i have to go to school it'll be easier


---------60:27----------
for me tomorrow


---------60:28----------
i like going to school i have fun once i


---------60:31----------
go there my friends are there


---------60:33----------
all of these different reasons and we


---------60:36----------
think that each of those reasons should


---------60:37----------
inspire us to action


---------60:40----------
but if we actually are scientific we


---------60:42----------
find that the more reasons there are for


---------60:44----------
us to do something


---------60:45----------
the more paralyzed we are and the more


---------60:48----------
reasons that we are to


---------60:49----------
that in order to do something the more


---------60:51----------
this negative self-attitude grows


---------60:54----------
and the more this grows the more it


---------60:56----------
holds us back in everything


---------60:58----------
so do you think that a root not as


---------61:02----------
specific like


---------61:02----------
not that it's one thing but something


---------61:04----------
that might have built it up over the


---------61:05----------
years


---------61:06----------
is that like i have no motivation to go


---------61:08----------
to school and i would build up that


---------61:10----------
negative self-attitude which then made


---------61:12----------
that more of a factor in other areas of


---------61:14----------
my life absolutely


---------61:18----------
yeah right and absolutely because now


---------61:21----------
all it takes it used to be school


---------61:23----------
that would bring up your negative


---------61:24----------
attitude now your negative self attitude


---------61:27----------
all it needs


---------61:28----------
is a [ __ ] mirror there's nothing in


---------61:32----------
the mirror


---------61:33----------
there's no consequence does that make


---------61:36----------
sense


---------61:37----------
right it's just a piece of glass


---------61:40----------
and you walk by and if we really look at


---------61:43----------
the truthfulness of what


---------61:44----------
there's nothing there's no nothing and


---------61:47----------
what you look in the mirror what you see


---------61:49----------
has nothing to do with the outside world


---------61:51----------
it comes all from you


---------61:53----------
there was a point where it used to be


---------61:55----------
with the outside world


---------61:56----------
like in school or maybe your first


---------61:58----------
girlfriend or whatever


---------61:59----------
but now this thing has gotten reinforced


---------62:02----------
so much it has a life of its own


---------62:04----------
it's become a whole different person


---------62:06----------
that lives inside you


---------62:08----------
and that's where the urge for


---------62:09----------
reassurance comes from


---------62:12----------
what do you think about that can you


---------62:15----------
illustrate that again really quick


---------62:17----------
yeah so the urge for reassurance is


---------62:19----------
because


---------62:20----------
you have a fundamentally negative view


---------62:22----------
of yourself


---------62:24----------
so i try to reassure myself that's not


---------62:26----------
the case yep


---------62:28----------
and then perfect right so true self is


---------62:31----------
where this comes from


---------62:32----------
urge for reassurance comes from here


---------62:37----------
what do you think about that yeah no i


---------62:39----------
mean that's that's a great way to


---------62:41----------
picture it because


---------62:42----------
i mean yeah here's the thing i've never


---------62:45----------
really been able to picture like i i do


---------62:46----------
this in my head like i'm a very


---------62:48----------
visual person like all my thoughts


---------62:50----------
almost like


---------62:51----------
visual if that makes sense so yeah when


---------62:54----------
i try to analyze this in my brain like i


---------62:55----------
come up with this


---------62:57----------
but you're putting it down on paper


---------62:59----------
makes it a lot


---------63:00----------
easier to comprehend and to digest good


---------63:04----------
that's what we're here for bro we're


---------63:06----------
just getting started buddy


---------63:08----------
okay so the other thing to let you know


---------63:10----------
is that this is


---------63:11----------
false fundamentally does that make sense


---------63:14----------
to you


---------63:16----------
it i believe you but


---------63:19----------
to but to my how much i've dealt with it


---------63:21----------
it doesn't because it feels like such a


---------63:22----------
fundamental part of how i think


---------63:24----------
yep yep so so it's a it's true in a


---------63:27----------
sense and it's false in another sense


---------63:29----------
but what i'm saying it's the urge is


---------63:31----------
true


---------63:32----------
but this attitude towards yourself


---------63:35----------
because you know this because you say


---------63:36----------
there are times where i know who my true


---------63:38----------
self is


---------63:40----------
and if this is based


---------63:44----------
[Music]


---------63:46----------
if this is related


---------63:50----------
and we know that this


---------63:53----------
is false okay


---------63:57----------
then then we know that like this can't


---------63:59----------
be true


---------64:02----------
does that make sense yes right because


---------64:06----------
we sort of know like you even said at


---------64:07----------
the very beginning if we talk about the


---------64:09----------
nature of ocd


---------64:10----------
it's being unable to


---------64:14----------
not believe things that you know are


---------64:16----------
false


---------64:17----------
you know the thoughts in your head are


---------64:18----------
wrong you just can't stop believing them


---------64:21----------
yeah right it's weird we like you


---------64:25----------
you know you shouldn't believe it but


---------64:26----------
you can't help it


---------64:28----------
yeah and then it gets to a point where


---------64:29----------
i've dealt with it for so long


---------64:31----------
that part of my like true like part of


---------64:34----------
me my


---------64:34----------
part of my logic has almost given up to


---------64:36----------
a point where i'm like


---------64:38----------
absolutely maybe maybe it is right yeah


---------64:40----------
like that's what i've dealt with


---------64:41----------
ah see maybe it is right there it is


---------64:45----------
what do we call that hopelessness


---------64:47----------
beautiful


---------64:49----------
and just like dealing with it for so


---------64:51----------
long over and over and over hold on hold


---------64:53----------
on


---------64:53----------
so now we're gonna tunnel down okay when


---------64:55----------
you say the word dealing with it


---------64:58----------
that's what this is


---------65:01----------
what do you think about that


---------65:05----------
yeah i mean it is it's that fight yeah


---------65:07----------
yep


---------65:09----------
right so it's the fight that leads to


---------65:12----------
the hopelessness


---------65:15----------
because you can't win against this


---------65:19----------
so what do you do any ideas


---------65:23----------
well if it's the fight that leads to it


---------65:27----------
then i imagine it's something to do with


---------65:29----------
not fighting


---------65:30----------
beautiful


---------65:33----------
right so this is in the east what we


---------65:35----------
call acceptance


---------65:38----------
did you ever try acceptance and


---------65:39----------
commitment therapy


---------65:41----------
act um i


---------65:45----------
i think it might have been part of my


---------65:46----------
exposure-based therapy yeah maybe


---------65:49----------
so this is going to sound kind of weird


---------65:52----------
but like imagine so what i want you to


---------65:54----------
do is like your ocd


---------65:56----------
self needs reassurance right


---------66:00----------
who does it need reassurance from


---------66:04----------
some factor that isn't myself incorrect


---------66:08----------
that's what you've believed right that's


---------66:10----------
what i mean yeah


---------66:11----------
right and just think about it what you


---------66:14----------
need


---------66:14----------
is for these two dudes to party up


---------66:20----------
because here's the thing at the end of


---------66:22----------
the day


---------66:23----------
the reason your self-attitude increases


---------66:25----------
is because you're beating yourself up


---------66:28----------
that's what this is


---------66:33----------
you say that again the reason that your


---------66:35----------
negative self-attitude is increasing is


---------66:37----------
because


---------66:38----------
you're beating yourself up because


---------66:40----------
there's reverses here


---------66:42----------
the urge for reassurance the logic is


---------66:44----------
like no no no bro don't feel that way


---------66:46----------
you're wrong


---------66:52----------
yeah this is the problem


---------66:55----------
this is the problem


---------66:58----------
because if you can reassure yourself


---------67:02----------
if instead of beating yourself up you


---------67:04----------
can reassure yourself if you can provide


---------67:06----------
comfort to yourself


---------67:08----------
then you don't need it from anyone else


---------67:12----------
yeah and i think bizarrely that's what


---------67:16----------
you started to do whether you realize it


---------67:18----------
or not


---------67:20----------
and what i mean by comfort is when you


---------67:22----------
start to


---------67:23----------
just notice things without reacting so i


---------67:26----------
don't know that you've gone as far as


---------67:27----------
providing comfort


---------67:29----------
what i think you've started to do at the


---------67:30----------
least is just let this thing be


---------67:33----------
without fighting it


---------67:36----------
yeah because you started to notice okay


---------67:39----------
my true self is over here my false self


---------67:41----------
is over here


---------67:42----------
so be it i'm gonna win some i'm gonna


---------67:45----------
lose some


---------67:47----------
yeah but when you say that you're not


---------67:54----------
fighting


---------67:57----------
yeah so are you saying that that's right


---------68:00----------
or wrong


---------68:03----------
how does it feel


---------68:06----------
um it kind of feels like i'm stuck in


---------68:08----------
limbo okay


---------68:10----------
so that's that's good because


---------68:14----------
stuck in limbo is the first step to


---------68:17----------
changing a downward spiral


---------68:19----------
okay right you gotta be neutral for a


---------68:22----------
while


---------68:23----------
and i think that's what i said i don't


---------68:24----------
think you've learned how to comfort


---------68:25----------
yourself


---------68:26----------
you've learned how to stop fighting


---------68:28----------
which if we think about it fighting like


---------68:29----------
we said


---------68:30----------
what does the logic do to the urge for


---------68:32----------
reassurance


---------68:36----------
um it's it's allowed to do that


---------68:40----------
it it gives me reassurance and like


---------68:43----------
i try to give myself reassurance and


---------68:45----------
what does it do


---------68:47----------
it counters it with the negative


---------68:50----------
self-attitude and


---------68:52----------
and so the logic the answer that i'm


---------68:54----------
looking for is we kind of talked about


---------68:55----------
this earlier but like


---------68:57----------
remember that the logic in a weird way


---------68:59----------
feeds your urge for reassurance


---------69:01----------
the more you fight against it the harder


---------69:04----------
it pushes back


---------69:05----------
so the fight between the negative


---------69:07----------
self-attitude and the true self


---------69:08----------
is almost the same as the urge


---------69:11----------
reassurance against the logic


---------69:13----------
you're damn right it is and and that's


---------69:15----------
why we have


---------69:16----------
these two arrows right


---------69:19----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------69:23----------
and then what happens is then you go um


---------69:25----------
after fighting this for a while you're


---------69:27----------
exhausted and then you just give in to


---------69:28----------
all this crap down here


---------69:31----------
yeah and so what i want you to think


---------69:34----------
about is like imagine like


---------69:35----------
like i don't know if you've ever


---------69:36----------
exercised with a punching bag


---------69:38----------
yeah but like you know the harder you


---------69:40----------
hit a punching bag the harder it swings


---------69:42----------
back


---------69:43----------
that's just the nature of it


---------69:46----------
and that's how your mind works so the


---------69:48----------
harder you push against


---------69:50----------
yourself in your mind the harder your


---------69:52----------
mind pushes back


---------69:54----------
every action has an equal and opposite


---------69:56----------
reaction


---------69:57----------
energy is neither created nor destroyed


---------70:00----------
if i take a neutron and i split


---------70:02----------
it i wind up with a proton and an


---------70:03----------
electron


---------70:05----------
this is like a universal principle


---------70:09----------
and so when people talk about acceptance


---------70:11----------
like if i hit


---------70:12----------
like a punching bag and the punching bag


---------70:14----------
swings back and smacks me


---------70:17----------
what can i do to like stop the punching


---------70:19----------
bag from smacking me


---------70:21----------
stop hitting it absolutely and even then


---------70:24----------
if you want if it's swinging wildly back


---------70:26----------
and forth because you've been hitting it


---------70:27----------
for a while


---------70:28----------
what do you need to do step away from it


---------70:32----------
step away for it or hug it


---------70:35----------
sure right when it hits you you wrap


---------70:38----------
your arms around it and go for the ride


---------70:40----------
baby


---------70:41----------
and you stay with it you accept it


---------70:45----------
you embrace it okay so what does that


---------70:48----------
mean in the context


---------70:49----------
because i'm getting lost in a bit of the


---------70:51----------
analogy you're


---------70:52----------
damn right buddy okay so good so now we


---------70:55----------
get to the practical


---------70:57----------
okay so what does that mean so


---------71:00----------
practically what that means is that


---------71:02----------
you're gonna have an urge so you're


---------71:03----------
gonna have a thought you're gonna have


---------71:04----------
an intrusive thought


---------71:05----------
we can't stop that yet agreed


---------71:08----------
that's the nature of intrusive thoughts


---------71:10----------
you can't control it


---------71:12----------
all you can control uh conor is your


---------71:16----------
reaction to what happens in your mind


---------71:18----------
you can't control your mind


---------71:20----------
does that make sense yeah i agree with


---------71:22----------
that so we can't stop this


---------71:25----------
we can't stop this


---------71:28----------
we can stop this


---------71:33----------
okay so what that means what i want you


---------71:35----------
to practically do


---------71:36----------
is like the next time you like look at


---------71:38----------
yourself in the mirror can you see


---------71:39----------
yourself on stream today


---------71:41----------
yeah okay so we're gonna do this like


---------71:43----------
meditation i guess we're gonna do it now


---------71:46----------
okay okay so hold on a second


---------71:50----------
i'm gonna stop the screen share okay


---------71:53----------
okay


---------71:54----------
so we're going to try right now i want


---------71:56----------
we're going to teach you how to do this


---------71:58----------
in this moment can't you see yourself


---------72:01----------
yeah so i want all you guys to kind of


---------72:03----------
try to do this if you can


---------72:05----------
but if you load yourself then this is


---------72:06----------
the practice for you


---------72:08----------
okay i want you to so what we're gonna


---------72:10----------
do is like i'm gonna ask you to look at


---------72:12----------
yourself in a second


---------72:13----------
and when you look at yourself i'm i want


---------72:15----------
you to notice


---------72:17----------
this like programming that starts up


---------72:20----------
you're gonna feel like all these


---------72:21----------
negative thoughts and then


---------72:23----------
what's going to happen is that a voice


---------72:25----------
automatically is going to come to your


---------72:27----------
defense


---------72:27----------
and that's going to be like no man that


---------72:29----------
stuff isn't true like khan is a great


---------72:31----------
guy


---------72:32----------
okay and then they're going to start to


---------72:34----------
war and you're gonna try


---------72:36----------
to suppress one don't do that


---------72:39----------
sit with both of those things and i want


---------72:42----------
you to be like referee between those two


---------72:43----------
things


---------72:44----------
and understand that conor is allowed and


---------72:47----------
has a good reason to feel the way that


---------72:49----------
he does


---------72:51----------
we don't want to teach you that we're


---------72:53----------
wrong you're wrong we want to teach you


---------72:55----------
that


---------72:56----------
you're right and it doesn't mean what


---------72:58----------
you think it means


---------73:01----------
right so like if i have a kid who like


---------73:03----------
you know they're


---------73:05----------
let's say they're like making a cupcake


---------73:09----------
and they mess up the icing i don't tell


---------73:12----------
the kid


---------73:13----------
yeah you messed up the ice you didn't


---------73:14----------
mess up the icing no no the icing is


---------73:16----------
fine


---------73:16----------
everything's is is great i tell them


---------73:20----------
yeah you screwed up the icing and it's


---------73:22----------
not the end of the world


---------73:25----------
what you need conor is for your true


---------73:27----------
self to reassure


---------73:28----------
your negative self it's not that your


---------73:31----------
negative self is wrong


---------73:32----------
it's just that all of the thoughts and


---------73:34----------
conclusions that your mind comes up with


---------73:38----------
about the premises which happen to be


---------73:41----------
true


---------73:42----------
that's what we need to let go so


---------73:45----------
what do you mean by that so the thoughts


---------73:47----------
that i'm


---------73:48----------
oh my my thoughts must feel like


---------73:50----------
conclusions if that makes sense


---------73:52----------
yeah so so that's what you need to tease


---------73:54----------
apart right so we'll see this in the


---------73:55----------
moment when i ask you to look at


---------73:57----------
yourself


---------73:58----------
but like you're going to look at


---------73:59----------
yourself and you're gonna say like okay


---------74:00----------
like my


---------74:02----------
face is right


---------74:05----------
whatever and then then what's gonna


---------74:07----------
happen is your mind is gonna


---------74:09----------
jump to a conclusion therefore no one


---------74:12----------
will ever love me


---------74:14----------
right and then what i want you to do is


---------74:16----------
almost be like an older brother to


---------74:18----------
yourself


---------74:19----------
and be like hey man like let's be honest


---------74:22----------
you're not the best looking guy on the


---------74:23----------
planet


---------74:25----------
and just because you're not the best


---------74:26----------
looking guy doesn't mean that you're


---------74:28----------
going to be alone for the rest of your


---------74:29----------
life


---------74:31----------
but i'm going to give you that you're


---------74:32----------
not the best looking guy on the planet


---------74:34----------
that's cool right we're not going to i'm


---------74:37----------
not going to argue with you against that


---------74:39----------
you can have that one i'll take the l


---------74:43----------
but can we just accept you anyway


---------74:47----------
can we say that i'm ugly and


---------74:51----------
like i'm actually a pretty cool guy can


---------74:53----------
the true self and negative self


---------74:56----------
that part of what you that you know you


---------74:59----------
are the part of you that looks at the


---------75:00----------
false self and says


---------75:02----------
that isn't me instead of the two y'all


---------75:04----------
fighting can both y'all coexist


---------75:08----------
i guess like part of me doesn't want to


---------75:09----------
like accept


---------75:11----------
that the negative thought is true yep


---------75:14----------
there's your problem because that's the


---------75:17----------
origin of


---------75:18----------
that's the origin of the the


---------75:21----------
fight because remember i don't want to i


---------75:24----------
don't want to look at myself in the


---------75:25----------
mirror and just be every time be like


---------75:26----------
yeah you're ugly


---------75:28----------
no no we're not we're not accepting that


---------75:30----------
you're ugly


---------75:32----------
per se so this is where remember when i


---------75:34----------
asked you


---------75:36----------
okay so i'm gonna switch back to this


---------75:38----------
for a second okay


---------75:40----------
okay remember when i asked you


---------75:45----------
is this false or true


---------75:49----------
do you remember that yes


---------75:52----------
the urge for reassurance is true


---------75:57----------
it's not that you're actually ugly


---------75:59----------
what's true


---------76:00----------
is that you feel ugly


---------76:03----------
okay and your true self can let your ocd


---------76:06----------
self feel that they're ugly


---------76:10----------
like hey man i get that you think you're


---------76:12----------
ugly


---------76:14----------
i'm not gonna try to convince you that


---------76:15----------
you're not but i understand that you


---------76:17----------
feel that way about yourself


---------76:19----------
okay okay does that make sense that


---------76:21----------
makes more sense yeah when you did the


---------76:23----------
big brother analogy i was like


---------76:25----------
i was viewing that as almost the the


---------76:28----------
objective truth i guess


---------76:29----------
no it's not about it's not about the


---------76:32----------
objective truth because like


---------76:33----------
this is the thing it's the search for


---------76:35----------
objective truth that is the source of


---------76:36----------
the conflict


---------76:38----------
because the ocd self says i'm


---------76:40----------
objectively true the true self says i'm


---------76:42----------
objectively true


---------76:43----------
and then they fight about it forget


---------76:44----------
about objective truth


---------76:49----------
what you're going to do is learn how to


---------76:51----------
accept yourself


---------76:52----------
even if you're wrong


---------76:55----------
okay it's not about right or wrong it's


---------76:58----------
about accepting both sides


---------77:00----------
yeah okay we're gonna try it and then


---------77:02----------
we'll see if this like works for you or


---------77:03----------
not okay so now can you see yourself can


---------77:05----------
you maximize your


---------77:07----------
i'll definitely try it off stream as


---------77:08----------
well okay sure i imagine in my own


---------77:11----------
like environment it'll be easier than


---------77:13----------
knowing i'm in front of people


---------77:14----------
but good so we want it we want it when


---------77:16----------
it's harder not when it's easier yeah


---------77:18----------
okay so just maximize your own image


---------77:21----------
okay


---------77:25----------
give me a window into your mind conor


---------77:27----------
what do you see so


---------77:28----------
immediately like i'm extremely critical


---------77:31----------
about like how my mouth moves how i see


---------77:33----------
myself


---------77:34----------
um i'm almost like looking at myself and


---------77:37----------
like seeing into my thoughts


---------77:39----------
negatively okay so close your eyes for a


---------77:41----------
second


---------77:42----------
and just watch all of that negativity


---------77:44----------
arise


---------77:47----------
okay so like all that stuff could be


---------77:48----------
true we're not here to find objective


---------77:50----------
truth


---------77:51----------
do you see your response to it


---------77:55----------
um it's kind of just there like i


---------77:58----------
like i'm like all those thoughts are


---------78:01----------
there and


---------78:03----------
observing them okay


---------78:06----------
so just watch them what happens to you


---------78:11----------
i just feel like uncomfortable i guess


---------78:13----------
okay good tell me what that discomfort


---------78:14----------
feels like


---------78:15----------
where do you it feels like it feels like


---------78:18----------
those thoughts


---------78:20----------
are becoming true to me okay so watch


---------78:22----------
them become truer and truer to you


---------78:25----------
what is it like for them to become true


---------78:31----------
um just kind of get more sad


---------78:35----------
and down i guess good okay so notice


---------78:38----------
those feelings now


---------78:41----------
that you feel sad that there's a part of


---------78:44----------
you that feels sad because it believes


---------78:46----------
this thing to be true


---------78:49----------
right and what do you want to do to the


---------78:51----------
part of you that feels sad because it's


---------78:53----------
like


---------78:54----------
destined to whatever um


---------78:58----------
i want to like fix it okay be happy


---------79:01----------
right that's what you have to let go my


---------79:03----------
friend


---------79:04----------
do you see that's your reaction so


---------79:06----------
there's this whole channel


---------79:08----------
i supposed and i'm looking there's this


---------79:11----------
whole channel of thoughts oh my mouth is


---------79:13----------
moving weird whatever


---------79:15----------
and then like those thoughts gel into


---------79:18----------
truth


---------79:18----------
and then they create a sense of sadness


---------79:21----------
and then along comes the true self no no


---------79:23----------
no


---------79:24----------
conor we shall not be sad we shall


---------79:27----------
triumph


---------79:28----------
and be victorious and live a life of


---------79:30----------
happiness


---------79:32----------
and what you're doing in that moment is


---------79:34----------
bullying


---------79:36----------
the negative self


---------79:39----------
you're telling it your feelings are


---------79:41----------
wrong


---------79:43----------
bad negative self that's not what we


---------79:45----------
want to believe


---------79:47----------
because there's a part of you that's


---------79:48----------
afraid that if you if you accept it and


---------79:51----------
you stop


---------79:51----------
fighting then what's gonna happen


---------79:55----------
that everybody else will look at me


---------79:58----------
weird and


---------79:59----------
nobody will like me because i'm not


---------80:02----------
making any effort to make myself


---------80:03----------
presentable or good in any way


---------80:05----------
okay so that too that's coming from the


---------80:07----------
negative self


---------80:08----------
do you see that those thoughts are


---------80:10----------
original from the negative self so now


---------80:11----------
what's happening


---------80:12----------
when you want to make yourself be happy


---------80:15----------
and not let yourself be sad you're doing


---------80:17----------
okay


---------80:18----------
okay so this is what happens is like


---------80:20----------
imagine i'm hitting the punching bag


---------80:22----------
and i hit the punching bag really hard


---------80:24----------
and it swings back at me really hard


---------80:26----------
what do i need to do


---------80:28----------
i need to hit it again to make it go


---------80:29----------
away right


---------80:31----------
and so when you try to chase after


---------80:33----------
happiness and you don't want to accept


---------80:35----------
the possibility of sadness


---------80:37----------
you hit back further and then it swings


---------80:40----------
back and you keep on doing that keep on


---------80:42----------
doing that until you run out of mana


---------80:44----------
and then it smacks you in the face and


---------80:45----------
then you lose


---------80:47----------
because it's your very own energy so you


---------80:49----------
don't want it okay so like


---------80:50----------
so you could be sad how do you feel


---------80:52----------
about that


---------80:57----------
sorry with my eyes closed my thoughts


---------80:59----------
move so fast it's hard to focus


---------81:01----------
okay so go ahead and open them then okay


---------81:04----------
so um yeah can you repeat that yeah


---------81:08----------
so um so you may be sad what do you


---------81:11----------
think about that


---------81:13----------
um


---------81:13----------
[Music]


---------81:17----------
it doesn't feel good okay um and it's


---------81:21----------
it's what it's what i said like there's


---------81:22----------
that instant desire to fix it


---------81:24----------
yep so that too i want you to notice


---------81:26----------
that desire to fix it that desire to fix


---------81:28----------
it actually doesn't come from the true


---------81:29----------
self


---------81:31----------
okay but notice that desire to fix it


---------81:34----------
and just let it be there


---------81:37----------
and now i want you to think about the


---------81:38----------
person that you are when you're


---------81:40----------
streaming who is that


---------81:43----------
does that person try to fix anything


---------81:48----------
not in the same way absolutely


---------81:54----------
right so it's not it's not self-critical


---------81:56----------
it's more


---------81:58----------
problem-solving if that makes sense yeah


---------82:00----------
how to describe it yep


---------82:01----------
i think it's very different there's a


---------82:04----------
difference between


---------82:06----------
trying to fix something and trying to


---------82:08----------
build something


---------82:10----------
i think your streaming self doesn't


---------82:12----------
think that anything is broken


---------82:13----------
you're just striving for more


---------82:17----------
right it's about effort and growth not


---------82:20----------
about


---------82:20----------
repair and security


---------82:24----------
it's offering the best of what you have


---------82:29----------
right and so when i'm not doing that i'm


---------82:31----------
i feel like i'm almost always in a state


---------82:33----------
of


---------82:35----------
trying to reassure myself and make


---------82:36----------
myself


---------82:38----------
feel justified i guess yep absolutely


---------82:41----------
right so now what you need to do is like


---------82:43----------
notice those two modes of operation


---------82:46----------
in the instinct now you have to be


---------82:48----------
really careful the instinct is going to


---------82:50----------
be let me adopt the streamer mode of


---------82:52----------
operation


---------82:54----------
yeah let me do things this way instead


---------82:56----------
of doing things that way


---------82:57----------
which is falling into the same [ __ ]


---------82:59----------
trap right because i've tried that


---------83:01----------
yep there we go it's the same trap


---------83:05----------
going to work just


---------83:09----------
let yourself sit in the sadness and


---------83:12----------
acknowledge for a moment that you're


---------83:13----------
allowed to be sad


---------83:14----------
you're allowed to be hopeless that


---------83:16----------
there's a part of you that wants very


---------83:18----------
hard


---------83:19----------
to take this suffering away from you


---------83:23----------
and it is when we try to protect


---------83:25----------
ourselves from the suffering that life


---------83:27----------
gives us


---------83:27----------
that we trap ourselves the most


---------83:31----------
right because like when i'm when i am


---------83:34----------
feeling good


---------83:35----------
like those thoughts aren't even a factor


---------83:39----------
if that makes so like during my


---------83:40----------
day-to-day my appearance and how other


---------83:42----------
people perceive me is a is a factor that


---------83:44----------
i'm constantly


---------83:45----------
at war with yup in this cycle but when


---------83:48----------
i'm


---------83:48----------
feeling my best that's not even a second


---------83:51----------
thought because i'm not on camera


---------83:53----------
uh i'm not i feel like i'm i'm separated


---------83:57----------
yep if that makes sense yeah from those


---------84:00----------
from what feels like realities


---------84:02----------
so that separation comes from


---------84:04----------
observation


---------84:09----------
so you can't be separate from something


---------84:11----------
any


---------84:12----------
anything that i observe must be separate


---------84:15----------
from me the seer in the scene


---------84:17----------
cannot be the same thing when i look at


---------84:20----------
myself in the mirror


---------84:21----------
what am i looking at am i looking at


---------84:23----------
myself


---------84:26----------
no you're looking at a reflection of


---------84:27----------
yourself beautiful


---------84:31----------
if you want to create separation connor


---------84:33----------
just


---------84:34----------
see it and the separation will be there


---------84:37----------
you have told me that for you to be free


---------84:40----------
of this thing


---------84:41----------
you need to be separate from it you


---------84:45----------
specified me by separate again separate


---------84:47----------
you tell me because you're the [ __ ]


---------84:48----------
one who said it


---------84:50----------
you said i'm trying to remember what i


---------84:51----------
just said it was good so go back and


---------84:53----------
watch the bot


---------84:54----------
but basically you were telling me that


---------84:55----------
when you're off camera


---------84:57----------
you're separate from these things these


---------84:59----------
thoughts don't even affect you they're


---------85:00----------
not a factor


---------85:02----------
right yeah right and so there there are


---------85:04----------
moments of time


---------85:06----------
where you have vairagya


---------85:09----------
detachment separation viagra for a


---------85:12----------
second


---------85:14----------
it's not viagra okay


---------85:17----------
that's the sanskrit word for detachment


---------85:19----------
when your thoughts are not reality


---------85:21----------
they're just thoughts


---------85:23----------
and the way that you create that


---------85:24----------
separation is through observation


---------85:26----------
not trying to fix it because fixing it


---------85:28----------
is getting into it


---------85:31----------
just watching it happen and when you


---------85:34----------
watch it because like


---------85:35----------
this is me and then like if i see it


---------85:38----------
like


---------85:39----------
it has to have distance


---------85:42----------
so when i ask you to stop and observe


---------85:45----------
the urge


---------85:46----------
and observe how you want to fix it it'll


---------85:49----------
naturally dwindle over time


---------85:53----------
okay and what you guys see what you're


---------85:55----------
saying what you found is a shortcut


---------85:59----------
to that dwindling process which was


---------86:01----------
streaming


---------86:02----------
and now we get to the idea of an escape


---------86:04----------
because when you're streaming you're


---------86:05----------
your true self


---------86:06----------
and how does that work that's because


---------86:08----------
you're free from all of these thoughts


---------86:10----------
i'm three i'm free from the physicality


---------86:12----------
i'm free from like the


---------86:14----------
fear of like actual consequence i guess


---------86:17----------
because it's easier to


---------86:19----------
feel separate when i'm in front of a


---------86:20----------
screen i guess even though there is


---------86:21----------
obviously more consequence now that i'm


---------86:23----------
it's my career


---------86:24----------
but like especially when i first started


---------86:26----------
like when i first started streaming like


---------86:28----------
it


---------86:29----------
felt like a complete disconnect yeah


---------86:32----------
and so now now here's the cool thing so


---------86:34----------
you i think that that's


---------86:35----------
true and at the same time you've found a


---------86:38----------
solution to this problem


---------86:41----------
that is not actually controlled by you


---------86:44----------
it's a circumstantial solution right and


---------86:47----------
that's right


---------86:49----------
that's why people call it an escape so


---------86:52----------
now what you need to do is


---------86:53----------
learn how to separate yourself in every


---------86:55----------
moment of every day


---------86:58----------
and then all of those cycles will start


---------87:00----------
to fall apart


---------87:01----------
same thing needs to happen for all of


---------87:02----------
them doesn't matter notice the intrusive


---------87:04----------
thought ah [ __ ] here we go again


---------87:07----------
it's like if you're terrified of a


---------87:09----------
roller coaster and you hate being on it


---------87:10----------
you might as well throw your hands up in


---------87:12----------
the air and scream and try to enjoy the


---------87:13----------
ride


---------87:15----------
that's what you need the intrusive


---------87:18----------
thought comes


---------87:19----------
the urge comes here i go trying to fix


---------87:21----------
it again


---------87:23----------
can i hold back from trying to fix it no


---------87:25----------
i can't


---------87:26----------
okay here we go there's me fighting


---------87:28----------
there's me fighting there's me fighting


---------87:30----------
ran out of mana oh there's that


---------87:32----------
clinginess oh man that clinginess comes


---------87:34----------
up


---------87:34----------
the sadness comes up the fear comes up


---------87:38----------
yeah and then oh here i go texting oh


---------87:41----------
[ __ ]


---------87:42----------
here i am judging myself for texting


---------87:45----------
sure


---------87:46----------
here i am seeing yeah the thing about


---------87:48----------
that is like even like


---------87:50----------
that cycle is so prevalent that like


---------87:52----------
even if i text something that almost


---------87:54----------
is like completely fair and like isn't


---------87:57----------
even


---------87:57----------
doesn't even come from a place of like


---------88:00----------
reassurance


---------88:01----------
immediately after i become self-critical


---------88:04----------
and that cycle starts well what if it


---------88:06----------
was what if


---------88:07----------
what if your thought what if you didn't


---------88:09----------
even realize that that was


---------88:11----------
a negative like a negative uh


---------88:14----------
reassurance seeking right so then what


---------88:16----------
you do is you


---------88:17----------
before you send the text message true


---------88:20----------
connor says


---------88:22----------
all right we're about to send this and


---------88:24----------
conor prepare yourself


---------88:27----------
you want to send this in this moment


---------88:28----------
because you think things are going to


---------88:29----------
get better


---------88:31----------
prepare yourself for the backlash


---------88:32----------
prepare yourself for cycle 2


---------88:34----------
you hit the text button there's the


---------88:37----------
intrusive thought


---------88:38----------
there we go again yeah


---------88:41----------
just like you said and watch it happen


---------88:43----------
to yourself


---------88:44----------
you know it's coming watch it happen let


---------88:47----------
it happen


---------88:48----------
if you feel like fighting fight but


---------88:50----------
fight with awareness


---------88:53----------
and i guarantee you conor whatever


---------88:54----------
you've been doing for the past couple of


---------88:56----------
months that's helped a little bit


---------88:58----------
you continue doing this mindful practice


---------89:02----------
this will start to dwindle away what did


---------89:05----------
you mean by fight with awareness


---------89:07----------
exactly because i thought i was trying


---------89:09----------
to not fight if you can't help


---------89:12----------
butt fight at least acknowledge that


---------89:16----------
you're fighting and that it's the wrong


---------89:18----------
thing to do


---------89:19----------
and let yourself do it okay


---------89:24----------
yeah because the more awareness you


---------89:26----------
create i'm not aware of anything what's


---------89:29----------
on my forehead i can't see


---------89:33----------
in order to see it needs to be over here


---------89:35----------
this is awareness


---------89:37----------
this is bringing something when you're


---------89:39----------
not awareness


---------89:41----------
is watching something from the outside


---------89:44----------
so the more that you become aware the


---------89:46----------
more separation you create


---------89:48----------
and then you become something called


---------89:50----------
detached


---------89:53----------
which is when when you when you say it


---------89:55----------
isn't a factor anymore


---------89:57----------
that is why so people like ask me like


---------90:00----------
don't you have sadness and all this kind


---------90:02----------
of [ __ ] do i have anxieties and all that


---------90:03----------
sort of stuff


---------90:04----------
sure i'm no different from any of you


---------90:06----------
guys the only difference


---------90:08----------
is that it's not a factor yeah


---------90:11----------
every time i yeah go ahead that's like a


---------90:14----------
kind of like that's sort of where i've


---------90:17----------
been


---------90:17----------
learning like where i've been at over


---------90:19----------
the past few months that i talked about


---------90:20----------
from listening to stuff with you like


---------90:22----------
in terms of like spiritual kind of


---------90:24----------
consciousness or


---------90:25----------
self versus thoughts like that's pretty


---------90:28----------
much what you're saying


---------90:29----------
and yep and so here's the cool thing


---------90:31----------
what has happened to your suffering


---------90:34----------
the more you have become aware that


---------90:37----------
there is a consciousness that is


---------90:38----------
separate from your thoughts


---------90:42----------
um it's become easier


---------90:46----------
i i've been able to observe


---------90:49----------
that the negative isn't necessarily


---------90:52----------
objective


---------90:53----------
exactly right it's become easier


---------90:56----------
so what i'm telling you is every moment


---------90:58----------
of awareness


---------91:00----------
is leveling up your consciousness and


---------91:02----------
the more your consciousness


---------91:04----------
levels up i kid you not this [ __ ] is op


---------91:07----------
conor


---------91:08----------
this is what buddha was talking about


---------91:09----------
when he was talking about enlightenment


---------91:12----------
it is when awareness becomes a hundred


---------91:14----------
percent all the time


---------91:16----------
and then suffering ceases to exist


---------91:19----------
sadness exists pain exists emotion


---------91:22----------
exists


---------91:23----------
hurt exists suffering does not


---------91:27----------
yeah um yeah that makes sense


---------91:32----------
it really does make sense


---------91:35----------
because i can i can see like areas where


---------91:39----------
that's just yeah absolutely


---------91:42----------
there we go man questions


---------91:47----------
um i can't really think of any questions


---------91:49----------
i


---------91:50----------
i think i'm just going to like re-watch


---------91:52----------
re-listen and try to like


---------91:55----------
apply is the main thing absolutely man


---------91:58----------
it's a slow road


---------91:59----------
so let me tell you one or two other


---------92:01----------
things how old are you connor i'm 21.


---------92:04----------
okay so not young


---------92:07----------
yet yeah i turned 21 two weeks ago okay


---------92:11----------
so let me tell you this journey is going


---------92:13----------
to take you a couple of years


---------92:15----------
it's going to get better over time


---------92:19----------
i don't know if you're ever truly going


---------92:21----------
to be quote unquote free for from this


---------92:23----------
but i do think you can get free on a


---------92:26----------
level that


---------92:27----------
will blow your mind i think part of it


---------92:30----------
is like here's what i've come to


---------92:31----------
understand is


---------92:32----------
even the search to get better


---------92:35----------
is an attachment


---------92:39----------
and that to accept that you won't be


---------92:41----------
better is actually like


---------92:43----------
a really really important milestone


---------92:47----------
to accept or like accepting that like


---------92:52----------
like that isn't the objective i guess i


---------92:54----------
mean it certainly is a objective and you


---------92:56----------
should try to get better


---------92:58----------
but even the chase to become better is


---------93:00----------
once again your desire you said it so


---------93:02----------
beautifully


---------93:03----------
i want to fix it yeah that was what if


---------93:06----------
you talk to my uh


---------93:08----------
therapist that i've had since i was like


---------93:10----------
16 like i've


---------93:12----------
told her that so many times over the


---------93:13----------
years like when i i'm not even 16 like


---------93:15----------
probably


---------93:15----------
13 14. like i remember i would go like


---------93:19----------
i'd not be able to go to class and i'd


---------93:20----------
just be crying in their office like i


---------93:22----------
just want to fix it i just want to be


---------93:24----------
better


---------93:24----------
so i can't describe it but i want to fix


---------93:27----------
this


---------93:28----------
so oddly conor here's the real thing


---------93:30----------
that i hadn't really pieced together


---------93:32----------
i think the source of this is not


---------93:36----------
the negative self-attitude it's your


---------93:38----------
obsession to fix it


---------93:43----------
the thing which you think has been


---------93:44----------
helping you and you've been


---------93:46----------
dumping all your points into it level up


---------93:49----------
is actually the thing that's trapping


---------93:50----------
you


---------93:54----------
let it be


---------93:57----------
accept it for what it is because when


---------94:01----------
you let it be there


---------94:02----------
it's not about fixing it it's about not


---------94:05----------
letting it be a factor


---------94:08----------
and when i ask you i mean if you said it


---------94:09----------
so beautifully like it's still


---------94:11----------
there it's just not a factor you don't


---------94:13----------
even need to fix it


---------94:17----------
right it's the obsession to fix


---------94:20----------
which ties us up the most


---------94:23----------
yeah no that's


---------94:26----------
that everything that you said clicked


---------94:28----------
today but like that was like really like


---------94:31----------
it's almost like an easy way to


---------94:32----------
encompass all of it


---------94:34----------
that makes sense like the entire


---------94:36----------
illustration you're trying to make


---------94:37----------
and the idea of separation


---------94:41----------
um the way you describe the fixing it


---------94:43----------
thing kind of


---------94:44----------
clicks on a more basic level i think


---------94:47----------
makes sense to me so now i'll ask you so


---------94:50----------
i'll test you connor


---------94:52----------
and now notice the anxiety rise because


---------94:54----------
oh my god you're gonna get tested


---------94:55----------
is it there i'm kinda i'm


---------94:59----------
i'm pretty confident that i'm


---------95:00----------
understanding a good thing whether or


---------95:02----------
not i can put words to it


---------95:04----------
i forgot my question


---------95:08----------
okay here's something i want to


---------95:09----------
understand so conor


---------95:11----------
what is it that we're trying to fix


---------95:12----------
today


---------95:17----------
um well i was trying to fix


---------95:22----------
in the end i was trying to fix that i


---------95:24----------
was trying to fix stuff


---------95:26----------
that makes sense yeah so another way


---------95:29----------
to say that i think is in a sense


---------95:31----------
absolutely nothing


---------95:35----------
right right and that's hard to like it's


---------95:36----------
easy to misconstrue that in my head and


---------95:38----------
be like well i'm does that mean i'm not


---------95:40----------
trying to get better but no it's just


---------95:41----------
that


---------95:42----------
that that entire drive


---------95:45----------
of just constant overthinking constant


---------95:48----------
what do i do


---------95:48----------
what is this that why i do this is


---------95:52----------
is causing the loop absolutely so so now


---------95:55----------
we can see now you said it they just


---------95:57----------
connected it for me right so if we think


---------95:58----------
about it


---------95:59----------
what is your ocd always trying to do


---------96:04----------
get reassurance and to


---------96:07----------
get fix a problem absolutely that's why


---------96:10----------
you send the text


---------96:12----------
gotta fix it gotta fix it gotta fix it


---------96:16----------
gotta fix it gotta fix it


---------96:18----------
yeah gotta make it better gotta take it


---------96:21----------
away can't keep doing this


---------96:24----------
the very opposite of acceptance


---------96:30----------
and so you get tied up worse and worse


---------96:33----------
and worse and worse because your


---------96:36----------
antidote is the poison


---------96:42----------
yeah yeah


---------96:46----------
your antidote is the poison of your life


---------96:50----------
was that from is that that was from


---------96:53----------
something


---------96:54----------
it sounded like it was like that's why


---------96:57----------
it's like


---------96:57----------
i thought you were making a reference i


---------96:59----------
was like oh


---------97:01----------
it's like it's this like zen wisdom kind


---------97:04----------
of stuff that's full of pain what you're


---------97:05----------
saying yeah


---------97:07----------
i was trolling myself because i deserve


---------97:09----------
to be trolled


---------97:10----------
when i speak like that


---------97:14----------
okay so i sort of taught you a


---------97:17----------
meditative practice today do you feel


---------97:18----------
comfortable with that


---------97:20----------
um so what what is that


---------97:24----------
what kind of meditative process does


---------97:25----------
that call it if i wanted to like look


---------97:26----------
that up and


---------97:27----------
i mean that that in and of itself is not


---------97:30----------
like a particular practice it's just


---------97:32----------
because i think you've already


---------97:33----------
cultivated some awareness


---------97:35----------
yeah so it's just creating that


---------97:36----------
awareness of allowing the


---------97:38----------
negativity and yep observe like


---------97:41----------
observing isn't the right yeah so i


---------97:42----------
think the closest thing is actually


---------97:44----------
mindfulness so i rarely teach


---------97:45----------
mindfulness


---------97:46----------
on stream this is a mindfulness practice


---------97:49----------
of what's traditionally known as


---------97:50----------
mindfulness


---------97:52----------
which is like in your case i think


---------97:53----------
you've actually you've spent so much


---------97:55----------
time in your head i don't need to teach


---------97:56----------
you how to be in your head


---------97:57----------
you've actually learned how to see those


---------97:59----------
things


---------98:01----------
so all i'm telling you to do is like you


---------98:03----------
can use a particular


---------98:06----------
object to evoke that process in a


---------98:09----------
controlled fashion


---------98:11----------
it's almost like an exposure therapy in


---------98:13----------
your mind


---------98:14----------
yeah right and and i'm not surprised


---------98:17----------
that exposure therapy worked well for


---------98:19----------
you because i think you have the


---------98:20----------
temperament


---------98:20----------
for mindfulness because like you're able


---------98:23----------
to see things within yourself and i'd


---------98:25----------
say just like look in the mirror like


---------98:26----------
you got to be careful because you don't


---------98:27----------
want to let it


---------98:28----------
go too wild right so once again you


---------98:31----------
don't want to like


---------98:31----------
push yourself to look in the mirror


---------98:33----------
every day like i'm gonna look in the


---------98:34----------
mirror


---------98:35----------
i'm gonna fix this


---------98:38----------
that's gonna be falling into the same


---------98:39----------
track whenever you can just look in the


---------98:40----------
mirror and like


---------98:41----------
do it for three or four minutes let


---------98:44----------
those thoughts come up


---------98:45----------
and notice them take a deep breath and


---------98:48----------
then walk away


---------98:50----------
there's a chance that your day is


---------98:52----------
torpedoed for the rest torpedo possum


---------98:55----------
and if it is let yourself be torpedoed


---------99:04----------
no that makes sense yeah


---------99:09----------
cool man this has helped this is this is


---------99:12----------
helpful


---------99:13----------
other people too yeah yeah i i don't


---------99:15----------
know how much of it i wasn't really


---------99:16----------
watching but


---------99:18----------
um you know


---------99:22----------
i mean hopefully i i don't know how far


---------99:23----------
in the weeds we were and how applicable


---------99:25----------
that was to other people


---------99:26----------
yeah i mean that was the big thing is


---------99:28----------
like i wanted to help myself but like i


---------99:30----------
i really want to make sure that like


---------99:32----------
others like if anybody else can get


---------99:34----------
something out of that


---------99:35----------
and like not go down an eight year


---------99:39----------
and maybe get a little bit you know get


---------99:42----------
there a little bit faster


---------99:43----------
than that that's what yeah that's good


---------99:46----------
yeah cool man


---------99:47----------
well thanks a lot for coming on man


---------99:50----------
and no problem i'm down again anytime


---------99:52----------
okay


---------99:53----------
yeah so so you know try this out for a


---------99:55----------
little while and continue watching


---------99:57----------
yourself


---------99:57----------
if you want to learn a formal meditation


---------99:59----------
practice you know you're welcome to do


---------100:00----------
whatever else we do on stream i think


---------100:02----------
all that stuff will help


---------100:03----------
it'll train your mind but i think in


---------100:05----------
your case


---------100:06----------
really as you can try to grapple with


---------100:08----------
with this beast inside you from time to


---------100:10----------
time


---------100:12----------
and okay you know expose it to you


---------100:16----------
your non-judgmental self and then i


---------100:18----------
think you'll start to get i mean you'll


---------100:19----------
continue to get better because you've


---------100:21----------
started to get better


---------100:22----------
and for what it's worth i think it's


---------100:23----------
really awesome that you have tried so


---------100:25----------
hard and have been in treatment because


---------100:27----------
i think that's certainly very helpful


---------100:28----------
too


---------100:29----------
yeah and like every time i talk about


---------100:31----------
the day like it's it's a lot


---------100:32----------
and like i almost like feel myself after


---------100:34----------
like well i want to make sure i get it


---------100:36----------
all and understand


---------100:37----------
but like that's part of what you're


---------100:38----------
talking about is kind of beautiful


---------100:40----------
acting on that


---------100:41----------
that's exactly what i'm saying so now


---------100:43----------
i'm confident you've understood


---------100:45----------
yeah you want to fix it you want to make


---------100:47----------
sure you got everything you needed to


---------100:49----------
because then you'll fix it faster right


---------100:51----------
but see


---------100:52----------
already you're noticing oh like there it


---------100:54----------
is again


---------100:55----------
you see how pervasive it is and since


---------100:58----------
it's pervasive it affects all


---------100:59----------
avenues of your life
