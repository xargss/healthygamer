---------00:00----------
so on our thanks so much for coming on


---------00:02----------
stream today so can you help us


---------00:03----------
understand a little bit about who you


---------00:06----------
are and and what you stream sure um hi


---------00:10----------
guys i'm ana i stream variety for the


---------00:14----------
most part i used to stream a lot of


---------00:15----------
overwatch but I felt like that game made


---------00:17----------
me really sad made me really angry it


---------00:20----------
was difficult to have fun so I kind of


---------00:22----------
transitioned into variety streaming for


---------00:24----------
Halloween i streamed a few horror games


---------00:26----------
which i think other people enjoy a lot


---------00:27----------
more than I do but it's fun to get clips


---------00:30----------
of me screaming and being weird and


---------00:32----------
wacky but it's just really a really fun


---------00:34----------
fun time okay and how how is it that you


---------00:37----------
got into streaming um well I guess


---------00:41----------
considering the topic today that's


---------00:42----------
that's kind of why I started streaming


---------00:44----------
I've never disclaimer


---------00:45----------
I've never technically been like


---------00:46----------
diagnosed with anxiety or anything but


---------00:48----------
when I was younger I was really bad at


---------00:51----------
socializing with people and I thought


---------00:54----------
that streaming would be a really good


---------00:55----------
way to learn how to talk to people and


---------00:57----------
kind of get out of my shell a little bit


---------00:59----------
and and sort of put myself in an


---------01:01----------
uncomfortable position so that I could


---------01:03----------
sort of grow as a program I guess so you


---------01:05----------
started streaming specifically to like


---------01:07----------
help overcome your concerns about like


---------01:11----------
sort of being socially with people and


---------01:14----------
feeling uncomfortable yeah that's kind


---------01:16----------
of like a like diving in headfirst sort


---------01:20----------
of yeah I mean at the start it was it


---------01:23----------
was very nerve-wracking I mean it still


---------01:25----------
is sometimes like um for the first year


---------01:27----------
or so that I was streaming I was also


---------01:29----------
going to school so being overwhelmed


---------01:31----------
with schoolwork and one nod and and


---------01:33----------
trying to have a social life outside of


---------01:34----------
that and stream it was it was really


---------01:36----------
difficult sometimes knowing how


---------01:38----------
nerve-wracking it would be to hit the


---------01:39----------
the go-live button to actually gather up


---------01:42----------
the courage to do that right I mean it


---------01:45----------
was um it was worth it in the end and I


---------01:48----------
really enjoyed doing it but there were


---------01:49----------
definitely days where I would just not


---------01:51----------
stream because I was afraid afraid of


---------01:52----------
what well I mean again since I was


---------01:58----------
struggling so much for the social aspect


---------01:59----------
of streaming a lot the idea of being a


---------02:04----------
small streamer and growing slowly was


---------02:06----------
kind of nerve-wracking because a lot of


---------02:09----------
people who go into streaming they just


---------02:10----------
want to see themselves grow immediately


---------02:12----------
and become a big famous streamer


---------02:14----------
which wasn't the goal necessarily but it


---------02:17----------
was you know an appealing idea so to be


---------02:20----------
sitting there smaller numbers of viewers


---------02:23----------
or whatnot


---------02:23----------
and knowing that not hitting go live


---------02:26----------
would affect that but then knowing that


---------02:28----------
I might be streaming for three or four


---------02:30----------
hours talking to nobody was kind of it's


---------02:34----------
scary to try and talk to yourself I


---------02:37----------
guess for hours and hours on end and


---------02:38----------
still be entertaining yet so what's


---------02:40----------
scary about that I guess I worry a lot


---------02:47----------
about what I talk about what I say how


---------02:49----------
people perceive me I worry that people


---------02:52----------
judge me and maybe it doesn't matter but


---------02:54----------
it's still something that I typically


---------02:56----------
worry about in a social setting is you


---------02:59----------
know for example if I'm out in public


---------03:01----------
now I have weird pink hair so if someone


---------03:04----------
stares at me typically I worry that


---------03:06----------
there's something wrong with my


---------03:07----------
appearance or or they're judging me in


---------03:10----------
some way negatively rarely do I think of


---------03:11----------
something positive it's typically a


---------03:13----------
negative assumption that I have so


---------03:15----------
streaming is kind of that exact same


---------03:17----------
thing someone comes into my stream I


---------03:19----------
don't know what they think of me I don't


---------03:20----------
know how they feel watching my stream so


---------03:22----------
at least for the first year or so up


---------03:24----------
streaming that was something that was


---------03:26----------
always on my mind was I hope that you


---------03:27----------
know they didn't hate me they didn't


---------03:28----------
think I was weird didn't think I was


---------03:30----------
annoying so it sounds like you were


---------03:32----------
concerned about being judged on stream


---------03:35----------
by the internet and twitch chat yep and


---------03:39----------
then you're also you were also concerned


---------03:41----------
about being judged by you know real


---------03:44----------
people in the real world and if someone


---------03:46----------
is looking at you you know you're it


---------03:49----------
sounds like the first place your mind


---------03:50----------
goes is it maybe because it's my hair as


---------03:53----------
Pinker I look weird and it's not this


---------03:54----------
person recognizes because it recognizes


---------03:57----------
and recognizes me because I'm internet


---------03:59----------
famous


---------03:59----------
I mean maybe that'll be the case one day


---------04:04----------
but for now it's just an assumption that


---------04:06----------
something's wrong yeah and and how long


---------04:08----------
have you been having those kinds of


---------04:09----------
thoughts about something being wrong


---------04:12----------
like how long has your mind been jumping


---------04:14----------
to that place I'd say mostly my whole


---------04:18----------
life I mean at least I'd say as long as


---------04:22----------
I can remember in school I was never


---------04:24----------
really the popular kid or anything like


---------04:25----------
that in elementary school I had


---------04:27----------
sort of one or two friends here and


---------04:29----------
there we were kind of the the weird kids


---------04:31----------
I guess


---------04:32----------
in high school I was made fun of a lot


---------04:34----------
for I mean what I love to do which is


---------04:37----------
gaming I I liked a lot of Korean pop


---------04:39----------
music growing up as well and it's it's


---------04:41----------
popular now but when I was a kid I was a


---------04:44----------
complete loser for liking kpop so I got


---------04:47----------
teased a lot and I also got teased a lot


---------04:51----------
for my appearance so that's something


---------04:52----------
that I've always been really


---------04:53----------
self-conscious about was how I look to


---------04:56----------
other people I had sort of a group of


---------04:59----------
people on my school bus who would


---------05:00----------
frequently insult me and belittle me and


---------05:03----------
it made me very self-conscious and very


---------05:06----------
aware of what other people might be


---------05:08----------
thinking that they might not be saying


---------05:09----------
and is that what you call anxiety well I


---------05:14----------
think it's more of a confidence that she


---------05:15----------
than an anxiety issue what's the dance I


---------05:18----------
think that's not entirely sure


---------05:23----------
bianna so we're here to talk about


---------05:24----------
anxiety right so what is what do you


---------05:28----------
mean by anxiety well I guess the the the


---------05:33----------
worry I have the fears that might not be


---------05:36----------
justified but they're just kind of in my


---------05:37----------
head thinking that someone is judging me


---------05:39----------
when there's probably nothing there to


---------05:42----------
worry about and it's just my mind


---------05:44----------
forming these these thoughts that that


---------05:46----------
are unjustified so now this is kind of


---------05:48----------
interesting because it sounds like


---------05:49----------
you're recognizing that those thoughts


---------05:51----------
are unjustified so would you say that


---------05:55----------
the thoughts are illogical to some


---------05:59----------
degree I mean when I go out for example


---------06:02----------
I obviously don't look at someone and


---------06:03----------
immediately judge everything that's


---------06:04----------
wrong with them but for some odd reason


---------06:06----------
I think that everyone's doing that to me


---------06:09----------
which I mean seems a little yeah so are


---------06:12----------
you saying that that that's a confidence


---------06:14----------
issue or that's is that what we're


---------06:15----------
calling anxiety I guess a mix of both


---------06:21----------
yeah I think so so I think that you're


---------06:23----------
what maybe what you're thinking is that


---------06:24----------
if you were more confident in yourself


---------06:26----------
you wouldn't have those thoughts yeah I


---------06:29----------
think that might ok case so I think that


---------06:32----------
what you're experiencing is the classic


---------06:34----------
definition of anxiety right so you're


---------06:36----------
concerned about how people are judging


---------06:38----------
you and that's pretty classic anxiety it


---------06:41----------
also sounds like most of what you're


---------06:43----------
experiencing is around other people's


---------06:45----------
perceptions of you I'm not hearing you


---------06:48----------
say that like are you are you worried


---------06:50----------
about other stuff I mean I guess like


---------06:56----------
life in general is kind of unnerving


---------06:58----------
being 27 years old and kind of confused


---------07:01----------
about life I guess not knowing really


---------07:03----------
where I'm gonna go there's there's the


---------07:05----------
general anxiety of that I guess I've


---------07:07----------
also actually for about five years now


---------07:09----------
my my doctor I've never gone in-depth


---------07:12----------
discussing with a doctor or anything my


---------07:14----------
family doctor about anxiety issues I


---------07:16----------
have but um about five years ago I broke


---------07:20----------
up with my last boyfriend and he kind of


---------07:23----------
we had this this sort of thing going for


---------07:27----------
four months he owed me money he didn't


---------07:28----------
send me the money he kept kind of saying


---------07:30----------
that he was gonna send it to me and


---------07:31----------
didn't and then it was a song for months


---------07:33----------
of him leading me on with that I guess


---------07:36----------
and it I think that that created


---------07:38----------
something that my doctor said was just


---------07:39----------
anxiety but since then I've had issues


---------07:43----------
with breathing anything like it feels


---------07:45----------
like kind of yeah with breathing this is


---------07:48----------
what my doctor told me it was just


---------07:49----------
anxiety and it would go away what I mean


---------07:52----------
by issues with breathing well sometimes


---------07:55----------
I feel like I don't get a full breath of


---------07:57----------
air like my lungs don't feel like they


---------07:59----------
get filled up especially when I would


---------08:00----------
I'm struggling with with something that


---------08:02----------
makes me nervous or anxious it's like I


---------08:04----------
I don't feel like I'm breathing properly


---------08:06----------
I'm not getting a full full broken I


---------08:09----------
guess so it would you like to understand


---------08:11----------
how that works and how to fix it yes


---------08:15----------
okay well so I mean fix it is maybe a


---------08:19----------
little bit ambitious because once again


---------08:21----------
I can't dispense medical advice nor can


---------08:22----------
I fix anything about your life over the


---------08:24----------
Internet but let's start with this


---------08:26----------
what's the relationship between your


---------08:28----------
mind and your breath I guess when I get


---------08:33----------
to these points I'm very conscious of


---------08:35----------
how I'm breathing and the fact that I'm


---------08:36----------
lacking the air whereas normally if I'm


---------08:39----------
not thinking about how I breathe that's


---------08:40----------
it's just natural right it just happens


---------08:42----------
but when I'm in these nervous situations


---------08:44----------
I'm a lot more aware of just every


---------08:46----------
little rumor that I do


---------08:47----------
so maybe the the break the breathing is


---------08:49----------
related so I'm noticing so I'm gonna


---------08:51----------
kind of boil down what you said that as


---------08:53----------
you become aware of


---------08:55----------
breath your breath begins to change


---------08:57----------
right so I want you guys everyone who's


---------09:01----------
watching I want you to become aware of


---------09:03----------
your breath sorry guys


---------09:07----------
right so what so so anarthas you become


---------09:09----------
aware of your breath what do you start


---------09:10----------
noticing about it well the for me for


---------09:15----------
example right now I'm having the issue


---------09:17----------
with the breathing the the full breath


---------09:19----------
that I can't quite you know get hold of


---------09:21----------
so your experience and I feel like I've


---------09:23----------
become going right but I feel like I've


---------09:26----------
become very self-conscious of myself


---------09:28----------
when I'm doing that too because for the


---------09:30----------
for a year or so it was consistent


---------09:32----------
pretty much every day every moment and I


---------09:34----------
if I was with my sister or friends or


---------09:36----------
something they would always they would


---------09:38----------
always think something was wrong with me


---------09:39----------
because I'd sound like I'm taking big


---------09:40----------
gasps and sighing a lot and they would


---------09:42----------
think is everything okay and and I would


---------09:44----------
always just say no it's just my issue


---------09:46----------
with breathing everything's for the most


---------09:48----------
part normal like it's not going away so


---------09:49----------
just just don't assume I'm struggling


---------09:52----------
with something necessarily this is just


---------09:53----------
how I am now I guess I kind of accepted


---------09:56----------
it after a while that I was struggling


---------09:58----------
with it and what impact when other


---------10:00----------
people noticed that you were gasping and


---------10:02----------
sighing all the time what did that do to


---------10:04----------
you


---------10:05----------
I feel like I would try to breathe a


---------10:08----------
little more quietly which might make it


---------10:09----------
more difficult to actually yeah


---------10:11----------
absolutely so it's almost like a vicious


---------10:12----------
cycle because when they notice you're


---------10:14----------
breathing like a weirdo and like I don't


---------10:15----------
mean to be judgmental but I can imagine


---------10:17----------
that's the thought that was in your head


---------10:19----------
right like these people are noticing


---------10:20----------
that I'm reading like a weirdo and I


---------10:22----------
feel like a weirdo because people are


---------10:23----------
paying attention to my breathing and


---------10:25----------
then the more that that thought arises


---------10:28----------
in your head the worse your breathing


---------10:29----------
gets and then you try to do the worst


---------10:32----------
thing that people can do with anxiety is


---------10:34----------
you try to control it you try to push it


---------10:37----------
down and how does that work mmm-hmm


---------10:40----------
poorly absolutely right so that's the


---------10:43----------
first thing to understand about anxiety


---------10:45----------
is that like people try to like people


---------10:48----------
people are in a war with anxiety does


---------10:50----------
that make sense to you what does that


---------10:52----------
mean


---------10:53----------
very much I mean you're you're kind of


---------10:56----------
caught constantly thinking about it


---------10:58----------
especially when it arises and you're


---------10:59----------
trying to I mean as you said you're at


---------11:00----------
war you're trying to battle it push it


---------11:02----------
away try and be normal and then it just


---------11:04----------
it gets worse because you're so


---------11:06----------
conscious of it and again like with me


---------11:08----------
with the breathing


---------11:09----------
when I become conscious of it it's it's


---------11:11----------
more difficult to control so the thing


---------11:13----------
would be I guess it would be better to


---------11:14----------
find a way to distract myself from it


---------11:16----------
and go back to the normal breathing or


---------11:18----------
something like that but if I become


---------11:20----------
aware it's just yet a struggle so for


---------11:22----------
people who are like is it I'm gonna ask


---------11:24----------
like I'm not gonna actually look at


---------11:26----------
twitch at it's twitch chats answers


---------11:28----------
right now but as you become aware of


---------11:30----------
breathing I want you to notice that you


---------11:31----------
automatically begin to control it it's


---------11:34----------
very hard to just observe your breathing


---------11:36----------
without changing your breathing does


---------11:38----------
that make sense an RM hmm okay yes so


---------11:41----------
now I'm gonna ask you again so we're


---------11:42----------
gonna take a step back we're gonna


---------11:43----------
bounce a little bit between anxiety and


---------11:46----------
understanding let's start by


---------11:48----------
understanding the relationship between


---------11:49----------
the mind and the breath so what what


---------11:54----------
relationship does your mental state have


---------11:56----------
on your breathing well as I said I think


---------12:01----------
what my doctors said as well I guess


---------12:03----------
very briefly in our discussion about


---------12:05----------
this was that oh goodness


---------12:06----------
when let's forget what your doctor said


---------12:10----------
see it's it's the only thing I ever


---------12:12----------
talked to her about regarding my anxiety


---------12:14----------
so I think that maybe she wasn't fully


---------12:15----------
understanding my side of things as well


---------12:17----------
no no so let's forget let's forget


---------12:19----------
neuroscience let's forget experts let's


---------12:21----------
forget anything I've ever said on stream


---------12:23----------
I'm asking you a narf and is it honor


---------12:27----------
Anna or uh narf Anna and Anna what is


---------12:30----------
the relationship between what is going


---------12:33----------
in your going on in your mind and your


---------12:35----------
breathing first of all are they


---------12:37----------
connected I guess to some degree even


---------12:43----------
like subconsciously when I start having


---------12:45----------
anxiety if I start you know breathing


---------12:46----------
more quickly or something like that or I


---------12:48----------
feel more sometimes that are so I want


---------12:50----------
you to now we're gonna play a fun game


---------12:52----------
okay and you have to you have to pay


---------12:53----------
attention to twitch chat because I can't


---------12:55----------
because I'm focused on you I want you to


---------12:57----------
guess what's happening in my mind based


---------13:00----------
on how I breathe are you ready to play


---------13:02----------
the game okay okay we'll try our best


---------13:09----------
what's that's a nervousness something's


---------13:14----------
working you up maybe you just rise I


---------13:16----------
wouldn't say nervousness what is what is


---------13:18----------
okay yeah so right so people yes and you


---------13:29----------
guys so just think about this for a


---------13:31----------
[ __ ] second you can listen to the


---------13:35----------
sound of my breathing and you can tell


---------13:38----------
me what is going on in my mind you are


---------13:42----------
reading my mind based on listening to my


---------13:45----------
breath your doctor didn't tell you this


---------13:49----------
you didn't read this in a book human


---------13:51----------
beings know this like just think about


---------13:53----------
that and appreciate that for a second


---------13:56----------
right and when people are anxious what


---------13:59----------
do we tell them to do in right way and


---------14:05----------
what does that mean try and relax or


---------14:09----------
anything keep it normal which is


---------14:11----------
difficult when you're sort of thinking


---------14:13----------
about more I guess so we tell people to


---------14:15----------
take deep breaths right and does that


---------14:18----------
help no I mean especially for me right I


---------14:22----------
struggle to breathe deeply when I'm


---------14:24----------
having these anxious issues so they like


---------14:25----------
breathe deeply and I just I'm more and


---------14:27----------
more aware of the fact that I can't we


---------14:29----------
just get stressed so I think that for a


---------14:32----------
lot of people deep breathing does help I


---------14:34----------
think in your case it doesn't we'll kind


---------14:36----------
of tunnel down into why that is but the


---------14:37----------
first thing that I want people to


---------14:39----------
understand is that you know there are


---------14:43----------
patterns of breathing so I'll do another


---------14:45----------
one now what am I feeling right so let's


---------14:55----------
start like fear panic anxiety so now


---------14:58----------
what do you guys notice about how I'm


---------15:03----------
changing my breathing in what ways what


---------15:05----------
are the properties of breath like what's


---------15:07----------
different between this


---------15:10----------
in this what's different


---------15:17----------
I mean panic is a lot fast okay so speed


---------15:20----------
is one thing what else is different


---------15:22----------
about the breath we're reading chat


---------15:28----------
depth and speed of breath a tempo speed


---------15:31----------
and tempo are the same thing the


---------15:33----------
shallowness there we go so let's start


---------15:35----------
with two things right and now I'm gonna


---------15:36----------
breathe another way it's deep and


---------15:45----------
calming


---------15:52----------
so what is the emotion in relaxed calm I


---------15:58----------
mean even even just watching you do that


---------15:59----------
makes me feel more relaxed yeah right so


---------16:02----------
we'll get to that so calm but now what


---------16:06----------
water are what are the two axes of


---------16:07----------
breath one is depth in one is speed


---------16:10----------
right so what is so we can map out what


---------16:15----------
kind of emotions lead to what kind of


---------16:18----------
breathing right so calm breathing is


---------16:22----------
fast or slow okay where and calm


---------16:27----------
breathing is deep or shallow okay


---------16:31----------
excellent right so then let's talk about


---------16:34----------
angry breathing angry breathing is fast


---------16:37----------
or slow seems seem slow right I'll do it


---------16:43----------
again


---------16:43----------
I mean it's slower but if you think


---------16:51----------
you're pushing out quick good


---------16:53----------
so now you've stumbled up upon another


---------16:55----------
axis of breath with it which is


---------16:57----------
inhalation and exhalation we'll get to


---------16:58----------
that for a second so I would say that


---------17:00----------
angry breathing versus anxious breathing


---------17:07----------
both of them are actually fast but


---------17:10----------
anxious breathing is deep and fast and


---------17:12----------
angry breathing is slow and fast would


---------17:14----------
you guys agree does that make sense


---------17:16----------
right yeah and so if we think about calm


---------17:19----------
breathing


---------17:31----------
right that's slow and deep and this also


---------17:36----------
there are even deeper layers of this so


---------17:38----------
a breath in which I am trying to calm


---------17:41----------
myself has a rapid inhalation in a slow


---------17:43----------
exhalation listen that's me trying to


---------17:49----------
calm myself and me actually being calm


---------17:53----------
is you guy see the difference so there


---------18:04----------
are a lot of subtleties in breath that


---------18:06----------
we never study and the next thing to


---------18:09----------
understand so the first thing is that


---------18:11----------
the pattern of your breathing relates to


---------18:14----------
the pattern of your mind and now I'm


---------18:16----------
gonna ask you a question Anna do you


---------18:18----------
think that it's a one-way street or a


---------18:20----------
two-way street


---------18:21----------
and what sense do you mean so we know


---------18:24----------
that our mind determines our pattern of


---------18:26----------
breathing like when you get anxious you


---------18:28----------
can't take a full breath right and so


---------18:30----------
let's just pause and go on a quick


---------18:32----------
tangent so when you can't take a full


---------18:33----------
breath are we talking about speed or


---------18:35----------
depth absolutely that you notice that


---------18:39----------
very well good so we'll come back to


---------18:41----------
that yeah so you're telling me that what


---------18:43----------
is going on in your mind controls the


---------18:44----------
way that you breathe agree or disagree


---------18:48----------
okay


---------18:49----------
agree so now I'm gonna ask you is that a


---------18:50----------
one-way street does your mind control


---------18:52----------
your breathing or is it a two-way street


---------18:54----------
and as you're breathing also control


---------18:55----------
your mind I guess right so what does


---------18:58----------
twitchchat think so well they say six or


---------19:03----------
a street so let's just think about this


---------19:07----------
so I'm gonna tell you guys about a


---------19:08----------
fascinating study okay so there was a


---------19:10----------
there was a researcher who was trying to


---------19:13----------
examine facial expressions and was


---------19:15----------
trying to figure out how much like what


---------19:18----------
percentage of a facial expression


---------19:20----------
do I need to demonstrate for someone


---------19:23----------
else to read what I'm feeling right so


---------19:27----------
like if I if I like this an ARF


---------19:30----------
what do you think I feeling yeah


---------19:34----------
happiness or instead insane see that's


---------19:37----------
beautiful right so like let's just pause


---------19:39----------
because you're able to detect something


---------19:40----------
in my facial expression that's a


---------19:42----------
little bit crazy so what this researcher


---------19:44----------
was trying to figure out is like what


---------19:46----------
percentage of crazy do I need to show in


---------19:48----------
my face for you to be able to pick it up


---------19:50----------
does that make sense


---------19:51----------
so if I like did this Yeah right like


---------19:57----------
what is that like you're able to detect


---------19:58----------
something so what he did and do people


---------20:03----------
know what that expression was how did


---------20:05----------
that feel how did you feel when I made


---------20:09----------
that facial expression I mean you kind


---------20:13----------
of it doesn't take much it doesn't take


---------20:16----------
much at all so what this researcher did


---------20:18----------
was he tried to figure out like what


---------20:21----------
percentage of a facial expression do I


---------20:23----------
need to show in like what I showed was


---------20:24----------
like a tiny like a tiny tiny amount of


---------20:26----------
flirtation right it's just a tiny you I


---------20:28----------
picked it up like that and I could see


---------20:30----------
it made you a little bit uncomfortable


---------20:31----------
and and so the researcher tried to


---------20:35----------
figure out what percentage of a facial


---------20:37----------
expression do I need to show in order


---------20:40----------
for people to pick up what I'm trying to


---------20:41----------
send and he took his research assistants


---------20:44----------
and he had them practice facial


---------20:45----------
expressions so then what he did is he


---------20:48----------
trained as his research assistants to


---------20:50----------
kind of display 50 percent of anger 25


---------20:53----------
percent of anger a hundred percent of


---------20:54----------
anger and then he had his research


---------20:57----------
assistants like glare at people right


---------21:00----------
or like flirt with people or smile at


---------21:01----------
people and by doing that he was like


---------21:04----------
testing like okay and he told his


---------21:05----------
research assistant I want you to display


---------21:06----------
25 percent of anger and see if people


---------21:08----------
can pick it up you get with me so far


---------21:11----------
so bizarre things started happening his


---------21:14----------
research assistants started fighting


---------21:18----------
amongst each other


---------21:18----------
in the research assistant who is trained


---------21:21----------
to like with anger started getting


---------21:23----------
pissed off the research assistant who is


---------21:26----------
trained to feel like shame started


---------21:28----------
feeling ashamed and that through the


---------21:30----------
research assistant who is trained to


---------21:32----------
feel like to demonstrate happiness


---------21:34----------
started feeling better and so the


---------21:37----------
researchers stumbled upon a really


---------21:38----------
fascinating thing which is that your


---------21:42----------
facial expression actually controls the


---------21:44----------
way that you feel - and I want you to


---------21:46----------
pay attention like an ARFF like right


---------21:47----------
now you're feeling curious right so like


---------21:51----------
yeah now now how do you feel


---------21:55----------
I mean look at me here it's really I had


---------21:57----------
a little distracted I guess look at me


---------22:00----------
what are you feeling intrigued I I mean


---------22:06----------
this is an interesting story I think um


---------22:07----------
when when we were at twitchcon


---------22:09----------
Sahil kanga my sister and I we went to


---------22:12----------
this um this improv thing where they did


---------22:15----------
something similar where they were having


---------22:16----------
people go up on stage and perform sort


---------22:19----------
of emotions just like what this guy was


---------22:22----------
having people do he just no words there


---------22:24----------
anything just facial expressions body


---------22:25----------
and whatnot I kind of remembered that


---------22:28----------
from this conversation but um they


---------22:30----------
didn't go in depth with you know how


---------22:31----------
they felt afterwards kind of thing but I


---------22:33----------
mean maybe it affected ya there as well


---------22:34----------
so like like I think Tom sort of said it


---------22:36----------
that like if I smile it's someone like


---------22:38----------
you guys should try this right so it's


---------22:39----------
hard if you have social anxiety but like


---------22:41----------
genuinely smile at someone on the street


---------22:43----------
like if you just smile at someone I do


---------22:45----------
that quite regularly actually yeah cuz I


---------22:47----------
definitely had people I'm walking by


---------22:48----------
them on the street they smile at me and


---------22:50----------
me yeah this is kind of good just like


---------22:51----------
Iceman and what happens when someone


---------22:53----------
smiles at you is yeah and you can


---------22:56----------
control it and when you smile you start


---------22:59----------
to feel a little bit better so breath


---------23:02----------
and facial expressions like everything


---------23:04----------
your body has a feedback loop this is


---------23:07----------
the principle of homeostasis and it's


---------23:09----------
like how our body functions when our


---------23:11----------
heart rate goes too high


---------23:13----------
our heart says oh god we're beating too


---------23:15----------
fast let's slow it down


---------23:16----------
everything has a feedback loop this is


---------23:18----------
like when you go to the doctor and they


---------23:20----------
test your reflexes they're testing your


---------23:22----------
nerves ability to create a feedback loop


---------23:24----------
so everything in your body has like a


---------23:26----------
point and a counter point like when you


---------23:29----------
when you get super excited over time


---------23:31----------
like just think about this for a second


---------23:32----------
you don't say excited forever what


---------23:34----------
happens to your excitement over time


---------23:38----------
exactly I found and when you feel shitty


---------23:40----------
about yourself what happens hopefully


---------23:41----------
over time your body has a very simple


---------23:47----------
mechanism where like both sides like


---------23:49----------
everything is a two-way street and this


---------23:50----------
is homeostasis so when it comes to your


---------23:53----------
breathing I want people to really


---------23:55----------
understand this what I'm telling you is


---------23:58----------
that you can literally control your mood


---------24:00----------
with your breath right like I can


---------24:05----------
control the happiness that an hour feels


---------24:07----------
bye


---------24:09----------
see you can't you can't stop it's that


---------24:17----------
simple so all we have to do is


---------24:21----------
understand what what's the patter of our


---------24:23----------
breathing right so like think of


---------24:24----------
thinking about like if I start to


---------24:26----------
breathe in an angry way like I'm gonna


---------24:29----------
get angry like even if you guys just


---------24:32----------
like look at me and I'm like and I can't


---------24:38----------
stop but smiling which is why you're


---------24:39----------
smiling and you're detecting that


---------24:40----------
underneath the fake anger is the genuine


---------24:43----------
smile so you're empathic circuitry and


---------24:45----------
as spot on because you're able to read


---------24:47----------
my facial expressions you're able to


---------24:49----------
feel what I'm feeling and so now what I


---------24:53----------
want you guys to understand is if you're


---------24:54----------
feeling a particular way if you


---------24:56----------
literally change the practice of your


---------24:57----------
breathing you can change your mind and


---------25:00----------
before we started our stream today like


---------25:02----------
I was talking to a couple of people that


---------25:04----------
have been doing so the meditation I've


---------25:05----------
taught and they feel like super calm and


---------25:07----------
there are a lot of reasons why


---------25:09----------
meditation helps us but I think one of


---------25:10----------
the simplest ways is that if you control


---------25:12----------
your breathing you're going to control


---------25:13----------
your mind and this is the science of


---------25:16----------
brawn I am so now a narf I'm curious how


---------25:20----------
shallow are your breaths right now can


---------25:21----------
you feel like you can get a good breath


---------25:23----------
I do yeah there's there's moments here


---------25:26----------
in there where it feels a little more of


---------25:27----------
a struggle but for the most part yeah


---------25:29----------
it's it was it was definitely a little


---------25:30----------
more of a struggle at the start of the


---------25:33----------
stream and I feel a little more now we


---------25:35----------
have to dig into this what on earth


---------25:37----------
happened


---------25:37----------
because when you try to control it it


---------25:39----------
doesn't work when you try to take a full


---------25:42----------
breath you don't feel it so what did we


---------25:44----------
just do over the last 10 minutes to like


---------25:46----------
disable your anxiety well something that


---------25:50----------
I found find works in general as well as


---------25:52----------
when something's engaging and


---------25:53----------
interesting to me I'm not paying as much


---------25:55----------
attention to the breathing or I'm


---------25:56----------
focused on something else so I'm not


---------25:58----------
aware of how difficult it is to breathe


---------26:00----------
so my body just goes back to doing its


---------26:02----------
regular thing which is breathing just


---------26:04----------
you know staying alive so I mean the the


---------26:06----------
discussion you had there with the facial


---------26:08----------
expressions was intriguing to me so I


---------26:09----------
was I was more focused on my sleep so I


---------26:12----------
think there are two things involved


---------26:13----------
there one is we have to be careful about


---------26:15----------
distraction so one thing that people do


---------26:18----------
to combat anxiety is to distract


---------26:20----------
themselves


---------26:22----------
but like when you distract yourself I


---------26:24----------
would argue that what we did is not


---------26:26----------
actually distraction does that make


---------26:29----------
sense to you or not so much we are


---------26:33----------
trying to teach me a way to deal with it


---------26:35----------
without it right like so distraction is


---------26:38----------
an active effort so let's kind of define


---------26:41----------
terms is an active effort in your mind


---------26:45----------
to suppress the anxiety and look at


---------26:47----------
something else


---------26:48----------
it's like distraction is like going like


---------26:50----------
this I'm not listening I'm not listening


---------26:51----------
I'm not listening I'm not listening


---------26:53----------
which is not actually calming anyone


---------26:55----------
down does that make sense like that's


---------26:57----------
what distraction is you know like you're


---------27:00----------
not here like it it's it's like a very


---------27:02----------
tense it's like one of the tools in the


---------27:06----------
war against anxiety does that make sense


---------27:10----------
what we actually did is engagement does


---------27:15----------
that make sense like that there's a


---------27:17----------
difference between distraction and


---------27:18----------
engagement I think a lot of times your


---------27:20----------
hope is that by distracting you'll


---------27:22----------
actually engage in something but what I


---------27:25----------
think we were able to do for you an ARFF


---------27:27----------
is engage you in the present moment for


---------27:30----------
you to be like fully present and paying


---------27:31----------
attention to what I'm doing you didn't


---------27:33----------
try to distract yourself from your


---------27:35----------
anxiety right like you didn't actually


---------27:36----------
try that distraction like and if we


---------27:39----------
think about even the verb so if I use


---------27:44----------
the word distraction like who is the


---------27:46----------
subject of that sentence absolutely


---------27:51----------
right so you say I tried to distract


---------27:52----------
myself


---------27:54----------
whereas what happened here is like you


---------27:56----------
didn't try to do anything it just


---------27:59----------
happened


---------28:00----------
and so in apologies if this sounds kind


---------28:04----------
of abstract but like engagement is


---------28:06----------
different from distraction and what we


---------28:10----------
did was engagement which is to genuinely


---------28:12----------
like take your mind and have you


---------28:14----------
appreciate and enjoy and be in the


---------28:17----------
present whereas distraction is actually


---------28:19----------
like pushing something away engagement


---------28:22----------
is about naturally moving towards


---------28:23----------
something and distraction is about


---------28:25----------
pushing away so in a weird way like do


---------28:29----------
you feel like we actually even though


---------28:30----------
the effect is that we affected your


---------28:32----------
anxiety did you feel like we were trying


---------28:34----------
to do anything with anxiety


---------28:36----------
absolutely and that's that's the key


---------28:40----------
because when you try to do something to


---------28:42----------
your anxiety what happens absolutely


---------28:45----------
right so the way to overcome anxiety is


---------28:49----------
to actually not try to fight it because


---------28:53----------
what happens when you when you fight


---------28:54----------
anxieties it creates tension in your


---------28:56----------
mind there's a war in tension yeah fee


---------28:59----------
is the fuel for anxiety does that make


---------29:03----------
sense


---------29:03----------
so anything that you combat in your mind


---------29:06----------
when it comes to anxiety is just making


---------29:08----------
it stronger and I would guess a nerf


---------29:10----------
that in your experience the more you


---------29:13----------
fight the anxiety sometimes you win but


---------29:15----------
it seems like the more you fight it the


---------29:17----------
stronger it grows yeah right like you're


---------29:20----------
building up this wall and the more you


---------29:22----------
build the wall like the higher the


---------29:24----------
anxiety climbs and it's this really like


---------29:26----------
crazy unnerving it can make you feel


---------29:28----------
powerless because you're trying so hard


---------29:31----------
and it's like not working at all and and


---------29:35----------
you become desperate and you're like I


---------29:37----------
need to push a little bit harder I need


---------29:38----------
to push a little bit harder I need to


---------29:40----------
keep it at bay and then it just gets


---------29:41----------
worse and worse and worse and it's


---------29:43----------
spiraling yeah so I want you guys to


---------29:46----------
understand that anxiety is like cancer


---------29:48----------
of the mind like so what cancer does is


---------29:50----------
it takes the nutrients that your body


---------29:52----------
has and it grows with them and the more


---------29:56----------
that you fight against anxiety it's


---------29:58----------
gonna grow based on your attention the


---------30:00----------
more you try to fight it the worse it's


---------30:02----------
gonna get Anissa what do you think we


---------30:06----------
should do on our if how can we make you


---------30:08----------
anxious again I wanna make you anxious


---------30:13----------
II I don't know if I want to hmm


---------30:16----------
I mean I'll be honest right now I'm


---------30:20----------
feeling yeah buddy calm I'm not sure how


---------30:23----------
to go about making me anxious again yeah


---------30:24----------
so so I apologize for fixing it I think


---------30:30----------
I think this is an important


---------30:31----------
relationship for us to understand okay


---------30:33----------
so like I just wanted to try to like


---------30:35----------
reactivate it so that we could like in a


---------30:38----------
in a more definitive and mindful way


---------30:40----------
like see how you can come back but it


---------30:42----------
seems like your calmness much like your


---------30:45----------
anxiety is like not wanting to go


---------30:47----------
anywhere right now which I guess


---------30:50----------
well that's that's how it is with the


---------30:51----------
the breathing as well as that something


---------30:53----------
comes up and it gets really difficult


---------30:54----------
and I think because I either try to


---------30:57----------
distract myself or fight it it sticks


---------30:59----------
around for a lot longer because I mean I


---------31:01----------
didn't know that if I just calm down


---------31:03----------
things like find something that brings


---------31:05----------
me back to the normal happy mood that


---------31:08----------
it'll just go away on its own naturally


---------31:09----------
through through getting rid of the


---------31:11----------
anxiety one of the things that I want


---------31:13----------
you guys to stop doing is fighting your


---------31:15----------
anxiety so like understand that your


---------31:17----------
anxiety has a place in a role and that


---------31:20----------
you're gonna feel certain feelings and


---------31:22----------
then let just let it happen so the thing


---------31:25----------
is like I think I think fine of fighting


---------31:27----------
anxiety is a little bit like holding


---------31:29----------
water like the harder you hold the more


---------31:32----------
the water slips out of your finger so if


---------31:34----------
you want to keep like or keep uh if you


---------31:37----------
want to keep water in your hands an ARFF


---------31:39----------
like how do you do that


---------31:42----------
cut them keep them together don't put


---------31:44----------
too much chatter and then also like like


---------31:46----------
gently right like the harder you try


---------31:48----------
like it's not about trying twice as hard


---------31:52----------
it's just about sort of like creating


---------31:54----------
and like it's sort of like being like


---------31:56----------
gentle with it does that make sense yeah


---------31:58----------
and so that is that's the same thing you


---------32:00----------
need to do with your anxieties when your


---------32:01----------
anxiety arises like I want you to kind


---------32:04----------
of tell yourself that okay like this is


---------32:07----------
happening again it's gonna happen my


---------32:09----------
body is used to doing this my mind is


---------32:10----------
used to doing this we can get into why


---------32:12----------
your body and mind do those things but


---------32:16----------
just sort of acknowledge that it's gonna


---------32:18----------
happen and also recognize that like you


---------32:20----------
know the more that you try to keep the


---------32:22----------
tide at bay like the more it builds up


---------32:24----------
but if you let the tide roll in


---------32:26----------
eventually it's gonna do what go past


---------32:32----------
right so like the tide comes in and it


---------32:34----------
comes out and remember that like just


---------32:36----------
like any other feeling that you have


---------32:38----------
even if you feel anxious you can't stay


---------32:40----------
happy forever you can't stay sad forever


---------32:41----------
you can't stay anxious forever and if


---------32:44----------
you oddly enough like the more like you


---------32:46----------
open the doggy door like dog is gonna go


---------32:48----------
in and out like and so you just let it


---------32:51----------
in and then you let it out if you want


---------32:53----------
to you can try to breathe a little bit


---------32:55----------
through it but don't try to breathe to


---------32:57----------
control it like if you feel yourself


---------32:58----------
breathing fast let yourself breathe fast


---------33:00----------
for a little while and then let yourself


---------33:03----------
kind of


---------33:04----------
slow-like see even now you're doing it


---------33:05----------
you're practicing yeah you're practicing


---------33:08----------
excellent do you guys see that gel catch


---------33:10----------
that I've been trying actually I have


---------33:15----------
watched the stream a couple of times


---------33:16----------
when you do the meditations and stuff


---------33:17----------
and I've been trying that when I have


---------33:19----------
the sort of moments where I struggle to


---------33:21----------
breathe I try to go through the


---------33:22----------
meditations and calm myself and that's


---------33:25----------
typically quite well though I could be a


---------33:29----------
little more consistent on how long I do


---------33:31----------
it that's okay


---------33:32----------
otherwise so I think really the


---------33:35----------
advantage there is that it's not that


---------33:37----------
you're trying to control your breathing


---------33:38----------
or dispel the anxiety what you're really


---------33:41----------
doing is engaging your mind in the


---------33:42----------
present like that's the advantage of


---------33:44----------
meditation because when you do like the


---------33:45----------
alternate nostril breathing practice


---------33:47----------
it's just like weird and awkward and not


---------33:50----------
simple enough to where your mind really


---------33:52----------
has to pay attention otherwise you're


---------33:53----------
gonna get lost does that make sense and


---------33:55----------
that value yeah because it forces your


---------33:58----------
mind into the present through its


---------33:59----------
difficulty if you guys want another just


---------34:02----------
brilliant exercise to bring your mind


---------34:04----------
fully to the present and conquer all


---------34:06----------
anxiety are you right-handed or


---------34:08----------
left-handed you ready for it brush your


---------34:12----------
teeth with your left hand I'll try that


---------34:16----------
tonight but it's very difficult but the


---------34:18----------
main thing that I want you to pay


---------34:20----------
attention to is do it when you're


---------34:23----------
anxious and then your mind is not gonna


---------34:25----------
have the RAM to be anxious if you brush


---------34:29----------
your teeth with your non-dominant hand


---------34:31----------
because it's just gonna be so hard that


---------34:34----------
like you can't think about anything else


---------34:38----------
I'll give it a go tonight when I feel


---------34:40----------
anxious hopefully I feel like just


---------34:42----------
tonight it somehow we really come full


---------34:43----------
circle because I never thought on


---------34:45----------
streamwriter I'd hear you say hopefully


---------34:46----------
I'll be anxious tonight that's that's


---------34:50----------
letting the tide in and letting it come


---------34:52----------
out right


---------34:52----------
so when you say bizarrely enough


---------34:54----------
hopefully I'll be anxious tonight you're


---------34:57----------
not fighting a war with anxiety anymore


---------34:59----------
I mean if it gives me some other way to


---------35:02----------
deal with it too


---------35:03----------
that's that's beneficial in the long run


---------35:05----------
so if I can try it and learn from it


---------35:07----------
that'll help and if it doesn't work I


---------35:09----------
can come to you tell you didn't work and


---------35:10----------
you absolutely so I think that actually


---------35:12----------
illustrates a fantastic principle in it


---------35:14----------
which is that this is about like it's


---------35:16----------
not about right


---------35:17----------
answers from me and this is why I think


---------35:19----------
you should ignore what doctors tell you


---------35:20----------
and when I tell I mean not like ignore


---------35:22----------
medical advice but you know like don't


---------35:25----------
set your compass to what your doctors


---------35:27----------
tell your even I tell you like this is


---------35:28----------
about what works for you and you have to


---------35:30----------
test it for yourself right you have to


---------35:32----------
see like what works for you there are


---------35:34----------
things that I'm gonna be right about and


---------35:35----------
there are things that I'm gonna be wrong


---------35:36----------
about I'm not like I'm I'm Nishant so I


---------35:38----------
think it's awesome that you're thinking


---------35:40----------
about really like trying this stuff for


---------35:41----------
yourself and you're meditating from time


---------35:43----------
to time and you're figuring out what


---------35:44----------
works and what doesn't so now so that


---------35:49----------
was kind of a quick primer on breath


---------35:51----------
anxiety and sort of how to think about


---------35:53----------
anxiety the other sort of dimension of


---------35:55----------
anxiety that I want to talk a little bit


---------35:57----------
about is that in my experience anxieties


---------36:00----------
actually learned behavior so I think


---------36:04----------
what happened in your case is that like


---------36:06----------
when you were like made fun of in school


---------36:09----------
your brain actually did something very


---------36:12----------
important which is that it recognized


---------36:14----------
that when people are looking at me I'm


---------36:16----------
in danger does that make sense yeah and


---------36:20----------
then what happened is like it learned


---------36:23----------
that lesson and it's still like it


---------36:26----------
learned that lesson so now it's part of


---------36:27----------
your programming so anytime people look


---------36:29----------
at you you feel like you're in danger


---------36:33----------
it's really oddly enough it's that


---------36:36----------
simple so one of the crazy things about


---------36:38----------
anxiety is I think like sure it's an


---------36:40----------
illness and it causes suffering but I


---------36:42----------
think it's important to remember that


---------36:44----------
your brain is not broken your brain is


---------36:47----------
just doing what it knows how to do and


---------36:49----------
unfortunately sometimes it does things


---------36:50----------
that are maladaptive like your brain is


---------36:53----------
just trying to protect you from danger


---------36:54----------
because some part of you like it when


---------36:57----------
when you feel judged by random people on


---------36:59----------
the street it's because your brain


---------37:01----------
remembered that you used to get judged


---------37:03----------
by other people and that getting judged


---------37:05----------
is dangerous and bad so let's go home


---------37:08----------
where no one can see you so what is your


---------37:13----------
brain actually doing there I guess as


---------37:17----------
you said it's trying to protect me and


---------37:19----------
prepare me for whatever the outcome may


---------37:21----------
be so oddly enough I want you to rethink


---------37:23----------
your anxiety and this helps you to form


---------37:25----------
a truce with it is understand that your


---------37:27----------
anxiety is like it's like a pit bull


---------37:28----------
that doesn't know what's dangerous


---------37:30----------
and what isn't it's like a blind pitbull


---------37:32----------
so like it can't see anyone but like it


---------37:34----------
knows someone's in the room and it's


---------37:36----------
default mode is to like attack and what


---------37:39----------
you really need to do is like calm down


---------37:40----------
the pitbull and like understand that the


---------37:42----------
pitbull is there for reason it's not


---------37:43----------
trying to screw you over it's really


---------37:45----------
just trying to protect you because when


---------37:47----------
you when you retreat from the outside


---------37:49----------
world and you go home like how do you


---------37:50----------
feel Kong's come yeah right so that's


---------37:54----------
your brain like trying to help you out


---------37:57----------
and it just doesn't understand that it's


---------37:59----------
doing a bad job because it's like it's


---------38:01----------
like a reflex


---------38:03----------
so tell me any any questions from you


---------38:08----------
well I'm wondering so so so when you get


---------38:12----------
into these situations is there something


---------38:13----------
you can sort of I mean I guess this


---------38:14----------
might be a little situational for me


---------38:16----------
specifically or other people but is


---------38:18----------
there something you can tell the pitbull


---------38:20----------
something you can do to actively like


---------38:22----------
should I say just don't worry about it


---------38:23----------
they're probably not thinking that you


---------38:25----------
know something that negative so if you


---------38:27----------
say don't worry about it they're


---------38:29----------
probably not thinking something negative


---------38:30----------
is that making a truce with or fighting


---------38:36----------
a war with your anxiety I guess kind of


---------38:39----------
a planning work because see like for


---------38:41----------
myself typically I I put myself into


---------38:43----------
their shoes again and I say to myself


---------38:45----------
you know normally I'm not looking at


---------38:47----------
someone and immediately judging


---------38:48----------
everything about them I don't know them


---------38:49----------
it's not my problems so I try to think


---------38:51----------
that that's that's the other person -


---------38:53----------
they looked at me maybe they just


---------38:54----------
glanced my way they they think nothing


---------38:56----------
of it so I try to keep that as my


---------38:58----------
mentality when I start feeling hurried


---------39:00----------
about social I think you're you're using


---------39:02----------
logic right you're using rational


---------39:04----------
thinking to combat your feeling of fear


---------39:08----------
that reacts sometimes so like but that


---------39:11----------
is I think fundamentally creating


---------39:13----------
tension in fighting a war so I think


---------39:15----------
oddly enough if you want it like how do


---------39:18----------
you calm down a blind pit bull that's


---------39:19----------
upset that someone is in the room give


---------39:24----------
it a give it a treat so I think that's


---------39:26----------
maybe like distraction or playing a


---------39:28----------
video game what else can you do


---------39:29----------
yeah introduce it sure's and maybe do


---------39:37----------
you have dogs


---------39:38----------
my sister has two so how do you calm


---------39:41----------
down dogs that are upset like does she


---------39:42----------
actually just pull out a treat every


---------39:43----------
time they freak out


---------39:45----------
now I mean one of them is very energetic


---------39:47----------
so we just kind of pull them to the


---------39:48----------
corner and hold on to him and try to you


---------39:50----------
know go okay okay hold on you're


---------39:52----------
glossing over the the juicy part how do


---------39:54----------
you try to calm him down


---------39:55----------
oh yeah we pull him somewhere else we


---------39:59----------
bring him somewhere else and sort of


---------40:00----------
take his mind off of whatever case


---------40:02----------
that's like going home so we're gonna


---------40:04----------
steer clear of that solution for a


---------40:05----------
minute well again we typically just the


---------40:13----------
best way of doing it is kind of like


---------40:14----------
yanking on her and hold on so you're


---------40:17----------
doing it you're glossing over the good


---------40:19----------
part how do you comfort her we talk to


---------40:22----------
her come there we go right so that's


---------40:27----------
what you need to do to your anxiety you


---------40:29----------
need to say hey buddy I know you're


---------40:31----------
freaking out right now and I know that


---------40:34----------
you're like like I know that you're


---------40:36----------
scared and I know that you think that


---------40:37----------
we're in danger but actually this is the


---------40:39----------
mailman he comes every day and and you


---------40:43----------
know like I understand that you're


---------40:44----------
feeling the way that you're feeling but


---------40:46----------
like hey why don't we just calm down a


---------40:47----------
little bit it's not that you're wrong


---------40:49----------
it's just that like this is not actually


---------40:52----------
the situation that you instinctively


---------40:54----------
think it is and let's remember that when


---------40:56----------
we're walking around and we look at


---------40:58----------
someone we have to look somewhere and if


---------41:01----------
we're walking down the street we're


---------41:02----------
gonna generally be looking at people


---------41:04----------
ahead of us and we're gonna have to see


---------41:06----------
people yeah right but like I think it's


---------41:09----------
important to be like compassionate


---------41:11----------
towards yourself and like be


---------41:12----------
understanding and try to calm that calm


---------41:15----------
that anxiety down by like petting it you


---------41:18----------
know and sort of like being kind to it


---------41:20----------
and sort of acknowledging that hey like


---------41:21----------
this is the tide rolling in you're like


---------41:23----------
you're allowed to like you know ruin our


---------41:25----------
sandcastle but at some point you're


---------41:28----------
gonna you're gonna kind of go back out


---------41:29----------
and so let the anxiety rise within you


---------41:32----------
try to be calm towards it don't try to


---------41:36----------
calm yourself down this is very


---------41:38----------
different like these are two very


---------41:39----------
different things don't force it down


---------41:41----------
which is what calming yourself down is


---------41:42----------
be calm towards your anxiety and


---------41:44----------
acknowledge that oh like this is you


---------41:46----------
freaking out like I understand that this


---------41:48----------
is like a protective mechanism that's


---------41:50----------
arising within me but I also know that


---------41:52----------
this mechanism isn't entirely


---------41:53----------
appropriate or is my anxiety action


---------41:58----------
like is it picking up on something so


---------42:00----------
you can sort of be like okay like what


---------42:02----------
are you concerned about and think


---------42:03----------
through it for a minute like is this


---------42:05----------
person like is there someone who's like


---------42:06----------
walking behind me who's like kind of


---------42:08----------
creepy you know like because because


---------42:10----------
remember that anxiety and as someone


---------42:13----------
you're very empathic so you pick up a


---------42:16----------
lot like even when I fake a facial


---------42:18----------
expression you're able to tell what's


---------42:19----------
underneath the facial expression so I


---------42:21----------
think the odd thing about your anxiety


---------42:23----------
is you may be picking up stuff that


---------42:25----------
other people don't pick up and you may


---------42:27----------
actually be right so I think the other


---------42:29----------
really scary thing is that if there's


---------42:32----------
it's possibility that people are judging


---------42:34----------
you great how does that make you feel


---------42:40----------
well I mean if I'm right it might be


---------42:43----------
easier to sort of I guess kind of


---------42:46----------
understand where they're coming from if


---------42:47----------
I felt the same thing at times so if my


---------42:50----------
goal is to understand and calm my


---------42:54----------
anxiety rather than myself then it might


---------42:56----------
be easier to just push aside their their


---------42:59----------
their opinions or whatever into yeah


---------43:01----------
absolutely right so the other cool thing


---------43:03----------
about anxiety is like what you're doing


---------43:05----------
is you're trying to tell it that it's


---------43:06----------
wrong but the other thing that you can


---------43:09----------
tell it is not that it's wrong but that


---------43:12----------
it's not as important as you think it is


---------43:14----------
like you're right but it just happens to


---------43:15----------
be that I'm never going to see this


---------43:17----------
person again so even if they are judging


---------43:18----------
me like okay who cares right and as you


---------43:22----------
start to grow in confidence and things


---------43:24----------
like that that's gonna get easier


---------43:26----------
that make sense yeah other questions


---------43:33----------
can't think of any right off the top of


---------43:36----------
my head now okay okay so you said that


---------43:41----------
is it okay if we kind of switch gears


---------43:44----------
for a little bit or we s we've been


---------43:45----------
talking for about 45 minutes but are you


---------43:48----------
open to talking for maybe about 15-20


---------43:50----------
minutes longer yeah sure so the other


---------43:53----------
thing that I want to kind of dive into


---------43:55----------
is sort of the roots of anxiety and


---------43:57----------
remember how I was saying that like


---------43:59----------
anxiety is a learned behavior so for a


---------44:01----------
lot of people disarming their anxiety


---------44:05----------
goes to sort of the root of where their


---------44:07----------
anxiety formed and kind of like


---------44:09----------
processing that


---------44:10----------
so you say that you've always been


---------44:13----------
concerned about how other people are


---------44:14----------
judging you or you'll always sort of


---------44:17----------
remember being anxious for the most part


---------44:21----------
yeah and you help me understand like


---------44:23----------
were there things that that happened


---------44:25----------
when you were younger like so it sounds


---------44:27----------
like bullying was a big part of it we're


---------44:29----------
getting picked on were there other


---------44:30----------
things that sort of happened that you


---------44:31----------
think sort of taught you that the world


---------44:33----------
is a dangerous place and that judgment


---------44:34----------
is bad I grew up with a very religious


---------44:40----------
and somewhat closed-minded grandmother


---------44:41----------
so that may have affected things she was


---------44:44----------
I don't wanna say she's a very positive


---------44:46----------
person growing up she was a little more


---------44:48----------
negative so I think she was somewhat


---------44:50----------
judgmental of others and very concerned


---------44:52----------
with with people we spent time with


---------44:54----------
growing up my sister and I were raised


---------44:55----------
by our grandmother because my my parents


---------44:57----------
divorced when I was very young so we


---------44:59----------
were raised by her in a very religious


---------45:01----------
household people we were friends with


---------45:03----------
she was very particular about pretty


---------45:06----------
much anything we did who we spent time


---------45:08----------
with in that kind of thing so I think I


---------45:09----------
grew up in an atmosphere where judgment


---------45:11----------
was quite normal and she was British and


---------45:12----------
I think showing emotion and stuff is not


---------45:15----------
really common in a British household I


---------45:17----------
think so that that may have been


---------45:18----------
difficult as well when I didn't know how


---------45:19----------
to bring up what I was feeling or


---------45:21----------
something for fear that she might


---------45:22----------
misunderstand or or it just seemed


---------45:27----------
uncomfortable I guess what was


---------45:28----------
uncomfortable about it it was just not


---------45:32----------
something that we discussed often I


---------45:33----------
guess the personal feeling someone oh it


---------45:35----------
wasn't a huge topic of discussion in my


---------45:38----------
household and so can you give me an


---------45:41----------
example of like how your mom was I mean


---------45:43----------
your grandmother was sort of you


---------45:46----------
mentioned like kind of close-minded


---------45:47----------
judgmental like very concerned about who


---------45:49----------
you hung out with like can you I'm sure


---------45:52----------
do you mind sharing an example about


---------45:53----------
that well my best friend is a lesbian am


---------45:58----------
i grown there was very against that


---------46:01----------
mentality that that that that you know


---------46:03----------
that type of person she's I never


---------46:06----------
mentioned it to my grandmother for that


---------46:07----------
reason is because I'm worried of how


---------46:09----------
she'll she'll react if she'll be upset


---------46:11----------
because she's not my best friend since I


---------46:13----------
mean I've known my best friend for about


---------46:15----------
20 years so my grandmother knew her when


---------46:16----------
we were we were we little kids at school


---------46:18----------
so it was sort of a secret yeah so what


---------46:22----------
are you afraid of


---------46:24----------
so it sounds like you're not you haven't


---------46:26----------
shared this with your grandmother what


---------46:27----------
are you afraid of what are you afraid of


---------46:29----------
I guess disapproval I obviously very


---------46:34----------
much care about my grandmother and her


---------46:35----------
opinions and how she feels about things


---------46:37----------
and obviously my best friend is one of


---------46:39----------
the most important people in my life so


---------46:41----------
I don't want there to be a rift or if my


---------46:44----------
best friend for example sometimes I'll


---------46:47----------
invite her to Christmas dinners


---------46:48----------
Thanksgiving dinners and if my grandma


---------46:51----------
found out about this there's a chance


---------46:53----------
maybe she would just say no not allow


---------46:56----------
her to come out anymore so I'd prefer to


---------46:57----------
kind of keep things from being hostile


---------47:00----------
so it sounds like you're I'm gonna need


---------47:10----------
a second sure you're very good at hiding


---------47:21----------
yep I'm pretty good at keeping all the


---------47:25----------
things about myself that I want to keep


---------47:28----------
private I keep them private well I think


---------47:31----------
maybe a defense mechanism I'm not sure


---------47:33----------
but my goodness that sounds very Rodian


---------47:36----------
yeah so yeah that's what II do you so


---------47:46----------
you also hide a fair amount on stream


---------47:48----------
right I'd say so yeah there's you know I


---------47:53----------
I want my stream environment to be


---------47:56----------
something that's that's happy and


---------47:57----------
positive as well so when I stream I want


---------47:59----------
other people to feel good not upset so


---------48:01----------
if I if I have any issues in my life the


---------48:03----------
stream is a place I can go to not


---------48:06----------
necessarily ignore them but be happy and


---------48:09----------
kind of forget it a little bit till I go


---------48:12----------
back to reality I guess off stream so


---------48:14----------
it's it's like a happy place to go what


---------48:16----------
do you think about that I think it's


---------48:20----------
nice sometimes if you're overwhelmed by


---------48:21----------
something to have somewhere you can go


---------48:23----------
like it's maybe not the best thing to


---------48:24----------
just kind of push things aside but I


---------48:27----------
mean if I'm feeling overwhelmed it's


---------48:29----------
nice to have people to talk to laugh


---------48:31----------
with kind of focus on them if they have


---------48:33----------
issues instead of just on myself and if


---------48:36----------
I can help


---------48:37----------
maybe it'll give me ideas for how I


---------48:39----------
could help myself if they have similar


---------48:41----------
you know similar issues in their life so


---------48:43----------
I think what we're running across is


---------48:45----------
that streaming is actually like a coping


---------48:46----------
mechanism for you does something I think


---------48:50----------
the challenge you know the problem with


---------48:51----------
coping mechanisms is if you use one you


---------48:55----------
know you know what you have to do the


---------48:56----------
next day work on the issues you that's


---------49:01----------
the problem right is working on your


---------49:02----------
issues is different from coping so like


---------49:05----------
coping implies that like you're like


---------49:08----------
covering up or like you know


---------49:10----------
decompressing like something but then


---------49:12----------
you're still hiding so what I'm what I'm


---------49:16----------
concerned about for you and RF is


---------49:17----------
actually that like I don't know I think


---------49:20----------
a lot of you mentioned early on that you


---------49:22----------
have some anxiety about life I think the


---------49:24----------
anxiety is rooted in some kind of


---------49:26----------
inauthenticity it's possible yeah what


---------49:31----------
are you what are you hiding like what


---------49:36----------
are you what are you hiding about


---------49:37----------
yourself from yourself


---------49:46----------
that's that's kind of a tough one to


---------49:48----------
understand I feel like it's a really


---------49:50----------
large thing I guess to some degree I'm


---------49:53----------
not I don't like I'm not satisfied with


---------49:57----------
myself entirely which i think is a lot


---------50:00----------
of where the confidence issue comes as


---------50:02----------
well as that I have a family that's


---------50:04----------
fairly accomplished as people and I'm I


---------50:08----------
mean I'm still young but I feel like I


---------50:10----------
could have gotten more out of life thus


---------50:13----------
far I feel like I do a lot of things


---------50:17----------
that I really enjoy but I still feel


---------50:18----------
like there's a lot more I could do so


---------50:20----------
maybe I expect too much of myself or I


---------50:22----------
put too much pressure on myself so I


---------50:24----------
want you to notice what you're doing


---------50:26----------
there that's you're fighting a little


---------50:27----------
war in your own head you see that yeah


---------50:31----------
that's not good


---------50:34----------
because I think what's happened is


---------50:36----------
you've gotten so it's become so in


---------50:38----------
siding has become so instinctive for you


---------50:40----------
that you do it all the time and then you


---------50:43----------
kind of like try to justify you're


---------50:46----------
trying to justify me you're trying to


---------50:48----------
like you're trying to be like


---------50:49----------
encouraging like a friend like you're


---------50:51----------
trying to reassure yourself that oh like


---------50:53----------
even though you feel like a failure


---------50:55----------
you're not really a failure right you


---------50:59----------
you like reassure yourself and you say


---------51:01----------
that you're and by the way you can tell


---------51:02----------
me to go [ __ ] myself at any point and


---------51:06----------
also we can stop at any point but I'm


---------51:09----------
concerned that what what's actually


---------51:10----------
going on is like you try to you try to


---------51:12----------
like pep yourself up and you you you


---------51:16----------
feel some degree of like you're not


---------51:18----------
maybe you haven't lived up to the


---------51:20----------
expectations that you set for yourself


---------51:21----------
you haven't lived up to the perceived


---------51:24----------
expectations of your family and at the


---------51:28----------
same time you kind of tell yourself oh


---------51:29----------
like I am having lots of fun though but


---------51:32----------
that feels kind of fake to me


---------51:34----------
mm-hmm does it feel fake to you I mean


---------51:39----------
the fun part it's ya know it does it's


---------51:43----------
hard to really understand how I even


---------51:45----------
feel about these things honestly I've


---------51:46----------
never fully tried to so you guys know


---------51:48----------
what's with it know it's hard for you to


---------51:50----------
understand because you're so good at


---------51:53----------
hiding that might be it yeah


---------51:57----------
so you're trying to detect yourself but


---------52:00----------
your self levels like a hundred so like


---------52:03----------
and so if you really want to understand


---------52:06----------
yourself you have to start by like


---------52:07----------
recognizing that like there's a part of


---------52:09----------
you there's a part of your mind that's


---------52:11----------
just really good at stealth mm-hmm and


---------52:14----------
your my guess is that part of your


---------52:16----------
directionless 'no siz because you're


---------52:17----------
kind of trying to move forward but like


---------52:19----------
you're not quite sure where to start and


---------52:21----------
i think that you you have lots of good


---------52:24----------
ideas but the problem is like you're not


---------52:26----------
sure if the i-i think i imagine you have


---------52:28----------
a lot of good ideas cuz it's clear to me


---------52:30----------
that you're very smart but i think the


---------52:32----------
challenge here is that you don't know if


---------52:34----------
the idea is gonna move you in the


---------52:36----------
direction that you want to move like i


---------52:38----------
think you're good at figuring out right


---------52:40----------
yeah this will get me from point A to


---------52:42----------
point B this will get me from point A to


---------52:44----------
point C but the challenge is you don't


---------52:46----------
know if you want to go to point B or you


---------52:47----------
don't want to go if you want to go to


---------52:48----------
point C so yeah that's a challenge is


---------52:52----------
not one of capability it's one of


---------52:54----------
direction so you know where Direction


---------53:00----------
comes from from your somewhere right


---------53:06----------
like so the question is like what do you


---------53:07----------
want to do see I I don't know that's the


---------53:13----------
that's that's where the confusion comes


---------53:15----------
from is that I feel like that's a


---------53:17----------
something that maybe doesn't weigh on


---------53:19----------
everybody my age but it's the future is


---------53:23----------
you know that's that's a long time to


---------53:25----------
think about that's I don't want to I


---------53:27----------
don't want to go in a direction that's


---------53:29----------
bad for me I don't know necessarily what


---------53:31----------
direction will make me happier or I mean


---------53:34----------
the hiding thing probably I try to just


---------53:36----------
avoid thinking about it and kind of


---------53:38----------
going from you know one thing together


---------53:40----------
as you said in just something that seems


---------53:41----------
like accessible arn or if I want to


---------53:43----------
commend you for streaming because I


---------53:45----------
think the challenge here is that I think


---------53:47----------
at times in your life you've known what


---------53:49----------
you wanted to do but you haven't let


---------53:50----------
yourself want to do it well to be honest


---------53:57----------
streaming was one of those things a long


---------53:58----------
time ago that I wanted to do a lot more


---------54:00----------
of and got sort of afraid of it and at


---------54:03----------
one point or another I just sort of


---------54:04----------
hunkered down and said okay just click


---------54:07----------
the go live button start doing this


---------54:08----------
consistently and yeah


---------54:10----------
where he goes and I think it has that's


---------54:11----------
what I mean so I think streaming is a


---------54:13----------
good idea but I wonder like I'm


---------54:14----------
imagining living in a house with your


---------54:16----------
grandmother and you being like 15 or 16


---------54:18----------
years old and you actually knowing at


---------54:21----------
some point when other people are


---------54:22----------
figuring things out like you're like hey


---------54:24----------
I think I want to do this but then you


---------54:27----------
reflexively recognize that that's not an


---------54:29----------
acceptable answer and so you go back


---------54:34----------
into self and you've been you've been


---------54:37----------
stealth for so long that you don't even


---------54:39----------
know how to find yourself a what yeah


---------54:42----------
that's right though I I don't think I've


---------54:44----------
ever really had a specific path that I


---------54:48----------
was really interested in I grew up I


---------54:50----------
wanted to be a chef for a long time


---------54:53----------
I love I love cooking I like the idea of


---------54:55----------
like learning about food and alcohol -


---------54:58----------
over the last few years I've had some


---------55:00----------
experiences going through really nice


---------55:02----------
bars experiencing the creative side of


---------55:04----------
these things has always been really


---------55:05----------
intriguing to me I don't love the idea


---------55:09----------
of working in a kitchen which was one of


---------55:11----------
the things that really deterred me from


---------55:12----------
progressing for the I took a very brief


---------55:15----------
I took a culinary arts program once very


---------55:18----------
briefly and I I discovered that the


---------55:20----------
kitchen atmosphere itself was not


---------55:21----------
appealing to me and then so I think my


---------55:24----------
life has been split in two interests


---------55:27----------
that are really that are kind of very


---------55:29----------
distant from each other in a sense I


---------55:31----------
really love gaming I love eSports I love


---------55:33----------
the idea of streaming and whatnot and


---------55:35----------
I've always kind of thought that that


---------55:37----------
would be better as a as a hobby


---------55:39----------
something as you said as well as like


---------55:41----------
maybe a coping mechanism outside of real


---------55:42----------
life I get something that kind of just


---------55:45----------
is a distraction I guess and then my


---------55:47----------
interest in food and the culinary arts I


---------55:50----------
guess is something else that's always


---------55:51----------
really interested me but I don't know


---------55:53----------
how to like which one I'm more


---------55:55----------
interested in which one is more pursuing


---------55:57----------
the gaming would be better as a hobby


---------55:59----------
where did you learn that I don't really


---------56:04----------
think it's something that I've learned


---------56:05----------
so much as it's it's always been that


---------56:07----------
thing that has been the hobby for me so


---------56:08----------
I'm a little afraid of creating a job


---------56:10----------
out of it and getting tired of it and


---------56:12----------
not having something that I would want


---------56:14----------
to fall back on to like something that's


---------56:15----------
there is a yeah so let's let's be clear


---------56:19----------
there's a difference between a good idea


---------56:21----------
and what you want


---------56:24----------
mm-hmm so I think you're probably so you


---------56:28----------
smiled when I said that so I think you


---------56:30----------
understood something that I'm trying to


---------56:31----------
tell you and what am I trying to tell


---------56:33----------
you yeah right and a lot of people are


---------56:40----------
very passionate about it my friends who


---------56:42----------
are involved in gaming any sports and I


---------56:45----------
guess for the most part the ones that I


---------56:47----------
do know haven't really gotten sick of


---------56:49----------
gaming because they work in the industry


---------56:51----------
but I guess that's always a fear of mine


---------56:53----------
is that if I worked in the industry or I


---------56:55----------
did things that related to gaming I


---------56:58----------
might get so yes so remember what was so


---------57:00----------
but enough what's your problem is it


---------57:02----------
that is it success or direction


---------57:07----------
direction


---------57:08----------
what is your reason to not go into the


---------57:11----------
gaming industry is it success or


---------57:17----------
directions honestly for one it's well


---------57:20----------
direction I'd say mostly I mean maybe


---------57:21----------
success but I think is what I'm hearing


---------57:23----------
what I'm hearing is that you're afraid


---------57:24----------
it may not work or what I'm not hearing


---------57:26----------
is like as what you're telling me is I


---------57:27----------
like gaming I'm interested in gaming


---------57:29----------
I've always liked gaming I've always


---------57:31----------
been a nerd and what I'm well yeah but


---------57:34----------
it's for me it's one it's it's the fear


---------57:38----------
of back in I guess about four years five


---------57:42----------
five years ago or so I got hired at riot


---------57:45----------
and then I was denied the visa to work


---------57:49----------
there I'm Canadian and it's it's not


---------57:52----------
easy to get into gaming necessarily


---------57:55----------
where I live or or have the option for a


---------57:58----------
visa or something like that where I live


---------57:59----------
so I kind of I accepted that I guess and


---------58:03----------
just wanted to focus on something else


---------58:04----------
and the other passion I had was cooking


---------58:06----------
drinks whatever so I thought maybe I


---------58:08----------
could lead towards that or something but


---------58:09----------
I think it always has been a confusion


---------58:11----------
I've been very yes and I think I


---------58:14----------
understand why you're confused because I


---------58:16----------
think what you're doing is you're


---------58:17----------
confusing in your own mind what you want


---------58:20----------
with what you think you can achieve and


---------58:23----------
that leads to a hell of a lot of


---------58:25----------
confusion so this is really important to


---------58:27----------
understand there's a lot of peace and


---------58:30----------
strength and confidence in knowing that


---------58:34----------
you want something and also


---------58:36----------
accepting that you can't have it but


---------58:39----------
you're not doing that what you're doing


---------58:42----------
is you're saying because this is hard


---------58:44----------
I'm not gonna let myself want it and so


---------58:48----------
you're stuck in limbo because you're not


---------58:50----------
allowed to fail because you're not


---------58:51----------
allowed to try because you made you're


---------58:54----------
afraid that you won't be successful and


---------58:57----------
so you're kind of like you're in limbo


---------59:00----------
like I don't think you're I think you


---------59:02----------
call it confuse but really what I'm


---------59:04----------
detecting from you is like limbo you're


---------59:06----------
just like floating without any like


---------59:09----------
you're not confused you're just like


---------59:11----------
stuck outside of some gravitational


---------59:14----------
orbit and just floating in space and not


---------59:16----------
going anywhere


---------59:17----------
so I think the first thing that you've


---------59:19----------
got to do is like understand what it is


---------59:20----------
that you want in divorce in your mind


---------59:23----------
whether it's a good idea or a bad idea


---------59:25----------
there are things that you want to do


---------59:27----------
like there's something that I want to do


---------59:29----------
which i think is a terrible idea so I


---------59:32----------
want to hold another retreat for video


---------59:33----------
gamers and I just want to do it like I


---------59:35----------
want to rent a house for 10 days or like


---------59:38----------
a farm so I was talking to someone about


---------59:40----------
this and they're like yeah get a farm


---------59:41----------
and like don't get a house get a farm


---------59:43----------
and I want to tell the Internet that if


---------59:45----------
you're struggling in life in your game


---------59:46----------
or just show up and we'll figure it out


---------59:50----------
and like I don't know if no one's gonna


---------59:52----------
show up or 20 people are gonna show up


---------59:53----------
or 50 people are gonna show up I don't


---------59:55----------
know if someone's gonna show up with


---------59:56----------
lice like that's a problem like there


---------59:58----------
are all kinds of reasons why this is a


---------60:00----------
bad idea but the fact that it's a bad


---------60:03----------
idea has nothing to do with whether I


---------60:04----------
want to do it or I don't want to do it


---------60:06----------
does that make sense and I think what


---------60:09----------
you're doing like I want you to really


---------60:10----------
think about this and let me know I mean


---------60:12----------
it can be hard but I would encourage you


---------60:14----------
to actually go back and watch this


---------60:16----------
because I think what you're doing is


---------60:18----------
you're confusing what you want with what


---------60:19----------
you think is a good idea and those are


---------60:21----------
completely different


---------60:27----------
I honestly I'm not entirely sure if I


---------60:32----------
know what I want yeah honestly like it's


---------60:34----------
like you do because I think anytime you


---------60:37----------
get a vet like anytime you have a little


---------60:39----------
sprout of a want what happens is you're


---------60:43----------
judgmental you're highly accomplished


---------60:45----------
family your set of values and what is


---------60:48----------
worth it or not worth it steps in and


---------60:51----------
squashes it okay sounds great so then


---------60:56----------
like of course you don't know what you


---------60:57----------
want because you haven't let it grow


---------60:59----------
right like you judge it based on its its


---------61:02----------
likelihood of success and then you


---------61:04----------
that's the that's the beginning and end


---------61:06----------
of the discussion so it's like either


---------61:08----------
either you you know Culinary Academy or


---------61:11----------
like like is it like what is it like


---------61:12----------
medical school engineering like what are


---------61:14----------
the things like you just want to be a


---------61:17----------
lawyer as a kid but I didn't think so so


---------61:21----------
this is where you've got to be careful


---------61:22----------
because you've been conditioned by your


---------61:24----------
family too and you're not you're not


---------61:26----------
allowing yourself to like want the


---------61:29----------
things that you want and so the little


---------61:31----------
vestiges of what you want you know like


---------61:33----------
the ones that didn't scale up stealth at


---------61:35----------
level one got squashed and so the only


---------61:37----------
ones that have been allowed to grow are


---------61:39----------
the ones that skilled up stealth and


---------61:40----------
then every time they level up if they


---------61:41----------
get caught they get destroyed by your


---------61:45----------
judgmental mind so they have to like


---------61:46----------
level up stealth and then we end up with


---------61:47----------
stealth stealth 100 and then you're


---------61:49----------
scratching yourself and you're like I


---------61:50----------
don't know what I want I mean that


---------61:56----------
sounds pretty accurate to me okay well


---------62:00----------
unfortunately I don't have as simple of


---------62:03----------
a fix for you as your anxiety when it


---------62:05----------
comes to this you know I think you know


---------62:08----------
I would really think about reflecting or


---------62:11----------
writing or seeing a therapist there are


---------62:13----------
a lot of different things that you can


---------62:14----------
do I mean do you have a sense of like


---------62:18----------
how you can get started and


---------62:19----------
understanding what you want maybe what


---------62:25----------
are you thinking I guess like the thing


---------62:28----------
that I I feel like I kind of want two


---------62:31----------
different things I and I feel like one


---------62:34----------
is a little less accessible so I'm sort


---------62:36----------
of leaning towards the other thing and


---------62:37----------
it's it's something that I'm working


---------62:39----------
towards it's just


---------62:41----------
I guess I still have some doubt in my


---------62:42----------
mind but I guess I need to work on one


---------62:45----------
of these I forget which eSports team I


---------62:47----------
think Philly fusion they've got a


---------62:51----------
professional chef right yeah no but most


---------62:56----------
of the teams do have confessional chefs


---------62:58----------
but again there is for me with gaming


---------63:01----------
it's always been a big concern of visas


---------63:03----------
or something like that I don't know how


---------63:04----------
accessible they are living in Canada


---------63:06----------
might make things more difficult if


---------63:07----------
they've got someone in the US who's


---------63:09----------
really easy to get ahold of then why


---------63:12----------
would they take someone from Canada why


---------63:13----------
would they spend the money on the visa


---------63:14----------
that kind of thing so I think it's it's


---------63:15----------
doubt that I've let kind of overwhelm me


---------63:17----------
and sort of deter me from pursuing


---------63:20----------
something like that yeah that makes


---------63:24----------
sense I think I think doubt is a big


---------63:25----------
problem right so it's the chance of


---------63:27----------
success that's preventing the low chance


---------63:30----------
of success that you perceive that's


---------63:32----------
preventing you from trying which is a


---------63:34----------
really really paralyzing way to live


---------63:36----------
life right so like you're falling into


---------63:40----------
something called the planning fallacy


---------63:41----------
which is that you're making a plan and


---------63:44----------
then you're choosing to act based on the


---------63:46----------
success of that plan you know what the


---------63:47----------
problem with that is when do we make


---------63:49----------
plans before the and so yeah so how good


---------63:57----------
is your plan at the beginning versus at


---------63:59----------
the end I mean my the majority of my


---------64:05----------
family works for the government that


---------64:06----------
kind of thing so there their mentality


---------64:08----------
is even if you don't love your job at


---------64:10----------
least it's stable at least it's you know


---------64:13----------
sensible yes and then do things that you


---------64:16----------
want to do on this so I think that's


---------64:17----------
fine but then at least you have to be


---------64:18----------
honest remember what I was saying


---------64:20----------
earlier that like you have to be honest


---------64:21----------
with what you want it's it's one thing


---------64:23----------
to be honest about what you want and to


---------64:25----------
give it up it's another thing to not let


---------64:27----------
yourself want it because you don't think


---------64:29----------
it's viable right so like does that make


---------64:33----------
sense to you and so I think what you're


---------64:36----------
the problem is that you're sort of


---------64:38----------
forming a plan but like when you try


---------64:39----------
something you're gonna learn all kinds


---------64:41----------
of things along the way that you didn't


---------64:43----------
expect like well as I said right now I


---------64:46----------
am I'm working towards some sort of


---------64:48----------
discuss it on streem because I'm kind of


---------64:49----------
don't there's no people who live in my


---------64:52----------
city who make me uncomfortable but I'm


---------64:53----------
taking a class for something that


---------64:55----------
is one of the things that is really


---------64:56----------
interested we don't want for a long time


---------64:58----------
so I figure I kind of just figured screw


---------65:00----------
it if it'll work for me I'm working I


---------65:03----------
just started a job yesterday that has to


---------65:05----------
do with this thing so I'm I'm


---------65:06----------
progressing towards something that I've


---------65:08----------
put off for a long time and sort of had


---------65:11----------
interest in and just didn't want to do


---------65:12----------
it for here of it so you're doing it all


---------65:14----------
right so like I think the most important


---------65:16----------
words that you just said out of


---------65:19----------
everything that you just said is the two


---------65:21----------
words


---------65:21----------
screw it I'm just gonna do it that's


---------65:24----------
that's what you want to do right and if


---------65:27----------
we think about like gamers like what


---------65:28----------
keeps them stuck it's their inability to


---------65:30----------
say screw it like if you're you know if


---------65:33----------
you there's someone that you have a


---------65:35----------
crush on and you're like afraid they're


---------65:37----------
gonna reject you like in order to move


---------65:38----------
forward you've got to say screw it and


---------65:40----------
you've got a truck yeah you've got to


---------65:43----------
open yourself up for failure and that's


---------65:46----------
like that's the problem is that people


---------65:48----------
are not willing to say I mean like this


---------65:50----------
whole stream started because one day I


---------65:52----------
said people told me like if you if you


---------65:54----------
go online and you start talking to


---------65:56----------
people about their feelings like you


---------65:58----------
could get sued and so I've disclaimers


---------66:00----------
and stuff but like yeah I could get


---------66:01----------
scooped suit they're like all kinds of


---------66:03----------
reasons why this is a bad idea like it's


---------66:05----------
a bad idea to do this and I think it's


---------66:07----------
the right thing to do so I'm saying


---------66:09----------
screw it and I'm doing this and I love


---------66:10----------
it


---------66:11----------
like this is fun for me and I think it's


---------66:16----------
great that you're saying screw it and I


---------66:17----------
think the more that you say that I think


---------66:19----------
the better off you'll be but you know


---------66:20----------
don't go overboard obviously like but


---------66:23----------
yeah I mean I think that's not the


---------66:25----------
concern I think your your pragma your


---------66:26----------
your you know your personality spectrum


---------66:29----------
is so far in the pragmatic side that you


---------66:32----------
can let leak like you can let loose and


---------66:34----------
you're still not going to cross like the


---------66:35----------
50 percent you know you're still you're


---------66:38----------
still gonna be pragmatic in the way that


---------66:40----------
you do things and I'm sure that you've


---------66:41----------
done a lot even though you've said screw


---------66:43----------
it I would bet money that you've done a


---------66:45----------
lot of calculation about what you're


---------66:46----------
doing and you've optimized your chances


---------66:48----------
of success I mean that's why I'm taking


---------66:52----------
a course for it and what not to learn it


---------66:53----------
before I kind of dive into the deep end


---------66:55----------
of it so okay so thanks a lot Anna I


---------66:59----------
think we'll turn things I don't know


---------67:01----------
sometimes people may have questions for


---------67:02----------
you so let's kind of actually turn to


---------67:04----------
questions if that's okay do you have


---------67:05----------
actually do you have questions before we


---------67:06----------
kind of switch switch gears


---------67:10----------
um any less I think I think I'm good I


---------67:14----------
think I'll get on the questo case for


---------67:16----------
now I think of anything I'll hit you up


---------67:18----------
so we're gonna see I'm gonna ask twitch


---------67:20----------
chat if people have thoughts or


---------67:22----------
questions for either you or me and then


---------67:24----------
if not if no one has questions for you


---------67:26----------
then we'll sort of end the call if


---------67:28----------
that's okay so if people are asking


---------67:32----------
first like what's your scream schedule


---------67:36----------
well right now I'm taking school classes


---------67:39----------
so most of the time I'll stream Sunday


---------67:43----------
nights Tuesday nights Monday nights


---------67:46----------
mostly nighttime when I'm done classes


---------67:49----------
so most days of the week I'm gonna be


---------67:51----------
working Friday and Saturday nights so


---------67:53----------
for the foreseeable future at this sort


---------67:56----------
of new job that I started so I'm not


---------67:57----------
gonna be streaming then but every other


---------67:59----------
night of the week I try my best to get a


---------68:00----------
stream in here and there so that I can


---------68:02----------
sort of you know have something positive


---------68:05----------
in my life that makes me feel great so


---------68:08----------
it sounds like most weeknights so that's


---------68:10----------
awesome and then so domination time asks


---------68:14----------
regarding coping versus dealing with


---------68:16----------
issues when should when should we do


---------68:19----------
coping coping must have some good


---------68:21----------
positive functions right absolutely so


---------68:23----------
remember that like coping is a band-aid


---------68:25----------
so when you're feeling like you can't


---------68:27----------
solve the root of your problem like all


---------68:29----------
the time so as a human being your mind


---------68:32----------
like you need some way to function so


---------68:34----------
like it's fine for us to talk about you


---------68:37----------
know Anna's like how she doesn't know


---------68:39----------
what she wants in life and how her


---------68:41----------
desires have like a high stealth to hide


---------68:43----------
from her grandmother and all that good


---------68:44----------
stuff and at the end of the day like on


---------68:46----------
a day-to-day basis like she can't she


---------68:48----------
can't tackle that problem so she has to


---------68:50----------
the feelings that that bring up in terms


---------68:53----------
of anxiety or confusion like in order


---------68:56----------
for her to apply to whatever school


---------68:57----------
thinks she's got or apply for a job or


---------68:59----------
go to work or stream she's got a like


---------69:01----------
table that existential dread you know


---------69:05----------
can I just say as well actually the last


---------69:09----------
bit of this conversation has been


---------69:10----------
something that I wanted to avoid


---------69:12----------
bringing up because it makes me kind of


---------69:14----------
scared so the fact that you got it out


---------69:15----------
of me I normally I probably would just


---------69:17----------
try to veer off and talk about something


---------69:19----------
else or cut the conversation short but


---------69:22----------
I mean I figured it'd be better for


---------69:24----------
myself my mental state the stream as


---------69:26----------
well maybe to discuss it and kind of


---------69:28----------
learn to deal with it I guess and so


---------69:31----------
from what I'm gonna translate that anta


---------69:34----------
so what you're saying is that you


---------69:35----------
unclick the Stealth button and you're


---------69:37----------
visible for a few moments it's dangerous


---------69:41----------
right because now you can be targeted oh


---------69:43----------
my goodness you're out in the open yes


---------69:45----------
so much danger but I mean that's it's


---------69:48----------
why I started streaming it's kind of why


---------69:50----------
I came on here it's why I've started


---------69:51----------
doing what I've been doing lately I'm


---------69:52----------
just kind of trying to get out of here I


---------69:55----------
guess I really commend you for that I


---------69:57----------
think it's like the opening ourself up


---------70:00----------
to like like stepping out of our


---------70:02----------
protective safe zone I think is really


---------70:04----------
the first step to changing your life and


---------70:06----------
so I really commend you for doing that


---------70:09----------
and yeah it looks like so I'm going to


---------70:13----------
just go back to Tom's questions so you


---------70:17----------
know so like I was saying like so you


---------70:19----------
have to cope in the moment so like if


---------70:20----------
you you know let's say that you lose a


---------70:22----------
loved one in your grieving and you have


---------70:24----------
to go to work the next day like I think


---------70:25----------
it's completely reasonable to use coping


---------70:27----------
mechanisms to sort of shove those


---------70:30----------
feelings down or like decompress those


---------70:32----------
feelings a little bit but at the end of


---------70:33----------
the day I think the problem is that


---------70:35----------
coping makes you feel better but it


---------70:37----------
never solves the problem and so people


---------70:39----------
without being very thoughtful about it


---------70:41----------
start to rely on coping more and more


---------70:44----------
and more and more and more because


---------70:46----------
that's what helps them feel better like


---------70:47----------
in the moment and then over time like


---------70:50----------
your problems never get solved because


---------70:52----------
you think that coping is like because


---------70:54----------
coping does help but it doesn't fix it


---------70:56----------
it's just like a band-aid so and


---------70:58----------
sometimes like let's remember that like


---------71:00----------
band-aids have their place in society


---------71:01----------
right like band-aids are good for us


---------71:03----------
like we need band-aids sometimes but


---------71:05----------
don't confuse a band-aid with actually


---------71:08----------
like the healing that goes on underneath


---------71:09----------
and both of those have their role so let


---------71:16----------
me see were there so are you following


---------71:22----------
to a chat and I also do you think that


---------71:25----------
there are other I mean other questions


---------71:28----------
[Music]


---------71:33----------
I'm not seeing any necessarily saying


---------71:35----------
that


---------71:36----------
he's gonna use a heroin to continue to


---------71:39----------
cope maybe I'll give it a go don't use


---------71:43----------
heroin boys and girls I'm kidding I


---------71:46----------
would a bad drug okay so I'm not seeing


---------71:51----------
a whole lot of questions so I'm gonna go


---------71:52----------
ahead and hop off the call on RF and


---------71:56----------
then we'll go ahead and transition and


---------71:57----------
if people want to like populate with


---------71:59----------
questions we'll kind of come back to


---------72:00----------
those in a second okay okay thanks a lot


---------72:04----------
for coming on in thank you for having me
