---------00:00----------
okay so let me explain what om chanting


---------00:02----------
is


---------00:03----------
so chanting is like a really powerful


---------00:05----------
meditation technique you can chant


---------00:07----------
different mantras to cultivate a


---------00:09----------
different kind of spiritual energy we're


---------00:12----------
gonna actually do om chanting so


---------00:14----------
chanting of om so om is actually


---------00:16----------
composed of three syllables


---------00:21----------
so we start out going


---------00:25----------
[Music]


---------00:34----------
so we do take a dip big deep breath we


---------00:37----------
start out with a mouth that's completely


---------00:39----------
open


---------00:45----------
okay and we go to completely closed


---------00:47----------
so when we chant we do a couple of


---------00:48----------
different things


---------00:50----------
one is that there's a certain breathing


---------00:51----------
component to which i'm sure has a


---------00:53----------
physiology to it but what we really want


---------00:55----------
to do is project out that energy we want


---------00:57----------
to like energize okay so we're going to


---------01:00----------
be loud


---------01:02----------
and


---------01:03----------
the other thing that to remember about


---------01:04----------
chanting is chanting is not about sound


---------01:06----------
it's about energy and vibration so what


---------01:09----------
i want you to pay attention to is not


---------01:11----------
what you hear but what you feel


---------01:14----------
with each of the syllables of the om


---------01:16----------
chant okay


---------01:18----------
so so what it'll be is like ah


---------01:20----------
um there'll be a period of silence


---------01:23----------
we'll take a deep breath again we'll do


---------01:26----------
another round so we'll do seven rounds


---------01:27----------
of ohm chanting and then we'll be silent


---------01:30----------
for about 60 to 90 seconds maybe two


---------01:32----------
minutes five minutes i don't know just


---------01:34----------
depends on how i feel okay all right so


---------01:36----------
i want everyone to sit up straight back


---------01:38----------
straight is very important


---------01:42----------
okay just take a few calming breaths


---------02:07----------
all right now we're going to begin so


---------02:08----------
i'm going to take a deep breath in


---------02:17----------
[Music]


---------02:34----------
again deep breath in


---------02:42----------
[Music]


---------02:57----------
again


---------03:04----------
[Music]


---------03:17----------
again


---------03:26----------
[Music]


---------03:40----------
again


---------03:50----------
[Music]


---------04:01----------
two more make him count a lot of energy


---------04:03----------
big deep breath


---------04:06----------
oh


---------04:11----------
[Music]


---------04:18----------
[Music]


---------04:24----------
maximize vibration big deep breath


---------04:41----------
[Music]


---------04:56----------
just feel with your eyes closed


---------06:05----------
okay


---------06:07----------
so in the quiet space afterward i want


---------06:09----------
you to just feel the person that you are


---------06:14----------
whatever is there let it come out


---------06:17----------
if it's sadness if you feel stressed


---------06:21----------
if you feel good great if you feel


---------06:23----------
energetic wonderful but if not just let


---------06:25----------
that crap out


---------06:28----------
so if we think about what vibration does


---------06:31----------
vibration facilitates movement


---------06:35----------
if i've got something stuck i shake it


---------06:37----------
starts moving again


---------06:40----------
so whatever needs to come out will come


---------06:42----------
out watch it with awareness breathe it


---------06:44----------
in breathe it out


---------06:47----------
and just


---------06:49----------
do it


---------06:51----------
seven breaths nine breaths


---------06:53----------
increase the power of the vibration


---------06:56----------
increase the energy of it


---------06:58----------
learn to take bigger deeper breaths with


---------07:00----------
practice


---------07:01----------
and more and more stuff will come out


---------07:05----------
so much anxiety me yeah we gotta let it


---------07:08----------
out man


---------07:09----------
that's the problem is that right now it


---------07:12----------
is inside you


---------07:14----------
so let it out and then you'll be anxiety


---------07:17----------
free


---------07:18----------
don't keep anxiety inside


---------07:20----------
let it out


---------07:23----------
if you just want to cry then cry


---------07:27----------
let it out the tears are there


---------07:30----------
if you hold on to them they'll stay


---------07:32----------
there


---------07:33----------
if you let them out they'll go


---------07:36----------
and so if you want to understand what


---------07:38----------
enlightenment is as you chant as you


---------07:41----------
meditate


---------07:42----------
what you think you are continues to come


---------07:45----------
