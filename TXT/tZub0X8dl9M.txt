---------00:00----------
I know okay backseat haircutting


---------00:03----------
questions time alright dr. kay how do we


---------00:07----------
decompress after a heavy work day after


---------00:09----------
talking to main depressed people in a


---------00:11----------
row yeah that's a question like how do


---------00:15----------
you decompress after a heavy work day um


---------00:19----------
that's a good question so you know I do


---------00:22----------
a couple of standard things so I try to


---------00:24----------
like stay fed throughout the day which


---------00:27----------
is actually really really important so


---------00:29----------
my wife does a good job


---------00:31----------
booty does an awesome job like so she


---------00:32----------
gave me a smoothie this morning I will


---------00:35----------
oftentimes wine per smoothie


---------00:37----------
soon after I wake up until I get one so


---------00:41----------
I think that you know decompressing


---------00:44----------
after a long day is just as much about


---------00:46----------
managing yourself throughout the day is


---------00:49----------
it is about like fixing things afterward


---------00:52----------
so I think like eating at regular


---------00:55----------
intervals and like not being super


---------00:57----------
hungry because if you're not like if


---------00:59----------
you're super hungry at the end of the


---------01:00----------
day and you eat a lot then you're gonna


---------01:01----------
like get into a food coma so I try to


---------01:05----------
spend some time with my kids usually


---------01:07----------
after I'm done working we've tried to


---------01:09----------
spend like an hour - together as a


---------01:11----------
family everyday which is like pretty


---------01:13----------
important I spent some time outdoors


---------01:18----------
that's huge so thankfully now I'm in


---------01:21----------
Texas and it's like kind of it's


---------01:22----------
generally speaking hot in Texas but it's


---------01:25----------
been nice this year actually so I'll


---------01:27----------
spend some time outdoors literally


---------01:29----------
yesterday I just laid down in the grass


---------01:32----------
so like because you're my birth dates


---------01:35----------
are 15 minutes and just looked at the


---------01:39----------
sky like that's good stuff and then I


---------01:43----------
also do play games so like after a long


---------01:46----------
day if I can't like play games to watch


---------01:48----------
a little bit of TV you know I think a


---------01:51----------
lot of people think that you should do


---------01:52----------
like self care like after a long day


---------01:55----------
like I should do yoga or meditate but I


---------01:57----------
actually find like I think self-care


---------01:59----------
requires mana right like it's it's


---------02:03----------
effortful to meditate exercise or do


---------02:06----------
yoga and so I don't I try to make that


---------02:10----------
part of my workday kind of basically


---------02:12----------
like treat it like a dog


---------02:15----------
yeah and sometimes I'll just be like


---------02:18----------
silent by myself so after streams


---------02:22----------
usually I go from like like a short


---------02:24----------
drive somewhere for no particular cue if


---------02:26----------
I have an errand to run or something


---------02:28----------
like that but I think it's important to


---------02:32----------
let your mind just decompress and


---------02:34----------
process one of the biggest problems I


---------02:36----------
think we run into is that we move from


---------02:38----------
distraction - distraction in the mind so


---------02:41----------
like it's always like TV or gaming or


---------02:43----------
audio book or podcast or music or like


---------02:47----------
and we're never just sitting with


---------02:48----------
ourselves like it's like browsing things


---------02:51----------
reading things listening to things our


---------02:53----------
mind is always occupied and I think one


---------02:55----------
of the best things that you can do is


---------02:57----------
actually just give your mind some time


---------03:01----------
to just process which peels boring at


---------03:07----------
first like you think you're gonna be


---------03:08----------
bored but you'd be amazed like how good


---------03:12----------
it can be yeah when you're talking about


---------03:14----------
like stuff to decompress was that stuff


---------03:16----------
you figure out on your own just through


---------03:17----------
experimentation or how did that like


---------03:19----------
come about yeah so I think basically


---------03:24----------
through experimentation so like the


---------03:26----------
thing is you have to understand how you


---------03:28----------
work and no one's gonna be able to tell


---------03:30----------
you how you work as a person so what you


---------03:33----------
want to do is like spend some time


---------03:34----------
paying attention to yourself


---------03:37----------
spend some time like kind of being with


---------03:40----------
yourself so one of our our coaching


---------03:44----------
clients came up with an awesome exercise


---------03:48----------
which was like halfway through his his


---------03:51----------
coaching run he decided to spend an hour


---------03:54----------
sitting on a honest like a couch or


---------03:57----------
something like staring at fall and he


---------03:59----------
was like I just wanted to see what would


---------04:01----------
happen if I just like don't have any


---------04:04----------
distractions and just see what would


---------04:06----------
happen to my mind and I think that was


---------04:08----------
like that's a brilliant exercise it's


---------04:10----------
really hard to do but a lot of stuff can


---------04:13----------
come up and so you know I think a lot of


---------04:18----------
it is through like reflection and like


---------04:20----------
observing yourself so what works for you


---------04:23----------
and what doesn't work for you


---------04:25----------
and I found that like basically I'm kind


---------04:27----------
of an introvert so when I need to


---------04:30----------
recharge I try to do things by myself


---------04:35----------
is there any like advice you give to


---------04:37----------
someone who's trying to figure out like


---------04:39----------
or understand themselves


---------04:43----------
yeah so I think kind of what I said is


---------04:45----------
like first start by being with yourself


---------04:47----------
so we spend so much of our time with


---------04:51----------
other things in people right so like


---------04:53----------
Reddit twitch gaming books music like


---------04:58----------
there's a reason why shower thoughts are


---------05:01----------
so profound and so wonderful it's


---------05:03----------
because like when you're in the shower


---------05:04----------
like you don't you're with yourself and


---------05:07----------
that can actually be pretty cool so just


---------05:09----------
I would say go on walks be in nature on


---------05:13----------
your own that's a really good way to get


---------05:17----------
to know yourself sorry


---------05:20----------
so was I like high neuroticism I


---------05:23----------
conscientiousness and if so if not how


---------05:27----------
was I not like that is basically what


---------05:29----------
I'm hearing yeah yeah so many of my


---------05:33----------
colleagues so what high neuroticism and


---------05:35----------
I conscientious means is that there's a


---------05:40----------
system of personality analysis which is


---------05:42----------
like scientifically like pretty


---------05:44----------
validated which is called the big five


---------05:47----------
or the five factor model and it


---------05:49----------
basically divides personality into five


---------05:53----------
dimensions and different people sort of


---------05:56----------
are on like different levels on each


---------05:59----------
dimension and two of the levels or


---------06:02----------
neuroticism so neuroticism is like the


---------06:04----------
tendency to worry on the inside so just


---------06:08----------
how like concern you get about stuff and


---------06:12----------
high conscientiousness which is the


---------06:15----------
ability to kind of focus on a task over


---------06:19----------
time and medical students tend to be


---------06:23----------
high in neuroticism and high in


---------06:25----------
conscientiousness so they can sit down


---------06:28----------
and like focus hard for four years in


---------06:30----------
order to get into medical school and


---------06:32----------
furthermore since they like or anxious


---------06:35----------
about how well they do on tests they're


---------06:37----------
worried and their anxiety actually


---------06:40----------
propels them to study more which makes


---------06:42----------
it adaptive in terms of like gives them


---------06:44----------
an advantage so most medical students


---------06:48----------
are highly conscientious and very


---------06:50----------
neurotic or anxious so I wasn't like


---------06:53----------
that


---------06:53----------
really at all


---------06:57----------
I think the reason is because I failed


---------06:59----------
so miserably four years before I got


---------07:03----------
into medical school so like I was a very


---------07:05----------
different person from many of my


---------07:07----------
colleagues so the first thing is I was


---------07:09----------
like years I was like 4 to 5 years older


---------07:12----------
than most of the class because it took


---------07:14----------
me that long to get into med school


---------07:17----------
that's number one but I think during


---------07:20----------
those years like the big difference was


---------07:21----------
that like these are you know I think


---------07:23----------
about him as kids but you know these are


---------07:26----------
people or kids that like basically


---------07:28----------
always did well in life so they're like


---------07:30----------
you know they like had you know they


---------07:34----------
were in top ten in their high school


---------07:36----------
class like had three point eight plus


---------07:39----------
GPAs in college and so they've always


---------07:43----------
like done really well so they don't


---------07:45----------
really like for them like a failure is


---------07:47----------
like a B or C and it's like they didn't


---------07:49----------
really understand like what real failure


---------07:51----------
is whereas I had understood what real


---------07:54----------
fear is it's like being 25 unemployed


---------07:56----------
you know being rejected from 80 medical


---------07:59----------
schools with really no hope of getting


---------08:01----------
in anywhere really not having any money


---------08:05----------
not having any much of anything at all


---------08:09----------
and so the things that would terrify


---------08:13----------
them or freak them out would like not


---------08:17----------
feel like much to me so a good example


---------08:19----------
is you know you get yelled at when


---------08:23----------
you're in the operating room by like


---------08:24----------
surgeons like that just think it's like


---------08:26----------
because surgeons sometimes aren't the


---------08:28----------
nicest people it's like a little bit of


---------08:30----------
a toxic culture in general and it's also


---------08:33----------
sort of a high-stakes thing so sometimes


---------08:36----------
medical students will you know they'll


---------08:39----------
get yelled at by a surgeon in the


---------08:41----------
operating room and so when they get yell


---------08:43----------
that's like that's not something that


---------08:44----------
has happened to them before right


---------08:49----------
because these are the kids that have


---------08:50----------
gotten over words and and done well and


---------08:53----------
gotten A's like they don't get yelled at


---------08:55----------
for being the stupidest person in the


---------08:57----------
room which isn't really fair because


---------08:59----------
that's you know they're the least


---------09:00----------
knowledgeable but that's what happens


---------09:03----------
and so then like they they've run out of


---------09:05----------
the operating room tears and all this


---------09:07----------
kind of stuff the


---------09:09----------
they're more terrifying thing for


---------09:11----------
medical students as they ask people like


---------09:13----------
hey how am i doing and they say like


---------09:14----------
yeah you're doing a great job you're


---------09:16----------
doing a great job you're doing a great


---------09:17----------
job and then they get like an average


---------09:19----------
grade they don't get like the best grade


---------09:23----------
and then they're devastated because at


---------09:25----------
that point bridge is a great job um so


---------09:30----------
you know I think that for me like the


---------09:32----------
reason that med school was actually kind


---------09:34----------
of like chill and easy was because I had


---------09:36----------
really failed and so I understood like


---------09:38----------
you know getting yelled at by a surgeon


---------09:40----------
like that's because he's an [ __ ] it


---------09:44----------
has nothing to do with me it's like the


---------09:46----------
dude is having a bad day like what do


---------09:47----------
you expect from me I'm a third-year


---------09:49----------
medical student who's been in the


---------09:51----------
operating room for two weeks so like


---------09:54----------
what can they reasonably expect and so I


---------09:56----------
studied and I recognized that I could


---------09:58----------
like learn as much as I could but I'm


---------10:00----------
not gonna know everything yet like


---------10:01----------
that's why I'm in med school whereas not


---------10:03----------
knowing everything felt very very


---------10:06----------
devastating to many of my colleagues and


---------10:09----------
so it's like okay I mean you can yell at


---------10:12----------
me for not knowing things but that has


---------10:14----------
nothing to do with me bro it's like I've


---------10:16----------
been doing this for two weeks like so I


---------10:19----------
think really understanding failure and


---------10:22----------
having failed is like one of the biggest


---------10:25----------
sources of my strength and like what


---------10:28----------
makes life like sort of easy to manage


---------10:30----------
right because it gives you perspective


---------10:36----------
yeah so I think I gained confidence and


---------10:40----------
when I think about confidence what I


---------10:43----------
mean is I had a sense of my internal


---------10:45----------
value and Worth and a lot of times


---------10:50----------
medical students will or they're just


---------10:53----------
people in general will have a sense of


---------10:55----------
value that's based on like external


---------10:57----------
things so like how good I am if I'm if I


---------11:01----------
get good grades then I'm a good person


---------11:03----------
if I graduate from college then I'm a


---------11:05----------
good person


---------11:05----------
the converse is also true that a lot of


---------11:08----------
our community will judge themselves


---------11:10----------
based on based on their lack of a


---------11:12----------
competence so their value as a human


---------11:15----------
being is determined by how much money


---------11:17----------
they make or whether they have jobs or


---------11:19----------
whether


---------11:19----------
they have you know romantic partners or


---------11:22----------
whatever whereas like when you really


---------11:24----------
fail you begin to realize like that's


---------11:26----------
not where value comes from it's just


---------11:28----------
value comes from like within and so I


---------11:32----------
think that was really different from me


---------11:34----------
and my colleagues so I you're right


---------11:39----------
Zack I'd I don't have much I mean I'm


---------11:43----------
not very neurotic gotcha okay and that


---------11:48----------
makes sense like someone was asking how


---------11:51----------
do you find that enter a person yeah you


---------11:54----------
spend time with yourself this is gonna


---------11:56----------
be a theme for today right so like I


---------11:58----------
spent time like when you're like when


---------12:00----------
you fail you miss it so you know we


---------12:12----------
don't sew like this this is getting like


---------12:15----------
so I think this is one of the reasons


---------12:16----------
why like mental health is getting worse


---------12:17----------
is because we spend more and more time


---------12:20----------
with our mind focus on external things


---------12:23----------
because there's way better external


---------12:26----------
stuff to focus on now


---------12:27----------
like you don't have to be with yourself


---------12:30----------
at all during the day like I have a


---------12:32----------
portable bluetooth speaker that'll


---------12:34----------
sometimes take like carry into the


---------12:36----------
bathroom when I take a shower so that I


---------12:38----------
can like listen to an audio book even


---------12:40----------
when I'm in the shower


---------12:41----------
you know you can have headphones


---------12:42----------
portable speakers you have a phone that


---------12:46----------
goes with you wherever you go that you


---------12:48----------
can like browse on like there's screens


---------12:50----------
and podcasts around you 24/7 if you want


---------12:54----------
so it's becoming like easier and easier


---------12:57----------
to not spend time with yourself and it's


---------12:59----------
becoming more entertaining to like not


---------13:01----------
be bored by yourself and that's what we


---------13:05----------
call bored right like we call bored like


---------13:07----------
a mind that is unoccupied


---------13:09----------
that's what boredom is but I think that


---------13:13----------
as we've become less and less bored it's


---------13:15----------
actually hurting us because we don't get


---------13:17----------
to know who we are because you're


---------13:19----------
spending your time with like things out


---------13:21----------
besides yourself so practically how do


---------13:23----------
you do that I think sitting and staring


---------13:25----------
at a wall is a good place to start you


---------13:28----------
know I think it's nice to like so I you


---------13:31----------
know I like tea


---------13:32----------
like I think it's nice to sit outdoors


---------13:35----------
if you can and and like you know grab a


---------13:38----------
cup of tea or even like a glass of like


---------13:40----------
water with lemon and then just chill out


---------13:45----------
there for like fifteen and thirty


---------13:46----------
minutes like don't take your phone take


---------13:49----------
like a piece of paper and like something


---------13:52----------
to write with and if you feel like


---------13:53----------
jotting things down jot things down


---------13:56----------
I think hikes are fantastic or like


---------13:59----------
going for a walk is fantastic because


---------14:01----------
it's like hard to get distracted when


---------14:04----------
you're hiking and you just kind of get


---------14:06----------
to spend time with yourself and sort of


---------14:08----------
exist with yourself and then you'll get


---------14:11----------
to know who you are and like the more


---------14:13----------
you get to know that person the more


---------14:14----------
you'll realize that like you know


---------14:17----------
whether you're a medical student failing


---------14:21----------
to get into medical school a doctor or


---------14:24----------
faculty at Harvard Medical School it's


---------14:26----------
like the same person who takes a hike


---------14:27----------
like I'm still the same dude like


---------14:30----------
nothing has changed like those are all


---------14:32----------
external trappings but like the person


---------14:37----------
on the inside is the same and so then


---------14:40----------
once you realize that there's a constant


---------14:43----------
within you that is irrespective of what


---------14:47----------
your bank account says then you begin to


---------14:50----------
realize that like no one can take that


---------14:52----------
away from you and like then it's kind of


---------14:54----------
cool because then you kind of know who


---------14:56----------
you are then it's like cool yeah so


---------15:00----------
Dominican love on Twitter ass


---------15:03----------
at some point in the future I guess like


---------15:05----------
now can you talk about self-love self


---------15:08----------
luck yeah I I don't is that something


---------15:12----------
that you learned because I don't


---------15:13----------
actually know what he means here a


---------15:16----------
little bit more I noticed a lot of


---------15:18----------
people reclaiming recoiling from


---------15:20----------
compliments and cop constantly putting


---------15:22----------
themselves down in an ultra negative way


---------15:25----------
and it would be cool to get some helpful


---------15:27----------
perspective to pass on to them


---------15:31----------
so I guess like his yeah so this is this


---------15:35----------
is something actually we talk about with


---------15:37----------
our coaches it's they're kind of two


---------15:39----------
perspectives and I I think like the


---------15:43----------
common element is why what makes it ours


---------15:47----------
like when you when someone complements


---------15:50----------
you like the first thing to do is notice


---------15:55----------
yourself so like when someone


---------15:57----------
complements you like it's almost almost


---------16:00----------
like this serpent on coils in your mind


---------16:04----------
and like swats away the compliment like


---------16:07----------
you feel deeply uncomfortable for like a


---------16:09----------
fraction of a second and then you want


---------16:11----------
to knock it away because something about


---------16:13----------
that like makes you feel something I the


---------16:17----------
first thing you've got to do is like


---------16:18----------
understand like why are you responding


---------16:21----------
like that like look at that and and see


---------16:25----------
that when someone is trying to express


---------16:26----------
appreciation something exists in you


---------16:30----------
that doesn't can't sit with that so


---------16:34----------
that's the first thing you've got to


---------16:35----------
figure out is like see that thing


---------16:37----------
because it's like it's like a reflex


---------16:39----------
like you're like no I can't I can't have


---------16:42----------
people saying that and so we ask our


---------16:47----------
coaches is then the question becomes


---------16:49----------
where where was that thing born right so


---------16:53----------
where does that come from why is it hard


---------16:55----------
for you to accept compliments and it may


---------16:58----------
not be any compliment for a lot of


---------17:00----------
people it's like particular things so if


---------17:02----------
you tell someone like on twitch that


---------17:04----------
they're a good-looking person they're


---------17:06----------
more likely to recoil than they are if


---------17:08----------
you tell them that you think they're


---------17:10----------
smart all right so there's some aspects


---------17:12----------
of your personality that you're okay


---------17:14----------
with being like Obama average and there


---------17:16----------
are other aspects that might deeply run


---------17:18----------
against your perception of self then


---------17:23----------
what we kind of ask our coaches is like


---------17:24----------
like once again like where does that


---------17:27----------
come from so you know when did they


---------17:28----------
start to feel like they're unattractive


---------17:32----------
and that you kind of go back to like the


---------17:35----------
origin of that feeling and then kind of


---------17:38----------
work through it for people I think the


---------17:43----------
other thing is is that


---------17:45----------
so like I think what you should try to


---------17:48----------
do is like acknowledge for a moment that


---------17:50----------
these people are seeing something within


---------17:53----------
you all right so even if you may


---------17:56----------
disagree or they don't fully understand


---------17:57----------
or maybe they're trying to be nice you


---------18:00----------
know they're basing it on something and


---------18:03----------
so as best as you can try to see like


---------18:06----------
what is this person able to see that I'm


---------18:09----------
not able to see and acknowledge for a


---------18:12----------
second that like other people may know


---------18:14----------
things about you that you don't know


---------18:15----------
about yourself and so it's not like you


---------18:17----------
know everything right which is the


---------18:19----------
earlier discussion about the scissors


---------18:21----------
like I know my hair but maybe she knows


---------18:22----------
my hair but she but you don't know about


---------18:28----------
cutting and I'm telling you what people


---------18:29----------
have used those scissors


---------18:30----------
how many haircuts have you given none to


---------18:36----------
dogs or people things that have hair


---------18:40----------
similar to yours the answer neither case


---------18:43----------
is zero actually so there's someone else


---------18:51----------
on Twitter I forgot to write their user


---------18:52----------
name said it feels like a lot of


---------18:54----------
people's phones come from not being able


---------18:56----------
to connect with others how can I


---------18:58----------
practice being less socially awkward how


---------19:01----------
can you get less socially awkward yeah


---------19:04----------
how how can I practice being less


---------19:06----------
socially awkward


---------19:11----------
it's a great question so there's a


---------19:13----------
subtle there's a subtlety in the


---------19:15----------
question how can I practice being less


---------19:17----------
socially awkward you can't practice


---------19:19----------
being a socially awkward all you can


---------19:21----------
practice is being socially awkward and


---------19:23----------
if you practice being socially awkward


---------19:25----------
for long enough over time you will


---------19:27----------
become less real right does that make


---------19:31----------
sense like you can't get past the fact


---------19:33----------
in the socially awkward phase it's like


---------19:35----------
it's just a it's a part it's a part of


---------19:39----------
the process right so you're gonna be


---------19:43----------
socially awkward or you're gonna it that


---------19:45----------
that too but you may not be socially


---------19:46----------
awkward you may just feel socially


---------19:48----------
awkward so like you know if you talk to


---------19:51----------
people who have social anxiety their


---------19:53----------
perception of how they're doing socially


---------19:55----------
is far worse than like how other people


---------19:58----------
think they're doing so you can't


---------20:01----------
practice being socially awkward what


---------20:02----------
unity just practices being social and


---------20:04----------
over time the awkwardness will decrease


---------20:11----------
now I'm not saying stop feeling awkward


---------20:13----------
I'm saying you're gonna continue to feel


---------20:14----------
awkward


---------20:15----------
until you practice being subtle and then


---------20:18----------
the feelings of awkwardness will fade


---------20:20----------
away I feel like one thing that's


---------20:30----------
helpful is like learning how to smooth


---------20:32----------
over socially awkward moments so like


---------20:34----------
knowing that it's not like the end of


---------20:36----------
the conversation like not freezing here


---------20:46----------
right here I could clean that up clean


---------20:51----------
