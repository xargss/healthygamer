---------00:00----------
how do i learn to accept love


---------00:03----------
hi everyone i'm 18f and i recently


---------00:05----------
started seeing this guy this is the


---------00:07----------
first person that i've dated and i'm


---------00:09----------
starting to notice a few things a few


---------00:11----------
off things regarding how i perceive the


---------00:13----------
relationship


---------00:14----------
i get uncomfortable when he flirts with


---------00:16----------
me and at one point i thought he was


---------00:18----------
trying to manipulate me by love bombing


---------00:19----------
me but when i looked up actual love


---------00:21----------
bombing he's the farthest from it


---------00:24----------
growing up i didn't have a father and my


---------00:26----------
mother wasn't very explicit with her


---------00:27----------
love for me though i knew it was there


---------00:30----------
i was treated pretty badly throughout my


---------00:32----------
school years and bullied in high school


---------00:34----------
i find myself having a pretty low sense


---------00:37----------
of self-worth and i feel unlovable


---------00:39----------
sometimes


---------00:40----------
i think the guy that i'm seeing is a


---------00:42----------
really good person and i don't want to


---------00:43----------
screw things up


---------00:44----------
i don't know how to accept his


---------00:46----------
compliments i say thank you but on the


---------00:48----------
inside i feel like he's lying to me or


---------00:49----------
he pities me


---------00:51----------
but i know rationally that isn't true


---------00:53----------
it's just that when he says i'm pretty


---------00:55----------
or he offers to take me home i feel


---------00:57----------
extremely guilty and i feel like i need


---------00:58----------
to pay him back in some way


---------01:00----------
i know people do nice things and i


---------01:02----------
should just let them and i should just


---------01:04----------
let them but i feel so guilty because i


---------01:06----------
feel like i don't deserve it


---------01:08----------
these patterns kind of spill over into


---------01:10----------
my platonic relationships as well


---------01:12----------
i find myself wanting to love others but


---------01:14----------
never wanting to be loved i love


---------01:16----------
spoiling my friends with small gifts or


---------01:18----------
favors spending time with them or just


---------01:20----------
being there every time they need me


---------01:23----------
i feel like i can't depend on people how


---------01:25----------
they depend on how people depend on me


---------01:27----------
people say that i'm not a bad person but


---------01:29----------
i can't help feeling like i am a bad


---------01:31----------
person on the inside and i just


---------01:32----------
masquerade as a good friend and


---------01:34----------
eventually someone is going to rip off


---------01:36----------
this mask and that i have and discover


---------01:38----------
the truth objectively i know that there


---------01:41----------
are a bunch of discrepancies between


---------01:43----------
reality and how i feel and i feel silly


---------01:45----------
for putting all of my thoughts out there


---------01:47----------
if anyone has advice for this i would


---------01:50----------
feel greatly i would greatly appreciate


---------01:52----------
it thank you


---------01:54----------
okay


---------01:56----------
so


---------01:57----------
some people are saying is this me as a


---------01:58----------
girl i know this is shocking but


---------02:00----------
sometimes your genitalia does not


---------02:02----------
correlate with your experience and that


---------02:04----------
men and women can have similar


---------02:05----------
experiences


---------02:06----------
i know it is shocking


---------02:09----------
so i just want to first shout out uh


---------02:11----------
give a shout out to this person because


---------02:13----------
like i want y'all to like think a little


---------02:15----------
bit about how hard it is to


---------02:19----------
post something like this right to feel


---------02:21----------
silly


---------02:22----------
objectively


---------02:23----------
like recognize that you're putting


---------02:25----------
something out there that does not


---------02:26----------
internally make sense it actually makes


---------02:28----------
perfect sense


---------02:29----------
but like it takes so much to be able to


---------02:32----------
post this


---------02:34----------
right like you'll see that and there's


---------02:35----------
so much here like


---------02:36----------
um i'm starting to notice a few off


---------02:39----------
things about how i perceive in the


---------02:40----------
relationship like this is what i mean


---------02:41----------
about the quality of posts so the person


---------02:43----------
like is very aware of what they're


---------02:46----------
experiencing recognizes some


---------02:48----------
discrepancies and is able to state it


---------02:50----------
anyway despite the fact that it kind of


---------02:52----------
feels silly


---------02:53----------
because if you have low self-esteem


---------02:55----------
and there's some kind of logical


---------02:57----------
inconsistency it's really hard for you


---------02:58----------
to ask for help right you're like this


---------03:00----------
is just my stupid head


---------03:02----------
that doesn't make any sense like i don't


---------03:03----------
even know what how someone can help


---------03:05----------
someone that's like head is as stupid as


---------03:07----------
my thoughts are


---------03:08----------
but the fact that they're able to do


---------03:10----------
this is actually a huge huge like step


---------03:13----------
in in the right direction they're able


---------03:15----------
to notice some of their thoughts and


---------03:17----------
feelings which are not perfectly aligned


---------03:19----------
and they're able to


---------03:20----------
set aside their self-judgment and like


---------03:22----------
take a step forward in the right


---------03:24----------
direction


---------03:25----------
right so this is fantastic


---------03:27----------
i mean this situation sounds tough but


---------03:29----------
we'll get there too but like i'm really


---------03:31----------
proud of like people for the quality of


---------03:33----------
the post the other thing to remember is


---------03:35----------
that the community deserves a shout out


---------03:36----------
too because


---------03:38----------
we would not get posts like this unless


---------03:40----------
the responses


---------03:42----------
were solid


---------03:43----------
right so if there's a bunch of like


---------03:45----------
hatred kind of responses like oh you're


---------03:47----------
a girl like what are you complaining


---------03:49----------
about men have it so much harder or the


---------03:51----------
flip side of you know like if there was


---------03:53----------
like really invalidating stuff then


---------03:55----------
people wouldn't post things like this


---------03:56----------
right so it's been a lot of hard work


---------03:58----------
and and by hard work i mean i think each


---------04:01----------
and every one of you has been a part of


---------04:02----------
this i don't and i don't think sometimes


---------04:04----------
people realize


---------04:05----------
like how you affect the community


---------04:08----------
right it's like little things like


---------04:09----------
reading this and not responding in a


---------04:11----------
toxic way or responding in a positive


---------04:13----------
way that make posts like this possible


---------04:15----------
seriously i'm not kidding go look at


---------04:17----------
other


---------04:18----------
go look at like other places on the


---------04:20----------
internet


---------04:21----------
right like other support communities


---------04:23----------
like


---------04:24----------
you know like


---------04:25----------
slash r


---------04:27----------
sad


---------04:28----------
and like forever alone and like other


---------04:30----------
places where there's just a lot of


---------04:32----------
like toxicity


---------04:35----------
um


---------04:37----------
or there's just kind of like this echo


---------04:38----------
chamber empty support right which is


---------04:40----------
like oh it's never your fault like


---------04:41----------
there's some subreddits like that where


---------04:43----------
it's like it's never your fault you're


---------04:45----------
awesome you keep doing you what i'm


---------04:47----------
really proud of our community for is


---------04:48----------
that we're self-reflective


---------04:50----------
we will like point out things but we'll


---------04:51----------
do it with kind of compassion which is


---------04:53----------
awesome okay so let's get to this


---------04:56----------
so the first thing is as we've talked a


---------04:57----------
little bit about today let's do a quick


---------04:59----------
reminder


---------05:00----------
so our ahamkar is our sense of identity


---------05:04----------
samskar is an experience that we've had


---------05:07----------
that shapes our personality


---------05:10----------
right so what happens is we have a bunch


---------05:12----------
of experiences that shape our reactions


---------05:14----------
to things


---------05:15----------
and based on those experiences we


---------05:17----------
develop a personality or sense of


---------05:19----------
identity


---------05:20----------
okay


---------05:21----------
so if you're in a relationship and you


---------05:24----------
feel like you don't deserve love and


---------05:26----------
this is like actually a really good


---------05:27----------
example of this i find myself wanting to


---------05:29----------
love others but never wanting to be


---------05:31----------
loved right i'm the person who spoils


---------05:34----------
others and spends time with them but


---------05:36----------
like


---------05:37----------
i can't accept their affection like it's


---------05:39----------
a one-way street because they are good


---------05:41----------
people and they deserve love but i am


---------05:44----------
not


---------05:45----------
and therefore i don't and like


---------05:47----------
compliments make me feel like


---------05:48----------
uncomfortable because i don't really


---------05:50----------
deserve compliments or affection or to


---------05:52----------
be cared for


---------05:54----------
so where does this kind of


---------05:56----------
sense of self because this is an


---------05:58----------
identity issue right this person does


---------06:00----------
not feel like they deserve love like


---------06:02----------
their idea of what they deserve is not


---------06:04----------
this


---------06:06----------
so there are a couple of important


---------06:07----------
things here the first is how does this


---------06:09----------
form right so we can kind of see this i


---------06:11----------
was treated pretty badly throughout my


---------06:13----------
school years and bullied in high school


---------06:16----------
so i find myself having a pretty low


---------06:18----------
self-worth and i feel unlovable


---------06:20----------
sometimes


---------06:22----------
so let's just like think about these are


---------06:23----------
just two sentences which is like i was


---------06:25----------
bullied so check mark right in terms of


---------06:27----------
your history but what does that actually


---------06:28----------
do to a person let's try to understand


---------06:30----------
what does bullying do to a person


---------06:34----------
so what do you deserve


---------06:35----------
right how do you determine what you


---------06:37----------
deserve so let's like think a little bit


---------06:38----------
about you know like if you're a slave


---------06:41----------
like if you're a slave let's say like a


---------06:43----------
thousand years ago


---------06:45----------
what did you deserve


---------06:47----------
well like you deserve like less than


---------06:48----------
other people right a lot of slaves


---------06:50----------
didn't even feel like they deserved


---------06:51----------
freedom i mean i've i haven't talked to


---------06:53----------
a bunch of slaves so i don't really know


---------06:55----------
but i'm making that assumption


---------06:57----------
but i've definitely seen for example


---------06:59----------
like in india there's still somewhat of


---------07:01----------
like i mean there isn't like a strict


---------07:02----------
caste system but there's like upper


---------07:04----------
class people and lower class people


---------07:06----------
there are bunches of servants and and


---------07:08----------
you know like there's like this clear


---------07:09----------
idea of like what each group of people


---------07:12----------
deserves


---------07:13----------
so there's like a first class cabin in a


---------07:15----------
train and there's a third class cabin in


---------07:17----------
the train in the first class cabin


---------07:19----------
people get to sit down and third class p


---------07:22----------
people get to stand


---------07:23----------
so i've seen in in my own personal life


---------07:25----------
like how


---------07:27----------
people are taught


---------07:29----------
what to expect from the world and what


---------07:31----------
they deserve


---------07:33----------
and so when you're bullied


---------07:36----------
right when people like make fun of you


---------07:38----------
like on a fundamental level since your


---------07:40----------
mind isn't really that developed


---------07:42----------
you just get some like basic programming


---------07:45----------
that's really like foundational there's


---------07:47----------
not a whole lot of nuance there's not a


---------07:48----------
whole lot of like understanding or


---------07:50----------
digestion or reflection


---------07:52----------
there's just this is how it is


---------07:54----------
so when you're a seven-year-old and like


---------07:56----------
everyone makes fun of you what do you


---------07:58----------
learn about yourself you learn that oh


---------08:00----------
i'm the person that people get


---------08:02----------
gets made fun of


---------08:04----------
and who gets the praise and adoration


---------08:06----------
the bully does


---------08:07----------
right


---------08:08----------
who gets respected and compliments


---------08:11----------
and who gets treats the bully does


---------08:14----------
and what do you get


---------08:15----------
you get the crap


---------08:17----------
you get the short end of the stick you


---------08:19----------
get to be the butt of the jokes and all


---------08:21----------
the good stuff


---------08:22----------
goes to the bully and all the bad stuff


---------08:24----------
goes to you and if this happens to you


---------08:27----------
at a very young age and it's quite


---------08:29----------
profound and doesn't have the right


---------08:30----------
counterbalancing influences there's a


---------08:32----------
lot here where like maybe your home life


---------08:34----------
also is important right so like your


---------08:36----------
parents don't support you in the right


---------08:38----------
way or don't give you that sense of


---------08:39----------
identity of like unconditional love to


---------08:42----------
kind of counter that


---------08:44----------
i'm not saying it's their fault but like


---------08:45----------
you know generally speaking not everyone


---------08:47----------
bully


---------08:48----------
being bullied ends up like this did we


---------08:50----------
see something about


---------08:52----------
yeah okay uh we didn't see much about


---------08:54----------
this person's what their parental what


---------08:57----------
their what the relationships of their


---------08:58----------
parents are like but that's where you


---------09:00----------
see a lot of good modeling


---------09:02----------
so if you sort of learn this about


---------09:03----------
yourself then it kind of becomes true


---------09:05----------
right so it becomes a part of your


---------09:06----------
personality it becomes a part of your


---------09:08----------
identity that i'm the butt of jokes and


---------09:11----------
i'm not the person who gets complimented


---------09:13----------
and believe me kids are really good at


---------09:14----------
this kids are really good at dividing


---------09:16----------
people into groups there's the popular


---------09:18----------
kids and they're not popular kids


---------09:19----------
there's a reason why high school is


---------09:20----------
brutal it's because instinctively we're


---------09:23----------
very hierarchical as children so just


---------09:26----------
like the popular kids and the not


---------09:27----------
popular kids and you get determined you


---------09:28----------
get placed in a particular category


---------09:30----------
which you understand and they understand


---------09:32----------
so once everyone understands the social


---------09:33----------
hierarchy there's some degree of harmony


---------09:35----------
there because everyone has agreed on


---------09:37----------
what steps people take


---------09:39----------
and this is why people don't like it


---------09:40----------
when people get uppity in a social


---------09:42----------
hierarchy right like human beings


---------09:45----------
respond very poorly to people getting


---------09:46----------
uppity we even have a word for it


---------09:49----------
they're like uppity like you don't know


---------09:50----------
your place right sure it's toxic but


---------09:52----------
it's natural


---------09:55----------
so


---------09:56----------
what do you do about this right so the


---------09:58----------
first thing is to understand that these


---------10:00----------
experiences


---------10:02----------
are carried forward from the past they


---------10:05----------
don't necessarily reflect on the present


---------10:08----------
so what our mind does is carries forward


---------10:11----------
energy from our some scars from the past


---------10:13----------
to the present


---------10:15----------
so for example like the fact that you


---------10:17----------
don't feel there was so much resentment


---------10:21----------
no maybe not resentment there's so much


---------10:23----------
like


---------10:24----------
low self-worth which you built up during


---------10:27----------
your teenage years


---------10:29----------
and you haven't processed that you


---------10:30----------
haven't therapized it you haven't you


---------10:32----------
know


---------10:33----------
spiritually removed it so you carry all


---------10:36----------
those emotions with you right it's like


---------10:38----------
emotional baggage we understand this in


---------10:40----------
terms of romantic relationships when you


---------10:42----------
have a bad romantic relationship you


---------10:43----------
carry the emotional baggage forward


---------10:46----------
so when you have a life of being bullied


---------10:48----------
you're carrying that emotional baggage


---------10:50----------
to the present the key thing here


---------10:53----------
is that


---------10:55----------
you need to recognize that that is not


---------10:57----------
from this even though you're feeling it


---------10:59----------
in the present it is not created from


---------11:01----------
this relationship your boyfriend is not


---------11:03----------
love bombing you your boyfriend is


---------11:05----------
genuinely like appreciating who you are


---------11:07----------
but the reason it feels like a love bomb


---------11:09----------
the reason that it feels fake


---------11:11----------
is because you have this


---------11:13----------
idea from the past that you don't


---------11:15----------
deserve this stuff


---------11:16----------
right so if you don't deserve


---------11:18----------
compliments and someone is complimenting


---------11:19----------
you the only logical conclusion you can


---------11:22----------
come to is there's some kind of


---------11:23----------
manipulation going on


---------11:24----------
right it's like really simple


---------11:26----------
completely logical like i know the


---------11:28----------
person feels silly like it doesn't make


---------11:30----------
sense it actually makes perfect sense


---------11:31----------
it's like if i'm a pos and someone is


---------11:33----------
treating me well


---------11:36----------
what am i missing where's the other shoe


---------11:37----------
what do they want from me like what's


---------11:39----------
going on here because i definitely don't


---------11:40----------
deserve this treatment it's actually


---------11:41----------
perfectly logical


---------11:43----------
okay


---------11:45----------
but that's emotional baggage carried


---------11:46----------
from the past


---------11:48----------
so this is where in the moment when you


---------11:49----------
sort of feel that way you need to ask


---------11:51----------
yourself is this a feeling that's being


---------11:53----------
created by this interaction or is this


---------11:55----------
an old feeling that is being stirred up


---------11:58----------
and the more that you're able to


---------11:59----------
recognize oh this is a feeling that i've


---------12:01----------
had from the past that's just like


---------12:03----------
reawakening just notice it kind of like


---------12:05----------
think through it a little bit let it go


---------12:07----------
and and then like you know be where you


---------12:09----------
are with your boyfriend


---------12:12----------
and the more that you do that the more


---------12:13----------
the the baggage will kind of like


---------12:15----------
decrease and the more you'll be able to


---------12:16----------
appreciate the compliments okay that's


---------12:18----------
number one


---------12:20----------
so number two and i saw someone kind of


---------12:22----------
post about this or mention this the


---------12:24----------
other thing is sometimes the way that


---------12:25----------
people react to this


---------12:27----------
is by mastery of the trauma so this is a


---------12:30----------
common thing that sometimes this is why


---------12:31----------
abusers i mean


---------12:33----------
the abused become abusers


---------12:36----------
so there's this psychological thing


---------12:37----------
where like if i'm on the receiving end


---------12:39----------
of a particular interaction if i'm the


---------12:41----------
victim and there's a bully


---------12:44----------
i can become powerful in that scenario


---------12:47----------
by switching roles


---------12:49----------
so the way that i'm gonna like fix this


---------12:51----------
emotional victimization is by becoming


---------12:53----------
the perpetrator because there's like one


---------12:55----------
victim in the scenario


---------12:57----------
and one person with power so there's the


---------12:58----------
powerful and the powerless and in the


---------13:01----------
past i have been the powerless and f


---------13:03----------
that i'm never being powerless again so


---------13:05----------
how can i become powerful oh i can start


---------13:07----------
bullying people


---------13:09----------
so this is what you see you see that


---------13:10----------
like you know a lot of bullies like have


---------13:12----------
bad home situations right i mean


---------13:14----------
sometimes they're just [ __ ] and they


---------13:15----------
have good home situations and don't get


---------13:17----------
appropriately parented which i guess is


---------13:19----------
a bad home situation as well but


---------13:21----------
so sometimes bullies are because they


---------13:23----------
you know parents don't set limits on


---------13:24----------
them they're like brats


---------13:26----------
and they don't like experience


---------13:27----------
consequences but then there's the flip


---------13:28----------
side of it too which is like the reason


---------13:30----------
they're abusive to other kids is because


---------13:32----------
they get abused at home so like you know


---------13:35----------
their parents make fun of them or nasty


---------13:37----------
to them so they just like learn that


---------13:38----------
behavior and then they mimic it


---------13:39----------
elsewhere


---------13:40----------
so we can see like mastery of the trauma


---------13:42----------
by like role reversal like that can


---------13:44----------
happen too it's not happening in this


---------13:45----------
situation but that can result you know


---------13:47----------
that can happen too


---------13:49----------
and so then also like you know


---------13:51----------
what can you kind of like do about this


---------13:53----------
in a very practical sense there are a


---------13:55----------
couple of other things to consider


---------13:57----------
the first is that if you're an


---------13:58----------
altruistic person who does not like to


---------14:00----------
be helped by other people there's


---------14:02----------
somewhat of a little bit of a trick that


---------14:03----------
you can use for your mind i don't think


---------14:05----------
it fixes the core problem but it can it


---------14:07----------
can help you can serve as a band-aid


---------14:09----------
which is recognize that sometimes the


---------14:11----------
nicest thing that you can do for someone


---------14:14----------
else


---------14:15----------
is to let them do something nice for you


---------14:19----------
right so like you like the way that it


---------14:21----------
feels to do something good for someone


---------14:23----------
right


---------14:24----------
you like to be like a kind person


---------14:26----------
and recognize that by accepting their


---------14:29----------
compliments


---------14:31----------
is like your opportunity to just like


---------14:34----------
think about your boyfriend for a second


---------14:35----------
so your boyfriend says thinks thinks


---------14:37----------
you're pretty and says hey you look


---------14:38----------
really great today


---------14:40----------
and if you're like no i don't


---------14:42----------
screw you why are you saying that right


---------14:45----------
that's your instinctive reaction like


---------14:46----------
how does your boyfriend feel it feels


---------14:48----------
terrible


---------14:49----------
on the flip side you could say you know


---------14:51----------
if you say like thank you so much like i


---------14:53----------
was having a rough day today and like


---------14:54----------
hearing that i'm having trouble


---------14:56----------
believing it


---------14:57----------
but i'm so like happy that you feel that


---------14:59----------
way


---------15:00----------
like even if you say that like how's


---------15:01----------
your boyfriend gonna feel you're gonna


---------15:02----------
make him turn him into chad mode he's


---------15:05----------
gonna be like damn


---------15:06----------
my girlfriend was having a bad day and


---------15:07----------
she like can't really accept the


---------15:08----------
compliment but like still i'm doing


---------15:10----------
something good for her i feel great


---------15:12----------
about myself because i am making someone


---------15:14----------
else's life better


---------15:17----------
right


---------15:19----------
so when you let other people do things


---------15:21----------
for you


---------15:23----------
you know it's it's kind of a it's like a


---------15:26----------
really nice thing to do for them


---------15:28----------
right and that's like how you form bonds


---------15:29----------
with people so i've so some time ago you


---------15:31----------
know i i used to like always turn down


---------15:33----------
gifts


---------15:35----------
you know like i like people would want


---------15:37----------
to give me gifts like i'd have like a


---------15:38----------
mentee like i'd write like a letter


---------15:40----------
recommendation or something right so buy


---------15:42----------
some kid


---------15:43----------
and they'd be like i want to send you


---------15:44----------
like a card to say thank you i'll be


---------15:46----------
like you don't need to do that


---------15:48----------
it's not necessary but then i realized


---------15:49----------
like i'm actually doing them a


---------15:50----------
disservice


---------15:52----------
right


---------15:52----------
it's like let them express gratitude


---------15:54----------
like let them practice gratitude like


---------15:57----------
let them express gratitude and then i


---------15:59----------
will accept their gratitude


---------16:01----------
and then like i will just tell them that


---------16:03----------
i appreciate their gratitude and like


---------16:05----------
it's great on all sides


---------16:08----------
so this is so confusing because when i


---------16:09----------
started being a therapist i was kind of


---------16:11----------
like


---------16:12----------
it was really tricky right because


---------16:13----------
people would say thank you so much dr k


---------16:15----------
i'm like i didn't really do much so it


---------16:17----------
made me uncomfortable so i wouldn't


---------16:18----------
accept their things


---------16:20----------
i'd like reject it because it made me


---------16:22----------
feel weird they're like oh my god like


---------16:24----------
you've transformed my life


---------16:26----------
it's like


---------16:27----------
did i what are you talking about bro i


---------16:29----------
just like we've just chatted for a while


---------16:31----------
i'm glad you're doing better but it's


---------16:32----------
mostly you


---------16:34----------
right and then i was like that's


---------16:35----------
actually kind of doing them into the


---------16:36----------
service and so that's then i'll say like


---------16:38----------
you know


---------16:38----------
you're like


---------16:40----------
i'm so glad that your life is doing


---------16:41----------
better i think at the end of the day we


---------16:44----------
meet for one hour a week and you're like


---------16:45----------
living your life for 100 hours a week so


---------16:47----------
i think it's more you than me but i'm


---------16:50----------
happy to accept whatever gratitude you


---------16:52----------
have so


---------16:53----------
right on bro and like keep on trucking


---------16:55----------
and you're very welcome for whatever you


---------16:57----------
know whatever you're great like you're


---------16:58----------
welcome


---------16:59----------
if it was mostly you


---------17:02----------
right so you just accept the ground like


---------17:03----------
accept what they and then like because


---------17:05----------
how is that person gonna feel if they


---------17:06----------
come in and they say thank you so much


---------17:08----------
and i'm like i didn't do anything it's


---------17:09----------
like their gratitude just it it explodes


---------17:12----------
in in the hangar you know it doesn't


---------17:13----------
like get to


---------17:15----------
get out


---------17:16----------
there and so you just let you know


---------17:19----------
accept it so when someone wants to do


---------17:21----------
something nice for you recognize that


---------17:23----------
for them one of the nice the nicest


---------17:25----------
things you can do is as genuinely as


---------17:27----------
possible try to accept what they want to


---------17:28----------
do for you


---------17:30----------
and as you start to engage in these


---------17:31----------
kinds of things you're gonna have


---------17:33----------
different some scars


---------17:34----------
right and you'll start to recognize like


---------17:36----------
if this happens enough like oh maybe i


---------17:38----------
am bringing something to the table not


---------17:40----------
everything not as much as this person


---------17:41----------
thinks i think i'm bringing a little bit


---------17:42----------
less but i'm bringing something to the


---------17:44----------
table and i can be happy for that


---------17:46----------
right there's some truth to this


---------17:49----------
so if you have trouble accepting love


---------17:50----------
you can start by sort of understanding


---------17:52----------
you know where does this idea that i


---------17:54----------
don't deserve to be loved come from


---------17:56----------
you can also start altering your


---------17:58----------
behavior a little bit recognize that


---------17:59----------
even though it makes you uncomfortable


---------18:01----------
it can actually be really really nice to


---------18:03----------
accept someone else's gratitude


---------18:06----------
that you're actually like that's a nice


---------18:07----------
thing to do for them


---------18:09----------
kind of a little bit of a band-aid


---------18:14----------
and the last thing is that


---------18:17----------
you know i don't know how else to say


---------18:18----------
this but you seem like a fantastic


---------18:20----------
person


---------18:22----------
right so like i i think you're


---------18:24----------
absolutely deserving of love like i


---------18:25----------
don't get where like just like look at


---------18:27----------
this look at how awesome this person is


---------18:29----------
to like imagine if this person was in


---------18:30----------
your life


---------18:32----------
so i find myself wanting to love others


---------18:34----------
i love spoiling my friends with small


---------18:36----------
gifts and favors


---------18:37----------
spending time with them


---------18:39----------
like that's i mean it sounds fantastic


---------18:43----------
right like they're self-reflective they


---------18:45----------
like they're not automatic they're not


---------18:48----------
reactive


---------18:49----------
so like i'm not surprised that people


---------18:51----------
you know are happy to you know like this


---------18:53----------
dude is happy to date this girl because


---------18:55----------
she seems like a fantastic person she


---------18:57----------
may have difficulty recognizing that but


---------18:59----------
i think we can all agree


---------19:01----------
right that this is like a good person to


---------19:03----------
date


---------19:05----------
and it's okay that that that doesn't


---------19:07----------
sink in yet right because you've got all


---------19:09----------
this


---------19:10----------
so this is gonna like not make sense


---------19:12----------
and so this is the last thing that i'll


---------19:14----------
kind of leave you all with objectively i


---------19:15----------
know there are a bunch of discrepancies


---------19:17----------
between reality and how i feel and yeah


---------19:19----------
that's because


---------19:21----------
you were told in the first half of your


---------19:22----------
life that you're unlovable and now


---------19:24----------
you're being told that you are lovable


---------19:27----------
and so that's going to feel like a


---------19:28----------
discrepancy because it is one


---------19:30----------
because like it sounds like you were


---------19:31----------
surrounded by [ __ ] earlier and now


---------19:33----------
you're in a like what sounds like a


---------19:34----------
healthy relationship


---------19:35----------
so like there's it's going to feel


---------19:37----------
contradictory and silly to you and this


---------19:39----------
is the real problem this is the kind of


---------19:41----------
the bullet you have to dodge sometimes


---------19:42----------
there's a trap here


---------19:44----------
which is that if you are in a healthy


---------19:46----------
relationship and you like turn to the


---------19:48----------
internet


---------19:49----------
they're gonna tell you oh my god he's


---------19:50----------
love bombing you don't trust them right


---------19:53----------
depending on who you go to


---------19:55----------
what echo chamber you choose to


---------19:56----------
participate in they will actually


---------19:58----------
support whatever your paranoia is


---------20:02----------
and so then i think this person did the


---------20:04----------
right thing which is they looked up love


---------20:05----------
bombing and they realized that like


---------20:06----------
that's not what love bombing is


---------20:10----------
but this is the other problem with the


---------20:11----------
internet is that we like to label things


---------20:12----------
really really quickly and like here's


---------20:14----------
just a quick aside so gas lighting is a


---------20:16----------
good example of this


---------20:17----------
so gas lighting is something that is


---------20:19----------
generally speaking a systemic and


---------20:22----------
malicious process that's aimed to disarm


---------20:25----------
someone's like ability of judgment right


---------20:29----------
it's like when you convince someone that


---------20:30----------
they're crazy


---------20:32----------
but


---------20:33----------
nowadays i hear gaslighting used anytime


---------20:36----------
someone has a different opinion from


---------20:38----------
yours so human beings have different


---------20:41----------
experiences of shared events like if i


---------20:43----------
have an argument with my wife about


---------20:45----------
something


---------20:47----------
going to think one way about it i'm


---------20:48----------
going to recall one thing and they're


---------20:50----------
going to recall something else


---------20:52----------
and now i've seen something really


---------20:53----------
tricky which is that when someone says


---------20:55----------
you did this to me and i say no i didn't


---------20:58----------
and they respond with you're gaslighting


---------21:00----------
me there's a gas lighter here


---------21:03----------
it you can't argue against that right


---------21:06----------
like it it's become something of a weird


---------21:08----------
trump card that like once you play the


---------21:10----------
gaslighting card it's like i can't say


---------21:11----------
anything because i'm just gaslighting


---------21:13----------
you further like i'm not allowed to have


---------21:15----------
an opinion if you accuse me of


---------21:16----------
gaslighting because anything i say is


---------21:18----------
just proof of the gaslighting right it's


---------21:20----------
like kind of weird what's happening


---------21:22----------
it says no you don't get to have a


---------21:25----------
different experience or different


---------21:26----------
perspective from me


---------21:28----------
so be super careful


---------21:30----------
about labels on the internet because in


---------21:32----------
my experience


---------21:34----------
interactions tend to be like nuanced and


---------21:36----------
multi-perspective but what we're


---------21:37----------
starting to do on the internet is get


---------21:39----------
like terminology like we had a really


---------21:40----------
good post the other day


---------21:42----------
about someone was like i had a bad


---------21:44----------
sexual experience i'm not interested in


---------21:46----------
having sex again am i asexual


---------21:48----------
and i see this a lot nowadays where


---------21:50----------
we're starting to label ourselves with


---------21:51----------
things we join that identity and then we


---------21:54----------
don't really acknowledge that sexuality


---------21:55----------
is like an evolving process right


---------21:58----------
so what happens when we start to label


---------22:00----------
ourselves is like then we was like i'm


---------22:02----------
asexual because i had a bad sexual


---------22:04----------
experience i go to an asexual community


---------22:06----------
where everyone else is asexual they


---------22:07----------
encourage me they say hey you can have a


---------22:08----------
lovely wonderful experience being


---------22:10----------
asexual like it's okay it's it's a


---------22:12----------
normal variant of humanity and i'm fine


---------22:14----------
with that i'm not saying that there's


---------22:15----------
anything wrong with being asexual the


---------22:17----------
problem is that sometimes we


---------22:18----------
inappropriately label ourselves


---------22:20----------
so i've had patients for example who


---------22:22----------
have vaginismus who describe themselves


---------22:24----------
as


---------22:25----------
asexual so vaginismus is a


---------22:27----------
a spasm


---------22:29----------
of the vaginal muscles which makes it


---------22:31----------
very painful or even impossible for you


---------22:33----------
to have penetrative intercourse


---------22:36----------
and so they didn't realize they had


---------22:37----------
vaginismus they just thought they were


---------22:39----------
asexual which is like fine


---------22:41----------
right like there's nothing wrong with


---------22:42----------
being asexual but sometimes just because


---------22:44----------
you have difficulty having sex or don't


---------22:46----------
enjoy sex doesn't necessarily mean


---------22:47----------
you're asexual there's a differential


---------22:49----------
diagnosis for that but the second we


---------22:51----------
label something


---------22:52----------
and the second we become a part of that


---------22:54----------
identity


---------22:56----------
then we could be losing something right


---------22:59----------
like because that identity may not apply


---------23:01----------
and i hope to god this is not being


---------23:02----------
interpreted as like dr k is against


---------23:04----------
asexual people i have nothing against


---------23:05----------
asexual people all i'm saying is don't


---------23:07----------
label yourself too early


---------23:09----------
once you've done a very thorough


---------23:11----------
investigation by all means label


---------23:13----------
yourself as asexual and live a happy and


---------23:16----------
fulfilling life without sex


---------23:18----------
which is what most married people have


---------23:20----------
to learn how to do in their 40s and 50s


---------23:22----------
right


---------23:23----------
so like we can manage that


---------23:27----------
so it's okay just don't label yourself


---------23:29----------
prematurely and be careful about some of


---------23:31----------
these labels because don't label your


---------23:32----------
partner as gaslighting


---------23:35----------
when all they're doing is disagreeing


---------23:37----------
right like human beings are allowed to


---------23:39----------
have because that's the kind of thing


---------23:40----------
that is actually going to negatively


---------23:42----------
hurt your relationships if you have a


---------23:44----------
relationship with someone and they


---------23:45----------
disagree with you and you start accusing


---------23:47----------
them of gaslighting like you can't have


---------23:50----------
a conversation there there can't be a


---------23:51----------
way to resolve that conflict once you


---------23:54----------
play that card


---------23:55----------
so be super careful about all these like


---------23:57----------
terms that are getting tossed around


---------23:59----------
which absolutely can describe behavior


---------24:00----------
and sometimes be


---------24:02----------
appropriate like another good example is


---------24:04----------
like monkey branching right where people


---------24:06----------
are like this person's monkey branching


---------24:08----------
they're waiting till they have their


---------24:09----------
next person in order to before they


---------24:11----------
break up with this person it's like yeah


---------24:12----------
some people are like that but the truth


---------24:14----------
is that sometimes relationships are like


---------24:16----------
complex and they're not intentionally


---------24:18----------
monkey branching maybe the reason that


---------24:20----------
they're like breaking up with you and


---------24:21----------
dating this person in rapidity is for


---------24:24----------
all kinds of reasons one is that they


---------24:25----------
can't tolerate being alone


---------24:27----------
so like they're just a serial dater that


---------24:29----------
has nothing to do with monkey branching


---------24:30----------
that just has to do with their inability


---------24:32----------
to be by themselves it's a very real


---------24:33----------
possibility another option is maybe the


---------24:35----------
relationship was dead on the inside and


---------24:37----------
they didn't realize that until they met


---------24:38----------
someone else that started to like they


---------24:40----------
started to catch feelings for


---------24:42----------
and that's when they sort of started to


---------24:43----------
realize and i've seen this too


---------24:45----------
where it's like i didn't realize like


---------24:47----------
how bad this relationship was until i


---------24:49----------
met someone else


---------24:50----------
like how empty the relationship has


---------24:52----------
become it doesn't mean they're monkey


---------24:53----------
branchers


---------24:54----------
there's all kinds of reasons that can


---------24:56----------
explain any given interaction for human


---------24:58----------
beings so just be a little bit careful


---------25:01----------
about judging things prematurely


---------25:04----------
and i realize i've come way far astray


---------25:06----------
from from the post


---------25:08----------
but


---------25:09----------
anyway


---------25:10----------
so kind of going back to this so like


---------25:11----------
for this person just be careful about


---------25:13----------
labeling things right


---------25:15----------
recognize i guess the key takeaway here


---------25:17----------
is that relationships and human beings


---------25:19----------
are complex processes a human being in


---------25:22----------
and of themselves is an incredibly


---------25:23----------
complex process


---------25:25----------
put two of them together throw in


---------25:28----------
interactions and you're getting an


---------25:30----------
increased order of magnitude on the


---------25:32----------
complexity of what's going on


---------25:34----------
so take it slow


---------25:36----------
it's okay for things to be confusing and


---------25:38----------
conflicting ain't no problem with that


---------25:41----------
as you'll discover things will resolve


---------25:42----------
themselves over time


---------25:45----------
and don't label things too quickly or


---------25:47----------
don't stick to those labels be flexible


---------25:50----------
around you know what your interpretation


---------25:51----------
of the relationship is


---------25:54----------
yeah so someone saying had to deal with


---------25:55----------
good vibes only and no drama guys it's


---------25:57----------
so annoying yeah so this is the other


---------25:59----------
thing right so sometimes like people


---------26:01----------
will be like yeah i'm drama free


---------26:03----------
i don't do drama and in adopting that


---------26:06----------
stance


---------26:07----------
they create drama right because like


---------26:11----------
the thing is anytime you're going to


---------26:12----------
have two humans in an interaction


---------26:15----------
there's going to be some kind of


---------26:16----------
conflict


---------26:18----------
and like the way to be you can't be


---------26:20----------
drama free you can be like drama


---------26:21----------
resistant


---------26:23----------
so you can have like good methods of


---------26:24----------
conflict resolution and like managing


---------26:26----------
drama or you can pretend to be


---------26:28----------
drama-free and just peace out anytime


---------26:30----------
like


---------26:31----------
the water gets a little bit rough


---------26:33----------
and then what ends up happening is you


---------26:35----------
don't build like conflict resolution


---------26:36----------
skills and you enter into your next


---------26:38----------
relationship looking for like drama-free


---------26:40----------
stuff


---------26:41----------
and then like you have dudes out there


---------26:42----------
who are looking for like drama-free


---------26:44----------
stuff


---------26:45----------
and like the reason they're looking for


---------26:46----------
it so hard is and because there's so


---------26:48----------
much drama everywhere because they're


---------26:49----------
creating it


---------26:53----------
right


---------26:54----------
like


---------26:55----------
yeah i'm not like looking for like


---------26:58----------
i'm not looking for drama okay so like


---------27:00----------
manage it


---------27:01----------
bro


---------27:02----------
right and it's not just men like this


---------27:04----------
happens to women too and non-binary


---------27:07----------
people


---------27:08----------
i'm judging everyone equally here


---------27:11----------
but like drama-free only works if you're


---------27:14----------
on an island and even then today we've


---------27:16----------
seen posts where there's drama in your


---------27:18----------
head with yourself


---------27:21----------
right so like if you're if there's like


---------27:23----------
if you want to be drama free like


---------27:25----------
don't look to other people


---------27:28----------
i'm not saying ignore other people


---------27:30----------
because some people like said person


---------27:33----------
will attract drama


---------27:35----------
but recognize that you have a hand in


---------27:37----------
the drama and they have a hand in the


---------27:39----------
drama and if you want to live a


---------27:41----------
drama-free life don't worry about


---------27:43----------
finding people that are drama-free worry


---------27:45----------
about conflict resolution right and then


---------27:48----------
the way that you filter


---------27:50----------
people is based on their ability to


---------27:52----------
participate in conflict resolution so


---------27:54----------
there's some people out there that can't


---------27:55----------
participate in conflict resolution i.e


---------27:57----------
these people who say they're drama free


---------27:59----------
because when you have a conflict with


---------28:00----------
them and you say hey i have this issue


---------28:02----------
with you can we talk about it and


---------28:03----------
they're like sorry i'm drama free this


---------28:06----------
sounds like drama to me


---------28:08----------
