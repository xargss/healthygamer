---------00:00----------
hold the thought pay attention so this


---------00:01----------
is what i want y'all to do chat there's


---------00:03----------
two meditations here one we're going to


---------00:04----------
teach you guys in a little bit so first


---------00:06----------
meditation is pay attention to yourself


---------00:09----------
and notice what happens when you have a


---------00:11----------
goal and you're looking for motivation


---------00:13----------
notice the thought


---------00:14----------
that would get you to go and then notice


---------00:17----------
what happens to it


---------00:18----------
don't even try to hold it at first just


---------00:21----------
notice what happens to it right because


---------00:22----------
if you try to hold it then what's gonna


---------00:23----------
happen oh like


---------00:24----------
i need to go to the gym and then you're


---------00:26----------
like oh my god


---------00:28----------
oh my god i'm trying so hard to hold it


---------00:29----------
i'm trying so hard to hold it i'm trying


---------00:31----------
so hard to hold it


---------00:31----------
i'm trying so hard to hold it i'm trying


---------00:33----------
it's not actually thinking about the gym


---------00:36----------
or i need to go to the gym oh my god i'm


---------00:40----------
so dumb i can't hold it


---------00:41----------
i can't hold it i can't hold it i'm so


---------00:43----------
bad at this i'm so lazy


---------00:44----------
i'm so undisciplined not even holding


---------00:47----------
the thought


---------00:48----------
weird pay attention


---------00:52----------
so understand first chat open up that


---------00:54----------
user manual


---------00:56----------
look at the faq of your mind and learn


---------00:59----------
about yourself


---------01:00----------
second thing tarataka we're going to


---------01:02----------
teach you guys


---------01:03----------
a yantra okay so tarataka


---------01:06----------
is fixed point gazing so what i'm going


---------01:08----------
to teach you guys to do what we're going


---------01:10----------
to do is


---------01:10----------
open our we're going to like stare at


---------01:12----------
something


---------01:14----------
and we're going to like look at it


---------01:16----------
without blinking okay so what i want you


---------01:18----------
all to do


---------01:19----------
is i'm going to show you a picture and


---------01:22----------
i'm going to instruct you


---------01:23----------
to look at the middle of the picture


---------01:26----------
without blinking


---------01:27----------
now you can do a half-litted gaze if it


---------01:30----------
starts to get too painful you can close


---------01:32----------
your eyes


---------01:33----------
but try to hold your gaze as long as you


---------01:35----------
can your eyes will start to tear up a


---------01:37----------
little bit which is totally fine that's


---------01:39----------
actually like a good thing it's going to


---------01:40----------
lubricate your eyes if they start to dry


---------01:42----------
out


---------01:43----------
we're going to keep our eyes open for


---------01:45----------
about 30 to 90 probably 60 to 90 seconds


---------01:48----------
if you need to close them before that


---------01:49----------
that's totally fine


---------01:51----------
we're gonna stare at one point and then


---------01:53----------
i'm gonna instruct your mind what to do


---------01:56----------
okay so i'm gonna tell y'all to


---------01:58----------
concentrate


---------01:59----------
at one thing so your eyes are gonna be


---------02:02----------
pointing to one thing like this


---------02:04----------
but i'm gonna tell your attention to


---------02:06----------
move around the periphery


---------02:08----------
so i want you guys to stare at my nose


---------02:10----------
but pay attention to the corner of my


---------02:13----------
chair and you can sort of see it in your


---------02:15----------
peripheral vision does that make sense


---------02:18----------
you can move your attention away from


---------02:20----------
where your eyes are focused


---------02:22----------
i want everyone to sit up straight okay


---------02:26----------
so this is uh the sri antra that's on


---------02:28----------
wikipedia okay


---------02:29----------
anyone's looking for a source so what


---------02:32----------
we're gonna do i want y'all to


---------02:34----------
start by closing your eyes just close


---------02:35----------
your eyes first


---------02:37----------
sit up straight we're going to take a


---------02:39----------
deep breath in and out


---------02:44----------
good we're just going to calm down for a


---------02:46----------
second we're going to take a couple


---------02:48----------
breaths


---------02:53----------
and now i'm gonna ask you to slowly open


---------02:56----------
your eyes


---------02:57----------
and stare at the red dot right in the


---------02:59----------
center


---------03:00----------
okay we're not gonna blink now


---------03:04----------
stare at the red dot focus on it


---------03:08----------
look at it look at it look at it we're


---------03:11----------
going to just focus on that red dot


---------03:14----------
your mind will be distracted by the


---------03:16----------
sensations of not blinking


---------03:18----------
so that's okay just keep looking at the


---------03:20----------
dot


---------03:21----------
try to return your attention to it


---------03:23----------
squint if you need to i haven't done


---------03:24----------
this in a while i'm out of practice


---------03:26----------
[Music]


---------03:27----------
okay just look at the dot gently gently


---------03:29----------
now gently


---------03:30----------
relax so notice that as


---------03:33----------
you let the tension out it becomes


---------03:35----------
easier to look


---------03:39----------
deep breath in and out


---------03:49----------
focus on your breathing keep looking


---------03:51----------
don't blink


---------04:00----------
okay now as you stare at the red dot


---------04:03----------
i want you to focus on the yellow


---------04:05----------
triangle around it don't move your eyes


---------04:07----------
but let your


---------04:08----------
attention move to the yellow triangle


---------04:15----------
and after a breath go to the green


---------04:18----------
triangles around that remember we're not


---------04:19----------
going to move our eyes but move your


---------04:21----------
attention


---------04:22----------
outward expand your attention


---------04:27----------
and then expand outward to the black


---------04:29----------
triangles


---------04:35----------
and then expand outward to the red


---------04:40----------
triangles


---------04:42----------
don't let your eyes move


---------04:46----------
expand outward to the blue triangles


---------04:55----------
nice deep breath subtle and then slowly


---------04:59----------
move outward to what you see outside of


---------05:01----------
that the red petals


---------05:07----------
and then the yellow petals


---------05:13----------
take a deep breath in close your eyes


---------05:19----------
feel the relief and notice the after


---------05:22----------
image


---------05:24----------
look at the center of the after image


---------05:32----------
so focus on the center of the after


---------05:34----------
image with your eyes closed


---------05:40----------
and notice the different aspects so you


---------05:42----------
can even move outward from the center


---------05:44----------
and put your attention to the after


---------05:45----------
image


---------05:46----------
the triangles the circles


---------05:59----------
then you may even notice it's like hard


---------06:01----------
to hold on to the image


---------06:04----------
but you can almost relax a little bit


---------06:06----------
and it'll float to the surface


---------06:15----------
so what we're going to teach you how to


---------06:17----------
do is let it float forward so


---------06:19----------
look at it concentrate on it but if you


---------06:21----------
hold on too tight it may become too hard


---------06:45----------
all right now put your hands together in


---------06:48----------
front of you


---------06:50----------
rub them together rub rub rub rub rub


---------06:52----------
rub rub


---------06:54----------
and then cup them over your eyes


---------07:02----------
deep breaths in and out


---------07:06----------
now slowly open your eyes and let your


---------07:09----------
eyes come down


---------07:10----------
let your hands come down it's okay


---------07:13----------
blinking is fine better to blink than


---------07:15----------
hurt yourself


---------07:17----------
okay chat this is a forbidden jitsu


---------07:21----------
is a powerful technique there's so much


---------07:25----------
to understand about this technique it


---------07:27----------
will teach you guys so many different


---------07:28----------
things


---------07:30----------
so take home points number one do what


---------07:32----------
you can


---------07:33----------
if you need to blink you need to blink


---------07:35----------
okay practice


---------07:37----------
practice practice practice practice


---------07:38----------
makes perfect right so


---------07:41----------
adept meditators like can comfortably do


---------07:44----------
this for like 20 minutes 30 minutes


---------07:46----------
arguably maybe even up to an hour i


---------07:48----------
don't know i've never i don't think i've


---------07:49----------
ever done tractica for like longer than


---------07:50----------
half an hour


---------07:52----------
and the interesting thing is that


---------07:54----------
there's a very cool physiology behind it


---------07:56----------
too like you're the way that your photo


---------07:58----------
receptors work and stuff like that but


---------08:01----------
the key thing here


---------08:02----------
is focus that's all you guys really


---------08:05----------
need to learn from this and there's a


---------08:06----------
lot of other benefits too like


---------08:08----------
people who do thrateka really well learn


---------08:11----------
a real


---------08:12----------
like because we think about focusing is


---------08:14----------
effortful


---------08:15----------
right i don't know if people like get


---------08:18----------
this but


---------08:20----------
optimal flow state is not a state of


---------08:22----------
stress


---------08:24----------
it's a state of relaxed focus


---------08:27----------
so tradica is the best practice to learn


---------08:29----------
relaxed focus


---------08:31----------
and it's especially in the second phase


---------08:33----------
of tradica after we close our eyes


---------08:36----------
because if you're too stressed the image


---------08:38----------
is like shaky


---------08:39----------
and you have to like sort of like step


---------08:41----------
back and the image will float to the


---------08:42----------
surface


---------08:43----------
but holding it there if you step back


---------08:46----------
too much it'll slip away


---------08:48----------
so it's like this sweet spot of like


---------08:51----------
attention and focus


---------08:57----------
right so if you didn't see the image


---------08:58----------
that's okay so


---------09:00----------
the image is going to become more clear


---------09:02----------
the longer you're able to keep your eyes


---------09:04----------
open


---------09:05----------
okay and there's a physiologic reason


---------09:07----------
for that and it has to do with the way


---------09:08----------
that your


---------09:09----------
your i think rhodopsin is the pigment


---------09:11----------
exhausts


---------09:12----------
in your eyes and how it needs to get


---------09:14----------
replenished


---------09:18----------
the shape is called the yantra that is


---------09:20----------
sri yantra


---------09:21----------
and there's also spiritual elements to


---------09:23----------
this practice as well


---------09:24----------
by the way there's a lot about this


---------09:26----------
stuff in dr k's guide um for people who


---------09:28----------
are like curious


---------09:29----------
and and you know more about it


---------09:33----------
but there there's even a spiritual


---------09:34----------
component where the object


---------09:36----------
that you concentrate on is


---------09:39----------
supposed to cultivate a particular kind


---------09:41----------
of spiritual energy


---------09:42----------
now when i teach meditation i sort of


---------09:44----------
have three kind of perspectives on it


---------09:47----------
one is psychological one is


---------09:48----------
neuroscientific and one is spiritual


---------09:51----------
or physiological as well so like


---------09:55----------
this practice i feel really confident in


---------09:57----------
like the psychological effects and the


---------09:59----------
neuroscientific effects


---------10:01----------
i understand the physiology of what


---------10:02----------
happens in your eyes and like why it


---------10:04----------
happens and stuff like that


---------10:05----------
the spiritual stuff you know i


---------10:07----------
personally place value in but you don't


---------10:08----------
need to


---------10:09----------
people are curious about that we can


---------10:10----------
teach you guys about different kinds of


---------10:12----------
yantras and


---------10:13----------
cultivating you know cosmic energies and


---------10:15----------
all that good stuff but


---------10:16----------
let's step set that aside so let's just


---------10:18----------
be a little bit scientific today and


---------10:19----------
focus on


---------10:20----------
the psychological and experience


---------10:22----------
experiential aspect and also like the


---------10:24----------
neuroscience of


---------10:25----------
how meditation helps motivation


---------10:28----------
so someone's asking why does this help


---------10:30----------
motivation because


---------10:32----------
we just explained that that motivation


---------10:34----------
is the ability to


---------10:35----------
hold one thing in your mind for an


---------10:37----------
extended period of time


---------10:38----------
and this is the practice that's


---------10:40----------
basically like push-ups for that


---------10:42----------
someone's asking if you want to quit


---------10:43----------
something can you think about not doing


---------10:45----------
it


---------10:46----------
abso no because


---------10:49----------
wait hold on this is a tricky question


---------10:51----------
if you want to quit something can you


---------10:53----------
think


---------10:53----------
about not doing it no because then


---------10:56----------
you're thinking about not doing it


---------11:01----------
if you want to quit something you can


---------11:03----------
not think about it


---------11:05----------
that'll work and i know it sounds kind


---------11:07----------
of weird but think about all of the


---------11:09----------
things that you've quit


---------11:11----------
why did you quit them because you


---------11:12----------
stopped thinking about them


---------11:15----------
right so if you like think about like


---------11:16----------
getting into a game right oh there's a


---------11:18----------
bunch of hype there are a bunch of


---------11:19----------
advertisements each of those


---------11:20----------
advertisements


---------11:22----------
is putting the thought in your head then


---------11:24----------
you see your favorite streamers like


---------11:26----------
playing beta and it's like oh my god


---------11:27----------
then you're thinking about it more and


---------11:28----------
more then you play the game


---------11:31----------
you play it for eight hours and during


---------11:32----------
that eight hours


---------11:34----------
you're thinking about the game and then


---------11:35----------
when you go to bed at night you're


---------11:37----------
thinking about the game and when you


---------11:38----------
wake up in the morning you're thinking


---------11:39----------
about the game and then what do you want


---------11:40----------
to do you want to play it


---------11:42----------
think about the games that you all used


---------11:44----------
to play when you were nine


---------11:47----------
why don't you play them anymore do you


---------11:49----------
think about them and not play them no


---------11:50----------
you stopped thinking about it


---------11:52----------
right why do we stop playing games chad


---------11:56----------
because we stopped thinking about them


---------11:58----------
can you go too far


---------11:59----------
ocd absolutely you can go too far that


---------12:02----------
is exactly what ocd is i don't know if


---------12:04----------
someone's joining late but like we


---------12:06----------
literally talked about ocd


---------12:07----------
so check out the vod i guess so


---------12:09----------
someone's asking where can i learn all


---------12:11----------
of this ayurveda knowledge like you so


---------12:13----------
first thing to understand this isn't


---------12:14----------
about ayurveda this has very little to


---------12:16----------
do with ayurveda


---------12:17----------
so this is more yoga um and


---------12:20----------
it's because people have been asking


---------12:22----------
that question hey dr k where can i learn


---------12:24----------
this stuff that's why we put together


---------12:25----------
together dr k's guide


---------12:27----------
because it's not ayurveda like i can't


---------12:28----------
point you all to a single book


---------12:30----------
what what we teach on stream is a


---------12:32----------
synthesis of knowledge


---------12:34----------
it includes all the oh hold on it


---------12:38----------
includes


---------12:38----------
all the crap on the bookshelf right


---------12:40----------
there are books on ayurveda their books


---------12:41----------
on neuroscience their books on


---------12:42----------
psychology


---------12:43----------
their books on yoga their books on


---------12:45----------
meditation their books on buddhism


---------12:47----------
we try to put it all together for you


---------12:50----------
i'm done with my part of the guide i was


---------12:52----------
highly motivated for a long period of


---------12:54----------
time even though it was


---------12:56----------
obscenely painful and tiring but i'm


---------12:59----------
done


---------12:59----------
so now it's in post-production why don't


---------13:02----------
you use the word mindfulness


---------13:04----------
there's like literally a video about


---------13:05----------
that in dr k's guide so here's the


---------13:07----------
reason i don't use mindfulness


---------13:09----------
because mindfulness is not meditation


---------13:12----------
so what happened is


---------13:16----------
scientists who had had personal


---------13:19----------
experiences with meditation


---------13:22----------
tried to figure out


---------13:25----------
like they're all these different types


---------13:26----------
of meditation right there's like mantra


---------13:28----------
chanting and


---------13:28----------
there's like zen meditation and then


---------13:31----------
there's like dantrix meditation


---------13:33----------
and then there's like you know kundalini


---------13:36----------
meditation


---------13:37----------
and kriya meditation and so like people


---------13:39----------
are sitting there like how do i


---------13:40----------
understand like how can we study this


---------13:44----------
because it's so different


---------13:45----------
and so what they did is they settled on


---------13:47----------
mindfulness what they did is they took


---------13:49----------
all of the meditative traditions and


---------13:51----------
they tried their best to reduce it down


---------13:54----------
to the most


---------13:55----------
common component and what they settled


---------13:58----------
on was mindfulness


---------14:00----------
and then we started studying mindfulness


---------14:02----------
and the way that i describe it


---------14:04----------
is like there's bread there's pasta


---------14:07----------
there's couscous there's rice and then


---------14:10----------
there are carbs


---------14:13----------
and so there's value in understanding


---------14:15----------
carbs but


---------14:16----------
like i don't want to feed people carbs


---------14:20----------
i want to feed people like rice and


---------14:22----------
bread and couscous right like


---------14:24----------
those are the real thing like you can


---------14:26----------
reduce something to its most basic


---------14:28----------
building blocks


---------14:29----------
but in my experience meditation


---------14:32----------
is in a sense better than mindful or


---------14:35----------
mindfulness is just one branch of


---------14:36----------
meditation because there are a lot of


---------14:38----------
different branches of meditation


---------14:39----------
and mindfulness is just one of them it's


---------14:42----------
in a specific branch so we teach some


---------14:44----------
kinds of mindfulness


---------14:46----------
but sometimes we don't teach mindfulness


---------14:48----------
we teach it on us which are the opposite


---------14:49----------
of mindfulness


---------14:50----------
so thrataka is not mindfulness


---------14:53----------
mindfulness


---------14:53----------
tends to be the wit cultivating the


---------14:55----------
witnessing attitude which is observing


---------14:57----------
things


---------14:59----------
dharana is different because it's


---------15:00----------
focusing your mind it's not observing


---------15:02----------
something


---------15:03----------
it's forcing it into a place and so when


---------15:06----------
i work with patients with trauma i do


---------15:08----------
not teach mindfulness


---------15:10----------
because when you have trauma and you


---------15:12----------
have psychological defense mechanisms


---------15:14----------
that are


---------15:14----------
trying to keep it varied and you just


---------15:17----------
like


---------15:18----------
observe it and you let it out like those


---------15:20----------
people don't do well


---------15:22----------
and so even if you look at the


---------15:24----------
techniques


---------15:25----------
the mindfulness techniques that work for


---------15:29----------
people with trauma they're not really


---------15:30----------
true mindfulness


---------15:31----------
they're actually grounding techniques


---------15:33----------
which is different they're focusing


---------15:34----------
techniques they're


---------15:35----------
actually the exact opposite of


---------15:36----------
mindfulness but we just call it


---------15:38----------
mindfulness in the scientific


---------15:39----------
community because that no one you know


---------15:43----------
now that science has discovered


---------15:45----------
something they think they understand it


---------15:47----------
which is what happens with science


---------15:49----------
how often should we do this meditation i


---------15:51----------
would say at a minimum of every other


---------15:52----------
day


---------15:53----------
ideally every day five to twenty minutes


---------15:56----------
sakshibhav


---------15:58----------
s a k s h i b a b h a v


---------16:02----------
it means witnessing attitude in sanskrit


---------16:04----------
it's just once it's the most actually


---------16:06----------
basic state of consciousness


---------16:08----------
on the path to meditation yeah so people


---------16:10----------
are asking how to do this so what i


---------16:11----------
would say is like you know start with 30


---------16:13----------
to 60 seconds


---------16:14----------
of open-eyed thratika and then close


---------16:16----------
your eyes and do that


---------16:17----------
and then you can try again and


---------16:19----------
eventually what you want to do is try to


---------16:21----------
extend the amount that your eyes are


---------16:22----------
open because remember you're going to


---------16:24----------
have the eyes closed for the same amount


---------16:25----------
of time


---------16:27----------
so like if i can hold my eyes open for


---------16:29----------
90 seconds


---------16:30----------
and then i keep my eyes closed for like


---------16:32----------
another 90 seconds or two minutes or


---------16:34----------
five minutes


---------16:35----------
that's fine and then over time you want


---------16:37----------
to work your way up to 20 minutes of


---------16:39----------
total practice
