---------00:00----------
all right hey man so first of all I


---------00:02----------
wanted to apologize for having to cancel


---------00:04----------
on you a couple of times and just being


---------00:06----------
like literally unable to speak oh no


---------00:09----------
it's fine um so sorry about that


---------00:12----------
but we're here now and so thanks for


---------00:14----------
coming on yeah I'm nervous okay what are


---------00:17----------
you nervous about talking about ADHD in


---------00:22----------
front of everybody because uh it's I


---------00:25----------
don't know it's just something I don't


---------00:27----------
like to talk about well we don't have to


---------00:28----------
talk about ADHD no we I think I it's


---------00:33----------
almost like I want to okay I mean I turn


---------00:35----------
off both chats so I'm trying to like


---------00:37----------
almost pretend that it's just you and me


---------00:39----------
talking okay III want to talk about


---------00:43----------
Haiti because it's probably the thing


---------00:44----------
that to me is the most important to fix


---------00:46----------
okay cuz I I took out it all for six


---------00:49----------
years uh-huh I know what it's like to


---------00:51----------
almost not have ADHD but I feel like


---------00:54----------
it's this might sound weird I feel like


---------00:57----------
it's almost getting worse okay and I


---------00:59----------
think it has to do partially with being


---------01:02----------
on the Internet having three monitors


---------01:03----------
sure


---------01:04----------
seeing twitch channel Hey not reading


---------01:08----------
not doing these things but I I really


---------01:10----------
don't know how to fix it and it's it's


---------01:12----------
scaring me can you hold on I feel like


---------01:14----------
just one second sorry yeah sure


---------01:17----------
hello it's just reset disk or okay so


---------01:23----------
sorry Mitch give me a second okay


---------01:25----------
all right let's just go with it sorry


---------01:27----------
about that


---------01:29----------
um that's okay so you were saying that


---------01:31----------
you feel like your ADHD is getting worse


---------01:33----------
I yeah and I feel like I'm genuinely


---------01:37----------
getting dumber like it it scares me like


---------01:41----------
today for an example I woke up to get


---------01:45----------
cereal and I ate the cereal was walking


---------01:49----------
around my room doing stuff I don't


---------01:50----------
remember what I was doing but I left the


---------01:52----------
refrigerator open and I'd do that almost


---------01:54----------
every single day and it's embarrassing


---------01:57----------
because I don't want my roommates to


---------01:59----------
just see how dumb I could really be and


---------02:03----------
how much I forget so and I think I do


---------02:05----------
this kind of stuff all the time so it


---------02:07----------
sounds like when when you have when you


---------02:09----------
have an attentional problem it sounds


---------02:12----------
like you conflate that


---------02:13----------
you sort of lump that in with


---------02:15----------
intelligence or stupidity hmm but it's


---------02:21----------
like the thing is even with your


---------02:22----------
sentence that you just said I I days


---------02:25----------
that okay that's okay space-time so so


---------02:26----------
it sounds like when you space out you


---------02:29----------
think that that's like you feel stupid


---------02:31----------
you feel like it's an AI all the time


---------02:33----------
okay can I ask you how old you are 25


---------02:38----------
and have you been you've been diagnosed


---------02:40----------
with ADHD or a DD yeah how old at


---------02:43----------
sixteen sixteen okay and you said you


---------02:45----------
were on adderall for a while like six


---------02:48----------
years and six years so when were you


---------02:51----------
first put on our at all I was first put


---------02:55----------
on adderall at 16 and is there a


---------02:57----------
particular reason you stopped three


---------02:58----------
years ago I well I had a heart virus and


---------03:04----------
the if I kept taking it there was a


---------03:08----------
higher risk of me getting the heart


---------03:09----------
virus again so I pretty much was told


---------03:12----------
you can either take it and risk yourself


---------03:14----------
dying or you should stop taking it so I


---------03:17----------
stopped taking it and it I don't know


---------03:22----------
III don't know if it was I don't know


---------03:25----------
it's weird to be off because I I know


---------03:28----------
what it's like to be on adderall and it


---------03:30----------
was euphoric like I remember walking


---------03:32----------
around feeling having euphoric feelings


---------03:34----------
being like oh my god like this is what


---------03:35----------
this is the best feeling ever had in my


---------03:37----------
life like the best feeling ever had in


---------03:39----------
my life was on adderall going to a


---------03:41----------
doctor's office if that was the best


---------03:45----------
thing I ever had okay


---------03:46----------
and you know it's just weird to be off


---------03:50----------
of it and I just want to not I like


---------03:54----------
having ADHD I think creatively it helps


---------03:57----------
a lot but I just want to try to be able


---------03:58----------
to fix it and not think all the time of


---------04:01----------
just 20 different things cuz my brain


---------04:04----------
just goes everywhere and it really is


---------04:07----------
bad like me even just telling you the


---------04:08----------
sentence I'm thinking of the most of


---------04:10----------
random [ __ ] like I'm thinking my


---------04:11----------
friend's house drinking alcohol in July


---------04:14----------
of like 2016 okay for no reason can I


---------04:18----------
just think for a second okay


---------04:24----------
I'm just making a list of talking points


---------04:27----------
okay you feel like it's getting worse


---------04:33----------
right yes what do you mean by that I


---------04:39----------
just think it's harder for me to focus


---------04:42----------
on things I think like even just talking


---------04:45----------
to my girlfriend it's a lot of times I


---------04:48----------
days out a lot of times and it's not


---------04:50----------
just because she's saying stuff that


---------04:52----------
isn't interesting to me um I just I


---------04:56----------
can't focus on what she's trying to tell


---------04:57----------
me and she'll say something to me like


---------04:59----------
Matt I told you that five minutes ago


---------05:01----------
and I already forgot okay and I I hate


---------05:05----------
that I hate that I can't remember things


---------05:07----------
I hate that I can't focus on things I


---------05:10----------
hate that my brain is always everywhere


---------05:12----------
okay that I always have to get explained


---------05:14----------
everything it's horrible and but and


---------05:17----------
what affected the did the adderall have


---------05:18----------
on this stuff the adderall did it really


---------05:22----------
necessarily make me it didn't make me


---------05:26----------
remember as I guess it did kind of make


---------05:29----------
me remember more but it just made me be


---------05:30----------
able to focus more on what people are


---------05:32----------
trying to say so I was able to it I


---------05:35----------
could feel like Mike the car wheels


---------05:37----------
turning as whereas it said yeah sure in


---------05:39----------
my brain I felt I was able to listen to


---------05:43----------
people a lot more understand what


---------05:45----------
they're trying to say and want to talk


---------05:47----------
to them more about stuff okay when an


---------05:49----------
ADHD nowadays I just want to not listen


---------05:51----------
to what people say and shut up and just


---------05:52----------
sit there I don't know okay okay so miss


---------06:01----------
gif have you um have you watched any of


---------06:03----------
our streams before I tried to watch some


---------06:07----------
of them but then I started playing like


---------06:10----------
other games


---------06:11----------
okay no problem so sometimes I talked to


---------06:14----------
people about their feelings in your case


---------06:17----------
I would like to talk to you about that


---------06:18----------
but I think that there are two different


---------06:19----------
paths we can go one is to talk about


---------06:22----------
your experience of ADHD and also some


---------06:25----------
amount of like how you hate it and how I


---------06:28----------
think by extension maybe you hate or


---------06:31----------
frustrated with yourself for being this


---------06:32----------
way right so that's gonna be like a


---------06:35----------
little bit more in


---------06:36----------
emotional and personal the other thing


---------06:39----------
that we can talk about is like what is


---------06:41----------
880 d like like what's happening in your


---------06:44----------
mind and what are the things that make


---------06:46----------
whatever is happening in your mind worse


---------06:48----------
or better and what are the things that


---------06:51----------
you can do to potentially like even


---------06:53----------
improve it over time is it weird if I go


---------06:57----------
grab a piece of pain oh not at all a bit


---------07:00----------
back of a repeat saver yeah this is


---------07:07----------
gonna be challenged because I I'm I


---------07:08----------
don't know if you guys know this but I'm


---------07:09----------
an academic and as academics we like to


---------07:12----------
talk really really long like we just


---------07:14----------
like to just keep going so he's doing


---------07:23----------
well he's coping managing okay okay what


---------07:34----------
does an academic mean so I I have a


---------07:38----------
faculty position


---------07:39----------
so I teach and I my ivory tower so I get


---------07:44----------
in front of groups of people and I just


---------07:45----------
opened my mouth and I keep talking until


---------07:47----------
they're all asleep oh so your teacher


---------07:52----------
yes yeah I mean it's pretty much part of


---------07:55----------
the job yes wait which job twitch


---------07:58----------
streamer being a teacher no just talking


---------08:01----------
until people fall asleep or an ASMR


---------08:03----------
twitch streamer either I was a pen


---------08:09----------
I lost my pen who would have thought I


---------08:18----------
guess I can maybe maybe my twitch chat I


---------08:25----------
mean I I always learn better when I


---------08:27----------
write good let's talk about why that is


---------08:30----------
very good I don't know why you get so


---------08:34----------
excited


---------08:36----------
very good observation why'd you just get


---------08:41----------
so excited about that is it just the


---------08:43----------
interesting thing that I know about


---------08:44----------
myself no I think it's it's a very


---------08:45----------
important principle that if we


---------08:47----------
understand you'll better understand how


---------08:49----------
your mind works and how to get it to do


---------08:51----------
the things that you want it's a really


---------08:53----------
important data book to know okay


---------08:56----------
I also if in terms of like things that


---------08:59----------
make me remember more colors yeah like I


---------09:02----------
like I like vibrant colors I feel awake


---------09:04----------
me mature


---------09:05----------
did you find a pen I have found a blue


---------09:09----------
mark okay um so looks like a crayon yeah


---------09:14----------
maybe this thing won't work I'm sorry


---------09:16----------
from I think a waste of your time oh


---------09:23----------
pretty sure it's a crayon I know I guess


---------09:26----------
my kids have the same crayons they have


---------09:28----------
the little nub that lets them go up and


---------09:31----------
down all right okay I found a pen strong


---------09:35----------
work okay so I was gonna say we can talk


---------09:38----------
about like your feelings and what it's


---------09:40----------
like to have a Dede and your


---------09:41----------
frustrations and things like that or we


---------09:43----------
can talk about understanding what you


---------09:45----------
mean by a Dede because I think it's more


---------09:47----------
complicated than just a Dede so are not


---------09:50----------
uncomplicated there's a broader it's not


---------09:52----------
just an illness your mind is functioning


---------09:54----------
in a particular way so would you like to


---------09:57----------
learn how your mind works or would you


---------09:59----------
like to talk about the personal impact


---------10:01----------
of having a mind that works like that


---------10:05----------
the first okay so help us understand


---------10:11----------
what you mean by a Dede it when I think


---------10:18----------
of ATD I think it's almost like if I


---------10:21----------
can't like draw it like let's say this


---------10:27----------
is what reality is right but for some


---------10:32----------
reason when I'm with ADHD it's almost


---------10:35----------
like this is gonna sound so weird


---------10:43----------
this is how I really think of reality


---------10:46----------
where it's like this is what reality is


---------10:48----------
but I go in such a trance of just


---------10:51----------
thinking of other thoughts that my brain


---------10:53----------
starts to go different ways and I start


---------10:55----------
really having a different person think


---------10:58----------
I'm like just talking to you right now


---------11:00----------
I'm thinking of the Cheetos guy for what


---------11:03----------
rate there's no Cheetos around me but I


---------11:05----------
just words or I don't know why my brain


---------11:07----------
goes this way but I start thinking of


---------11:09----------
other things okay good


---------11:10----------
good observation yeah this is how I


---------11:14----------
would perceive like a tease okay that's


---------11:16----------
that's very good so that's something


---------11:17----------
that we call a tangential kind of


---------11:19----------
thought process where your mind starts


---------11:22----------
here and then it ends up going this way


---------11:25----------
and this way and this way and this way


---------11:26----------
and by the end of it you're like far


---------11:28----------
away from where you started right so


---------11:33----------
your mind you notice that your


---------11:35----------
experience of your mind tends to have


---------11:37----------
like a lot of randomness to it yeah and


---------11:41----------
I I do like the randomness a lot because


---------11:44----------
it's what makes me me like my friend


---------11:46----------
Dave said to me one day he said you


---------11:48----------
you've you have the best


---------11:49----------
word-association I've ever seen in my


---------11:51----------
entire life where and that's what makes


---------11:53----------
me I believe in a lot of ways funny


---------11:55----------
where I will hear someone say a word


---------11:58----------
pick it out and then think of an


---------12:00----------
abstract thought which makes a joke and


---------12:03----------
they're like wow that was funny or you


---------12:05----------
know so I do like a part of my HD a lot


---------12:08----------
and but a lot of it is it sucks like I


---------12:12----------
can't even I can't do basic thing I can


---------12:15----------
do it it's very difficult though it's


---------12:16----------
just like call my mom or really try to


---------12:20----------
remember anything yes it's so so we're


---------12:23----------
gonna talk about that okay so the first


---------12:24----------
thing that I want to do is reframe ad D


---------12:27----------
to something called avatar mind so Vata


---------12:31----------
is the Sun script word for one of these


---------12:34----------
things called a door shows but I want


---------12:35----------
you to think about it like the element


---------12:37----------
of wind


---------12:38----------
do you play RPGs


---------12:40----------
No so I you have like a mind that's like


---------12:44----------
the wind so the wind loudly Wow


---------12:46----------
sure so like you know how they're like


---------12:48----------
different elements right so like in


---------12:50----------
different games and then like elements


---------12:52----------
have properties so a wind mind is one


---------12:55----------
that blows really hard in one direction


---------12:57----------
and then like the wind it can kind of


---------12:59----------
stop right there's a gust of wind and


---------13:01----------
then there's nothing and then sometimes


---------13:03----------
the wind blows this way sometimes the


---------13:04----------
wind blows that way sometimes it stops


---------13:07----------
sometimes it starts again that's kind of


---------13:09----------
what your mind is like it's like all


---------13:11----------
these different gusts of wind it's not


---------13:13----------
like a mind like fire which is sort of


---------13:16----------
steady and stable and like burns and in


---------13:19----------
a consistent way it's also not like


---------13:22----------
water which sort of flows consistently


---------13:24----------
in a particular direction it goes all


---------13:27----------
over the place right hmm


---------13:30----------
yeah that's that's actually a good way


---------13:33----------
yeah all right so that's like the first


---------13:36----------
thing to understand is that each of


---------13:38----------
these mind types is adaptive in some


---------13:42----------
ways but maladaptive in other ways so


---------13:46----------
Charles Darwin studied finches which are


---------13:50----------
little birds and what he noticed is that


---------13:52----------
they have different kinds of beaks some


---------13:55----------
beaks are very like long and pointed and


---------13:57----------
some beaks are like short and powerful


---------13:59----------
and so long and pointed beaks aren't


---------14:02----------
better or worse than short and powerful


---------14:04----------
beaks the long pointed beaks can let get


---------14:07----------
into holes and like fine caterpillars


---------14:09----------
and stuff whereas the short powerful


---------14:11----------
beaks can let crunch seeds with me which


---------14:14----------
one is better


---------14:17----------
hmm they both are exactly so the first


---------14:21----------
thing to understand is that the vato


---------14:23----------
mind your mind is good at some things


---------14:25----------
and it's bad at other things right so


---------14:29----------
you know do you think that's with


---------14:30----------
everybody or do you think that's just


---------14:31----------
with ADHD people no I think it's with


---------14:34----------
everyone so fire minds have some


---------14:36----------
strengths and weaknesses water Minds


---------14:38----------
have some strengths and weaknesses wind


---------14:40----------
minds have some strengths and weaknesses


---------14:42----------
so your strength and so this is the


---------14:45----------
interesting this is what I don't like


---------14:46----------
about the pathology system so we say you


---------14:48----------
have an illness we miss out on the fact


---------14:51----------
of something very important that you


---------14:53----------
notice which is that your mind is


---------14:54----------
actually better than other people at


---------14:56----------
some things hmm like you're funnier your


---------14:59----------
word association is good


---------15:01----------
your dynamic you're actually a good


---------15:02----------
entertainer because no one knows what


---------15:04----------
they're gonna get when they watch you on


---------15:06----------
stream it's probably instrumental to a


---------15:09----------
lot of your success and it is a big part


---------15:12----------
of a lot of your failure you see that


---------15:14----------
mmm so we just have to understand that


---------15:16----------
this is how your mind works and there's


---------15:18----------
some things you're gonna be good at and


---------15:19----------
some things you're gonna be bad at and


---------15:20----------
the key to becoming successful is to


---------15:24----------
understand okay what can we capitalize


---------15:26----------
what can we like support about the way


---------15:28----------
of that my mind is and what do we need


---------15:30----------
to like account for or like kind of like


---------15:35----------
what what are the things that my mind


---------15:36----------
sucks at and how do we make that better


---------15:38----------
with me okay


---------15:39----------
the first thing is that generally


---------15:42----------
speaking your ability your minds ability


---------15:45----------
to focus on one thing at a time changes


---------15:50----------
over the course of your lifespan right


---------15:52----------
so like like let's think about what's


---------15:54----------
the difference between the mind of a


---------15:56----------
five-year-old a 15 year old a 25 year


---------15:59----------
old and a 35 year old let's start with 5


---------16:01----------
and 15 what what so five-year-olds mind


---------16:03----------
like not not strong what do you mean


---------16:09----------
just googoo gaga


---------16:12----------
I mean I don't know like they think they


---------16:14----------
just they their yes very good


---------16:17----------
pretty much like how I am nowadays so


---------16:19----------
what is that let's define that beautiful


---------16:21----------
point they just will be thinking of


---------16:25----------
something and then just think of


---------16:27----------
something else and see something shiny


---------16:29----------
and run away absolutely right so their


---------16:31----------
mind wanders a lot the attention of


---------16:33----------
their mind is not focused on one thing


---------16:35----------
for a long period of time


---------16:37----------
hmm so what changes when you're 15 uh


---------16:42----------
instead of random things it starts


---------16:45----------
becoming women's boobs sure so there's


---------16:47----------
more focus right and so like sometimes


---------16:51----------
there are particular objects that your


---------16:54----------
mind can retain its focus on so you


---------16:56----------
noticed another really important thing


---------16:57----------
which is that your minds ability to


---------16:59----------
focus is not the same it can be subject


---------17:03----------
dependent right so your mind can focus


---------17:07----------
more if if you are presented with the


---------17:08----------
right stimulus and can focus less if


---------17:11----------
you're presented with another stimulus


---------17:14----------
so what do you think mine is now that


---------17:16----------
I'm 25 just yeah so we'll get we'll get


---------17:19----------
there in a second so then what's that


---------17:20----------
are between a 15 year old and 25 year


---------17:22----------
old I guess I would probably say they


---------17:27----------
have they're an adult now they have work


---------17:28----------
yeah they have responsibility so what


---------17:30----------
does that mean for their mind how does


---------17:32----------
their mind work I'm instead of focusing


---------17:35----------
on like all about I would say it's


---------17:43----------
probably more if I describe it I guess


---------17:45----------
it's more water


---------17:46----------
very good easy beautiful what does that


---------17:50----------
mean though yeah I like when you smile


---------17:53----------
cuz I I sort of got your teacher right


---------17:55----------
sure


---------17:56----------
no teacher has ever smiled at me unless


---------17:59----------
I'm getting kicked out of the class like


---------18:00----------
they don't I've never had a teacher that


---------18:02----------
was like oh they enjoy it they were like


---------18:06----------
proud that I said something that's


---------18:09----------
shitty why I was always the class clown


---------18:15----------
like I I was I would say one joke to try


---------18:18----------
get kicked out like I knew I was gonna


---------18:19----------
get kicked out but I would just say to


---------18:20----------
me so misc if you're good at this so I


---------18:23----------
don't know if you realize this but like


---------18:25----------
you're giving me answers which are not


---------18:28----------
complicated explanations but capture the


---------18:32----------
essence of the answer


---------18:34----------
that's why I'm smiling because you can't


---------18:37----------
put into words but you [ __ ]


---------18:39----------
understand because when you say how what


---------18:41----------
is a five year olds mind like you


---------18:43----------
stumble around with your words which I


---------18:45----------
think sometimes makes you feel stupid


---------18:47----------
and makes other people maybe think that


---------18:48----------
you're stupid but then you do this that


---------18:52----------
captures a five year olds mind you see


---------18:55----------
that and then when I asked you I just


---------18:58----------
introduced 30 seconds ago


---------19:00----------
the concept of elements and mind and you


---------19:04----------
are already understanding that concept


---------19:06----------
in bringing it back to me a 25 year olds


---------19:09----------
mind is more like water you have in the


---------19:12----------
span of 60 seconds taking an entirely


---------19:14----------
new concept understood it you can


---------19:17----------
manipulate that information and you can


---------19:19----------
speak my language this is the strength


---------19:21----------
of Avada mind you learn incredibly fast


---------19:26----------
you can't focus on things for a long


---------19:28----------
amount of time but I can drop you in the


---------19:30----------
middle of nowhere where you don't


---------19:32----------
understand what the [ __ ] is going on


---------19:33----------
you'll understand what's going on in


---------19:35----------
four hours because your mind is so fast


---------19:39----------
at accumulating information right so a


---------19:44----------
dynamic scenario is gonna be good for


---------19:46----------
your mind what are you feeling you look


---------19:48----------
like you're feeling something I feel


---------19:51----------
happy I mean I I do feel stupid all the


---------19:55----------
time now and for someone to say that I'm


---------19:57----------
not dumb eh it's it's it makes me feel a


---------20:03----------
lot better I just feel nobody and but do


---------20:06----------
you get that I'm just not saying that to


---------20:07----------
be nice like do you do you agree with


---------20:09----------
what I'm saying like do you understand


---------20:11----------
how your mind is picking up new concepts


---------20:14----------
and like using them in a very rapid way


---------20:17----------
I I don't think I'm dumb Minh I know I


---------20:24----------
could be smarter I know I am genuinely a


---------20:27----------
smart person I wouldn't be where I am


---------20:29----------
today if I was just dumb you know I


---------20:32----------
obviously am smart in a lot of ways and


---------20:35----------
I know I understand things but I just


---------20:36----------
feel like that it's almost like a piece


---------20:39----------
of me is turned off right now and I


---------20:41----------
really want to try to turn it back on


---------20:43----------
but what I just did to you is I don't


---------20:45----------
know if you've been noticing I've


---------20:46----------
actually been staring


---------20:47----------
down not looking at the screen because


---------20:50----------
I've been able to focus a lot more just


---------20:52----------
staring at my keyboard just literally


---------20:54----------
trying to listen and there's one thing I


---------20:56----------
don't do enough at nowadays and I think


---------20:58----------
I just learned that with you is they


---------21:00----------
don't listen as much as I need to


---------21:03----------
because when I listen now I remember a


---------21:05----------
lot of things yes this is number one of


---------21:07----------
the points that I jotted down so I want


---------21:09----------
you understand your memory is not bad at


---------21:11----------
all


---------21:11----------
it's your attention that's the problem


---------21:13----------
right so yeah a lot of people with AD D


---------21:17----------
think they have bad memory so like when


---------21:19----------
you describe the fridge incident you


---------21:21----------
think I forgot because English is like


---------21:23----------
an unsophisticated language when it


---------21:25----------
comes to the mind you say I forgot to


---------21:27----------
close the door which implies that it is


---------21:30----------
a memory problem because the word forget


---------21:32----------
has to do with memory right but if we


---------21:35----------
think about memory memory is about


---------21:37----------
reaching into like the library of your


---------21:40----------
mind and pulling something out that's


---------21:42----------
not your problem you can actually pull


---------21:44----------
something out of your mind very easily


---------21:46----------
the problem is stuff doesn't go in so


---------21:50----------
your mind doesn't process because it is


---------21:52----------
distracted that the door is open in the


---------21:55----------
first place and what you're exactly yes


---------22:00----------
and what you're noticing now is that


---------22:02----------
you've somehow in the course of this


---------22:03----------
conversation figured out how to listen a


---------22:06----------
little bit better so what does that mean


---------22:08----------
that means that your attention is


---------22:10----------
actually focused on what I'm saying and


---------22:13----------
therefore you are learning and getting


---------22:16----------
the information in your problem is not


---------22:18----------
one of memory it's that the information


---------22:20----------
doesn't come in but sure and so how are


---------22:26----------
you listening to me now I'm just I am


---------22:30----------
trying to just focus all on my hearing


---------22:34----------
and just stare I'm literally just


---------22:35----------
staring at one keyboard or one key go


---------22:38----------
ahead so I I asked you how and what


---------22:40----------
you're doing is focusing your attention


---------22:43----------
on something sensory and somehow by


---------22:48----------
staring at a keyboard my words are


---------22:51----------
sinking in better


---------22:53----------
how about because there's no


---------22:55----------
distractions why aren't there


---------22:57----------
distractions very good misc


---------22:59----------
because I'm looking at one specific


---------23:04----------
thing like for example when I'm


---------23:06----------
streaming there's like three monitors


---------23:09----------
thousands of people in chat donations


---------23:12----------
people trying to get my attention one


---------23:14----------
with you right now it's just one


---------23:17----------
keyboard and then I'm just listening to


---------23:19----------
you so do you have a DD right now yes


---------23:25----------
yes I still do absolutely is it


---------23:28----------
affecting you the way that it does at


---------23:29----------
other times no not as much beautiful so


---------23:34----------
that's something we have to understand


---------23:36----------
right so the first thing to understand


---------23:38----------
is that just because you have a DD there


---------23:40----------
are literally things that you can train


---------23:43----------
yourself to do there are also


---------23:44----------
environmental things that you can do to


---------23:47----------
influence that your mind to do a better


---------23:51----------
job at what you want it to and you are


---------23:54----------
actually doing that right now so I'll


---------23:56----------
tell you exactly what's going on you


---------23:59----------
worry so normally your mind is a


---------24:01----------
thousand different things you were


---------24:03----------
focusing on one thing to keep all of the


---------24:05----------
other things at bay does that make sense


---------24:09----------
so your mind by focusing it on one thing


---------24:12----------
which is like a piece of paper your


---------24:14----------
ability to listen to my words actually


---------24:17----------
improves and you're already figuring you


---------24:19----------
figure to actually bisque if you figured


---------24:20----------
all this stuff out bizarrely it's great


---------24:22----------
and you've also noticed what is the


---------24:25----------
circumstance that leads you to have a


---------24:27----------
more ATD mind you've already talked


---------24:30----------
about it the circumstance that leads me


---------24:33----------
to have a more a dee dee yes distraction


---------24:36----------
yes


---------24:36----------
like what yes right so like if I'm out


---------24:43----------
with my like anybody like one one place


---------24:46----------
I have eighty mystic of somewhere but I


---------24:48----------
have ADHD more at grocery stores that


---------24:51----------
I've ever had in anywhere and that's


---------24:53----------
because I've noticed that it's if I've


---------24:57----------
tried to talk to my friend there's a


---------24:59----------
thousand different things behind him


---------25:01----------
that can grab my attention because


---------25:02----------
colors grab my attention a lot there's a


---------25:05----------
thousand different things that can grab


---------25:06----------
my attention


---------25:08----------
people talking noises and all those


---------25:10----------
things and they just I am completely out


---------25:14----------
of it when I'm at grocery stores or at


---------25:15----------
like a Walmart or something


---------25:16----------
yes but I feel like right here life it's


---------25:19----------
like it's a black keyboard there's


---------25:21----------
nothing else that's very stagnant like


---------25:23----------
what you said I feel that I can talk and


---------25:26----------
listen a lot more and also I feel like I


---------25:28----------
in general I could speak better yes


---------25:29----------
right so good so you're recognizing that


---------25:32----------
there are some kinds of environments


---------25:34----------
that are so your mind is prone to


---------25:36----------
distraction and so if you're in a high


---------25:39----------
stimulus environment with a lot of


---------25:42----------
different things coming at you it's


---------25:44----------
gonna amplify your vodka


---------25:45----------
it's gonna increase your ad D and if


---------25:48----------
you're in a low stimulation environment


---------25:51----------
then your minds ability to focus is


---------25:53----------
going it's gonna be better right so I


---------25:58----------
think unfortunately one of the the bad


---------26:01----------
things about our current society is that


---------26:03----------
technology and the rapidity of


---------26:05----------
Technology trains your brain to not


---------26:08----------
think about one thing mm-hmm


---------26:11----------
right so Twitter teaches our brain to


---------26:16----------
shift from one thought to another very


---------26:19----------
very rapidly


---------26:20----------
reddit teaches our brain to shift from


---------26:23----------
one thing to another very rapidly


---------26:25----------
there's some interesting research about


---------26:27----------
children and screen time so people are


---------26:30----------
wondering like what's the effect are if


---------26:32----------
people if kids watch like screens like


---------26:35----------
iPad or YouTube or whatever does they


---------26:37----------
make them more prone to ad D because ad


---------26:39----------
D is on the rise and it turns out that


---------26:41----------
it's not necessarily the screen it's


---------26:43----------
whether they watch something long form


---------26:45----------
or short form so if you watch an episode


---------26:48----------
of Sesame Street that's 30 minutes that


---------26:52----------
doesn't make them as a DD as watching


---------26:55----------
YouTube videos that are three minutes


---------26:57----------
long because your your brain is training


---------27:00----------
itself to shift its attention shift


---------27:02----------
shift shift shift shift


---------27:04----------
and your environment with streaming and


---------27:07----------
managing chat and stuff like that so by


---------27:09----------
the way you're also good at that right


---------27:11----------
you your mind can handle three different


---------27:15----------
monitors twitch chat donations this that


---------27:17----------
if you think about it like some people's


---------27:19----------
minds people's whose minds are like


---------27:20----------
water have trouble with that they're


---------27:23----------
like no man I just want to flow in one


---------27:24----------
direction and like I can't [ __ ] like


---------27:27----------
I'm sort of like this so I've trained my


---------27:29----------
mind - you know attend to this and I


---------27:31----------
find that like I do a really bad job if


---------27:33----------
I look at the donations and stuff it


---------27:35----------
completely derails me so I have to like


---------27:37----------
not look at chat and I don't look at my


---------27:39----------
viewer account and I don't look at any


---------27:41----------
of that because if I start doing that I


---------27:42----------
lose my attention with you so there are


---------27:45----------
some vulnerabilities that your mind has


---------27:47----------
and if you account for your


---------27:49----------
vulnerabilities it's gonna do a better


---------27:51----------
job so technology is gonna make your


---------27:55----------
mind more vayas gonna make your ATD


---------27:56----------
worse yeah a hundred percent it does


---------28:00----------
okay i i've noticed that i've tried to


---------28:02----------
stop looking at socials and stuff like


---------28:04----------
that because it's and also just


---------28:09----------
constantly trying to like well something


---------28:13----------
that i do a lot is i'll i'll open google


---------28:15----------
look at something close google go to a


---------28:17----------
game open google do something i don't


---------28:20----------
even realize i did it like it just comes


---------28:21----------
naturally i don't even mean to do it and


---------28:23----------
i i've been trying to it's not easy it's


---------28:27----------
very hard yeah i'm trying to do that way


---------28:30----------
less or scrolling through twitter


---------28:32----------
instagram why i never look at it so so i


---------28:36----------
want to point something out to you so


---------28:38----------
like the cool thing is that you may be


---------28:39----------
able to stare at objects to help keep


---------28:42----------
your attention focused right so what


---------28:45----------
you're doing is actually something


---------28:46----------
called a donna which is actually a


---------28:48----------
meditation technique so it is focusing


---------28:50----------
your attention on one particular thing


---------28:52----------
so now we're gonna talk about how to


---------28:54----------
make things better so the aggregate


---------28:56----------
amount of random-ass screen time that


---------28:59----------
you get exposed to is gonna make you


---------29:01----------
more a dee dee


---------29:03----------
yes so if you spend time doing other


---------29:05----------
activities you're literally giving your


---------29:08----------
mind like time to operate in a


---------29:12----------
particular way so it's sort of like you


---------29:15----------
know if you spend a bunch of time


---------29:17----------
walking it's not gonna make you better


---------29:19----------
at swimming but if you spend half of


---------29:21----------
your time in the water and half of your


---------29:22----------
time walking your body's gonna get good


---------29:24----------
at both things mm-hmm that makes sense


---------29:27----------
see like look that's good I like that


---------29:29----------
yeah so I don't know if you know this


---------29:31----------
miss gif but I tend to have very long


---------29:34----------
and complicated sentences that people


---------29:36----------
tend to have difficulty following really


---------29:39----------
I thought I liked that I thought that


---------29:41----------
analogy or I don't know what that is but


---------29:42----------
I like yeah so you're you're attending


---------29:45----------
right that's very good


---------29:47----------
so I want you to spend time the


---------29:51----------
dedicated amount of time every day


---------29:54----------
focusing on just like attending to one


---------29:57----------
thing right so whether that's a


---------29:59----------
conversation or whether that's this or


---------30:00----------
whether that's that and in terms of your


---------30:02----------
girlfriend if you want to you know


---------30:04----------
improve your relationship and not


---------30:06----------
frustrate her you guys both need to


---------30:09----------
understand that like if you're outside


---------30:11----------
at a grocery store your capacity to


---------30:13----------
attend to her is going to be decreased


---------30:18----------
yeah and so for you to even use some


---------30:21----------
language like hey it sounds like what


---------30:23----------
you're saying is important right now is


---------30:25----------
it okay if we just like go to a place


---------30:26----------
where I can really just listen to what


---------30:28----------
you're saying and maybe sit in the car


---------30:30----------
or something like that like so you can


---------30:31----------
you can delay those conversations and


---------30:33----------
it's a weird thing to tell someone but


---------30:35----------
if she yeah I just feel bad yeah why do


---------30:38----------
you feel bad because it just sounds I


---------30:43----------
feel so dumb that I have to say that to


---------30:45----------
someone like hey you I can't talk to you


---------30:49----------
right now because I can't folk like


---------30:51----------
we're just at a supermarket


---------30:53----------
I can't focus on what you're saying but


---------30:54----------
it's true I I know it's true because it


---------30:57----------
happens like we went to sushi and I I


---------31:02----------
couldn't for the life of me focus on


---------31:05----------
what she was doing because there was a


---------31:07----------
birthday party going on behind her there


---------31:09----------
was like


---------31:10----------
all this other stuff people walking


---------31:14----------
people talking it was raining and I just


---------31:16----------
eyes nothing I could focus on I couldn't


---------31:18----------
focus on anything she was saying I felt


---------31:20----------
terrible because I felt that's where I


---------31:23----------
felt so dumb so maybe I need to just


---------31:26----------
tell her we need there's times where I


---------31:28----------
can't focus on stuff cuz you said


---------31:31----------
there's pros and cons to my brain and


---------31:35----------
this is one of the cons that I have to


---------31:36----------
deal with absolutely right so this is


---------31:39----------
gonna be hard miss Kip but you have to


---------31:40----------
let yourself be where you are what does


---------31:45----------
that mean great question so a lot of


---------31:49----------
people are in a particular place right


---------31:52----------
so like they have certain strengths and


---------31:54----------
weaknesses and they beat themselves up


---------31:57----------
so much for being where they are that


---------31:59----------
they don't like let themselves be there


---------32:02----------
hmm


---------32:03----------
does that make sense yeah being present


---------32:05----------
being present you mean just not only


---------32:06----------
being present but like accepting that


---------32:08----------
you suck at some stuff that other people


---------32:11----------
find very easy and normal I'm fine with


---------32:14----------
sucking at most just like I I actually I


---------32:16----------
don't mind it what's up being bad a lot


---------32:19----------
of what bothers you so much about this I


---------32:22----------
I just I hate I feel like I'm not living


---------32:24----------
like I feel like I'm not and doing I'm


---------32:28----------
not enjoying conversations as much I


---------32:30----------
like it bothers me that I could see


---------32:32----------
people talking about stuff and I either


---------32:35----------
am just not enjoying it or be I just


---------32:38----------
don't I can't listen to them because I


---------32:40----------
just don't care or I hate that I have a


---------32:42----------
conversation with my mom and I just feel


---------32:44----------
like 20 seconds into the conversation I


---------32:47----------
stopped listening and I just start


---------32:48----------
saying okay yeah blah blah blah giving


---------32:50----------
generic answers and then I'm not


---------32:51----------
listening to the conversation what's


---------32:53----------
wrong with it I'm thinking of a hundred


---------32:54----------
different things


---------32:57----------
what's wrong with is I just feel like


---------32:58----------
I'm not being present and I hate not I


---------33:01----------
want to be present more because I hate


---------33:04----------
about not being present


---------33:07----------
I don't feel like I'm enjoying life I


---------33:10----------
feel like I'm missing out on a lot of


---------33:13----------
things by not being present because a


---------33:16----------
lot of times I'll be doing this with my


---------33:19----------
brain to try to make jokes and try to


---------33:23----------
make people laugh or try to entertain


---------33:25----------
and I won't be here and because I'm not


---------33:29----------
there and everyone else is there they're


---------33:31----------
all enjoying themselves with me the only


---------33:33----------
thing I'm doing the whole time is


---------33:34----------
thinking of random stuff to make jokes


---------33:37----------
and say stupid stuff and I know there's


---------33:41----------
a balance of it I've been there before


---------33:42----------
where my brains like disconsolate but


---------33:45----------
I've had a balance before where I was


---------33:47----------
able to enjoy myself and focus at


---------33:49----------
parties or focus at with someone but


---------33:52----------
also still be funny and I just want to


---------33:55----------
try to get to that balance more because


---------33:57----------
right now I feel like if there's like a


---------33:59----------
middle I'm sorry from these drawings are


---------34:02----------
weird but if there's like a middle where


---------34:04----------
I want to be I think this is like you


---------34:07----------
know over here it's like really you


---------34:12----------
could play like what's the water and


---------34:14----------
over here's air I want to be more in the


---------34:18----------
middle of water in air or as close to as


---------34:21----------
middle as like possibly very good so now


---------34:23----------
let me ask you something miss gift when


---------34:25----------
you write why is it easier for you to


---------34:28----------
explain things I don't know what so what


---------34:32----------
make the threats right there in front of


---------34:34----------
me so I want you to notice something


---------34:35----------
when you're not writing and you're not


---------34:38----------
focused on your keyboard what is the


---------34:41----------
speed of your thoughts can I see the


---------34:44----------
other side what do you have the


---------34:46----------
different boxes oh yeah


---------34:49----------
so how long does it take you to get from


---------34:51----------
the bottom-left box to the top right box


---------34:54----------
in about one sentence of Utah exactly so


---------34:58----------
when you're drawing something is your


---------35:00----------
mind focusing on one thought for a


---------35:03----------
longer period of time is your mind


---------35:05----------
moving slower


---------35:09----------
i spaced out he said oh yeah so when


---------35:10----------
you're drawing something is your mind


---------35:12----------
moving faster or slower than the boxes


---------35:15----------
slower when you write what is the speed


---------35:19----------
of thoughts that you think compared to


---------35:21----------
the thoughts that you write what I think


---------35:24----------
they're way faster what I'm writing its


---------35:26----------
way slimmer so now we understand when


---------35:30----------
you focus on a keyboard what is the


---------35:33----------
speed of your thoughts slower so all you


---------35:37----------
need to do is use certain techniques to


---------35:41----------
slow down your mind and the reason that


---------35:43----------
writing helps our memory is because we


---------35:46----------
literally sit on that thought for a


---------35:49----------
longer period of time than thinking does


---------35:53----------
that make sense if I write out you know


---------35:55----------
that h2o is water and water is a liquid


---------35:59----------
can be a liquid gas and solid that


---------36:01----------
sentence takes two seconds to think it


---------36:04----------
takes two seconds to say but it also


---------36:06----------
takes way longer to write and if I write


---------36:09----------
it my mind is literally sitting on that


---------36:12----------
thought for a greater amount of time and


---------36:14----------
the longer that we sit on a thought the


---------36:16----------
further in it sinks so for you to be


---------36:21----------
able to attend to conversations all we


---------36:23----------
need to teach you how to do miss give is


---------36:24----------
to slow down the speed of your mind


---------36:26----------
and you've already discovered many


---------36:31----------
things that slow down the speed of your


---------36:32----------
mind and the cool thing the really cool


---------36:35----------
things to just think about this for a


---------36:36----------
second when you slow down your mind


---------36:38----------
you're actually able to do the very


---------36:40----------
things that you feel stupid for not


---------36:41----------
doing like you can do it you just have


---------36:46----------
to duplicate what you're doing right now


---------36:48----------
yeah what do you think III still don't


---------36:52----------
think I can do as much as you think I


---------36:54----------
can do yes like III don't think I can go


---------36:57----------
to school and you get good grades like I


---------36:59----------
could on adderall okay it's just a


---------37:01----------
different beast yeah cuz I think there's


---------37:03----------
things that I suck at like school on


---------37:07----------
ADHD know what stuff like things you


---------37:09----------
think but I do think I can at least slow


---------37:11----------
down my brain on what makes you think I


---------37:12----------
think you can succeed at school maybe I


---------37:16----------
was wrong


---------37:17----------
so bisque if I think you I agree with


---------37:20----------
you that I think that I


---------37:22----------
have more faith in what you're capable


---------37:24----------
of than you think you do


---------37:26----------
and I also think that school is gonna be


---------37:28----------
a very difficult environment for you but


---------37:31----------
this is what I will say I think you


---------37:33----------
could be very successful without school


---------37:35----------
so school is for water people and fire


---------37:38----------
people it's for river people and you


---------37:41----------
know bonfire people it's not for about


---------37:43----------
that people so the other thing or


---------37:46----------
certain kinds of school so I think there


---------37:48----------
are other kinds of school that you could


---------37:50----------
do but like sitting in a like if you had


---------37:51----------
to like come and listen to my lectures


---------37:53----------
you'd be screwed actually my lecture


---------37:55----------
isn't pretty good I'm pretty good about


---------37:56----------
that but so you know if you have to sit


---------38:01----------
in front in a classroom and focus like


---------38:03----------
that is not what your mind is designed


---------38:04----------
for I don't think you're gonna ever


---------38:06----------
excel in that scenario but I think part


---------38:08----------
of the advantage of understanding Vata


---------38:09----------
is that in order to succeed in life you


---------38:11----------
don't have to be one of those people the


---------38:13----------
whole point of being vodka is to


---------38:15----------
structure your life so that you succeed


---------38:19----------
where wimpy I mean water people or fire


---------38:21----------
people would fail like extremists


---------38:24----------
exactly so I for example have four or


---------38:27----------
five jobs and what I found so when I was


---------38:30----------
failing out of college might so I went I


---------38:33----------
was a freshman in college playing it's a


---------38:35----------
bunch of video games also ran for like


---------38:36----------
student council joined a bunch of gloves


---------38:38----------
joined a fraternity took like two


---------38:42----------
different languages or actually in my


---------38:43----------
first year I took Spanish Japanese and


---------38:45----------
Mandarin no sorry Spanish and Japanese


---------38:47----------
and then Mandarin my second year and


---------38:49----------
then like so studied philosophy and was


---------38:51----------
majoring in like biology and all this


---------38:53----------
kind of crap my mind was all over the


---------38:55----------
place and I just failed like I had like


---------38:57----------
a 1.5 GPA and so my dad comes to me and


---------39:01----------
he says I'll look what you need to do is


---------39:03----------
just focus on studies like don't do any


---------39:05----------
of the other stuff so my second year I


---------39:07----------
dropped all the clubs stayed in the


---------39:09----------
fraternity still played video games what


---------39:12----------
do you think happened to my GPA is I


---------39:13----------
focused on


---------39:15----------
just 1.6 nope


---------39:18----------
1.4 oh nice let's close when even lower


---------39:23----------
and then so then what I said is like man


---------39:24----------
[ __ ] this I'm not even gonna take a full


---------39:26----------
class load I'm just gonna take two


---------39:27----------
classes so my second semester of my


---------39:30----------
sophomore year I just took two classes


---------39:31----------
and focused on those two classes even


---------39:34----------
more what do you think happened to my


---------39:35----------
GPA did it go up or did it go down were


---------39:39----------
used to playing video games probably


---------39:42----------
wouldn't probably stayed around there


---------39:43----------
went down so the fewer things that I


---------39:46----------
tried to do the the more I tried to like


---------39:49----------
make my life easy the worse I did so


---------39:52----------
then I go to India and I talked to a


---------39:54----------
buddy of mine who's an Ayurvedic


---------39:55----------
physician and I tell him I this is what


---------39:57----------
I've been struggling with what do you


---------39:58----------
think and he started laughing and I said


---------40:00----------
what's wrong he's like that's a terrible


---------40:02----------
idea for ovata


---------40:03----------
if you want to be successful as a Vata


---------40:06----------
you don't focus on one thing what you


---------40:08----------
need to do is juggle as many balls as


---------40:11----------
you can without dropping a single one


---------40:13----------
hmm you need to have when your mind gets


---------40:17----------
bored of something you need to have


---------40:19----------
something else for it to move to and


---------40:21----------
then when you get it bored of that you


---------40:23----------
need something else to move to and when


---------40:24----------
you to get bored of that you need to


---------40:26----------
have something else to get get bored and


---------40:27----------
by the time you get bored of the fourth


---------40:29----------
thing you can go back to the first one


---------40:30----------
and it's interesting again hmm so if you


---------40:34----------
want to if you're in school misc if


---------40:36----------
you're screwed


---------40:37----------
but if you're in school and you're


---------40:39----------
streaming and you're learning how to


---------40:41----------
cook you're gonna be capable of things


---------40:44----------
that other people are gonna think is


---------40:46----------
actually superhuman the water folks are


---------40:48----------
like how does he do it all because what


---------40:51----------
you need is because here's the cool


---------40:53----------
thing about your mind misc if you feel


---------40:54----------
dumb but when your attention is actually


---------40:57----------
focused like you probably feel brilliant


---------41:00----------
like you get that right that you're able


---------41:02----------
to pick up concepts way faster than the


---------41:05----------
average person


---------41:06----------
so all you need to do is instead of just


---------41:09----------
focusing on like one thing switch your


---------41:12----------
mind and let it focus on different


---------41:14----------
things and then you will actually be


---------41:15----------
able to move forward the problem is that


---------41:17----------
if you try to climb one mountain you're


---------41:19----------
gonna fail if you try to climb four


---------41:21----------
mountains you're gonna succeed so like


---------41:29----------
if Ida like just cuz I I swear I sound


---------41:34----------
like a two-year-old but I don't know why


---------41:35----------
I just writing makes things easier so


---------41:38----------
you're saying I get bored easily right


---------41:41----------
so and because I get bored easily I


---------41:43----------
should I having numerous thinks is a


---------41:45----------
good thing because it makes my brain


---------41:47----------
better so then like if I was to draw


---------41:50----------
what you're saying cuz I swear the


---------41:54----------
drawings helped me like Maya my


---------41:56----------
girlfriend she drew she read this book


---------41:59----------
about ADHD and she drew like the stuff


---------42:02----------
and I look at it every night and it's


---------42:04----------
it's to teach me how to focus and try to


---------42:08----------
be more present because that's a huge


---------42:10----------
putting I've been having a problem with


---------42:11----------
for years just trying to be present but


---------42:13----------
what you're saying so drawing just help


---------42:16----------
so what you're saying is like this where


---------42:18----------
it's like the first thing and then if


---------42:20----------
you don't like the you keep going and


---------42:22----------
juggling different things and then you


---------42:23----------
finally get to this one and when you


---------42:25----------
finally get bored with that by the time


---------42:27----------
your this one's so so the only thing


---------42:29----------
that's wrong with that is that big arrow


---------42:31----------
on the left side of the paper needs to


---------42:34----------
be down instead of up the arrow head is


---------42:37----------
in the wrong way so you go from thing


---------42:41----------
number this big one yeah so the arrow


---------42:43----------
head needs to be pointing down not up so


---------42:47----------
it goes back this yeah I was thinking


---------42:50----------
that it like it's never a no that's not


---------42:52----------
what you want if you if you go


---------42:54----------
never-ending you're gonna fail at all of


---------42:56----------
them right was that because you're never


---------42:59----------
gonna spend enough time on one okay so


---------43:03----------
what you need to do like you you know so


---------43:05----------
you can like what you want to do is come


---------43:07----------
back to square one and then work on that


---------43:09----------
and then when you get bored of square


---------43:12----------
one go back to task two and then move to


---------43:15----------
task three and then move to task four


---------43:16----------
and then in order for you to complete


---------43:18----------
any of those tasks you've got to go back


---------43:20----------
to


---------43:20----------
task 1 again and then work on that for a


---------43:22----------
while and then when you get bored of


---------43:23----------
that go back to 2 and you want to move


---------43:25----------
forward on all 4 of those things kind of


---------43:28----------
simultaneously but you need to create a


---------43:31----------
life where your dynamic mind instead of


---------43:34----------
forcing it to do something that it


---------43:35----------
doesn't want to do you sort of like


---------43:38----------
given an opportunity to like thrive in


---------43:40----------
the way that it normally functions so


---------43:44----------
what do you think I should do so I mean


---------43:46----------
I don't know practically how you spend


---------43:47----------
your days but like I think streaming is


---------43:49----------
good but I would think about like other


---------43:51----------
goals besides streaming that you work on


---------43:53----------
I have a affiliates probably - I move


---------43:58----------
for you but I have a game that I'm


---------44:00----------
working on as well good its yeah because


---------44:03----------
I've learned that I need to distract


---------44:05----------
myself from streaming because I think


---------44:08----------
about it all day that's all I think


---------44:09----------
about is streaming a my job and I'm


---------44:12----------
trying to think of other things like my


---------44:14----------
youtube channel that's a good one yeah


---------44:18----------
so I'm not quite that so I'm not quite


---------44:21----------
sure what your life is like in what


---------44:23----------
you're working on but like I would also


---------44:26----------
think about you know structuring your


---------44:28----------
girlfriend into that right so like like


---------44:32----------
make her a task in your mind that your


---------44:34----------
mind can focus on for periods of time so


---------44:37----------
if you spend five hours with her you're


---------44:39----------
gonna like lose attention but if you


---------44:41----------
spend like an hour with her like you can


---------44:43----------
probably do okay for an hour and then


---------44:44----------
you're gonna get bored and when you get


---------44:46----------
bored it doesn't mean that you don't


---------44:47----------
care about her or things like that and


---------44:48----------
you're gonna feel dumb you need some


---------44:50----------
some something to occupy your mind to


---------44:52----------
move it to so you essentially want to


---------44:54----------
rotate the focus of your mind because


---------44:58----------
it's naturally gonna want to move okay


---------45:02----------
so I think if if I'm with her I should I


---------45:08----------
should try or like it's it's really


---------45:12----------
anyone I mean you don't have to just


---------45:13----------
label just her like anybody cuz it's all


---------45:15----------
my friends - I should try to be in an


---------45:18----------
environment that doesn't have any


---------45:19----------
distractions and if I am the environment


---------45:23----------
with distractions I mean I don't have to


---------45:26----------
tell them like hey you know right now I


---------45:29----------
can't focus but try not to have more


---------45:31----------
serious conversations


---------45:33----------
at those places focus it more at places


---------45:35----------
like my house where yeah if we're just


---------45:37----------
in a room together okay so the cool


---------45:39----------
thing about that is if you start to do


---------45:42----------
that what do you think is gonna happen


---------45:43----------
to the quality of your conversations


---------45:45----------
you're gonna go up and how is that gonna


---------45:48----------
make you feel more attentive probably a


---------45:52----------
lot better what is better mean probably


---------45:54----------
more president sure more president how


---------45:55----------
is that gonna make you feel about


---------45:56----------
yourself smarter how does that feel it


---------46:03----------
feels great cuz I feel so so now misc if


---------46:06----------
we get to an interesting question if you


---------46:08----------
feel smarter do you think that has any


---------46:11----------
impact on your attention yes I would say


---------46:18----------
how well I think a lot of things that


---------46:22----------
come down to me is a lot of stuff when


---------46:26----------
it comes to me as confidence and I lack


---------46:28----------
a lot of confidence right now in my


---------46:30----------
attention and ability to be attentive


---------46:33----------
but I know what I'm more confident I'm


---------46:35----------
waste I'm better and I think that if


---------46:37----------
these things align they've like these


---------46:40----------
stars align and I start working more


---------46:42----------
towards better conversations with people


---------46:44----------
and focusing that I think I'll be more


---------46:49----------
confident and I'll be able to


---------46:52----------
yeah okay so we got to understand that


---------46:55----------
right so once again miss skip the cool


---------46:56----------
thing about this you actually have all


---------46:58----------
the answers I think what I would like to


---------47:00----------
help you do is understand the equations


---------47:03----------
behind your observations so how on earth


---------47:07----------
does confidence make you make your mind


---------47:12----------
less ATD like how does that work because


---------47:17----------
I think when when I have a th this is


---------47:19----------
gonna be made like a minute to figure it


---------47:22----------
out but I know the less confident I am


---------47:25----------
the more ADHD intensive I am because


---------47:29----------
this is gonna sound bizarre but when I'm


---------47:33----------
488 when I'm less confident and I feel


---------47:36----------
Dumber I


---------47:37----------
I look to ADHD more as like my way cuz I


---------47:40----------
try to just constantly think of instead


---------47:44----------
of like focusing on a conversation and


---------47:45----------
enjoying it I try to make jokes Alon and


---------47:49----------
I'll focus more on making jokes with my


---------47:51----------
ADHD which won't make it'll make my ADHD


---------47:53----------
do this times like five because now I'm


---------47:56----------
just if I'm in full ADHD I call it


---------47:58----------
[ __ ] mode so I'll go in the [ __ ]


---------48:00----------
mode and I'll start doing this times


---------48:01----------
like five and I'll just start trying to


---------48:03----------
make jokes constantly and get completely


---------48:05----------
derailed from conversation yes so so


---------48:07----------
let's understand this why do you start


---------48:09----------
making jokes when you feel when you


---------48:10----------
don't feel confident I don't know okay


---------48:15----------
I'm not gonna we're gonna nah not good


---------48:18----------
enough buddy I'm gonna dig so how do you


---------48:20----------
feel when you make a joke euphoric I


---------48:25----------
love it it's the it's one of my favorite


---------48:28----------
feelings ever is when I see people


---------48:29----------
thinking I'm funny okay enjoy so so


---------48:31----------
thank you so there's something within


---------48:33----------
you that says hey miss gif now it's time


---------48:36----------
to make a joke we need to make a joke


---------48:37----------
right and so what is what are you


---------48:40----------
looking for in the joke what am I


---------48:46----------
looking for I joking like something in


---------48:48----------
your mind wants that right a good


---------48:52----------
feeling yes okay since I'm approval yes


---------48:55----------
very good


---------48:56----------
now why do you need that sense of


---------48:58----------
approval


---------48:59----------
because I lack confidence in other areas


---------49:02----------
and I want people to I want to be people


---------49:06----------
to validate me


---------49:07----------
perfect right so look at how fast you're


---------49:10----------
answering this [ __ ] beautiful five


---------49:12----------
seconds ago you said what a video HD man


---------49:19----------
I don't remem you said I don't know Wow


---------49:22----------
right yeah I thought I don't yeah that


---------49:24----------
sounds that good I yeah and it turns out


---------49:27----------
that you do know so now the favela day


---------49:30----------
so what you're noticing is that you give


---------49:32----------
in to the ADHD process and you actually


---------49:35----------
support it you want it I'm right I'm


---------49:40----------
ready it yeah you you want that ADHD


---------49:42----------
process right because the ADHD process


---------49:44----------
makes you feel how you for it yeah it


---------49:49----------
makes me feel so so what you're doing in


---------49:51----------
that moment is actually like fertilizing


---------49:53----------
and growing the ADHD neurons in your


---------49:56----------
brain yeah I I definitely know that it


---------50:00----------
is so you're strengthening your ADHD to


---------50:03----------
protect you from what feeling from


---------50:07----------
feeling dumb yes I'm feeling very good


---------50:11----------
right so you feel dumb but if you can


---------50:12----------
make everyone laugh no one notices that


---------50:14----------
you're dumb and and you don't have to


---------50:16----------
pay attention to the conversation


---------50:16----------
because everyone's looking at your joke


---------50:18----------
and everything is fun and wonderful so


---------50:21----------
in a bizarre way if you become more


---------50:23----------
confident the fuel for your 80 the fuel


---------50:28----------
that you put into the ADHD gas tank


---------50:31----------
starts to go down you don't need that


---------50:34----------
part of you if you can feel confident in


---------50:36----------
yourself so do you think that with


---------50:40----------
streaming and with the lifestyle that I


---------50:42----------
live I've fueled that ADHD fire


---------50:45----------
massively because not I think I filled


---------50:47----------
it with multiple things I feel like I


---------50:49----------
fueled it with looking at socials all


---------50:51----------
the time Twitter's and stuff like that


---------50:53----------
and then I've also filled it a lot by


---------50:56----------
giving in to the ADHD process because my


---------50:59----------
stream is six hours a day and then if


---------51:02----------
I'm six hours trying to make jokes all


---------51:04----------
the time because it's my life I'm


---------51:06----------
feeling that ADHD fire because I'm


---------51:08----------
giving I don't I don't need I'm looking


---------51:11----------
for validation


---------51:13----------
through the 8-hd process so I'm feeling


---------51:15----------
that fire massively with streaming and


---------51:19----------
through also socials and three monitors


---------51:22----------
and everything else that's going on in


---------51:24----------
my life so that's making that fire


---------51:26----------
massive and then that's why I feel


---------51:28----------
Dumber today that I did like let's say a


---------51:31----------
few years ago I'm sorry was that a


---------51:32----------
question or was that a conclusion I


---------51:34----------
guess that was a conclusion also drawing


---------51:37----------
that absolutely right so this is Miss


---------51:39----------
gif what we call understanding yeah so


---------51:43----------
now you're kind of saying at the


---------51:44----------
beginning you said I feel like I'm


---------51:46----------
getting Dumber and my ADHD is getting


---------51:47----------
worse and if if I were to ask you how


---------51:52----------
does that work you need to go back and


---------51:54----------
watch the vote of what you just said


---------51:56----------
because that's how it works


---------52:00----------
mmm right because absolutely so you see


---------52:06----------
that like you're you're actually you


---------52:08----------
need the ADHD you rely on it you know


---------52:12----------
you're growing it or feeding it mmm but


---------52:19----------
I don't want to just feed it good


---------52:20----------
so you so this is where you got to meet


---------52:23----------
yourself where you are so right now it's


---------52:24----------
big it's gonna take time for it to grow


---------52:27----------
last week but the first thing that you


---------52:29----------
need to do is understand once again that


---------52:30----------
it comes with confidence so that there


---------52:32----------
are two solutions here one is to become


---------52:33----------
more confident and the second is to be


---------52:37----------
more tolerant of feeling stupid no III


---------52:42----------
I'm yeah I mean I I love feeling dumb


---------52:46----------
like I love when chat thinks I'm dumb or


---------52:50----------
they you know I love being an ad sup


---------52:54----------
yeah so I think that there are two kinds


---------52:57----------
of idiot here right this so now you have


---------52:59----------
to really tunnel and pay attention to


---------53:00----------
yourself because I think there's the


---------53:02----------
idiot that's funny and then there's the


---------53:05----------
feeling inside you that causes you to


---------53:08----------
joke that you try to get rid of by being


---------53:10----------
funny and being an idiot on stream those


---------53:12----------
are two different idiots yeah I would


---------53:15----------
agree that there's two different idiots


---------53:16----------
so one of them you're very comfortable


---------53:18----------
with because that's the mask that's the


---------53:20----------
ADHD idiot what you're not comfortable


---------53:22----------
with is the other one


---------53:24----------
yeah how do those feel different to you


---------53:27----------
I think when I'm trying to when I'm on


---------53:30----------
stream I don't feel as bad about feeling


---------53:32----------
dumb because they're thinking it's funny


---------53:35----------
and it's entertaining to them but then


---------53:37----------
when it's something the idiot the other


---------53:39----------
idiot is like like talking to my mom and


---------53:42----------
how I feel like when I talk to her


---------53:44----------
sometimes I I don't remember anything


---------53:46----------
and she's telling me Matt I told you


---------53:47----------
this five seconds ago like why don't you


---------53:48----------
remember or she's getting upset with me


---------53:51----------
that I didn't remember a text message or


---------53:53----------
any of those kind of things so there's


---------53:55----------
those the two different yep very


---------53:56----------
different very very different right so


---------53:59----------
it's good so once again English doesn't


---------54:01----------
have really a great way to differentiate


---------54:03----------
those but I mean I think you have this


---------54:06----------
sort of deep set kind of like idiot


---------54:10----------
complex that you try to run away from so


---------54:14----------
what we need to help you do so one is we


---------54:16----------
can help you be more confident by like


---------54:18----------
like and this is gonna be tricky because


---------54:20----------
you're gonna have to say things that are


---------54:22----------
gonna evoke that complex when you tell


---------54:25----------
your girlfriend hey I can't talk to you


---------54:26----------
about this right now because we're in a


---------54:27----------
grocery store you're gonna feel like an


---------54:29----------
idiot it's gonna bring that feeling up


---------54:32----------
so you got to be ready for it and then


---------54:35----------
you got to say what you're saying is


---------54:37----------
actually really important to me and I'm


---------54:40----------
sorry I'm trying to like I'm trying to


---------54:41----------
like learn how to concentrate better


---------54:43----------
well I don't want a lighter yeah but so


---------54:46----------
you just tell her like this is like so


---------54:49----------
if the funny thing is that she you know


---------54:52----------
oftentimes when people talk to other


---------54:54----------
people about their weaknesses and I tell


---------54:57----------
people how can I say this so if I'm like


---------55:04----------
working with a patient and I kind of


---------55:07----------
tell them hey like I'm gonna have to


---------55:09----------
cancel today I'm just not in the brain


---------55:12----------
space to where I think that I can really


---------55:14----------
like help you the way that you deserve


---------55:17----------
how do you think they feel


---------55:21----------
um if you did that to me I'd feel like


---------55:24----------
well I feel like you didn't care that's


---------55:27----------
just me okay I don't know I would have


---------55:31----------
it another person feel the yeah I didn't


---------55:34----------
care about you yeah but that's just me


---------55:38----------
yep I would say upset they wouldn't


---------55:41----------
think they'd be happy about it they'd be


---------55:42----------
like mmm lost maybe I can I can see why


---------55:47----------
you think that is it turns out it's


---------55:49----------
actually the opposite so in my UK III


---------55:53----------
know I know it's the obviously you can


---------55:54----------
you care a lot and you want to you want


---------55:56----------
to give as much attention as you


---------55:57----------
possibly can and you don't want look at


---------55:59----------
that fatha mind look at you saying one


---------56:01----------
thing and then being able to understand


---------56:03----------
the exact opposite when the span of a


---------56:04----------
second this is your strength but I don't


---------56:07----------
think that's that hard to understand


---------56:09----------
maybe I'm a dick do you think I feel


---------56:11----------
like anyone and can understand that no


---------56:13----------
yeah so this is something that we tend


---------56:15----------
to do right so most human beings and


---------56:17----------
this is true of everyone who is watching


---------56:20----------
at home we tend to devalue the things


---------56:23----------
that we're good at and over amplify the


---------56:27----------
things that were bad at yeah so you see


---------56:31----------
how you do that so that just reinforces


---------56:34----------
the lack of confidence because you're


---------56:37----------
not able to see that you're actually


---------56:38----------
exceptional in some ways all you see is


---------56:41----------
your fuck-ups yeah and we're taught that


---------56:46----------
from a very young age you know when


---------56:47----------
we're taught that 5 yeah right so when


---------56:52----------
we go to school and you get a 75 on a


---------56:55----------
test is that a good grade or a bad grade


---------56:58----------
my we I would be jumping for joy if I


---------57:01----------
got a 75 what about the average person


---------57:07----------
probably a little obscene yeah because


---------57:10----------
we always look at the 25 questions we


---------57:12----------
got wrong instead of the 75 questions we


---------57:15----------
got right yeah I do that a lot right I


---------57:18----------
think I think everyone those things


---------57:19----------
everybody is that like a human nature


---------57:21----------
too sure and it's reinforced by some of


---------57:23----------
our societal stuff so you have so the


---------57:25----------
cool thing so miss gif I think there's


---------57:27----------
hope for you and the reason I think


---------57:29----------
there's hope for you is because I think


---------57:31----------
you have learned and you have fueled and


---------57:34----------
cultivated some of these negative


---------57:37----------
patterns of viewing yourself in the way


---------57:39----------
that your mind works you know you've


---------57:42----------
done like bonsai sculpturing of your


---------57:44----------
mind and it like it grows in this weird


---------57:47----------
twisted way that's like based on a TD


---------57:49----------
you fuel the ATD because it protects you


---------57:51----------
from feeling stupid yeah so the cool


---------57:54----------
thing about that is that if you've grown


---------57:56----------
it and cultivated it one way you can


---------57:58----------
actually cultivate and grow it the other


---------58:00----------
way that'd be great you can do that


---------58:04----------
right and it starts and it's gonna be


---------58:06----------
difficult because what you have to do is


---------58:08----------
it starts with something as simple as a


---------58:09----------
conversation simple but hard with your


---------58:11----------
girlfriend that's gonna make you feel


---------58:12----------
dumb but bizarrely enough what she's


---------58:15----------
gonna hear is oh Miss gif is actually


---------58:18----------
trying to like do right by this


---------58:20----------
relationship


---------58:22----------
generally speaking you know if your


---------58:24----------
girlfriend tells you that she's having


---------58:25----------
difficulty with something and she wants


---------58:27----------
to do a really good job and can you give


---------58:30----------
her some time and space to do that how


---------58:33----------
does that make you feel if she says


---------58:35----------
something like that not okay with it


---------58:38----------
why don't you think she's dumb um


---------58:45----------
because


---------58:46----------
that's it I guess you're right yeah it


---------58:49----------
shows that she cares absolutely that


---------58:50----------
she's more what they're more willing to


---------58:52----------
care about like what's going on so it's


---------58:54----------
it's not bad it's a good thing because


---------58:57----------
they want to give you their full time


---------58:58----------
exactly right yeah and and so yeah so


---------59:05----------
miss gif what if I told you select do


---------59:07----------
you think what I do on stream is special


---------59:09----------
I would say of course yeah okay you're


---------59:15----------
very very unique yeah so how do you so


---------59:17----------
would it surprise you to learn that I


---------59:21----------
think that what I do on stream is


---------59:22----------
completely average in that anyone could


---------59:24----------
do it yeah I mean I'd say a lot of


---------59:30----------
redditors would probably say that they


---------59:32----------
could do your job but I think that they


---------59:33----------
can't yeah but I feel that way right cuz


---------59:36----------
I also overvalue my weaknesses and I


---------59:40----------
under value my strengths I think that's


---------59:43----------
a very common thing with streamers those


---------59:45----------
we we all do that I think I think chat


---------59:48----------
doesn't realize that but streamers in


---------59:50----------
general we all under value ourselves


---------59:52----------
massively and we all think of ourselves


---------59:54----------
less than what they think of us yep like


---------59:57----------
I really don't feel special and I don't


---------59:59----------
I know people think I have this massive


---------60:01----------
ego but I don't feel special at all


---------60:04----------
I feel very the opposite almost I in


---------60:07----------
some cases I wish I had more of an ego


---------60:10----------
so that way I could be more confident


---------60:12----------
yes so is that make sense yes but it


---------60:13----------
actually I think you probably do have


---------60:15----------
more of an ego because confidence and


---------60:18----------
ego or opposites they're not the same


---------60:19----------
thing so the more is that maybe an


---------60:21----------
English thing that I'm thinking it's


---------60:23----------
different yeah well I think English just


---------60:25----------
a lot of us don't understand how ego and


---------60:28----------
confidence works because we don't


---------60:29----------
explore it but generally speaking you


---------60:32----------
know the person who is more egoless so


---------60:34----------
think about someone who's egotistical


---------60:35----------
and think about someone who's confident


---------60:38----------
are those different people in your mind


---------60:43----------
I can't really think of an example


---------60:47----------
someone that's confident but I can think


---------60:50----------
a lot of people idiot istic oh yeah but


---------60:52----------
it's weird right cuz you say I can't


---------60:54----------
think of someone who's confident so your


---------60:55----------
mind is automatically saying that the


---------60:58----------
egotistical people are not confident


---------61:00----------
because you're looking for someone else


---------61:02----------
so actually ego is a cover for


---------61:05----------
insecurity it's the armor against


---------61:07----------
insecurity and confidence because in the


---------61:11----------
egotistical person their view of


---------61:14----------
themselves depends on themselves or


---------61:17----------
other people the other people what about


---------61:22----------
the confident person themselves


---------61:25----------
absolutely different right


---------61:26----------
beautiful so the confident person's


---------61:29----------
sense of self-worth comes from within


---------61:31----------
and the egotistical sense of self-worth


---------61:33----------
comes from without and if you are not


---------61:37----------
confident there is a high likelihood


---------61:39----------
that your egotistical because that's


---------61:42----------
just how our mind protects us from


---------61:45----------
insecurity it's a protective mechanisms


---------61:49----------
so I do have a huge ego possibly I don't


---------61:51----------
know so so I think you don't feel like


---------61:55----------
you have a huge ego because you don't


---------61:57----------
feel confidence in yourself right so


---------62:00----------
like the ego is what protects you when


---------62:02----------
you're feeling down so whether you have


---------62:06----------
a huge ego or not I can't really say I'm


---------62:08----------
not detecting much of an ego right now


---------62:11----------
yeah I mean like yeah I I feel like I


---------62:15----------
used to have way more of an ego and then


---------62:16----------
I don't have it as much anymore I did


---------62:19----------
like a year ago I had a huge yeah


---------62:21----------
nowadays not so much are you feeling


---------62:23----------
secure in yourself a year ago yeah


---------62:27----------
really


---------62:28----------
mm-hmm way more but I


---------62:32----------
I stopped feeling that way a lot more


---------62:35----------
last year as I grew as a streamer


---------62:38----------
because I I don't if you know this but I


---------62:42----------
like doubled my view count overnight


---------62:44----------
pretty much because I got banned or over


---------62:45----------
a week and in doing that I got a lot of


---------62:51----------
positive vibes and a lot of people that


---------62:53----------
were you know it was crazy but a lot a


---------62:57----------
lot of people also [ __ ] on me and then


---------62:59----------
people started getting hating on me and


---------63:01----------
getting sick of me and you know I


---------63:03----------
started getting hate which is something


---------63:04----------
I was never used to and hate like what


---------63:08----------
you just said before with we tend to


---------63:10----------
look at you know we've got a someone


---------63:15----------
will say something what were you saying


---------63:17----------
before is like we look at something and


---------63:21----------
it's like if the 75% right like we look


---------63:24----------
at the 25 that we got wrong that's


---------63:25----------
exactly how I is streamer and a lot of


---------63:27----------
other streamers look at the negative


---------63:29----------
comments that we get is we look at the


---------63:32----------
positive ones and we just glance right


---------63:34----------
through them but we'll see like one


---------63:35----------
negative comment and I'll sit with me


---------63:37----------
all night and it slowly has deteriorated


---------63:40----------
me I think it's a stream and absolutely


---------63:42----------
buddy that's just how we work man so you


---------63:45----------
have to you have to stop feeding those


---------63:49----------
neurons right so like you have to


---------63:51----------
acknowledge that oh this is my mind


---------63:55----------
because because what happens is the mind


---------63:57----------
looks for confirmation of what it


---------64:00----------
believes that's just how the mind works


---------64:03----------
so if you believe that you're doing a


---------64:06----------
bad job and you lack confidence in


---------64:07----------
yourself your mind is gonna go towards


---------64:10----------
the one or two things that support what


---------64:13----------
it already believes so I was once


---------64:16----------
working with a patient who was convinced


---------64:18----------
that their spouse was having an affair


---------64:20----------
and so they would do all kinds of weird


---------64:22----------
mental gymnastics that I like yeah they


---------64:24----------
came home late one night


---------64:27----------
and so that's evidence that they're


---------64:28----------
having an affair they said that they


---------64:30----------
were at work but I tried calling their


---------64:32----------
cell phone and it rang but they usually


---------64:35----------
don't get cell phone reception in their


---------64:37----------
building so I don't think they were at


---------64:38----------
work they must have been at a hotel and


---------64:42----------
once you believe something your mind is


---------64:45----------
going to look for any way to kind of


---------64:47----------
support that pre-existing belief right


---------64:50----------
yeah mm-hmm that's very true


---------64:54----------
look III will get some people will I've


---------65:00----------
gotten comments before people saying


---------65:01----------
like and this has definitely hurt my


---------65:04----------
confidence and I guess as made me create


---------65:07----------
an ego where it's I've gotten people


---------65:10----------
saying like oh man like like I miss old


---------65:15----------
miss kif where he was just an idiot and


---------65:18----------
was playing a game called marbles on it


---------65:22----------
is and like yeah I would just sit there


---------65:25----------
and play marbles all day and do that and


---------65:27----------
just listen to music and like oh I miss


---------65:29----------
that miss gif and I would ban them and I


---------65:36----------
would think on that a lock so I'm like


---------65:38----------
wow like have I really changed as much


---------65:39----------
it's like over the course of just a year


---------65:41----------
have I really as a streamer become this


---------65:44----------
like completely different beast where


---------65:46----------
nowadays my old viewers can't even


---------65:48----------
recognize Who I am they don't even


---------65:50----------
remember like they can't even watch me


---------65:52----------
because they don't they just missed who


---------65:53----------
I once was but then I uh I then I I they


---------65:58----------
messaged me and then I go in this huge


---------66:02----------
trance where I just started thinking


---------66:03----------
like oh my god they hate me bye old


---------66:05----------
viewers [ __ ] hate my guts they think


---------66:06----------
I'm a piece of [ __ ] like I don't know


---------66:08----------
what to do anymore like oh like all my


---------66:10----------
old you worst laughs but I'll message


---------66:12----------
them or they'll message me and they're


---------66:13----------
like yo dude I was just kidding it was a


---------66:15----------
joke I love your streams I have no


---------66:16----------
problem with who you are nowadays and I


---------66:17----------
like who you are and I'm happy for you


---------66:19----------
but yet you said we just go off in such


---------66:22----------
a trance and we look at one comma in


---------66:24----------
good school off the wall so absolutely


---------66:27----------
so I think it's a really common problem


---------66:28----------
I'm glad that you notice it and if it's


---------66:31----------
okay with you miss gif I want to go back


---------66:33----------
to a DD


---------66:35----------
yeah of course yeah so first of all how


---------66:37----------
long have we been talking


---------66:38----------
I would guess 42 minutes is that how


---------66:42----------
long we've been talking I don't know


---------66:43----------
okay I don't know


---------66:45----------
so how do you feel like your attention


---------66:47----------
has been over the course of this


---------66:48----------
conversation


---------66:48----------
I feel it's crazy like what I said I


---------66:52----------
mean like I've wrote your notes and like


---------66:55----------
I've been writing but writing and then


---------66:57----------
staring at the keyboard has helped me a


---------66:58----------
lot like my link and it helps me


---------67:01----------
understand like ego I think of it as


---------67:03----------
like just a circle and Hollow right and


---------67:06----------
then confidence I think of as you know


---------67:09----------
oh not a hollow circle yeah like a full


---------67:13----------
so yeah beautiful but but just like you


---------67:15----------
understand writing these things down


---------67:17----------
yeah I feel like I don't I don't I don't


---------67:19----------
feel like I'm like I feel like anyone


---------67:21----------
can get that yeah but I feel it's weird


---------67:27----------
when I when I do this stuff with you and


---------67:28----------
and and I I really listen and I've


---------67:31----------
noticed that when I listen to people


---------67:33----------
like let's say I'm talking to one of my


---------67:34----------
friends and I really am trying to pay


---------67:36----------
attention what they're saying the wheels


---------67:38----------
start turning and it makes my day better


---------67:40----------
because I feel like almost like these


---------67:42----------
cog wheels that have you know webs on


---------67:45----------
them that haven't been being used are


---------67:47----------
being turned and it now makes me more


---------67:49----------
focus throughout the entire day yes


---------67:51----------
beautiful right so this is why I've hope


---------67:54----------
for you because that too so you by the


---------67:56----------
way basic if you're beautiful with


---------67:57----------
imagery because like ego is a shell


---------68:00----------
that's what it is right and confidence


---------68:03----------
so what people say about ego versus


---------68:05----------
confidence is that ego is iron on the


---------68:08----------
outside and water on the inside and


---------68:11----------
confidence is water on the outside and


---------68:14----------
iron on the inside so right so like


---------68:18----------
really hard exterior with like jelly in


---------68:21----------
the middle whereas confidence like you


---------68:24----------
let stuff slide over you you don't


---------68:27----------
resist it but on the inside nothing can


---------68:29----------
touch you yeah so that's sort of a


---------68:33----------
Chinese approach to ego and confidence


---------68:35----------
but how do I get more confidence but so


---------68:38----------
I think you're already discovering right


---------68:40----------
so you actually have the answer right


---------68:41----------
there so first of all that attention and


---------68:44----------
concentration


---------68:46----------
is a skill that can be trained so when


---------68:49----------
you say I have cog wheels that are like


---------68:51----------
covered in webs and aren't moving


---------68:52----------
properly absolutely so when you train


---------68:55----------
your attention you can actually start


---------68:58----------
the flow of that machine in a positive


---------69:00----------
way and all it takes is practice because


---------69:03----------
in the same way that sometimes you feed


---------69:04----------
the ADHD a conversation like this a


---------69:07----------
conversation with your girlfriend where


---------69:08----------
you are attentive actually levels up


---------69:11----------
your concentration skill so this is a


---------69:13----------
big is it weird that I I don't know I


---------69:15----------
feel like right here is that normal like


---------69:18----------
you feel yeah that's it that's your


---------69:21----------
third eye maybe so as you are understand


---------69:24----------
things I wouldn't be surprised if you


---------69:26----------
feel things here because this is where


---------69:29----------
understanding comes from not information


---------69:31----------
but understanding that's a conversation


---------69:33----------
for a separate day but I'm not surprised


---------69:35----------
at all so I want to just get to a couple


---------69:38----------
of other points what actually I want to


---------69:39----------
mention to you the first is that your


---------69:42----------
concentration will continue to improve


---------69:44----------
until you're about 32 so the brain


---------69:48----------
though I'm not alone no you're not so


---------69:50----------
your frontal lobes which are responsible


---------69:52----------
for things like impulse control the


---------69:55----------
focus of your attention and executing


---------69:58----------
long complicated tasks that's the


---------70:02----------
difference between a five year old a


---------70:03----------
fifteen year old a 25 year old and a 35


---------70:05----------
year old its frontal lobe development


---------70:08----------
delaying gratification controlling your


---------70:11----------
impulses that's what we call quote


---------70:13----------
unquote maturity right so five year old


---------70:16----------
mind is all over the place fifteen year


---------70:18----------
old can concentrate on boobs and every


---------70:20----------
once in a while they can focus on their


---------70:21----------
physics test a twenty five year old can


---------70:24----------
go to work most days and be like kind of


---------70:26----------
stable but still like on the weekends


---------70:28----------
like doesn't have quite their [ __ ]


---------70:29----------
together now thirty five-year-old does


---------70:31----------
things like pay taxes and contribute to


---------70:33----------
their IRA and 401k that's maturity that


---------70:37----------
frontal lobe development ends around 32


---------70:39----------
but it's my hypothesis is that that is


---------70:41----------
changing in our society and that our


---------70:43----------
frontal lobes actually have a delayed


---------70:44----------
maturity because of the influences like


---------70:47----------
Twitter and things like that


---------70:49----------
so you're gonna get better at this just


---------70:53----------
naturally like your brain is literally


---------70:55----------
gonna develop okay okay second thing is


---------70:58----------
that if you reduce your Vata so control


---------71:02----------
the influences that make your mind more


---------71:05----------
wind like you will get better at this so


---------71:10----------
to spend time every day writing or


---------71:14----------
concentrating on keyboards or like


---------71:16----------
learning to do art or creating music or


---------71:18----------
something like that something that


---------71:20----------
engages your attention so we don't want


---------71:23----------
you to like read textbooks on


---------71:24----------
biochemistry we want you to do something


---------71:26----------
that engages your attention more


---------71:28----------
naturally over an extended period of


---------71:31----------
time so we've been talking for about an


---------71:33----------
hour and 20 minutes and it feels to you


---------71:36----------
like 45 minutes hmm


---------71:39----------
but your mind has actually been way more


---------71:41----------
focused than I think like you give it


---------71:43----------
credit for you have not defaulted to


---------71:45----------
making jokes and things like that your


---------71:48----------
ADHD has been more restrained and so


---------71:50----------
this is a skill that you can learn next


---------71:54----------
thing is how are your bowel movements


---------71:57----------
really yes they feel like in general you


---------72:03----------
have like more than one a day you have a


---------72:04----------
lot of bowel movements or what's going


---------72:06----------
on tell me about them constipated mmm I


---------72:10----------
was when I was younger I stopped to take


---------72:12----------
one of those things and you're a


---------72:14----------
suppository yeah because I couldn't


---------72:18----------
I never yeah [ __ ] I think like at least


---------72:24----------
once a day okay and you go at the same


---------72:27----------
time every day no if they don't think so


---------72:31----------
now okay and are they like or they like


---------72:34----------
stinky or they like kind of like one log


---------72:37----------
look what is it like


---------72:39----------
I would say it's not one log it's like


---------72:45----------
way it's like five pieces long okay so


---------72:49----------
are there are times that so what like


---------72:52----------
are there are there certain things that


---------72:53----------
you can eat that make it one log I know


---------72:57----------
it's a weird question have you I have no


---------72:59----------
okay so there's a there's a growing so


---------73:02----------
in Ayurveda the way to reduce vada is


---------73:05----------
through the bowels so you have to fix


---------73:08----------
constipation and reduce gas production


---------73:10----------
so the crazy thing is that like i


---------73:12----------
Rather's been saying that for thousands


---------73:14----------
of years but now they're actually


---------73:15----------
Studies on the brain got axis which show


---------73:19----------
that everything from autism to


---------73:24----------
depression and anxiety can be changed by


---------73:27----------
changing your gut bacteria they did a


---------73:29----------
wild study where they did stool


---------73:31----------
transplants from depressed mice


---------73:34----------
so they took mice that are depressed so


---------73:36----------
they can measure mice depression by like


---------73:38----------
how much they play in their cage and how


---------73:39----------
curious they are and things like that


---------73:40----------
they also have like a terrible test that


---------73:43----------
they do to my switches they drop them in


---------73:45----------
water and they see like how long the


---------73:47----------
mice mouse fights before it gives up and


---------73:49----------
like like lets itself drown and more


---------73:52----------
depressed mice will give up more easily


---------73:54----------
and less depressed mice will fight for


---------73:56----------
life okay they don't actually let them


---------73:59----------
drown but they pull about when they give


---------74:01----------
up so the interesting thing is they took


---------74:03----------
a group of not depressed mice and they


---------74:05----------
took a group of depressed mice they


---------74:07----------
extracted stool not extracted but they


---------74:09----------
took the stool of a depressed Mouse


---------74:11----------
transplanted it into a non depressed


---------74:14----------
mouse and the mouse became depressed


---------74:18----------
so there are some kinds of gut bacteria


---------74:20----------
that are higher in people with anxiety


---------74:22----------
disorders and some kinds of gut bacteria


---------74:25----------
that are lower in people with anxiety


---------74:27----------
disorders least scientifically valid


---------74:31----------
evidence I work with some people at this


---------74:33----------
place called the Lurie Center which is


---------74:34----------
like a center for autism at Mass General


---------74:36----------
Hospital in Harvard Medical School they


---------74:39----------
do a lot of stuff on behavioral


---------74:40----------
disturbance for people with autism so


---------74:42----------
sometimes people with autism get really


---------74:44----------
behaviorally dysregulated and they get


---------74:46----------
angry and they'll do head-banging and


---------74:48----------
things stuff like that that altering


---------74:49----------
their diet and giving them other kinds


---------74:51----------
of like iron and things like that and


---------74:53----------
smoothing out their bowels actually


---------74:54----------
reduces behavioral disregulation and


---------74:58----------
people with autism unpublished data all


---------74:59----------
clinical so it's like anecdotal but like


---------75:02----------
when people come from all around the


---------75:04----------
world to come to the Lurie Center when


---------75:05----------
their kids have autism and like this is


---------75:07----------
what some of the clinicians there do so


---------75:09----------
your bowel movements need to be smoother


---------75:12----------
so you need to think about what foods


---------75:13----------
will contribute to like big logs okay


---------75:18----------
I think you're 80 do you know what foods


---------75:20----------
would yes so high fiber foods cooked


---------75:23----------
foods you want cooked vegetables things


---------75:25----------
like sweet potatoes are ideal root


---------75:27----------
vegetables are good for you the other


---------75:29----------
thing that you can do is you can order


---------75:30----------
fenugreek seeds take about a teaspoon of


---------75:33----------
fenugreek seeds put them in water


---------75:36----------
like three to four ounces of water at


---------75:39----------
night and in the morning drink them on


---------75:40----------
an empty stomach


---------75:42----------
will reduce your Vata okay make sure you


---------75:47----------
talk to your doctor about all this stuff


---------75:48----------
before you start it but should be safe


---------75:51----------
the last thing so to think about bata


---------75:54----------
there's some dietary things that you can


---------75:56----------
do you can focus it and attend to your


---------75:58----------
concentration and I'm gonna have to run


---------76:01----------
in a minute so I'll give you a chance


---------76:02----------
for questions let me just see okay I've


---------76:04----------
got six minutes so your frontal lobe is


---------76:09----------
going to develop right so you can do


---------76:13----------
improve your constipation let me just


---------76:21----------
think for a second it'll warm two things


---------76:23----------
that yeah and the last thing is kind of


---------76:25----------
coming back to this confidence point so


---------76:26----------
I want you to understand that the state


---------76:28----------
of your mind emotionally is going to


---------76:31----------
make you more vulnerable to the ATD


---------76:33----------
thinking or less vulnerable to the ATB


---------76:35----------
thinking what do you mean by that so


---------76:38----------
when you feel less confident


---------76:39----------
remember when you feel bad about


---------76:40----------
yourself you the a D D is gonna activate


---------76:43----------
to be a joker and make you feel less bad


---------76:45----------
so working on your confidence is gonna


---------76:48----------
be important but working on your


---------76:50----------
confidence is gonna be tough because you


---------76:52----------
have to admit the feelings of stupidity


---------76:55----------
right you have to acknowledge those and


---------76:57----------
face those you're gonna feel a little


---------76:59----------
bit dumb when you tell your girlfriend


---------77:00----------
hey I can't talk to you in a grocery


---------77:02----------
store because my mind is weak that's not


---------77:05----------
really what it is but you're gonna have


---------77:06----------
that feeling you got to just acknowledge


---------77:08----------
that feeling and then sort of try to


---------77:10----------
tell her that you know you I really care


---------77:12----------
about your relationship and I'm trying


---------77:13----------
to work on this and I want to practice


---------77:16----------
listening to you the cool thing is that


---------77:19----------
as you level this skill up your ability


---------77:22----------
to talk to her in a grocery store is


---------77:24----------
gonna get better


---------77:25----------
yeah you just got a level up mm-hmm


---------77:30----------
no that's it's I have a lot of good


---------77:32----------
stuff yeah last thing is you gotta


---------77:35----------
meditate buddy so meditation is


---------77:38----------
literally like doing push-ups for this


---------77:40----------
part of your brain there's a stream that


---------77:44----------
I did that hopefully is on YouTube about


---------77:45----------
da da da da daaaa is the Sun script word


---------77:48----------
for concentration but concentration and


---------77:51----------
one pointedness of the mind is a skill


---------77:53----------
that you can develop some people are


---------77:55----------
naturally


---------77:56----------
or at it some people have more


---------77:57----------
difficulty with it but it's like


---------77:59----------
literally something you can get better


---------78:00----------
at okay yeah I I've been told that


---------78:05----------
meditating is going to the gym something


---------78:08----------
good yes but it's not going to help I


---------78:11----------
mean so you should go to the gym for


---------78:12----------
other reasons there are all other things


---------78:14----------
that we haven't gotten to about the way


---------78:15----------
that your mind works and how a TV works


---------78:18----------
and stuff like that so the other thing


---------78:20----------
anyway so we can maybe have a follow-up


---------78:22----------
but there are other points on my talking


---------78:24----------
list that I just haven't gotten around


---------78:25----------
to but no I would love to you questions


---------78:28----------
thoughts from the chatter from me anyone


---------78:34----------
everyone oh I think I I got it I really


---------78:39----------
got a lot like I'm actually ridiculously


---------78:41----------
happy I cuz I go I went in here I didn't


---------78:43----------
know if you were gonna be able to help


---------78:44----------
me at all but I what I've learned a lot


---------78:48----------
that I wrote it down because it helps me


---------78:51----------
is that I I try to validate like I give


---------79:02----------
in to my ADHD process all the time


---------79:04----------
because if Bala dates me and makes me


---------79:06----------
feel better but by giving into the ADHD


---------79:08----------
process it makes this go haywire which


---------79:12----------
is making my it's fueling my fire of


---------79:15----------
ADHD it's making my you know what does


---------79:18----------
it call and I'm like the gust of wind


---------79:20----------
Vata about the it makes me go for it


---------79:24----------
makes that timez5 into like a crazy


---------79:26----------
storm because I'm feeling that fire


---------79:28----------
massively I'm making it worse


---------79:30----------
and I shouldn't do that I to learn


---------79:33----------
slowly to focus over time to have good


---------79:36----------
conversations to understand people and I


---------79:39----------
need to also understand that there's an


---------79:43----------
idiot that's funny and then there's the


---------79:44----------
idiot that doesn't remember things and


---------79:46----------
the idiot that's funny is fine but I


---------79:49----------
need to learn to talk to people to


---------79:51----------
understand people to grow less of an ego


---------79:56----------
and have more confidence in myself so


---------79:59----------
that way because confidence is less ADHD


---------80:01----------
intensive and an ego is just me


---------80:04----------
increasing this because just feeling my


---------80:05----------
fire so can we get a [ __ ] round


---------80:09----------
applause cuz you just tied it just think


---------80:13----------
about all of the different directions


---------80:17----------
you just wove together in like 90


---------80:21----------
seconds confidence what you're fueling


---------80:25----------
yeah so many different things why you do


---------80:29----------
it


---------80:30----------
you just beautiful man


---------80:32----------
beautiful watch that like you guys get


---------80:35----------
that like that wasn't that like that is


---------80:38----------
a better summary than I could put


---------80:40----------
together


---------80:41----------
sounds like someone was [ __ ] paying


---------80:43----------
attention yeah good job I know I could


---------80:53----------
do it I don't know I just have a lot


---------80:54----------
like I said I have low confidence that I


---------80:56----------
can pay attention anymore but I good I


---------80:58----------
think from this I learned that I can I


---------81:00----------
just there's different I know I can I


---------81:03----------
think again I know I can it's just I


---------81:05----------
need to there's different states and


---------81:07----------
there's different ways to focus like


---------81:08----------
staring at one thing does help try to


---------81:11----------
have it less distractions as possible


---------81:14----------
I think meditating I'm gonna try to read


---------81:16----------
so it's I want to give you a particular


---------81:19----------
practice on meditation so I got a my


---------81:22----------
parking meters about to run out and I'm


---------81:24----------
in Boston where they like give us


---------81:25----------
tickets and I've got 37 seconds so I


---------81:27----------
want to teach you this though okay so I


---------81:30----------
want to just leave you with this so sit


---------81:31----------
up straight close your eyes tell me what


---------81:36----------
you felt in your forehead it felt tingly


---------81:41----------
okay I want you to put but your middle


---------81:46----------
finger like a millimeter away from where


---------81:50----------
it felt tingly


---------81:54----------
touch good just and keep it there right


---------82:04----------
so middle finger right here good yep


---------82:09----------
just focus on the sensation do you feel


---------82:13----------
tingling or warmth hmm just focus on


---------82:16----------
that now let your arm come down relax


---------82:23----------
keep your eyes closed and just continue


---------82:26----------
to focus on that spot


---------82:34----------
focus on the tingly sensation thoughts


---------82:38----------
may come so be it


---------82:44----------
your mind may wander but just return to


---------82:46----------
that tingly sensation and now I want you


---------82:53----------
to drive your attention into it I want


---------82:58----------
you to imagine your attention like going


---------83:03----------
into a funnel and it kind of starts like


---------83:06----------
in your head and then it focuses down


---------83:08----------
and like comes to a point and then


---------83:11----------
please pushing out of your forehead and


---------83:17----------
that's that tingly nassif eel that's the


---------83:20----------
that's your attention kind of flowing


---------83:21----------
into that does that make sense no but I


---------83:25----------
feel the tingling


---------83:26----------
okay so then just focus on the tingle


---------83:28----------
yes


---------83:37----------
good now open your eyes how was that oh


---------83:44----------
cool I mean I brain was going crazy


---------83:47----------
closing my eyes like it was I was


---------83:50----------
thinking of chicken nuggets eating with


---------83:52----------
McDowell tell you it's just like Mario


---------83:54----------
Kart Yoshi chicken nuggets winter okay I


---------83:57----------
like it was just so sorry Adam so now


---------83:59----------
what we need to do is I want you to


---------84:01----------
practice a half leaded gaze okay


---------84:03----------
so I'll teach you one more thing so you


---------84:04----------
shouldn't do meditation with your eyes


---------84:06----------
closed


---------84:06----------
so the half-witted gaze is kind of just


---------84:09----------
like just as kind of zone out and stare


---------84:11----------
it so turn there's a picture somewhere


---------84:14----------
look so look look at one of your


---------84:16----------
pictures okay so sit up straight


---------84:20----------
half flitted gaze focus on the tingling


---------84:36----------
is your mind has less thought or about


---------84:40----------
the same Oh way less good so you need to


---------84:43----------
do half I open meditation half flitted


---------84:45----------
gaze very good you can come back is that


---------84:51----------
because I'm focusing on one object like


---------84:53----------
ideal Mikey so you need pattern ideally


---------84:56----------
I could teach you through attica but so


---------84:59----------
we're gonna have to think about that but


---------85:00----------
I want you to focus on that tingling


---------85:01----------
sensation and gaze at something look


---------85:05----------
okay thoughts or questions we wrap it


---------85:07----------
wrap up how long do I do that for how


---------85:10----------
long do you think like as long as I can


---------85:14----------
15 minutes 15 minutes is gonna be a lot


---------85:16----------
I'd start with 3 to 5 but 3 to 5 minutes


---------85:20----------
yeah don't beat yourself up and get do I


---------85:23----------
do it like once a day what do you think


---------85:25----------
whenever I want what do you think about


---------85:28----------
that I think it's good to meditate


---------85:33----------
whenever you could possibly can so I


---------85:35----------
could do this kind of on the road done


---------85:36----------
right if I could just stare at something


---------85:37----------
and then just focus on that middle yeah


---------85:40----------
so be careful if you're driving so so I


---------85:43----------
think that so you have to balance your


---------85:45----------
Vata which is that you want to do it at


---------85:47----------
random times versus recognize that if


---------85:50----------
you do it at random times you're also


---------85:51----------
feeding Vata okay so I should I should


---------85:55----------
do it in an area where it's calm calm


---------85:59----------
and also you should try to build


---------86:01----------
consistency but it's better that you do


---------86:04----------
it everyday as opposed to like not doing


---------86:07----------
it you know like like I would try to


---------86:09----------
build some consistency in your practice


---------86:11----------
so if you have any anger in your day


---------86:13----------
like if you you know wake up in the


---------86:15----------
morning and then like if you go for a


---------86:16----------
walk or like it when you like take a


---------86:18----------
piss or something like that


---------86:19----------
you know spent your you're in Austin so


---------86:21----------
go outside and especially at dawn or


---------86:24----------
dusk would be ideal like you pick an


---------86:26----------
object that's outside like a tree you do


---------86:28----------
half flitted gaze towards the tree


---------86:31----------
okay I could do that okay any last


---------86:35----------
thoughts or questions before you wrap up


---------86:36----------
for the day if chat has anything I'm


---------86:42----------
happy with it I learned a lot I feel


---------86:45----------

---------88:37----------
we can all get better like it's good


---------88:38----------
it's doable we just have to understand


---------88:40----------
like the problem here is that we're


---------88:42----------
playing a game without a tutorial like


---------88:44----------
that we play the game of life and no one


---------88:45----------
teaches us like no one has explained to


---------88:47----------
miss gif how his mind works right like


---------88:50----------
he's like it's like imagine if you're


---------88:53----------
playing a game and you have you know


---------88:54----------
like a keyboard in a language that you


---------88:56----------
don't understand and so you have to


---------89:01----------
understand how you work because he's not


---------89:03----------
dumb he's actually brilliant you guys


---------89:05----------
see that like how like we talked about a


---------89:08----------
lot of stuff you fast he moved really


---------89:11----------
fast that's what he's good at he just


---------89:14----------
needs to create a situation where his


---------89:15----------
mind can thrive like that and and like


---------89:20----------
like yeah his summary was like I


---------89:22----------
couldn't do that guys I could not do


---------89:24----------
that and he just learned it for the


---------89:26----------
first time and look at how he summarizes


---------89:28----------

---------89:31----------
you guys very much hopefully this was


---------89:33----------
helpful for you all too if you guys feel


---------89:35----------
like you're a you have a TD or that


---------89:37----------
you're dumb or things like that probably


---------89:39----------
not the case right so like I know that


---------89:41----------
you feel that way but a lot of the stuff


---------89:43----------
that that we talked about with him


---------89:44----------
should apply to you too because gaming


---------89:46----------
Twitter you know YouTube all of these


---------89:48----------
things at which all of these things are


---------89:51----------
gonna enhance the vittatus of your mind


---------89:53----------

---------89:57----------
particular thing okay so thank you guys
