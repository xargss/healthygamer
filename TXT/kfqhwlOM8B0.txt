---------00:00----------
and I'll give you guys just one example


---------00:01----------
so one of the basic things that you can


---------00:03----------
do is become a reflective listener


---------00:04----------
instead of a problem solver or reassure


---------00:07----------
so did you guys notice that Jessica was


---------00:11----------
talking about a lot about problems right


---------00:12----------
she was talking about the problems that


---------00:13----------
I'm that she was facing and you guys


---------00:16----------
know what I never told her it's gonna be


---------00:18----------
okay I never told her you're gonna be


---------00:21----------
fine I never told her I think you're


---------00:22----------
gonna be fine I think everything's gonna


---------00:24----------
end up okay I never told her you know I


---------00:27----------
I believe in you I never said any about


---------00:29----------
which is weird because usually when


---------00:31----------
people come to us with problems our


---------00:33----------
thought is to reassure them like if


---------00:35----------
someone gets dumped by their girlfriend


---------00:37----------
our instinctive answer is hey man there


---------00:39----------
are other fish in the sea you'll find


---------00:41----------
someone else it'll all be okay you'll


---------00:43----------
find love again


---------00:44----------
you know that's actually the wrong thing


---------00:47----------
to say the right thing to say is man I'm


---------00:50----------
sorry that sucks for you you must be


---------00:52----------
feeling like right now is there


---------00:55----------
anything I can do to help so instead of


---------00:58----------
telling them that everything's gonna be


---------00:59----------
okay which is reassurance instead of


---------01:01----------
providing reassurance provide reflect


---------01:06----------
back what they say and be supportive so


---------01:08----------
if they say oh yeah you know she dumped


---------01:10----------
me and like I'm afraid that like I'm not


---------01:13----------
like no one else like I'm never gonna be


---------01:14----------
able to find a girlfriend again what you


---------01:16----------
should say to them if you want to be


---------01:18----------
like a better listener and support them


---------01:20----------
more is it sounds like you're afraid


---------01:22----------
that you're you're not gonna be able to


---------01:24----------
find someone to love you again and just


---------01:26----------
period pause and be silent after that


---------01:29----------
and then they're gonna respond with


---------01:30----------
something else and be like yeah man it


---------01:32----------
sounds like you're going through really


---------01:33----------
over rough time it sounds like you


---------01:34----------
really are not confident in yourself


---------01:36----------
period you don't tell that everything's


---------01:39----------
gonna be okay because that's not the way


---------01:40----------
they feel it's actually incredibly


---------01:42----------
invalidating it's kind of telling them


---------01:43----------
hey you're stupid what your your


---------01:46----------
feelings are wrong you are gonna find


---------01:48----------
someone you're an idiot how could you


---------01:49----------
not find someone like you're such an


---------01:51----------
amazing person the subtext is you're an


---------01:53----------
idiot and it's incredibly invalidating


---------01:54----------
so I think the first thing that you can


---------01:56----------
do is instead of providing reassurance


---------01:58----------
provide validation did you guys go back


---------02:00----------
and you watch the interview like a lot


---------02:02----------
of what I did was actually reflecting


---------02:03----------
back what she said like really like look


---------02:05----------
at what I said I didn't tell her


---------02:06----------
anything was going to be okay I just


---------02:07----------
sort of repeated back to her what she


---------02:09----------
was saying and that's what helps people


---------02:11----------
come out of it that's what helps the


---------02:13----------
emotions come out


---------02:13----------
then she feels supportive at the end of


---------02:16----------
it even though we were talking about


---------02:17----------
everything how everything is bad like we


---------02:19----------
didn't talk about there was no like


---------02:20----------
sunshine and rainbows in that


---------02:22----------
conversation it was bad man but how


---------02:25----------
does that help her at the end like I


---------02:26----------
don't know but it does so that's


---------02:28----------
something you can do


---------02:30----------
so Siller G sorry Sylar gray asks how


---------02:34----------
does compassion fatigue affect you it


---------02:36----------
doesn't to be honest so I think what


---------02:38----------
fatigues me is being inauthentic like


---------02:41----------
what's tiring is putting on a


---------02:43----------
act so what I love about what I do is it


---------02:46----------
doesn't if at eat like I mean sure I'm


---------02:49----------
tired at the end of it because it's like


---------02:50----------
you're kind of emotionally active but it


---------02:52----------
sort of feels like working out like at


---------02:54----------
the end of a workout you kind of feel


---------02:55----------
physically exhausted but like


---------02:57----------
spiritually powerful and that's so


---------03:00----------
compassion fatigue doesn't affect me


---------03:02----------
because sure there's like emotions and


---------03:04----------
that can be tiring but I find it like


---------03:07----------
spiritually gratifying to like help


---------03:08----------
another human being and it inspires me


---------03:10----------
and it gives me energy that's how I can


---------03:12----------
do it for like 10 hours a day what's


---------03:15----------
hard to do 10 hours a day is live a life


---------03:18----------
that is like not worth living to live a


---------03:20----------
life of like falseness and to put on a


---------03:22----------
mask like that's fatiguing


---------03:25----------
what's wonderful and this is the big


---------03:27----------
problem with gamers is that they


---------03:29----------
actually don't live a life that


---------03:30----------
spiritually fulfilling and so they feel


---------03:32----------
like they have low energy they don't get


---------03:33----------
that energy doesn't come from from like


---------03:36----------
expending energy energy come sorry


---------03:39----------
energy comes from like living a life of


---------03:42----------
purpose that's what gives you strength


---------03:44----------
doing something that matters like when


---------03:48----------
you're and you think about this I think


---------03:49----------
about the times in your life where


---------03:51----------
you've gone the extra mile and those are


---------03:53----------
times in your life when like someone


---------03:55----------
needed you right that's when you


---------03:57----------
actually like you're able to to


---------03:59----------
double-down like when your friend is


---------04:00----------
going through a breakup that's when you


---------04:02----------
can stay up till 4:00 in the morning and


---------04:03----------
like support them in the next day go to


---------04:05----------
class and still do a decent job when you


---------04:08----------
live a life that is like worth living


---------04:10----------
and you when you live a life that's


---------04:11----------
aligned with what you care about and


---------04:13----------
what you believe the world needs that's


---------04:15----------
actually invigorating it gives you a ton


---------04:17----------
of energy and if we think about what a


---------04:19----------
gamer's deal with like they deal with


---------04:20----------
like a lack of energy like they have


---------04:21----------
trouble getting out of bed they have


---------04:23----------
trouble getting out of the house like


---------04:24----------
why is that that's because they're not


---------04:26----------
tapping into energy they're not tapping


---------04:28----------
into an energy of like doing something


---------04:31----------
that has purpose and meaning and so


---------04:33----------
compassion fatigue sure it sort of


---------04:35----------
affects me a little bit but most of the


---------04:37----------
time when I go home I feel tired at the


---------04:39----------
end of a day of work but I feel


---------04:40----------
fulfilled and then that fulfillment like


---------04:43----------
carries over to my kids and though even


---------04:44----------
though I'm like physically exhausted


---------04:46----------
you know I'm still gonna like attend to


---------04:48----------
them in a way that that it's I mean it's


---------04:50----------
cool it's it feels good
