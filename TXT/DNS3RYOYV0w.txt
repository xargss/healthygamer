---------00:40----------
you usually do


---------00:41----------
um i mostly play fps games i was really


---------00:44----------
big into rainbow six siege for a long


---------00:46----------

---------00:48----------

---------01:01----------
most of the time i'm playing fps games


---------01:03----------
what do you like about fps games


---------01:05----------
um i


---------01:07----------
grew up on fps games i started i think


---------01:10----------
one of my very first video games was


---------01:12----------
goldeneye when i was a kid


---------01:14----------
and 64.


---------01:15----------
yeah


---------01:16----------
yeah and i've just always i mean i was


---------01:18----------
really big into halo


---------01:20----------
um


---------01:21----------
yeah i've always i've just always played


---------01:23----------
fbs games


---------01:24----------
cool yeah i've always sucked at fps


---------01:27----------
games including it started with golden


---------01:29----------
eye


---------01:30----------
and has continued through quake and


---------01:32----------
unreal tournament and at that point i


---------01:34----------
just kind of gave up back around 2004.


---------01:37----------
so yeah i had a lot of fun playing that


---------01:40----------
in high school like halo and halo 2.


---------01:43----------
yeah yeah cool


---------01:45----------
um so thanks for coming on today uh is


---------01:47----------
there something in particular you wanted


---------01:49----------
to talk about


---------01:50----------
or anything that we could potentially


---------01:52----------
help you with yeah we talked about um i


---------01:55----------
talked about this a lot on stream


---------01:56----------
actually about how i feel like streaming


---------01:59----------
over the course of time that i've been


---------02:00----------
doing it um has had a lot of impact on


---------02:05----------
the way that i socialize and i was


---------02:11----------
even with streaming i feel like i i've


---------02:13----------
i've always struggled to


---------02:15----------
make friends with people that i


---------02:17----------
i feel like i've struggled to make deep


---------02:18----------
friendships with people


---------02:20----------
um it's easy to kind of have these like


---------02:23----------
surface level friendships with people


---------02:24----------
that you


---------02:25----------
um are in band with or you know whatever


---------02:28----------
in school


---------02:29----------
um but i think streaming has kind of


---------02:31----------
exacerbated that and made it very


---------02:34----------
difficult because it's almost like


---------02:35----------
there's


---------02:37----------
this underlying um


---------02:40----------
it's almost like transactional sometimes


---------02:42----------
and you worry about


---------02:45----------
you don't want the other person to think


---------02:46----------
that you're trying to like leach off of


---------02:48----------
them you don't want to feel like they're


---------02:50----------
leeching off of you


---------02:51----------
um i've had experiences before where i


---------02:53----------
started trying to befriend someone and


---------02:56----------
then found out that they just wanted to


---------02:58----------
uh get on my stream


---------03:00----------
and so stuff like that really kind of


---------03:01----------
like bites you you know um and so now i


---------03:04----------
feel like i just can't i feel like i


---------03:06----------
really struggle to


---------03:08----------
make friends with people because you


---------03:09----------
also like don't see people in real life


---------03:11----------
ever you know conventions are pretty


---------03:13----------
much gone for now um


---------03:16----------
so yeah so


---------03:19----------
and can i kind of ask you are you so do


---------03:21----------
you


---------03:22----------
have people that you're kind of close to


---------03:24----------
outside of the streaming world like in


---------03:27----------
you know irl friends and stuff like that


---------03:29----------
or do you think that's


---------03:30----------
been hard given streaming and


---------03:33----------
all that stuff


---------03:35----------
well so when i was i when i was in


---------03:37----------
college and i had a lot of um


---------03:39----------
good friends when i was in college


---------03:41----------
that were


---------03:44----------
people that i worked with i worked on


---------03:46----------
campus and


---------03:48----------
after college i feel like we all just


---------03:50----------
kind of


---------03:51----------
split up um i didn't really mean


---------03:53----------
maintain any of those friendships


---------03:56----------
um and now most of my friends are either


---------03:58----------
people who are streamers or people who


---------04:02----------
uh like work at twitch or work in like


---------04:04----------
kind of the same industry


---------04:06----------
sure


---------04:07----------
so you're noticing that there's like um


---------04:09----------
a blend or overlap between your


---------04:11----------
professional life and your personal life


---------04:14----------
yeah i mean i feel like that's not too


---------04:18----------
out of the ordinary probably a lot of


---------04:19----------
people yeah that's like how you make


---------04:20----------
friends is yeah at the office or


---------04:22----------
whatever absolutely right so there's a


---------04:24----------
lot of overlap there um and so how you


---------04:28----------
know how would you say that streaming


---------04:29----------
has changed the way that you socialize


---------04:33----------
what i mentioned before where i feel


---------04:35----------
like there's always this kind of


---------04:37----------
um


---------04:41----------
i'm usually worried that if if i'm


---------04:43----------
trying to like befriend someone um


---------04:46----------
who is also a streamer who


---------04:48----------
happens to have like a larger social or


---------04:51----------
sorry a larger um like viewership than


---------04:53----------
me um i don't want them to think that


---------04:55----------
i'm


---------04:56----------
trying to


---------04:57----------
like leech off of their their success


---------05:00----------
and so if it's somebody you know that


---------05:02----------
i'm like genuinely i would be interested


---------05:03----------
in being friends with them


---------05:05----------
um


---------05:07----------
i feel like i i will make an effort to


---------05:10----------
try to be friends with them and then if


---------05:12----------
that effort isn't


---------05:14----------
um


---------05:15----------
i forget the word like reciprocated


---------05:17----------
reciprocated yeah if it's not


---------05:18----------
reciprocated on like an evil


---------05:20----------
uh equal level then


---------05:23----------
i usually just like back off and then


---------05:25----------
that's kind of it


---------05:26----------
like kind of you know i don't want to


---------05:27----------
like be pushy with people


---------05:30----------
and and how would you know okay i


---------05:34----------
this is hard and


---------05:38----------
yeah


---------05:39----------
yes welcome to my life


---------05:47----------
let me just think for a second usually


---------05:49----------
it takes me a while to get there


---------05:51----------
but um


---------05:52----------
so here's the first problem that i'm


---------05:54----------
seeing


---------05:55----------
so usually when people come in with


---------05:57----------
problems


---------05:59----------
it's easy if like the problem isn't as


---------06:01----------
real as they think it is and it's like


---------06:03----------
something that has to do with them


---------06:05----------
does that make sense


---------06:07----------
i think so


---------06:08----------
so like like for example let's say like


---------06:10----------
i have a patient in in my practice right


---------06:13----------
and they say they come in and they say


---------06:14----------
i'm depressed


---------06:16----------
and like if their life is wonderful and


---------06:17----------
they have a clinical illness then the


---------06:19----------
problem is within them


---------06:21----------
and so that i'm like i'm good with right


---------06:23----------
so like that's what i do i help people


---------06:24----------
like fix things that are busted within


---------06:26----------
them


---------06:27----------
what's really hard is sometimes i'll get


---------06:29----------
people that come into my office and


---------06:30----------
they'll say like oh you know


---------06:32----------
um i'm going through a divorce


---------06:36----------
uh and


---------06:38----------
my partner is making allegations that i


---------06:41----------
was like sexually abusive to our


---------06:43----------
children to get a leg up in the divorce


---------06:46----------
which is in turn cause problems at my


---------06:48----------
job


---------06:49----------
and so that's


---------06:51----------
and if someone comes in saying something


---------06:52----------
like that like


---------06:54----------
you know i don't think necessarily that


---------06:56----------
the problem is within them it's not like


---------06:58----------
they're mentally ill and have a


---------06:59----------
neurochemistry imbalance it's like


---------07:00----------
genuinely like their life is falling


---------07:02----------
apart


---------07:03----------
and that's not something that i can fix


---------07:05----------
so it kind of gives me pause does that


---------07:07----------
make sense


---------07:08----------
yeah so the first thing that i'm taken


---------07:10----------
aback by is just


---------07:12----------
how challenging your circumstances are


---------07:15----------
like i don't know that you're like i'm


---------07:16----------
not hearing that you've got social


---------07:18----------
anxiety


---------07:19----------
or like you know any that's maybe you do


---------07:21----------
who knows maybe we'll get there but you


---------07:23----------
know i'm not hearing like a you problem


---------07:25----------
does that make sense


---------07:27----------
yeah i understand it's kind of it's just


---------07:29----------
the circumstances of my profession and


---------07:32----------
the way that


---------07:34----------
my people in my profession socialize is


---------07:37----------
challenging yeah absolutely and and so


---------07:40----------
that's what kind of gives me pause


---------07:41----------
because i'm noticing there's lots of


---------07:42----------
issues i suspect around boundaries there


---------07:45----------
are issues around expectations i see big


---------07:48----------
issues around conflicts of interest


---------07:50----------
right so you have dual relationships and


---------07:52----------
anytime you have a dual relationship it


---------07:54----------
complicates things it's the same reason


---------07:56----------
why you know therapists are not allowed


---------07:58----------
to date their patients


---------08:00----------
right so like there's like an inherent


---------08:01----------
conflict of interest it's the same


---------08:03----------
reason why you shouldn't go into


---------08:04----------
business with family


---------08:05----------
because there's like a dual relationship


---------08:07----------
there and anytime there's a dual


---------08:08----------
relationship things get muddy


---------08:10----------
um and so i'm i'm struggling a little


---------08:14----------
bit because i


---------08:16----------
i don't know how to help you with this


---------08:18----------
so i i need a second to think


---------08:20----------
okay which because i don't want to be


---------08:22----------
like sorry sucks for you the world is


---------08:24----------
what it is gg i'll catch you next time


---------08:27----------
thanks for having me yeah


---------08:30----------
which is which is honestly what where


---------08:31----------
i'm kind of leaning towards right now so


---------08:33----------
i gotta i gotta check check myself for a


---------08:35----------
second


---------08:36----------
um


---------08:38----------
so and let me ask you a question so i'm


---------08:40----------
noticing that


---------08:42----------
you're


---------08:42----------
are you usually like pretty even keel


---------08:46----------
um yeah


---------08:49----------
yeah i get that on stream a lot of uh is


---------08:52----------
she depressed because i just i have a


---------08:54----------
very um


---------08:57----------
monochrome uh


---------08:59----------
attitude i think pretty yeah you know


---------09:01----------
level


---------09:02----------
um


---------09:05----------
yeah how long have you been that way


---------09:08----------
uh i would say probably my whole life


---------09:10----------
okay


---------09:12----------
um and how does it feel when people kind


---------09:14----------
of like notice that when people in your


---------09:16----------
chat ask like is she depressed


---------09:20----------
um i don't i usually make a joke about


---------09:23----------
it um


---------09:26----------
i think it's i it's something that's


---------09:29----------
very obvious to me about my own


---------09:30----------
personality is that i'm not uh


---------09:32----------
i'm not a person who has very


---------09:35----------
extreme reactions to things


---------09:37----------
um which i think


---------09:39----------
often on camera that is kind of


---------09:41----------
exacerbated


---------09:43----------
by being on camera i feel like if you if


---------09:45----------
you have just like a regular reaction to


---------09:47----------
something the camera doesn't usually


---------09:48----------
pick up on that i feel like a lot of


---------09:50----------
times that's why content creators end up


---------09:52----------
over exaggerating things


---------09:54----------
um


---------09:56----------
and so i think because i'm i'm pretty


---------09:59----------
neutral most of the time even when like


---------10:01----------
big things happen


---------10:02----------
i think that comes across as me like not


---------10:04----------
caring and sometimes that kind of


---------10:06----------
frustrates me where


---------10:08----------
either like people will think that i


---------10:10----------
just don't care about something that


---------10:11----------
happens and it's just because i'm not


---------10:14----------
forcing myself to overreact to things


---------10:17----------
um or if i do actually have a moment


---------10:20----------
where i i react in a big way then


---------10:22----------
there's people that are just like why is


---------10:23----------
she faking her laugh and why is she


---------10:26----------
you know pretending or something so


---------10:29----------
kind of sounds like you can't win


---------10:30----------
situations yeah i was gonna say it


---------10:32----------
sounds like damned if you do damned if


---------10:33----------
you don't yep


---------10:35----------
yeah


---------10:36----------
what's it like to be put into those


---------10:38----------
situations


---------10:39----------
it sucks that's one of my least favorite


---------10:41----------
things about streaming it feels like


---------10:43----------
you're kind of trapped in between uh


---------10:45----------
like i feel like you you can have those


---------10:47----------
moments where


---------10:49----------
you're


---------10:49----------
above it and you're like well you know


---------10:52----------
you can't please everyone and so


---------10:54----------
do whatever you want and that's fine but


---------10:56----------
a lot of content


---------10:58----------
creation


---------11:00----------
surround is surrounded by having to


---------11:02----------
please


---------11:03----------
the audience right like that is that's


---------11:06----------
how you get a bigger audience is by


---------11:07----------
being interesting to people that are


---------11:09----------
watching and


---------11:13----------
so it's like you kind of have to do both


---------11:15----------
yeah so


---------11:16----------
and let me ask you it's okay if i call


---------11:18----------
you ann right yes okay


---------11:21----------
um


---------11:22----------
so


---------11:22----------
i'm kind of


---------11:25----------
getting a sense that like you know like


---------11:26----------
you said you're kind of trapped so i i'm


---------11:28----------
i'm really


---------11:30----------
curious and almost confused also amazed


---------11:33----------
and it's a weird plethora of things but


---------11:36----------
how you manage to get up every day and


---------11:39----------
stream


---------11:42----------
like because if you're faced with a


---------11:43----------
situation where you can't you know it's


---------11:45----------
like if you emote too much


---------11:47----------
it's like ah she's being fake for views


---------11:49----------
and if you don't emote enough it's like


---------11:52----------
she's heartless


---------11:53----------
you know maybe a little bit of a


---------11:54----------
hyperbole but i'm trying to mimic the


---------11:56----------
internet here


---------11:57----------
no that's pretty accurate actually ah


---------11:58----------
[ __ ]


---------12:02----------
oh my god that's pretty spot on


---------12:05----------
yeah


---------12:07----------
yeah


---------12:08----------
how do you do that how do you i don't


---------12:12----------
know there's um there's a florence in


---------12:14----------
the machine song where she says i don't


---------12:15----------
know how i don't just stand outside and


---------12:17----------
scream and that's how i feel sometimes


---------12:20----------
it's like i don't know um i mean i like


---------12:22----------
playing video games i've been playing


---------12:24----------
video games for


---------12:25----------
you know forever so


---------12:27----------
i got into streaming because it was


---------12:29----------
something that i wanted to


---------12:31----------
share with people you know um


---------12:35----------
but


---------12:36----------
i mean it is


---------12:37----------
it's like a constant


---------12:39----------
assault of


---------12:42----------
different


---------12:43----------
people's opinions and like people who


---------12:45----------
will just throw out a comment without


---------12:46----------
really


---------12:49----------
there's not a lot of like


---------12:51----------
spice behind it you know they're just


---------12:52----------
saying things i think a lot of times


---------12:54----------
it's like you know like young kids who


---------12:55----------
will just be like oh you look depressed


---------12:57----------
or like why are you ugly today you're


---------12:59----------
just like and sometimes it just hits you


---------13:01----------
and you're like


---------13:03----------
you want to just snap back at them and


---------13:05----------
sometimes probably too often i do


---------13:07----------
because i just get so frustrated with it


---------13:11----------
but


---------13:11----------
that's just kind of part of the job


---------13:14----------
what makes you want to stand outside and


---------13:15----------
scream


---------13:18----------
uh


---------13:19----------
well the double standard of it is


---------13:20----------
frustrating to me um


---------13:23----------
if i try to


---------13:26----------
talk about social justice issues i get


---------13:28----------
called a social justice warrior people


---------13:30----------
be like oh here comes the feminazi blah


---------13:32----------
blah um if


---------13:35----------
some


---------13:37----------
you know 20 000 viewer white male


---------13:39----------
streamer does it then everyone's like oh


---------13:41----------
good for you you know good job


---------13:43----------
um


---------13:44----------
and so that that kind of thing really


---------13:46----------
frustrates me where it's like people who


---------13:47----------
champion


---------13:49----------
the ideas of like


---------13:50----------
uh i mean mental health talking about


---------13:52----------
mental health and um


---------13:56----------
you know that kind of thing is


---------13:58----------
i feel like a lot of times you get


---------13:59----------
shouted down and then


---------14:01----------
if you have enough of a following then


---------14:03----------
people will praise you for it and that


---------14:05----------
is frustrating to me


---------14:07----------
yeah i just realized something


---------14:09----------
can you have a male feminazi


---------14:12----------
oh probably


---------14:14----------
because i would think so too but i just


---------14:17----------
realized that i've never heard someone


---------14:19----------
call a man a feminazi right if you're if


---------14:22----------
you're a female feminist


---------14:25----------
i've seen lots of female feminists get


---------14:27----------
called feminaz i don't think i've ever


---------14:28----------
seen a male feminazi before


---------14:31----------
yeah i think people will then usually


---------14:33----------
go for like the white knight or like


---------14:34----------
simp is now just the modern yeah white


---------14:37----------
knight you know yeah yeah simping for


---------14:39----------
someone yeah so it sounds like the


---------14:41----------
double standard frustrates you um


---------14:45----------
and i am kind of noticing that you'll


---------14:46----------
sort of voice an emotion but we as i was


---------14:49----------
mentioning earlier you're kind of even


---------14:50----------
keel so you don't sound frustrated


---------14:53----------
you don't look frustrated


---------14:56----------
but you feel frustrated


---------14:58----------
sometimes it's not like a 24 7 i feel


---------15:01----------
this way um


---------15:03----------
but sometimes yeah i think i've seen


---------15:05----------
maybe youtube clips of you owning people


---------15:08----------
who are


---------15:09----------
misogynistic


---------15:10----------
if


---------15:14----------
yeah that was a big day


---------15:17----------
what was that


---------15:19----------
what was the kotaku article


---------15:21----------
uh i was playing siege and i was i think


---------15:23----------
i was off stream but i was recording


---------15:25----------
just in case anything like cool happened


---------15:26----------
you know um


---------15:28----------
and


---------15:29----------
i th there were just a couple of guys


---------15:31----------
that were


---------15:32----------
being really shitty toward me um and so


---------15:34----------
i was like recording it and just


---------15:36----------
i wasn't responding to them i was just


---------15:38----------
saying like making call outs in the game


---------15:41----------
and then i ended up being like the top


---------15:42----------
frag on our team um and they were still


---------15:45----------
just being like really


---------15:46----------
aggressive and like


---------15:48----------
you know the whole go kill yourself etc


---------15:50----------
etc


---------15:52----------
um and


---------15:55----------
i posted it on twitter and then someone


---------15:58----------
decided to post it on kotaku i guess and


---------16:00----------
there was a whole thing about it


---------16:02----------
how did you feel after the kotaku


---------16:04----------
article was posted


---------16:06----------
um i feel like i it surprised me it felt


---------16:09----------
like


---------16:11----------
it was a lot of more attention being


---------16:13----------
drawn to something that is


---------16:16----------
um


---------16:17----------
not


---------16:18----------
to me it doesn't it's not that big of a


---------16:20----------
deal you know so it felt like there was


---------16:22----------
a big spotlight being shined on


---------16:24----------
something that was kind of a daily


---------16:25----------
occurrence


---------16:26----------
um


---------16:28----------
so i mean it would be kind of like a


---------16:30----------
kataku article


---------16:31----------
about the color of your shirt today and


---------16:33----------
you're just like i don't know i just do


---------16:34----------
this um


---------16:36----------
so it was a little bit uh intimidating


---------16:39----------
to me because there were a lot of people


---------16:40----------
that came into my chat that day that


---------16:41----------
were saying like


---------16:42----------
you know um


---------16:45----------
they were saying really nice things


---------16:46----------
actually they were like really positive


---------16:47----------
about the way that i responded or my


---------16:49----------
lack of response to what those guys were


---------16:51----------
saying


---------16:52----------
so


---------16:53----------
what was intimidating about it


---------16:56----------
uh well like i said it was just it was a


---------16:58----------
just a big spotlight of


---------17:00----------
on something that to me was um


---------17:03----------
not


---------17:04----------
that interesting


---------17:06----------
and so it was just i i was worried more


---------17:08----------
about um


---------17:11----------
like any negative reaction that might


---------17:13----------
come from it like i said of people that


---------17:14----------
are just like oh you know who cares if


---------17:16----------
they told you to kill yourself like who


---------17:18----------
cares if they said that why you know why


---------17:19----------
do you why do you care about that


---------17:22----------
so i'm here i'm hearing that you were


---------17:24----------
almost anticipating


---------17:26----------
an amplification of the hatred


---------17:29----------
yeah


---------17:30----------
yeah um well


---------17:32----------
about um


---------17:34----------
anytime you talk about


---------17:36----------
people being


---------17:38----------
misogynistic or


---------17:40----------
uh


---------17:43----------
you know


---------17:44----------
aggressive or just rude in online games


---------17:46----------
there's always the people there's always


---------17:47----------
so many people that are just like i just


---------17:49----------
mute them or whatever just ignore them


---------17:51----------
or you know


---------17:52----------
it's your fault because you didn't mute


---------17:53----------
them or you should have just ignored


---------17:55----------
them or who cares what they say like


---------17:56----------
don't let it bother you and


---------17:58----------
um so that kind of thing is


---------18:02----------
frustrating


---------18:04----------
okay


---------18:08----------
so


---------18:13----------
and i think i have a sense of where to


---------18:14----------
go


---------18:16----------
and i'm i'm going to


---------18:19----------
challenge you a little bit is that okay


---------18:21----------
okay okay


---------18:23----------
so we're gonna go into hard mode you


---------18:25----------
ready for it


---------18:26----------
okay


---------18:27----------
so i don't want you to use the word


---------18:29----------
frustrating anymore


---------18:31----------
okay so i'm noticing what i think is


---------18:33----------
that frustration is actually an umbrella


---------18:36----------
emotion


---------18:37----------
that covers other emotions


---------18:40----------
so i'll give you an example um


---------18:43----------
so you just said that like this is


---------18:45----------
frustrating because here's a spotlight


---------18:47----------
of you doing something that is generally


---------18:49----------
received by the internet is like a good


---------18:52----------
thing like you're a champion


---------18:54----------
you're a hero


---------18:55----------
right but that's not how it feels to you


---------18:57----------
so it's kind of strange because a lot of


---------18:59----------
people are grateful probably like for


---------19:02----------
what you did like they appreciate that


---------19:03----------
you're putting a spotlight on an issue


---------19:05----------
that's very common for people and yet


---------19:07----------
your response to it is not positive at


---------19:09----------
all in fact you're kind of like


---------19:11----------
intimidated concerned on guard


---------19:14----------
that yeah you know the the [ __ ] will


---------19:18----------
like they're gonna grab their pitchforks


---------19:19----------
and they're gonna come right they're


---------19:21----------
coming for you


---------19:22----------
and so you'll use the phrase like


---------19:24----------
intimidating i mean it's very


---------19:25----------
frustrating


---------19:26----------
intimidating is a good example of of


---------19:28----------
kind of like i think you could have used


---------19:30----------
frustrated there


---------19:32----------
but i i'm getting the sense that like


---------19:34----------
frustration for you is sort of like what


---------19:36----------
you feel but i think there's like stuff


---------19:40----------
underneath the surface there


---------19:42----------
so for example


---------19:44----------
there's a sense of like you've


---------19:49----------
so i would venture i'm just gonna toss


---------19:51----------
out some things one is that like


---------19:53----------
there's a complete gap in understanding


---------19:56----------
between the kotaku article and like your


---------19:58----------
actual experience


---------19:59----------
people are gonna look at you and be like


---------20:02----------
oh like she's such a champion of women's


---------20:04----------
rights on the internet and she's


---------20:06----------
schooling noobs right yay


---------20:08----------
cheering for women in gaming you go girl


---------20:12----------
but that's so discongruent of your


---------20:14----------
actual experience like you're not being


---------20:15----------
a hero


---------20:17----------
you're not like that's not how you see


---------20:19----------
it you're not fighting for women's


---------20:20----------
rights you're just trying to play a


---------20:21----------
[ __ ] video game


---------20:23----------
and you just want people to not be toxic


---------20:25----------
and this is what you deal with every day


---------20:28----------
it's it's kind of like i remember seeing


---------20:30----------
talking to my friends who uh i don't


---------20:32----------
really like work in a hospital anymore


---------20:33----------
but i have like friends who still work


---------20:35----------
in hospitals and everyone is like


---------20:36----------
hailing them as heroes and they're like


---------20:38----------
we're not heroes like we don't want to


---------20:39----------
be here we're not doing this out of


---------20:41----------
choice


---------20:42----------
we're being like ground down by a


---------20:44----------
pandemic where like people are dying


---------20:46----------
everyone's getting sick and like there's


---------20:48----------
like you know we're sacrifices we're not


---------20:50----------
heroes


---------20:51----------
right and so what i can imagine could be


---------20:53----------
frustrating is like a complete lack of


---------20:56----------
understanding between the way the world


---------20:58----------
sees you and your experience


---------21:01----------
yeah what do you think about something


---------21:02----------
like that


---------21:05----------
um


---------21:07----------
yeah i think that happens


---------21:08----------
a lot um that


---------21:13----------
if i


---------21:15----------
if i do anything to highlight the way


---------21:18----------
that


---------21:19----------
women are treated online even if in my


---------21:21----------
mind i'm not doing this as a


---------21:25----------
like this happened because she's a woman


---------21:27----------
but rather just


---------21:28----------
like people are really shitty for some


---------21:30----------
reason sometimes online


---------21:32----------
um and then it gets turned into kind of


---------21:35----------
a political


---------21:36----------
thing that was not necessarily my


---------21:39----------
intention but i can see where like where


---------21:40----------
people are getting that from


---------21:42----------
and um


---------21:45----------
i think intimidating is a good word or


---------21:48----------
just worried uh worried about


---------21:51----------
backlash from


---------21:54----------
you know random people


---------21:56----------
um and then sometimes i i honestly


---------21:59----------
actually sometimes i think i would feel


---------22:01----------
i feel a little bit guilty almost that


---------22:03----------
my intention wasn't to


---------22:06----------
like they'll say like oh you did this


---------22:07----------
thing for women and i have that feeling


---------22:09----------
of like oh i that's not actually what i


---------22:11----------
meant to do but like maybe maybe that


---------22:13----------
should have been what i was doing and


---------22:14----------
like am i


---------22:15----------
not doing my job properly if i'm not you


---------22:17----------
know thinking of that


---------22:19----------
so


---------22:20----------
so and i'm gonna struggle to find the


---------22:22----------
words to say this


---------22:24----------
but


---------22:25----------
i i think um i'm just noticing like


---------22:28----------
there's you


---------22:30----------
and there's a really thick wall


---------22:32----------
and then there's like the outside world


---------22:36----------
does that resonate with you at all


---------22:38----------
yes


---------22:39----------
yeah exactly help me i don't i don't


---------22:41----------
understand that can you help me


---------22:42----------
understand that


---------22:43----------
what do you mean you don't understand it


---------22:45----------
i don't know why i'm getting this image


---------22:47----------
but that's just the image that i'm


---------22:48----------
getting


---------22:49----------
i think that's the image that everyone


---------22:50----------
gets and i think that's my problem with


---------22:52----------
making friends is that


---------22:54----------
i have


---------22:56----------
i i can't tell you the number of times


---------22:57----------
that someone has come to me and they'd


---------22:58----------
be like anne


---------23:00----------
you're so cool i think you're just like


---------23:02----------
the coolest person i've ever met and


---------23:04----------
they'll talk to their friends they'll be


---------23:05----------
like isn't she so cool we want to be


---------23:07----------
friends with her


---------23:08----------
and then we're just not friends and i


---------23:10----------
don't know how to like


---------23:11----------
make friends with them even though


---------23:13----------
they're like they i feel like sometimes


---------23:15----------
i don't know if it's that there's


---------23:18----------
maybe it's a combination of things maybe


---------23:19----------
it's the fact that i put a wall between


---------23:21----------
myself and others or for some reason


---------23:23----------
that wall exists but at the same time it


---------23:25----------
feels like other people


---------23:27----------
sometimes put me on like a pedestal


---------23:30----------
where they're like oh she's over here


---------23:31----------
and she's cool and


---------23:33----------
she's


---------23:35----------
on it like unapproachable


---------23:37----------
and then and i don't know how to get


---------23:38----------
myself off of that right like i don't


---------23:40----------
want to be there i just want to


---------23:42----------
make friends with people


---------23:45----------
yeah so when you're saying people put


---------23:47----------
you on a pedestal you're talking about


---------23:48----------
people in your real life for kotaku


---------23:52----------
no uh i meant like other streamers like


---------23:54----------
other content creators or just like


---------23:56----------
people that i've met in person


---------23:58----------
um


---------24:00----------
yeah


---------24:01----------
yeah so my question was actually like a


---------24:03----------
a subtle point which is that i'm


---------24:06----------
noticing


---------24:07----------
a theme here


---------24:09----------
about


---------24:10----------
and i'm still not i'm sniffing at it i


---------24:12----------
don't know exactly what it is yet but


---------24:14----------
like


---------24:15----------
i'm getting the sense that you're not


---------24:17----------
understood you can't form connections


---------24:19----------
you've sort of said that explicitly


---------24:21----------
but i i suspect that that has something


---------24:23----------
to do with like


---------24:26----------
are you at a disadvantage because you're


---------24:28----------
a streamer and this is the streaming


---------24:29----------
world and y'all are essentially in the


---------24:31----------
business of friendship so this is


---------24:32----------
something we say a lot in our content


---------24:34----------
creator coaching program is we help like


---------24:37----------
streamers work through this idea that


---------24:39----------
y'all are in the business of friendship


---------24:41----------
right because friendships are collabs


---------24:44----------
and collabs is work therefore


---------24:47----------
friendships are work and then you start


---------24:49----------
to enter into this dual purpose of like


---------24:51----------
are you my friend are you here for the


---------24:53----------
collab


---------24:54----------
when you approach someone else and you


---------24:56----------
genuinely like them and they have five


---------24:58----------
million more


---------24:59----------
followers than you do


---------25:01----------
like how do you let that person know


---------25:03----------
that you actually don't give a [ __ ]


---------25:04----------
about that right you just think that


---------25:06----------
they're genuinely a cool person and you


---------25:07----------
want to connect human to human


---------25:09----------
yeah exactly


---------25:11----------
what i'm


---------25:12----------
but the the thing that's kind of


---------25:13----------
interesting


---------25:14----------
and about the way that you view these


---------25:17----------
things is i'm noticing that in your


---------25:19----------
language you're like a separate entity


---------25:22----------
from the outside world


---------25:24----------
it's sort of like


---------25:25----------
you know you kind of say like oh that's


---------25:26----------
what kotaku was thinking but that's not


---------25:28----------
what i was thinking there's like there's


---------25:30----------
no there's like not connection you feel


---------25:32----------
trapped because you know they're going


---------25:34----------
to react to you this way or they're


---------25:35----------
going to react to you that way they're


---------25:37----------
going to either call you depressed or


---------25:39----------
they're going to call you


---------25:41----------
you know simp farming


---------25:43----------
by expressing emotion you can't win so


---------25:46----------
i'm just noticing that like the way that


---------25:48----------
your mind views the world


---------25:50----------
is that the world is going to be like


---------25:52----------
running on autopilot


---------25:54----------
and then like you're you can try to move


---------25:56----------
around within it but you can't really


---------25:58----------
like affect how the world interacts with


---------26:01----------
you


---------26:03----------
yeah


---------26:05----------
so i think as long as that i suspect


---------26:08----------
that contributes


---------26:10----------
to the way that you form


---------26:12----------
relationships with people


---------26:14----------
what do you think


---------26:16----------
that sounds accurate yes


---------26:19----------
right so so i don't know how to


---------26:21----------
undo that or to like change that you


---------26:23----------
know we'll get there i think so


---------26:25----------
you know i i think we


---------26:27----------
i hopefully will get there so so i i


---------26:30----------
think there's there's actually something


---------26:31----------
really interesting which is while you're


---------26:33----------
a champion of women in the gaming space


---------26:36----------
i don't get the sense that you feel


---------26:38----------
powerful


---------26:39----------
do you feel powerful


---------26:44----------
no not really


---------26:45----------
do you feel like you have agency


---------26:49----------
like the capacity to change things


---------26:54----------
minor things


---------26:56----------
yes


---------26:58----------
i think but not


---------27:00----------
on a grand scale


---------27:02----------
what about making a friend


---------27:05----------
what's the scales had a grand scale of


---------27:06----------
life


---------27:08----------
uh


---------27:09----------
i mean i


---------27:11----------
it's like not for lack of trying you


---------27:13----------
know it's like it's i feel like i try


---------27:16----------
maybe i'm not doing a good job of it but


---------27:18----------
that's not the question i asked okay pay


---------27:20----------
attention now and i think your answer is


---------27:22----------
revealing


---------27:23----------
do you have the agency to change things


---------27:26----------
i didn't ask you if you try to change


---------27:27----------
things i asked you can you


---------27:29----------
can you can i have friends


---------27:32----------
can i


---------27:34----------
i think so yes


---------27:36----------
i think i'm capable of that yeah


---------27:42----------
what's the likelihood of the outcome


---------27:44----------
there


---------27:45----------
are you theoretically capable or do you


---------27:47----------
think like you know who should where


---------27:48----------
should i place the bet should i bet on


---------27:50----------
you or should i bet on should we bet on


---------27:52----------
friendship or bet on not friendship


---------27:55----------
i mean yeah like it's a thing that i


---------27:56----------
have done before so it's like i know


---------27:58----------
that i can do it it just feels like


---------28:00----------
something that is


---------28:02----------
very challenging


---------28:04----------
for me


---------28:05----------
so how hard have you tried


---------28:08----------
i don't i don't know how do you quantify


---------28:10----------
that gut


---------28:12----------
yeah um


---------28:13----------
you feel like you've tried hard uh well


---------28:16----------
that's that's what i was talking about


---------28:17----------
earlier where it's like i feel like i


---------28:19----------
will


---------28:20----------
take a step forward


---------28:22----------
and then i get


---------28:24----------
worried


---------28:25----------
about


---------28:27----------
what the other person is thinking what


---------28:28----------
their reaction is or i don't feel like


---------28:31----------
i'm seeing a


---------28:33----------
reciprocation


---------28:35----------
and so then i back off because i don't


---------28:36----------
want to pressure people or push people


---------28:40----------
so i think i


---------28:42----------
i would say i probably don't try like


---------28:45----------
super hard in that sense because i don't


---------28:47----------
want to be


---------28:49----------
um


---------28:50----------
i don't want to be overbearing


---------28:52----------
okay so


---------28:54----------
i'm gonna this is gonna be a bit blunt


---------28:57----------
so i want you to envision something okay


---------28:59----------
okay i'm going to take a step forward


---------29:02----------
and i'm going to take a step back and


---------29:03----------
then i'm going to take a step forward


---------29:05----------
and i'm going to take a step back and


---------29:06----------
i'm going to take a step forward i'm


---------29:07----------
going to take a step back


---------29:09----------
if you're watching someone doing this


---------29:11----------
and someone told you


---------29:12----------
why don't you think that person is


---------29:14----------
walking forward and someone was like


---------29:15----------
it's because there's an invisible wall


---------29:18----------
that's why they can't move forward what


---------29:19----------
do you think about that


---------29:20----------
is that fair


---------29:23----------
what do you mean by fair


---------29:25----------
like is that a fair interpretation of


---------29:26----------
like if someone just keeps on like


---------29:28----------
staying in place right like you're


---------29:30----------
taking a step forward and then you kind


---------29:31----------
of pull back it's sort of like i'm


---------29:32----------
getting this image of a wall is like in


---------29:34----------
the way


---------29:37----------
right i mean this is a bit blunt because


---------29:38----------
i'm i'm asking you to stretch here i


---------29:41----------
don't think we've we've appropriately


---------29:42----------
filled in all the steps


---------29:45----------
but like i'm noticing a resistance right


---------29:47----------
maybe it's not a wall it's more like a


---------29:49----------
tether


---------29:50----------
that keeps you like


---------29:52----------
from really pushing forward and like


---------29:57----------
you know like i i think we're on to


---------29:59----------
something here i'm sniffing something


---------30:00----------
what do you think i could be wrong


---------30:02----------
though


---------30:03----------
well if we


---------30:06----------
if we take your example


---------30:08----------
of


---------30:09----------
taking a step forward towards someone


---------30:11----------
and


---------30:12----------
um


---------30:14----------
maybe you take two steps forward and


---------30:16----------
they don't move you take another step


---------30:18----------
forward and they still don't move or


---------30:20----------
they even maybe


---------30:21----------
get distracted by something and they you


---------30:23----------
know start walking in another direction


---------30:25----------
um


---------30:28----------
at what point do you


---------30:30----------
you know


---------30:31----------
stop following that person


---------30:33----------
you know or you're just like


---------30:35----------
we're not actually like friends yet but


---------30:37----------
i'm just


---------30:39----------
walking after you you know like


---------30:40----------
following you wherever you're going at


---------30:42----------
what point does that person then turn


---------30:43----------
around and be like


---------30:45----------
why are you following me you know so i


---------30:47----------
think that's more of my


---------30:49----------
my fear i'm with you so where does that


---------30:51----------
fear come from does that happen to you


---------30:54----------
um i mean i think that's just generally


---------30:57----------
when i when i feel like i i'll like


---------31:00----------
message people


---------31:01----------
um to ask them if they want to like play


---------31:03----------
games um they'll say like yeah sure like


---------31:05----------
that sounds great and then we just like


---------31:07----------
i'll be like cool when you know do you


---------31:09----------
want to do that and then just like they


---------31:10----------
don't talk ever again


---------31:11----------
what about


---------31:12----------
before you


---------31:13----------
let's step outside of streaming for a


---------31:15----------
second okay


---------31:16----------
if you had any experiences where you


---------31:18----------
felt like you kind of chased someone


---------31:21----------
and they were like what are you doing


---------31:25----------
um like middle school


---------31:27----------
high school maybe college


---------31:30----------
i think um i think most of the time


---------31:32----------
[Music]


---------31:34----------
it's more like uh


---------31:41----------
like for example i i mentioned that i


---------31:43----------
worked at a place um that was on campus


---------31:45----------
when i was at college and


---------31:48----------
there were probably


---------31:50----------
15 employees


---------31:51----------
um and they were all students they were


---------31:53----------
all about the same age


---------31:54----------
and


---------31:57----------
i always felt like we were all


---------32:01----------
acquaintances


---------32:02----------
um


---------32:03----------
and some of us were even friends and


---------32:05----------
would hang out


---------32:07----------
but i felt like i


---------32:09----------
was one of the people who


---------32:14----------
was i i never really felt like like i


---------32:16----------
was one of the the core group


---------32:19----------
um where


---------32:20----------
it felt like there were people who were


---------32:22----------
um


---------32:23----------
if they wanted to study together they


---------32:25----------
would call each other and i was not one


---------32:27----------
of those people right like i was


---------32:28----------
somebody who worked with them and who


---------32:30----------
was like kind of friends with them


---------32:32----------
but was not


---------32:33----------
the like


---------32:35----------
you're an outsider


---------32:36----------
yeah


---------32:40----------
were you an outsider in high school


---------32:44----------
yeah i think it was kind of the same the


---------32:46----------
same scenario where i


---------32:48----------
was in like marching band or concert


---------32:50----------
band or whatever


---------32:52----------
and


---------32:53----------
it always felt like kind of the same


---------32:55----------
social dynamic


---------32:58----------
what was it like to be in marching band


---------33:01----------
uh


---------33:03----------
i played trumpet so i had to hold my


---------33:04----------
trumpet up for many hours so i had


---------33:06----------
really great biceps but it was um


---------33:09----------
it was a lot of


---------33:11----------
a lot of long hours


---------33:13----------
um


---------33:14----------
with like you know the same group of


---------33:15----------
people and so


---------33:17----------
i mean there were people that i was like


---------33:20----------
pretty good friends with um


---------33:22----------
at the time and then


---------33:24----------
we either


---------33:25----------
kind of fell out of contact or


---------33:28----------
just


---------33:31----------
weren't friends anymore um


---------33:33----------
you know for various reasons so


---------33:37----------
okay


---------33:39----------
and can i ask you kind of a couple of


---------33:41----------
like


---------33:42----------
random questions that are sort of all


---------33:43----------
over the place


---------33:45----------
okay


---------33:46----------
can you help me understand um so i


---------33:48----------
noticed you have some tattoos can you


---------33:50----------
tell me a little bit about those


---------33:52----------
um sure uh well i have a star wars


---------33:55----------
tattoo here if you can't tell i like


---------33:57----------
star wars i've got my own stuff back


---------33:58----------
here


---------33:59----------
um this one is from the witcher


---------34:02----------
this is from a


---------34:04----------
uh a russian novel


---------34:07----------
um and the text says uh bold is the


---------34:10----------
heart that steers her through the night


---------34:13----------
um and then i have uh this one here


---------34:16----------
that's supposed to be a representative


---------34:17----------
of my family my siblings and my mom and


---------34:19----------
i


---------34:20----------
wha what is that one


---------34:22----------
uh so it's a it's a horse here because


---------34:25----------
my mom loves horses and then it's a sun


---------34:27----------
moon and star which is my uh brother


---------34:29----------
sister and i


---------34:31----------
can you tell me a little bit about your


---------34:32----------
family


---------34:33----------
yeah um


---------34:35----------
i have an older brother and an older


---------34:36----------
sister um we're all within about four


---------34:39----------
years of each other


---------34:40----------
uh


---------34:41----------
i grew up with my mom


---------34:43----------
[Music]


---------34:45----------
my dad


---------34:46----------
uh where my parents were divorced and he


---------34:49----------
would visit when i was a kid he would


---------34:51----------
visit maybe like two or three times a


---------34:52----------
year um


---------34:55----------
and then


---------34:56----------
uh now most of my family lives here in


---------34:59----------
california we actually we all kind of


---------35:01----------
ended up here through


---------35:02----------
we lived in the midwest and then through


---------35:04----------
you know all sorts of different things


---------35:05----------
we all ended up in california


---------35:07----------
um


---------35:09----------
i'm really


---------35:10----------
close with my sister and my brother and


---------35:12----------
my mom


---------35:13----------
my dad and i see each other every so


---------35:15----------
often


---------35:17----------
we're not super close but


---------35:18----------
we have a like amicable relationship


---------35:21----------
sure


---------35:23----------
did you


---------35:25----------
want more of a relationship with your


---------35:27----------
dad


---------35:28----------
um


---------35:31----------
sometimes i think i would i would see


---------35:33----------
like uh


---------35:35----------
for like again for our college we had um


---------35:37----------
like parent weekend and


---------35:40----------
um i would see like girls with their


---------35:41----------
dads and i i wished for


---------35:44----------
myself that i had that kind of


---------35:45----------
relationship with my dad


---------35:47----------
um


---------35:48----------
but we just


---------35:50----------
never really had that


---------35:51----------
and


---------35:53----------
i don't know it's okay like i i like i


---------35:55----------
said my mom and i are really close i


---------35:57----------
feel like she did a really good job of


---------36:00----------
raising us and certainly


---------36:03----------
yeah i think that much is clear


---------36:04----------
yeah also sounds like you have very


---------36:06----------
close bonds with your siblings


---------36:08----------
yeah yeah we're pretty close


---------36:11----------
um and why do you think you didn't have


---------36:14----------
more of a relationship with your dad how


---------36:15----------
do you understand that


---------36:18----------
how long do you have


---------36:19----------
um


---------36:21----------
uh well when i was a kid um so my dad is


---------36:25----------
uh korean and my mom is american and my


---------36:28----------
dad uh


---------36:30----------
i think


---------36:31----------
got a lot of uh


---------36:34----------
of negative negativity from his his side


---------36:37----------
of the family


---------36:38----------
because he married an american woman and


---------36:40----------
had half american kids


---------36:42----------
um so his side of the family was always


---------36:45----------
pretty


---------36:46----------
um


---------36:47----------
rude to us and kind of dismissive


---------36:50----------
um i was always frustrated with my


---------36:53----------
dad not allowed to use that word oh yeah


---------36:56----------
um i was


---------37:01----------
disappointed


---------37:02----------
and


---------37:03----------
[Music]


---------37:06----------
unhappy and resentful of my dad for


---------37:10----------
see what's under my frustration yeah


---------37:12----------
right


---------37:13----------
um


---------37:14----------
can we just go back to the blanket term


---------37:16----------
so i don't have to figure other words


---------37:17----------
out yeah um


---------37:19----------
but he


---------37:21----------
he wanted us to


---------37:23----------
be


---------37:24----------
i think he i think he had this idea that


---------37:26----------
like being american was like the secret


---------37:28----------
to success and that


---------37:29----------
he didn't want us to


---------37:31----------
be very


---------37:32----------
korean so like he


---------37:34----------
could have taught us how to speak korean


---------37:36----------
when we were kids you know like kids


---------37:37----------
like pick up languages and he just never


---------37:39----------
did


---------37:40----------
um because he wanted us to


---------37:44----------
um


---------37:47----------
he just didn't want us to be


---------37:48----------
you know korean and


---------37:51----------
i just i think that also i mean if we


---------37:54----------
talk about feeling like an outsider


---------37:55----------
whenever i would go to my dad's


---------37:57----------
you know family function


---------37:59----------
um


---------38:01----------
they


---------38:02----------
well first all the other kids that were


---------38:04----------
our age all spoke korean so we didn't


---------38:07----------
and i think that was one of the reasons


---------38:09----------
i really resented my dad because it's


---------38:10----------
like my cousins speak korean and i like


---------38:12----------
can't i feel like i can't hang out with


---------38:14----------
them


---------38:15----------
um


---------38:17----------
sounds like he kind of doomed you to be


---------38:18----------
an outsider


---------38:20----------
yeah thanks dad


---------38:22----------
um i don't think it was like


---------38:24----------
100 his fault um i definitely don't like


---------38:27----------
blame it on him i think he


---------38:29----------
tried to do


---------38:30----------
well because i think he tried to do


---------38:32----------
what he thought


---------38:34----------
was the best


---------38:36----------
um i think he wanted us you know at the


---------38:38----------
root of it he wanted us to be


---------38:40----------
successful and healthy


---------38:42----------
and now especially as we've gotten older


---------38:44----------
i think my dad is kind of mellowed out i


---------38:45----------
think when we were kids he was really


---------38:47----------
trying to control


---------38:48----------
our futures and our path and i think now


---------38:51----------
that we've all grown up and we're all


---------38:53----------
kind of established in our own ways


---------38:55----------
um


---------38:56----------
he's


---------38:58----------
really calmed down about all that and


---------38:59----------
he's just like


---------39:01----------
you know


---------39:02----------
you guys are doing great and i'm glad


---------39:04----------
you're healthy and i think he's kind of


---------39:06----------
has a


---------39:07----------
better perspective on what's really


---------39:08----------
important


---------39:10----------
rather than just


---------39:11----------
get rich and


---------39:12----------
you know


---------39:14----------
have a lot of kids or something i don't


---------39:16----------
know


---------39:17----------
and do you think your dad loves you


---------39:20----------
yeah


---------39:21----------
yeah i do think he does


---------39:22----------
i think he does too


---------39:24----------
yeah


---------39:27----------
um


---------39:30----------
that turned out to be a shorter story


---------39:31----------
than i was expecting oh there's more but


---------39:35----------
that's just i think the start of it you


---------39:37----------
know


---------39:37----------
what what do you mean there's more


---------39:42----------
and it sounds pretty


---------39:43----------
reasonable and wholesome


---------39:45----------
yeah um


---------39:48----------
i don't know my


---------39:49----------
dad


---------39:50----------
uh


---------39:51----------
i just hope he never watches this he got


---------39:53----------
remarried without telling us um


---------39:56----------
i'm pretty sure that the woman that he's


---------39:57----------
living with he also got remarried too


---------39:59----------
without telling us


---------40:00----------
um


---------40:01----------
he


---------40:06----------
had to borrow money from me a lot when i


---------40:08----------
was in college


---------40:12----------
he


---------40:14----------
was uh he rented a car didn't pay for it


---------40:17----------
got arrested


---------40:18----------
um


---------40:19----------
my cousin who i hadn't spoken to in many


---------40:22----------
years called me to say that it was my


---------40:23----------
fault because i didn't give him money


---------40:25----------
um


---------40:27----------
when i didn't even know that he needed


---------40:28----------
money because i had given him money in


---------40:30----------
the past


---------40:31----------
so i think he just kind of shuffled the


---------40:33----------
blame over onto me


---------40:35----------
um


---------40:39----------
i don't know what else


---------40:41----------
i think that's sufficient


---------40:43----------
that's yeah you know we'll start let's


---------40:45----------
just start there


---------40:48----------
different picture huh


---------40:51----------
yeah i mean but like i said despite all


---------40:53----------
that i think he's made


---------40:54----------
like not good decisions in his life but


---------40:56----------
i do think that he cares


---------40:58----------
about us you know he cares about us as


---------41:00----------
his children


---------41:01----------
so


---------41:03----------
yeah i mean


---------41:11----------
can i think for a second


---------41:17----------
how does it feel to talk about this


---------41:19----------
stuff


---------41:21----------
um


---------41:24----------
it's okay it's been


---------41:26----------
many years since all of that and since


---------41:30----------
uh


---------41:34----------
i think the last time any of that really


---------41:36----------
happened was


---------41:40----------
i don't know i think i was still in


---------41:42----------
college at the time yeah i was still in


---------41:43----------
college so that's been a while


---------41:46----------
uh


---------41:47----------
so i think now i'm okay with it it's


---------41:49----------
kind of in the past you know


---------41:51----------
i've moved on


---------41:54----------
so and other random question okay this


---------41:56----------
may be the most offensive question that


---------41:58----------
i ask you're welcome to not answer it


---------42:00----------
you're welcome to go tell me to [ __ ]


---------42:01----------
myself


---------42:02----------
um so i i noticed that you're wearing


---------42:04----------
black


---------42:05----------
and that you have you know you have it


---------42:08----------
seems like black is kind of your color


---------42:10----------
okay technically this is gray okay


---------42:13----------
technically sure


---------42:15----------
technically do you is am i just catching


---------42:17----------
you on a day where you're like like


---------42:20----------
dressing darker or is this sort of like


---------42:22----------
is this your aesthetic like even when i


---------42:24----------
look at your cool like first of all it


---------42:25----------
looks cool okay your your room looks


---------42:28----------
cool like there's a lot of like black


---------42:30----------
and like some cool lighting and stuff


---------42:31----------
like that looks looks dope


---------42:33----------
but i i'm noticing you know there's not


---------42:36----------
like i don't see any blue i don't see


---------42:38----------
any pink like there's a there's a plant


---------42:40----------
in there


---------42:42----------
there's some there's some lighting in


---------42:43----------
there but it's very like black and white


---------42:45----------
is kind of like your aesthetic there's


---------42:47----------
some blue okay yeah


---------42:49----------
how uh


---------42:50----------
i mean is this is this usually kind of


---------42:52----------
how you


---------42:53----------
look or how you or is am i just catching


---------42:56----------
you on a darker day in terms of color


---------42:58----------
palette


---------42:59----------
yeah i think sometimes especially when i


---------43:02----------
was in


---------43:03----------
college and then when i first started


---------43:04----------
streaming the first couple of years i


---------43:06----------
would say i wore a black shirt every day


---------43:08----------
um


---------43:10----------
and i think the past maybe a year or two


---------43:12----------
i've started wearing um


---------43:14----------
more different colors


---------43:16----------
than just black so and how do you can


---------43:19----------
you help me understand like when you


---------43:20----------
started wearing so you started wearing


---------43:22----------
black a whole bunch when you started


---------43:24----------
streaming


---------43:25----------
no uh i meant like


---------43:27----------
for


---------43:29----------
a long time but for probably all of like


---------43:31----------
high school college and then when i


---------43:33----------
started streaming and then


---------43:35----------
okay i know it's kind of


---------43:36----------
i don't know where i'm going with this


---------43:38----------
okay so so you got to help me out here


---------43:40----------
but help me understand what what's


---------43:42----------
appealed to you about


---------43:44----------
that like


---------43:46----------
the way that i dress yeah


---------43:48----------
oh um


---------43:50----------
uh


---------43:51----------
i


---------43:52----------
well i wear like i said now recently i


---------43:54----------
wear more um i still wear some pretty


---------43:56----------
like neutral colors uh like


---------43:58----------
gray black and and white but then i also


---------44:01----------
i've started


---------44:03----------
kind of branching out more and i have


---------44:04----------
some like blue and red and


---------44:06----------
um


---------44:08----------
green and stuff like that um


---------44:13----------
and


---------44:14----------
i don't know i don't i don't really


---------44:15----------
think about it too much i think i just


---------44:17----------
pick what i think looks nice on me


---------44:20----------
yeah so when when when you so yeah so


---------44:22----------
like when you like wear a dark color


---------44:24----------
let's say and i get that you're


---------44:26----------
branching out


---------44:27----------
um when you just like look in the mirror


---------44:29----------
like something about that


---------44:31----------
look feels right to you or like looks


---------44:33----------
good to you


---------44:35----------
you look great in dark colors by the way


---------44:37----------
so we're not i'm not trying to make a


---------44:38----------
judgment thing yeah oh that's okay um so


---------44:41----------
i'm curious what would it feel like to


---------44:42----------
wear like a pink shirt


---------44:45----------
uh i do have like a i mean it's more


---------44:46----------
like a salmon colored shirt that i


---------44:49----------
really like


---------44:50----------
um it kind of just depends on


---------44:52----------
what i feel like wearing that day


---------44:54----------
what do you think makes you feel like


---------44:56----------
wearing a salmon color versus a dark


---------44:58----------
color


---------45:01----------
uh


---------45:02----------
i genuinely don't know it depends on


---------45:05----------
what's clean


---------45:06----------
what my hair looks like that day i guess


---------45:08----------
truly one of us yeah


---------45:11----------
my wardrobe choice is dependent on body


---------45:14----------
odor more than anything else


---------45:15----------
and what will will you know make me


---------45:17----------
stink the least truly one of us yeah you


---------45:20----------
know and i you know if i if i need to


---------45:22----------
apologize for that line of questioning


---------45:24----------
please let me know i wasn't intending to


---------45:26----------
be offensive or anything but


---------45:34----------
i don't know why i've never asked anyone


---------45:36----------
that before on stream but there's just


---------45:37----------
something about your appearance that


---------45:39----------
feels very


---------45:40----------
intentional to me


---------45:42----------
i have a very


---------45:44----------
i have an aesthetic that i feel like is


---------45:47----------
especially when you see me with


---------45:49----------
everything i feel like that is true um


---------45:53----------
so i don't i'm not offended by that at


---------45:54----------
all yeah


---------45:56----------
and i guess we don't really understand


---------45:57----------
what the origin of that aesthetic is


---------45:59----------
which may be like a philosophically


---------46:01----------
foolish question right what's the origin


---------46:03----------
of aesthetics we don't know


---------46:05----------
um


---------46:06----------
so here's kind of what i'm


---------46:08----------
noticing so


---------46:10----------
okay let's take a step back any


---------46:11----------
questions for me by the way


---------46:13----------
no okay um anything that you think we


---------46:16----------
should talk more about


---------46:19----------
uh i'm not sure


---------46:21----------
okay


---------46:22----------
so um i'm gonna try to just lay a couple


---------46:25----------
things out and then i'm curious kind of


---------46:27----------
what you think about them and maybe we


---------46:29----------
can


---------46:30----------
kind of shift a little bit into more of


---------46:32----------
like a


---------46:33----------
active phase as opposed to an


---------46:35----------
investigative phase does that sound okay


---------46:37----------
to you


---------46:38----------
maybe it's inappropriate maybe it's


---------46:40----------
premature so let's take you for example


---------46:43----------
you're ann you're a twitch streamer you


---------46:45----------
school noobs on the internet you love


---------46:46----------
star wars


---------46:48----------
you know you're branching out in


---------46:49----------
different colors it's all good you're it


---------46:52----------
sounds like you're capable of forming


---------46:54----------
like healthy and close relationships


---------46:56----------
you're really close to your mom you've


---------46:58----------
come to some kind of dynamic equilibrium


---------47:00----------
with your dad


---------47:01----------
i get the sense that he loves you a lot


---------47:02----------
i get the sense that you love him a lot


---------47:04----------
i get the sense that he's done a lot of


---------47:06----------
stuff that maybe you could blame him for


---------47:08----------
maybe at some point you did but i don't


---------47:09----------
really get the sense that you're holding


---------47:11----------
on to a ton of resentment


---------47:13----------
um and that hopefully you've forgiven


---------47:15----------
him or something there may be more to do


---------47:16----------
there because when i asked the question


---------47:18----------
about your dad you're like how long do


---------47:20----------
you have so maybe there's more to


---------47:21----------
explore there but uh maybe that's for a


---------47:22----------
therapist


---------47:24----------
so you came here with some sort of


---------47:25----------
question of okay i'm trying to form


---------47:28----------
relationships with people and it's like


---------47:30----------
hard and then


---------47:32----------
and so here's the challenge is that like


---------47:34----------
you're interested in forming


---------47:35----------
relationships you want you know true


---------47:37----------
friends you had good friends in the past


---------47:39----------
they kind of


---------47:40----------
sloughed off over time


---------47:43----------
and now you're in the world of streamers


---------47:45----------
where like a lot of friendships are


---------47:46----------
transactional so here we are


---------47:48----------
is that fair to say


---------47:51----------
so what do we do about this so first


---------47:53----------
thing that i kind of want to point out


---------47:54----------
to you is that you do seem to have a


---------47:56----------
sort of like fatalistic approach to


---------47:58----------
things and i don't get the sense that


---------48:01----------
you have a what's the grin


---------48:03----------
i just i just like the word fatalistic


---------48:06----------
there we go


---------48:08----------
yeah that's because you know


---------48:11----------
yeah so like you have like kind of a


---------48:13----------
fatalistic attitude right so and what i


---------48:15----------
mean by that is that


---------48:16----------
your ability to exert change on the in


---------48:20----------
the external world that's been written


---------48:22----------
down on my notebook for a while i've


---------48:23----------
just been waiting for the right


---------48:25----------
choice


---------48:26----------
toss it out


---------48:27----------
but like if you just think about how you


---------48:30----------
view this it's sort of like the


---------48:31----------
circumstances are what they are and i


---------48:34----------
don't really know like how to fit into


---------48:36----------
or make this work in this situation


---------48:39----------
yeah that's the approach that i hear


---------48:42----------
i also hear like a sense of being an


---------48:44----------
outsider like you know you're uh you're


---------48:48----------
you're a female streamer on twitch but


---------48:50----------
you're kind of different from the other


---------48:51----------
female streamers on twitch is that fair


---------48:53----------
to say


---------48:55----------
maybe


---------48:57----------
i think there's a i mean there's a lot


---------48:59----------
of women on twitch now which is great so


---------49:02----------
i definitely


---------49:03----------
align with


---------49:04----------
i've got to align with some of them you


---------49:05----------
know absolutely so maybe that's not


---------49:07----------
unique


---------49:09----------
maybe that's a little bit of an


---------49:10----------
incorrect statement or an unfair


---------49:12----------
statement on my part


---------49:13----------
i'm sort of noticing though that there's


---------49:15----------
like a theme of being an outsider right


---------49:17----------
so like that you can't really connect to


---------49:19----------
people that there's a so if i think


---------49:21----------
about you know outsider like literally


---------49:24----------
what determines whether someone is


---------49:26----------
inside or outside


---------49:28----------
what's the dividing line between inside


---------49:30----------
or outside


---------49:33----------
right


---------49:34----------
it's a wall right like it's like


---------49:36----------
literally a wall and we're kind of


---------49:38----------
talking about like sort of like i'm


---------49:40----------
noticing this theme emerge and so this


---------49:42----------
is where you got to be careful right


---------49:44----------
because sometimes like people who are


---------49:46----------
trained like i am in therapy like we


---------49:47----------
love to find connections


---------49:50----------
and we love to be like oh this is the


---------49:51----------
answer i figured it all out i'd say that


---------49:54----------
half the time we're just wrong we just


---------49:56----------
really don't know and it's just all in


---------49:58----------
our head and we love to come up with


---------50:00----------
complicated theories


---------50:01----------
but what i am really noticing with you


---------50:03----------
and is is a strong theme of like not


---------50:05----------
being able to connect with people and


---------50:07----------
that starts with like literally going to


---------50:09----------
a family event and not speaking the


---------50:12----------
language and then recognizing oh like


---------50:15----------
the reason that i can't connect is


---------50:17----------
because my dad didn't teach me korean


---------50:20----------
and so what i'm kind of imagining is


---------50:22----------
like i'm imagining five-year-old anne


---------50:24----------
who's trying to understand how does the


---------50:26----------
world work what are the rules of the


---------50:28----------
game and you correctly conclude that my


---------50:31----------
ability to connect with these people is


---------50:33----------
determined by whether my dad teaches me


---------50:36----------
korean or not is that fair for that


---------50:39----------
five-year-old to conclude


---------50:41----------
i mean yeah partially it wasn't just the


---------50:43----------
language thing but it was also the fact


---------50:45----------
that like


---------50:46----------
i think even as a kid you can sense when


---------50:48----------
adults are like side-eyeing you you know


---------50:51----------
absolutely that's i think a big part of


---------50:54----------
it too


---------50:56----------
yeah so i think that there's like a fear


---------50:58----------
of judgment


---------50:59----------
yeah which is what i'm hearing there


---------51:02----------
which is also like so i'm noticing there


---------51:04----------
are a couple of things which seem to be


---------51:05----------
popping up


---------51:07----------
so the first is that it's kind of like


---------51:10----------
there's nothing you can do about the


---------51:11----------
adults that sideline you right or side


---------51:13----------
eye you like you can't do anything about


---------51:15----------
that so that there's like a sense of of


---------51:17----------
you know actually like a lack of agency


---------51:19----------
is what i'd call it that you don't


---------51:20----------
actually have


---------51:22----------
it's not within


---------51:25----------
you know the scope of what you can


---------51:27----------
control to like change those people


---------51:30----------
right and we sort of hear that thinking


---------51:32----------
which is logical by the way i'm not


---------51:34----------
saying it's incorrect in any way shape


---------51:35----------
or form


---------51:36----------
in terms of like even when i ask you


---------51:37----------
like okay what if you take one step


---------51:39----------
forward


---------51:40----------
and then like you pull back a little bit


---------51:42----------
like what's the alternative you can say


---------51:43----------
like i take one step forward i take two


---------51:45----------
steps forward i take three steps forward


---------51:46----------
they start moving away and i keep


---------51:48----------
chasing after them like that's just dumb


---------51:51----------
right


---------51:52----------
and and once again i'm kind of noticing


---------51:54----------
that that


---------51:55----------
irrespective of what you're doing like


---------51:57----------
what your mind jumps to is like what's


---------51:59----------
the scenario where i can't win despite


---------52:01----------
my efforts


---------52:02----------
do you see that


---------52:04----------
yeah


---------52:05----------
so and i think this is what i refer to


---------52:07----------
as like fatalistic so there's kind of


---------52:09----------
i'm noticing


---------52:11----------
so i'm going to share a concept with you


---------52:12----------
that's that's locus of control


---------52:15----------
so generally speaking when i try to help


---------52:17----------
people solve their problems


---------52:19----------
what i tend to find is that


---------52:21----------
there are two places that they think


---------52:22----------
control comes from one is an internal


---------52:24----------
locus of control one is an external


---------52:27----------
locus of control so for example


---------52:29----------
let's say i apply for a job and i don't


---------52:31----------
get the job people will come to two


---------52:33----------
conclusions they'll say oh i should have


---------52:35----------
prepared better i should have dressed


---------52:37----------
better i could have answered these


---------52:39----------
questions better they'll adopt an


---------52:41----------
internal locus of control where change


---------52:43----------
in the world is controlled by like what


---------52:46----------
by them


---------52:47----------
other people will adopt an external


---------52:49----------
locus of control like oh i didn't get


---------52:50----------
the job because the company is racist i


---------52:54----------
didn't get the job because the manager


---------52:56----------
didn't like me i didn't get the job


---------52:58----------
because of factors outside of i didn't


---------52:59----------
get the job because of the economy


---------53:02----------
right factors outside of them and


---------53:04----------
generally speaking people will do both


---------53:07----------
but in a given issue they'll sort of


---------53:09----------
default to the locus of control being in


---------53:11----------
one place does that make sense yeah


---------53:15----------
and so what i've often times found is


---------53:17----------
the best way to help people is to switch


---------53:19----------
their locus of control because you tend


---------53:21----------
to be doing everything for the locus of


---------53:23----------
control that you think is


---------53:25----------
important right so if someone says oh i


---------53:28----------
didn't get the job because of the


---------53:29----------
economy that may be a factual statement


---------53:31----------
like the economy may suck but it still


---------53:34----------
remains that that company was hiring and


---------53:36----------
they probably hired someone it's just


---------53:37----------
that someone wasn't you


---------53:39----------
so in spite of the world being rigged


---------53:41----------
against you if you switch your locus of


---------53:43----------
control it changes the way that you


---------53:46----------
approach the problem and actually helps


---------53:47----------
those people land the job


---------53:50----------
okay does that make sense


---------53:52----------
yes


---------53:53----------
okay


---------53:54----------
so when it comes to you


---------53:56----------
i think you're right that genuinely


---------53:58----------
speaking it's an uphill battle to make


---------54:00----------
friends with streamers it's a problem


---------54:02----------
that all of y'all face and i think it


---------54:04----------
comes down to what you were kind of


---------54:06----------
saying about the transactional


---------54:07----------
relationship of streaming because you


---------54:10----------
never know like


---------54:12----------
you know


---------54:13----------
what's personal and what's professional


---------54:16----------
in terms of when we hang out like if


---------54:18----------
we're gonna go to dinner is that gonna


---------54:19----------
be posted on instagram and then i'm


---------54:22----------
gonna get you're gonna get likes because


---------54:24----------
oh look ann is going to dinner with like


---------54:26----------
whoever right and then people like oh


---------54:29----------
yay you know


---------54:31----------
every aspect of what like because if i'm


---------54:33----------
friends with someone and i go out to


---------54:35----------
some somewhere and we like take a


---------54:36----------
picture of ourselves and i post it on my


---------54:38----------
instagram there's no there's no


---------54:39----------
professional impact there right right


---------54:42----------
so i'm noticing that that's absolutely


---------54:44----------
true but i do think that you in


---------54:45----------
particular may be like sensitive


---------54:48----------
to the consequences of dual


---------54:50----------
relationships


---------54:51----------
and where i kind of get that from is


---------54:53----------
like


---------54:54----------
your dad hitting you up for cash


---------54:57----------
you know like what do you think about


---------54:59----------
that


---------55:03----------
what do i think about my dad asking me


---------55:04----------
for money yeah


---------55:06----------
um


---------55:11----------
well i i think when it happens


---------55:13----------
or when it happened when i was in


---------55:15----------
college


---------55:19----------
i'm not sure i mean i just i remember


---------55:21----------
trying to figure out you know how much


---------55:23----------
money


---------55:24----------
does he need and like how much am i


---------55:26----------
capable of giving on my you know like


---------55:28----------
college student salary and like paying


---------55:30----------
my rent and everything


---------55:32----------
uh


---------55:34----------
i i honestly i don't remember having


---------55:37----------
very like strong feelings about it


---------55:39----------
but that could just be because of how


---------55:41----------
much time it's been i just don't really


---------55:43----------
remember but whatever it was i don't


---------55:44----------
feel like it left like a super strong


---------55:46----------
impression yeah i don't think it did


---------55:48----------
leave a super strong impression so let


---------55:49----------
me ask you a question slightly


---------55:51----------
differently what impact do you think it


---------55:54----------
has on a father father-daughter


---------55:55----------
relationship if a father asks a daughter


---------55:57----------
for money


---------56:00----------
uh well i mean


---------56:04----------
i i


---------56:05----------
i never really


---------56:06----------
have felt like my dad


---------56:08----------
and i i mean we've never had a very


---------56:10----------
close relationship you know we've never


---------56:11----------
been like a


---------56:12----------
father-daughter you know he kind of


---------56:14----------
feels like


---------56:15----------
this older


---------56:16----------
male stranger you know


---------56:18----------
um and it's like i know i'm related to


---------56:20----------
him and i know he's my dad but


---------56:22----------
he's still kind of


---------56:25----------
i mean he's he's not my father really


---------56:28----------
sure so let me ask you a question in a


---------56:30----------
different way


---------56:31----------
right so


---------56:32----------
if an older male stranger hit you up for


---------56:34----------
cash would you give it to him


---------56:38----------
uh


---------56:39----------
i mean a stranger no but because he's my


---------56:41----------
dad i did


---------56:43----------
right so like


---------56:44----------
that's


---------56:46----------
i don't know how to say this but exactly


---------56:48----------
right so here you are not really having


---------56:51----------
a father-daughter relationship


---------56:55----------
but like you're giving him money because


---------56:57----------
he's your dad


---------56:59----------
right right so like that feels very like


---------57:02----------
muddy in terms of like what the


---------57:04----------
relationship is


---------57:07----------
does that make sense


---------57:08----------
right i mean yeah like one of us is


---------57:10----------
supposed to be


---------57:11----------
more of an adult than the other well i


---------57:13----------
mean i i know it sounds kind of weird


---------57:15----------
but let's let's change things up a


---------57:16----------
little bit how would you feel giving


---------57:18----------
your mom money


---------57:20----------
no problem exactly because she's


---------57:22----------
actually your mom


---------57:24----------
right


---------57:24----------
right so it's kind of interesting


---------57:26----------
because


---------57:27----------
on the one hand sure the adult is


---------57:29----------
supposed to be the the adult but at the


---------57:31----------
same time like family comes first and


---------57:33----------
they're actually scenarios where you


---------57:35----------
know kids help parents out financially


---------57:37----------
all the time like i help my mom out like


---------57:39----------
every week


---------57:40----------
and and that's fine because i'm grown up


---------57:42----------
now and she took care of me and i took


---------57:44----------
care of her and like it's kind of weird


---------57:45----------
but but it was sort of like almost like


---------57:47----------
a trick question in a sense because


---------57:49----------
there's sort of like a right answer


---------57:50----------
which is that adults aren't supposed to


---------57:52----------
hit up their kids for money but what i'm


---------57:54----------
kind of noticing is that like


---------57:56----------
you know


---------57:57----------
there's like a dual relationship there


---------57:59----------
it's kind of weird like it's it feels


---------58:01----------
kind of transactional to me it feels


---------58:02----------
like he's not really playing the part of


---------58:04----------
your dad but you're giving like he's


---------58:06----------
getting the benefits of sort of like


---------58:07----------
being your dad


---------58:09----------
right


---------58:10----------
i don't think that the goal here is to


---------58:11----------
dig into your relationship with your dad


---------58:13----------
the reason i'm highlighting this is


---------58:15----------
because i think it


---------58:16----------
when you have someone who grows up in


---------58:18----------
this sort of situation


---------58:20----------
it shapes and informs the way that they


---------58:23----------
view relationships


---------58:25----------
i see okay


---------58:27----------
how do you feel with some of the


---------58:29----------
questions that i'm asking you right now


---------58:32----------
uh


---------58:33----------
[Music]


---------58:34----------
i mean i feel fine i'm i'm


---------58:38----------
like just processing what you're saying


---------58:39----------
i i haven't really thought about any of


---------58:41----------
that for a while like i said it's many


---------58:43----------
years in the past and so i don't like


---------58:45----------
think about it on a daily basis sure but


---------58:46----------
it makes sense to me that that um


---------58:49----------
like you said kind of informs the way


---------58:50----------
that i


---------58:51----------
view relationships and the way that i


---------58:53----------
try to


---------58:54----------
make friends with people


---------58:56----------
yeah so i and i think that like one of


---------58:59----------
the most so the i've noticed this


---------59:01----------
pattern where


---------59:04----------
when when people grow up with like some


---------59:06----------
of these kinds of relationships and i


---------59:08----------
know in a sense you didn't really grow


---------59:09----------
up with a relationship with your dad i'm


---------59:10----------
not saying it's all like daddy issues


---------59:13----------
but that i'm kind of noticing that there


---------59:15----------
have been multiple times


---------59:17----------
throughout your life where


---------59:19----------
you felt like an outsider right in


---------59:21----------
marching band or in college like you are


---------59:24----------
never like the tier one friend there's


---------59:26----------
like the tier one friends and they're


---------59:27----------
like the tier two friends it's like if


---------59:29----------
we're going to party queue and we've got


---------59:30----------
five spots


---------59:32----------
i'm going to ask these four people first


---------59:34----------
and if none of them are available here's


---------59:36----------
the invite and you want to play some you


---------59:38----------
want to play some cs go


---------59:40----------
right


---------59:41----------
and you're why are you smiling now


---------59:44----------
because that is how it feels yeah it's


---------59:46----------
like we've got four spots and


---------59:49----------
uh


---------59:50----------
i mean


---------59:51----------
ant's available i guess you know like


---------59:53----------
it's not like i'm the first person that


---------59:54----------
people are like let's invite anne and i


---------59:56----------
i have like i would say i have


---------59:58----------
probably a couple friends that i would


---------60:01----------
be their first choice um


---------60:03----------
and i appreciate


---------60:05----------
that and i appreciate them um


---------60:08----------
and i think it's just like my my kind of


---------60:10----------
search for more of that right i want to


---------60:12----------
be


---------60:13----------
closer with more people but i definitely


---------60:16----------
feel like


---------60:17----------
the


---------60:18----------
not one of the first


---------60:20----------
choices


---------60:21----------
so my point is that when i hear that


---------60:25----------
feeling


---------60:27----------
that you're sort of experiencing i'm


---------60:28----------
actually hearing that it pre-dates


---------60:30----------
streaming


---------60:31----------
so this is where locus of control


---------60:33----------
becomes important because if you


---------60:35----------
diagnose this problem is exclusively a


---------60:38----------
stream or problem


---------60:39----------
then your sol


---------60:41----------
because you can't change the streaming


---------60:43----------
world but what i'm sort of noticing is


---------60:45----------
that this actually pre-dates streaming


---------60:48----------
that you've learned how to be protective


---------60:51----------
of yourself


---------60:52----------
and even erect a wall because i'm


---------60:54----------
guessing that when you sort of figured


---------60:56----------
out that they weren't


---------60:59----------
you weren't the first person that they


---------61:00----------
thought of to invite to study


---------61:03----------
you didn't chase them very far


---------61:07----------
what do you think about that


---------61:09----------
that's i mean yeah that sounds accurate


---------61:11----------
right and the reason you didn't chase


---------61:13----------
them is because it hurts


---------61:16----------
it hurts to like


---------61:17----------
want something from someone


---------61:20----------
and


---------61:21----------
them not give it to you


---------61:23----------
so there's an easy way to protect


---------61:25----------
yourself from that hurt which is don't


---------61:27----------
want it from them


---------61:28----------
right don't chase him in the first place


---------61:30----------
and if you want to get like if you want


---------61:31----------
to get super classic about it you could


---------61:34----------
say that this is all starts with your


---------61:36----------
dad


---------61:37----------
and that you may have made overtures


---------61:38----------
with him and like he didn't like meet


---------61:40----------
you halfway you saw him two or three


---------61:42----------
times a year so you learned early on to


---------61:45----------
be like i'm not gonna get anything there


---------61:48----------
and so you've normalized this is the


---------61:50----------
other thing that i see i see that you've


---------61:52----------
normalized a lot of like what seems like


---------61:54----------
painful stuff


---------61:55----------
so it doesn't feel painful anymore like


---------61:58----------
when everyone else on the internet


---------61:59----------
thinks that what you go through is


---------62:01----------
terrible and you are a hero for standing


---------62:04----------
up to injustice and you're like it's my


---------62:06----------
everyday that's [ __ ] sad


---------62:10----------
yeah


---------62:12----------
how does it feel to hear me say that


---------62:15----------
uh


---------62:17----------
again that feels very accurate i think i


---------62:19----------
do that a lot and i actually just talked


---------62:21----------
with my partner about that recently


---------62:23----------
where i i think i take


---------62:25----------
emotions and i put them into a box and


---------62:27----------
then i put that box away and then


---------62:29----------
i just don't bother with it again so yep


---------62:33----------
i don't know if this is this is probably


---------62:35----------
the poorest prediction i'll ever make on


---------62:37----------
stream


---------62:38----------
but i i gotta wonder whether your choice


---------62:40----------
to wear a salmon shirt has to do with


---------62:42----------
the way that you're feeling on a


---------62:43----------
particular day


---------62:45----------
whether the emotions are in the box or


---------62:47----------
not in the box


---------62:50----------
yeah


---------62:51----------
i have no idea


---------62:53----------
but i i gotta wonder


---------62:56----------
and so i


---------62:57----------
i don't know how else to say the sand


---------62:58----------
but i think if you wanna form


---------63:00----------
connections with people


---------63:04----------
you ha


---------63:06----------
so the last point that i'll sort of say


---------63:08----------
is i think a lot of the wall is being


---------63:10----------
understood


---------63:12----------
and that i think that you have like an


---------63:14----------
internal experience of the world that


---------63:16----------
you don't advertise to the outside world


---------63:20----------
like what do you think about that


---------63:23----------
yeah i mean i've always been even


---------63:27----------
even with streaming and before streaming


---------63:28----------
i would say i'm like a pretty


---------63:30----------
private person um


---------63:33----------
and definitely like


---------63:36----------
i don't know if it was that i


---------63:39----------
learned to be


---------63:41----------
learned to operate solo


---------63:44----------
because of what we're talking about or


---------63:46----------
if i like have always been like that you


---------63:48----------
know it's like chicken and egg i don't


---------63:49----------
know which one came first


---------63:51----------
but i have kind of always operated on my


---------63:54----------
own


---------63:55----------
so here's how i would understand that so


---------63:57----------
i think that generally speaking the


---------63:59----------
brain uses the tool that works the best


---------64:01----------
and then that tool improves with


---------64:03----------
practice


---------64:05----------
so what we tend to find in people is


---------64:07----------
that when they have a strength


---------64:09----------
that's what they default to to get them


---------64:10----------
through difficult situations which then


---------64:13----------
in turn in turn improves that strength


---------64:16----------
makes it adaptable so like emotional


---------64:18----------
suppression putting up walls


---------64:21----------
and like putting your emotions in a box


---------64:24----------
or like absolutely adaptations


---------64:27----------
um the the challenge is that over time


---------64:30----------
they can become maladaptive because now


---------64:32----------
what's happened is like you're a


---------64:34----------
one-trick pony like i'm a s i i'm a


---------64:37----------
spawn camping sniper rifling noob right


---------64:41----------
and and you get to that way because like


---------64:43----------
that's what let you in


---------64:45----------
and then


---------64:46----------
at the same time though like you don't


---------64:48----------
know how to use like an smg or like


---------64:49----------
whatever as a result


---------64:51----------
so i i think what what i'm really


---------64:53----------
hearing is that you probably had you


---------64:54----------
have a natural tendency to be like kind


---------64:56----------
of closed off right


---------64:58----------
and that that worked well for you and so


---------65:00----------
you like got better and better at it you


---------65:02----------
leveled it up and leveled it up and


---------65:03----------
leveled it up and then you kind of find


---------65:05----------
yourself in this weird situation where


---------65:06----------
it's kind of like hard to connect with


---------65:08----------
people


---------65:09----------
yeah


---------65:11----------
so then the question becomes


---------65:13----------
what do you do about it


---------65:15----------
what do you think


---------65:18----------
uh


---------65:21----------
well i would guess


---------65:23----------
if we go back to the analogy of taking a


---------65:25----------
step towards someone um


---------65:28----------
don't take the step back and to just


---------65:30----------
keep


---------65:31----------
trying i guess


---------65:34----------
yeah how do you think that's gonna work


---------65:37----------
i'm gonna annoy someone into telling me


---------65:39----------
to [ __ ] off probably or or maybe it'll


---------65:42----------
work out i don't know


---------65:43----------
okay so very good so like in a sense so


---------65:46----------
here's the key thing i think you're


---------65:47----------
missing it's not about the action it's


---------65:49----------
about the worry so when you take a step


---------65:51----------
forward what happens in your mind


---------65:55----------
uh


---------65:57----------
i think like okay i tried and now we see


---------66:00----------
what they do


---------66:01----------
and then if they don't do anything i'm


---------66:02----------
like okay goodbye


---------66:04----------
so at that point


---------66:06----------
is when i have to be like i'll try again


---------66:08----------
right


---------66:09----------
yeah so like i even you even said it you


---------66:12----------
said it beautifully because you're like


---------66:13----------
after you take a step forward what


---------66:14----------
happens then you said well either they


---------66:16----------
get annoyed with me and tell me to they


---------66:18----------
get so annoyed with me until


---------66:20----------
until they tell me to [ __ ] off which


---------66:22----------
like think about that for a second okay


---------66:24----------
so out of all of the possibilities of


---------66:27----------
what the reactions are


---------66:28----------
what is the one that you default to


---------66:32----------
it's kind of an overreaction they


---------66:34----------
probably would just ignore me i guess


---------66:36----------
but but why do you default there like do


---------66:38----------
you see what your mind is predicting is


---------66:40----------
the responses to taking this step


---------66:42----------
forward


---------66:43----------
yeah


---------66:45----------
it's like why the hell does your mind


---------66:46----------
default to they get annoyed with me so


---------66:48----------
annoyed with me that they tell me to


---------66:49----------
[ __ ] off like why is that the


---------66:51----------
default response


---------66:54----------
yeah or they ignore me and it's you're


---------66:56----------
not dumb for having that default


---------66:58----------
response like there's a damn good reason


---------67:00----------
why your mind comes up with an answer so


---------67:03----------
if i ask you what kind of games you play


---------67:06----------
your mind comes up with fps why does


---------67:07----------
your mind say fps it's because it's like


---------67:09----------
what you play it's been your experience


---------67:11----------
it's what you do it's what the how the


---------67:12----------
world works what color is your hair it's


---------67:14----------
blackish


---------67:16----------
dark gray


---------67:19----------
you know so so your mind generates


---------67:21----------
things


---------67:23----------
that


---------67:24----------
are based on your experience and i think


---------67:26----------
the real tricky thing here is that


---------67:28----------
you know when you take a step forward


---------67:30----------
towards someone your mind is worried


---------67:32----------
about their response that's what's


---------67:34----------
actually preventing you


---------67:36----------
that's the wall


---------67:37----------
because if you're worried about how


---------67:39----------
they're they're gonna respond what are


---------67:40----------
you gonna do how does that worry shape


---------67:42----------
you it's not a rhetorical question i'm


---------67:44----------
curious like what do you what do you do


---------67:47----------
when i'm worried about people not


---------67:48----------
responding to me yeah or finding you


---------67:51----------
annoying and telling you to go away


---------67:53----------
uh


---------67:57----------
i i i think that just i mean encourages


---------68:00----------
me to


---------68:03----------
not try


---------68:05----------
like you said it's like i've kind of


---------68:07----------
learned how to deal with my worry in


---------68:10----------
this one way and so


---------68:12----------
i just keep building up that same


---------68:15----------
skill essentially right


---------68:16----------
so i think it's kind of tricky because


---------68:18----------
now now what we get is sort of like a


---------68:20----------
personal


---------68:22----------
tendency that is particularly poorly


---------68:26----------
suited for your social environment


---------68:29----------
because at the end of the day streamers


---------68:31----------
are [ __ ] flaky


---------68:33----------
and so when you have someone who's


---------68:34----------
worried about chasing after people and


---------68:36----------
annoying them which by the way i would


---------68:38----------
bet money there's a story somewhere


---------68:40----------
there about like


---------68:42----------
you're like hey can you guys invite me


---------68:43----------
to study next time and they were like


---------68:45----------
sure and then they didn't do it and then


---------68:47----------
like


---------68:48----------
like you i think you've made overtures


---------68:50----------
in the past and they didn't work out for


---------68:52----------
you


---------68:52----------
right


---------68:53----------
um or romantic relationships is another


---------68:56----------
place that you can kind of explore that


---------68:57----------
or parental anyway so i i don't think


---------69:00----------
that you're


---------69:01----------
and you sound very competent capable and


---------69:04----------
introspective to me and i think you've


---------69:05----------
learned


---------69:06----------
how to manage this stuff for a reason


---------69:09----------
so i think like when you take a step


---------69:11----------
forward towards someone and your mind


---------69:12----------
worries it actually causes you as you


---------69:14----------
said to pull back there's not actually a


---------69:16----------
wall


---------69:17----------
it ends up looking like a wall and


---------69:19----------
feeling like a wall but it isn't a wall


---------69:22----------
and i would even go as far as to say


---------69:24----------
that there are opportunities for you to


---------69:26----------
connect to other people but it's your


---------69:27----------
concern about how they're they're gonna


---------69:29----------
respond that causes you to like slow


---------69:32----------
play it right like you're one of these


---------69:33----------
people that


---------69:35----------
if you get to the highest tier if you


---------69:37----------
grind


---------69:38----------
rep


---------69:39----------
with the faction of ammunition


---------69:42----------
and you ever get to the grand master


---------69:44----------
tear you are friends for life


---------69:46----------
people like your mom and your brother


---------69:47----------
and sister but grinding up until that


---------69:50----------
way is like really hard


---------69:52----------
yeah because i suspect that you pull


---------69:54----------
back from people or even don't let


---------69:56----------
people in


---------69:58----------
yeah


---------69:59----------
what do you think


---------70:01----------
yeah i think that


---------70:03----------
i think i've always thought of it as a


---------70:05----------
wall and the way you're describing it i


---------70:07----------
feel like it's more like a like i'm


---------70:09----------
attached to a bungee cord that like ex


---------70:12----------
extends to a certain point and then


---------70:14----------
snaps back like straight away and


---------70:16----------
beautiful image because here's what i'd


---------70:18----------
ask you


---------70:20----------
if you take three or four steps towards


---------70:22----------
someone how quickly do you retreat when


---------70:24----------
they don't meet you


---------70:25----------
where you're at


---------70:28----------
quickly yeah very quickly right just


---------70:30----------
like a bungee cord the deeper into


---------70:32----------
unknown territory you go the harder it


---------70:34----------
is and the quicker you are to pull back


---------70:37----------
and so now we get to like this idea of


---------70:39----------
connection


---------70:40----------
so it may be things like you you know


---------70:42----------
i'm not saying that you should like


---------70:44----------
hammer paying people to play games with


---------70:46----------
you on a daily basis right because


---------70:47----------
that's [ __ ] annoying but i also


---------70:49----------
suspect that when you do have some of


---------70:51----------
these interactions


---------70:53----------
that there are moments where you can be


---------70:56----------
more like emotionally vulnerable with


---------70:58----------
them or emotionally connected with them


---------71:00----------
and that you're kind of concerned about


---------71:02----------
like how they're gonna respond


---------71:05----------
what do you think about that


---------71:10----------
about


---------71:11----------
like telling people yeah directly that


---------71:13----------
that's how i feel


---------71:14----------
yeah like like i think that there are


---------71:15----------
times where you'll feel a particular way


---------71:17----------
but you


---------71:19----------
you know


---------71:20----------
your like brain is going to be like you


---------71:21----------
don't want to be too much for them


---------71:23----------
yeah does that tell you those kinds of


---------71:25----------
thoughts


---------71:28----------
yeah like i mean i said a couple times


---------71:30----------
at the beginning that i don't want to be


---------71:31----------
overbearing and i know like i know that


---------71:33----------
people are busy um and there's plenty of


---------71:35----------
times that i've like gotten a message


---------71:37----------
from someone and i i


---------71:39----------
take a couple days to respond or


---------71:40----------
something


---------71:41----------
um so i completely understand the


---------71:44----------
you know the schedule it's just


---------71:47----------
um


---------71:49----------
i don't know it's i think it's like a


---------71:51----------
thing where i see a lot of other


---------71:52----------
streamers is like the cool kids and


---------71:55----------
i'm not the cool kid


---------71:57----------
at least you know that's how i see


---------71:58----------
myself and so i don't want to be


---------72:00----------
i don't i just want to bother people


---------72:05----------
what do you think about


---------72:13----------
this is hard


---------72:22----------
why do you think you're bothering people


---------72:27----------
um


---------72:29----------
because


---------72:30----------
they're


---------72:31----------
busy


---------72:33----------
with


---------72:34----------
all their other


---------72:35----------
like things that they're doing in their


---------72:36----------
lives like streamers are very busy


---------72:38----------
um


---------72:41----------
and


---------72:43----------
okay i said that i feel like uh


---------72:49----------
if i if i try to like make friends with


---------72:51----------
people who


---------72:54----------
are like also happen to be streamers um


---------72:56----------
and let's say we start to kind of become


---------72:58----------
friends uh


---------73:01----------
and then if i


---------73:03----------
if i see


---------73:04----------
with regularity then i'm not being


---------73:06----------
invited to do stuff then to me i


---------73:08----------
translate that as


---------73:10----------
they


---------73:11----------
are being polite but they don't actually


---------73:13----------
want to like play play games with me or


---------73:15----------
like be friends with me they're just


---------73:16----------
being polite because


---------73:19----------
like if you want to be friends with


---------73:20----------
someone you


---------73:21----------
invite them to play games or you invite


---------73:22----------
them to hang out and so i i i translate


---------73:25----------
that as like if you're if you're not


---------73:28----------
like if i invite you to do something and


---------73:29----------
you decline because you have something


---------73:31----------
else going on or whatever and then you


---------73:33----------
don't ask me to do stuff then it's kind


---------73:35----------
of like


---------73:36----------
i feel like it's they're trying to


---------73:38----------
reject you but nicely you know


---------73:40----------
sure so for me i'm like i'm gonna take


---------73:41----------
the hint and just leave you alone


---------73:44----------
yeah


---------73:46----------
okay so and i'm gonna try


---------73:49----------
now we get into the territory that i'm


---------73:51----------
the worst at but i'm gonna give it a


---------73:52----------
shot okay okay so now what i'd like to


---------73:55----------
do is actually be very very concrete


---------73:57----------
with you and see if we can actually


---------74:00----------
adjust some of the way that you


---------74:02----------
communicate with people i don't know if


---------74:03----------
this is actually going to work or not


---------74:05----------
all right so you got to take this with


---------74:06----------
so here's the challenge


---------74:09----------
so if you reach out to someone and they


---------74:11----------
don't respond back and then you reach


---------74:13----------
out to them and they don't respond back


---------74:15----------
you don't want to reach out to them a


---------74:16----------
third time you're like i get the hint


---------74:18----------
i'm taking the hand right i'm not going


---------74:20----------
to force you into telling me that you


---------74:22----------
don't want to hang out with me right


---------74:24----------
right


---------74:25----------
so that makes sense and i think is not


---------74:29----------
an effective style of communicating to


---------74:31----------
build relationships


---------74:33----------
right


---------74:34----------
so


---------74:35----------
here's a question for example that i'll


---------74:37----------
ask people when


---------74:39----------
so i have a i have a


---------74:41----------
friend of mine so i sometimes play d d


---------74:44----------
and sometimes do other things like i


---------74:45----------
watch esports tournaments and stuff like


---------74:47----------
that and i've got like my group of nerd


---------74:48----------
friends right so we like get together on


---------74:50----------
occasion and we'll like we'll play d d


---------74:52----------
or we'll like watch esports stuff or


---------74:54----------
whatever and then there's some people at


---------74:56----------
the fringe of the group


---------74:57----------
that i have a relationship with them and


---------75:00----------
then like i'll invite them to the stuff


---------75:01----------
and they always turn me down


---------75:03----------
so i don't know what the deal is but


---------75:05----------
sometimes what i found is actually


---------75:07----------
really really useful is like a specific


---------75:09----------
question which is hey i've i've noticed


---------75:11----------
that you know i've invited you a couple


---------75:13----------
of times it seems like you've been busy


---------75:14----------
no big deal i was just curious do you


---------75:16----------
want me to invite you in the future


---------75:20----------
like being a little bit explicit instead


---------75:22----------
of inferring into their communication


---------75:24----------
because for them to not respond to you


---------75:26----------
there's like a differential diagnosis


---------75:27----------
there are all these kinds of reasons one


---------75:29----------
is that i'm not really too interested in


---------75:30----------
ann


---------75:31----------
she's my second choice in terms of


---------75:33----------
hanging out with so i would say yes


---------75:36----------
if i had no one else better to hang out


---------75:37----------
with you know there's like that whole


---------75:39----------
line of thinking which you've got to be


---------75:40----------
careful about and i think that


---------75:42----------
experience of yours actually shapes the


---------75:44----------
way that you interpret their response


---------75:48----------
which is that oh i don't want to bother


---------75:49----------
them which is kind of weird because if


---------75:51----------
you're bothering someone it implies to


---------75:53----------
me like a sense of like lower value in


---------75:56----------
you


---------75:57----------
does that make sense


---------75:59----------
yeah and i've i've actually done that


---------76:01----------
before with someone where i've said like


---------76:03----------
uh


---------76:05----------
like thank you for inviting me all the


---------76:06----------
time and i genuinely have just had


---------76:08----------
schedule conflicts the past couple of


---------76:10----------
times but i do want to hang out with you


---------76:11----------
so like please keep inviting me so like


---------76:13----------
i've said that to other people before


---------76:15----------
and how did that work for you


---------76:17----------
good yeah i mean they were like okay


---------76:20----------
we'll just keep inviting you even if


---------76:21----------
you're


---------76:22----------
you know busy a lot of the time yeah so


---------76:24----------
i think that's that's a beautiful


---------76:25----------
example right so like it's so


---------76:27----------
considerate when you let people know hey


---------76:29----------
it's not that i like don't want to hang


---------76:31----------
out with you it's like genuinely like


---------76:32----------
life is busy right now


---------76:34----------
yeah so


---------76:35----------
and and i think that's like a very good


---------76:37----------
thing for you to do so i'd say like


---------76:39----------
let's kind of take a step back and let


---------76:41----------
me think through this for a second so


---------76:42----------
first is to acknowledge that you know if


---------76:44----------
you're barking up the tree that is a


---------76:47----------
streamer for friendship i think it's


---------76:49----------
gonna like you've got the deck stacked


---------76:51----------
against you so mentally like you have to


---------76:52----------
prepare yourself for a higher amount of


---------76:55----------
rejection than normal or higher amount


---------76:57----------
of radio silence i think is probably


---------76:58----------
what it's really going to be which radio


---------77:00----------
silence can be deafening and hard to


---------77:02----------
deal with and sometimes even harder than


---------77:03----------
rejection


---------77:04----------
the problem with radio silence is that


---------77:06----------
we as human beings and social


---------77:08----------
relationships when we experience radio


---------77:10----------
silence we


---------77:12----------
project our prior experiences to


---------77:14----------
interpret that radio silence


---------77:16----------
does that make sense yeah so i think


---------77:18----------
that any time you get a neutral response


---------77:20----------
for from someone you're gonna they're


---------77:23----------
gonna fill it in with like


---------77:26----------
whatever their insecurities are


---------77:30----------
um


---------77:31----------
so just be aware of that first of all


---------77:33----------
secondly i would also consider being a


---------77:35----------
little bit more explicit in your


---------77:36----------
communication to like play games and


---------77:38----------
hang out because i think there are i


---------77:40----------
don't know how this is going to work by


---------77:41----------
the way so you got to take this with a


---------77:42----------
grain of salt um but i i would say like


---------77:45----------
you know if you want to hang out with a


---------77:47----------
streamer and you're actually like want


---------77:48----------
to be friends be a little bit explicit


---------77:51----------
that hey like do like


---------77:52----------
you know i really i think you're a cool


---------77:54----------
person i'd love to hang out


---------77:56----------
i'm not interested in like collabing or


---------77:58----------
anything like that i just you know


---------78:00----------
looking to make friends


---------78:02----------
what do you think about saying something


---------78:03----------
like that


---------78:06----------
um


---------78:09----------
yeah i guess it depends on


---------78:11----------
like how i feel like the relationship


---------78:13----------
already is with someone because i


---------78:15----------
wouldn't of course you would i don't


---------78:16----------
think it you wouldn't want to do that


---------78:17----------
with just like some random person that


---------78:18----------
that's like the first time you're trying


---------78:20----------
to talk to them right you know but it's


---------78:21----------
just after like


---------78:22----------
trying to establish something with


---------78:24----------
someone it's just it's really hard when


---------78:26----------
you're just like i don't really care


---------78:27----------
about collabing but the only time


---------78:29----------
that


---------78:31----------
we can like hang out would be on stream


---------78:34----------
so it's like kind of


---------78:35----------
is a collab you know


---------78:37----------
um


---------78:38----------
so i feel like that's also one of the


---------78:40----------
things that is tough because it's


---------78:43----------
uh


---------78:44----------
like you can't hang out with people in


---------78:46----------
person very easily um


---------78:49----------
either so


---------78:51----------
that's a good point so that's why i'm


---------78:52----------
saying like i don't really know if some


---------78:54----------
of the suggestions i'm going to make


---------78:55----------
make are going to land or not


---------78:57----------
but i think the main goal anne is to


---------78:59----------
clarify the dual relationship


---------79:02----------
so like you know when you're engaging


---------79:03----------
with someone to be as is explicit i


---------79:05----------
don't know what this practically looks


---------79:06----------
like but try to be explicit with them


---------79:09----------
about what you're looking for from the


---------79:11----------
relationship


---------79:13----------
you know there's a certain amount of


---------79:14----------
like let's talk about romantic


---------79:16----------
relationships for example like there's a


---------79:18----------
certain amount of flirtation and


---------79:21----------
you know not leaving things unsaid that


---------79:23----------
can make things kind of exciting but at


---------79:25----------
the end of the day the successful


---------79:26----------
relationships are the ones that like


---------79:28----------
where people usually at some point


---------79:30----------
explicitly make their intentions known


---------79:32----------
and the relationships that get confusing


---------79:34----------
and messed up are the ones where people


---------79:36----------
are like ambiguous and


---------79:38----------
you know half-assing it and like not


---------79:40----------
sure what they want


---------79:41----------
so i i don't know what do you think that


---------79:43----------
would look like in terms of the kinds of


---------79:45----------
friendships that you want to pursue


---------79:51----------
uh i'm not sure how to answer that i


---------79:53----------
guess


---------79:54----------
neither am i so i think this is a


---------79:56----------
problem that actually all streamers are


---------79:58----------
facing right now


---------79:59----------
is that they don't i haven't heard


---------80:01----------
anyone really like talk about figuring


---------80:03----------
out how to determine with a stream or


---------80:06----------
relationship like how to draw the


---------80:08----------
boundaries and set expectations about


---------80:10----------
what people are looking for from the


---------80:11----------
relationship


---------80:13----------
yeah so i think that's a genuine


---------80:15----------
challenge with your situation and one


---------80:18----------
that you can't affect what streamers do


---------80:20----------
but i do wonder a little bit about


---------80:22----------
whether you can adjust your language to


---------80:24----------
somehow compensate for like the


---------80:26----------
circumstances


---------80:29----------
yeah


---------80:31----------
um but i i think if there isn't a clear


---------80:33----------
way to engage with streamers i'm just


---------80:36----------
not sure


---------80:37----------
this i'd say then what you should really


---------80:39----------
focus on is your internal sense of worry


---------80:42----------
when you start engaging in a


---------80:44----------
relationship and be a little bit careful


---------80:46----------
about letting that dictate when you pull


---------80:49----------
back


---------80:51----------
yeah


---------80:53----------
yeah i agree i think it's


---------80:56----------
it's like an internal thing that i have


---------80:58----------
to kind of overcome that i


---------81:01----------
i cut the cord pretty quickly when i


---------81:03----------
feel like


---------81:05----------
i'm not sure if i'm gonna be annoying


---------81:08----------
people or or whatever


---------81:10----------
and


---------81:13----------
so yeah i think the challenge for me is


---------81:15----------
going to be just not


---------81:17----------
immediately cutting and running


---------81:21----------
yep


---------81:22----------
i think i think spot on so very


---------81:25----------
practically like what that's going to


---------81:26----------
look like in is you're going to do one


---------81:28----------
or two things and then there's going to


---------81:30----------
be a voice in your head that's going to


---------81:32----------
tell you hey these people think i'm


---------81:34----------
annoying


---------81:35----------
you can still you're still allowed to


---------81:37----------
cut the cord if you want to


---------81:39----------
but just be aware that you're doing it


---------81:41----------
and say to yourself like


---------81:43----------
in this moment i'm actually like this


---------81:46----------
just feels too uncomfortable for me and


---------81:48----------
i just don't want to take this chance


---------81:50----------
i'd rather not be friends at all than


---------81:53----------
take the chance that i'm annoying them


---------81:56----------
yeah


---------81:57----------
um


---------81:58----------
yeah oh i'm sorry i was just gonna say


---------82:00----------
that at least then it's like um


---------82:02----------
you have a i guess more of like a finite


---------82:05----------
answer rather than just being like


---------82:08----------
i don't know i don't know what happened


---------82:09----------
and i just made this up maybe how how do


---------82:12----------
you have a finite answer


---------82:14----------
i i meant like if you try to talk to


---------82:16----------
someone and you're more explicit about


---------82:17----------
kind of what you're


---------82:19----------
hoping to achieve and they i mean


---------82:22----------
i i mean i when you talk about it it's


---------82:24----------
like i have a hard time imagining


---------82:26----------
someone just being like


---------82:28----------
don't talk to me again you know but like


---------82:30----------
imagine if there was some equivalent of


---------82:32----------
of that where they're just like no


---------82:33----------
that's cool like i don't really want to


---------82:35----------
be friends or something like that um


---------82:38----------
so


---------82:40----------
very good yeah yeah no so


---------82:43----------
the the cool thing actually and this is


---------82:45----------
kind of bizarre but the really cool


---------82:47----------
thing is that human beings are evolving


---------82:49----------
to say that


---------82:51----------
so people didn't used to say that but


---------82:53----------
now like i've seen this sometimes like


---------82:55----------
people will post on like you know tinder


---------82:57----------
screenshots and stuff where people will


---------82:59----------
actually say like hey i'm you know i


---------83:01----------
think you're a wonderful person i just


---------83:02----------
didn't feel a spark and i'm not


---------83:04----------
interested in seeing you again that


---------83:07----------
that kind of communication is becoming


---------83:09----------
more common because of the nature of


---------83:11----------
human interactions has never required


---------83:13----------
that before


---------83:14----------
now it does and i think the interesting


---------83:17----------
thing is that even if someone told you


---------83:19----------
that hey i'm not interested in pursuing


---------83:21----------
a friendship with you i think you would


---------83:23----------
feel okay with that i think you would


---------83:25----------
actually like it like you'd be fine with


---------83:27----------
that it may hurt a little bit but the


---------83:29----------
closure and the simplicity of it i think


---------83:31----------
can be very like therapeutic


---------83:33----------
yeah


---------83:34----------
yeah i agree


---------83:36----------
so and the last thing that i'd say is


---------83:37----------
that you know just just look a as i can


---------83:40----------
i don't know how else to say that any


---------83:42----------
experience with meditation by the way


---------83:44----------
uh no


---------83:45----------
okay


---------83:46----------
so um i can maybe try to teach you


---------83:48----------
something in a little bit but


---------83:50----------
you know i would say that this thing is


---------83:52----------
gonna like arise in your mind i don't


---------83:54----------
know how else to put that does that make


---------83:56----------
sense to you


---------83:59----------
um


---------84:00----------
no okay so i want you to imagine this


---------84:03----------
people find me annoying


---------84:06----------
you remember the days of pop-up ads


---------84:09----------
it's gonna be like a pop-up ad like


---------84:11----------
you're going about your business you're


---------84:12----------
doing your thing you're browsing the web


---------84:14----------
you know looking at 4chan or whatever


---------84:17----------
and then like there are going to be


---------84:18----------
particular circumstances


---------84:20----------
in which


---------84:22----------
this thing is going to pop up in your


---------84:23----------
head and you're going to feel like


---------84:25----------
you're annoying someone you're going to


---------84:26----------
feel like the


---------84:28----------
outsider and i want you to just really


---------84:31----------
prepare for that pop-up ad and just


---------84:33----------
remember that just like a pop-up ad


---------84:36----------
just because there's something on your


---------84:37----------
screen that's telling you


---------84:39----------
that there are hot singles in your area


---------84:41----------
and you can take this this pill for


---------84:44----------
penis enlargement doesn't actually make


---------84:46----------
it real right that's coming from the


---------84:48----------
pop-up ad it's not actually coming from


---------84:51----------
like


---------84:51----------
reality


---------84:53----------
right


---------84:54----------
right and so the really confusing thing


---------84:56----------
about our human psychology is that our


---------84:58----------
mind tells us things that are based on


---------85:02----------
like our experience which is sort of


---------85:04----------
like our cookie history


---------85:05----------
right and so like that then we get


---------85:08----------
targeted with the kinds of things that


---------85:09----------
pop up but that's just based on our


---------85:12----------
history of what we've been browsing on


---------85:13----------
the internet


---------85:14----------
i remember one of my friends worked at


---------85:16----------
it and he was he was he worked at it in


---------85:18----------
it at a university and he was saying


---------85:20----------
that like you know like one of the


---------85:22----------
professors complained that like they


---------85:23----------
were getting all these like ads for like


---------85:26----------
gay pornography


---------85:28----------
and then and then the it dude was like


---------85:30----------
the ads are based on your browser


---------85:34----------
so he's like he's like there's it's not


---------85:35----------
a virus bro it's just


---------85:39----------
the internet just knows what you're


---------85:40----------
looking at yeah


---------85:41----------
and so in that way our mind also


---------85:44----------
populates our head with the trash that


---------85:46----------
we've engaged in in the past


---------85:49----------
yeah


---------85:50----------
and so i know it's kind of hard but as


---------85:51----------
you notice that pop-up come up if you


---------85:54----------
until you know it's a pop-up like you


---------85:56----------
just think it's what's there right it's


---------85:58----------
what your mind tells you it feels real


---------86:00----------
but just look for it wait for it it's


---------86:02----------
gonna pop out it's like it's trying to


---------86:04----------
you know spawn camp you


---------86:07----------
and it's gonna be waiting download


---------86:08----------
buttons when you're trying to download


---------86:09----------
something and there's like the real


---------86:11----------
download button and then there's like 12


---------86:13----------
fake download buttons and you have to


---------86:14----------
like figure out which one is the right


---------86:16----------
one absolutely and just like that your


---------86:18----------
mind is going to be feeding you lots of


---------86:20----------
crap that is not actually accurate


---------86:23----------
so and hopefully as you notice you can


---------86:26----------
not give into a little bit and like take


---------86:28----------
one step forward maybe have a


---------86:30----------
conversation with someone maybe kind of


---------86:31----------
try


---------86:33----------
and then my hope is that you'll actually


---------86:34----------
be able to form better connections over


---------86:37----------
time


---------86:39----------
thoughts questions


---------86:42----------
that sounds good that all makes a lot of


---------86:43----------
sense


---------86:48----------
i'm having trouble yeah


---------86:50----------
i was just gonna say i feel like i the


---------86:52----------
there's a lot of like analogies that


---------86:53----------
we've used today that i haven't like


---------86:56----------
really thought of in the past so i think


---------86:58----------
that gives me a lot to think about like


---------86:59----------
what


---------87:01----------
uh well the thing


---------87:02----------
that i


---------87:05----------
i default to assuming that people are


---------87:07----------
gonna be annoyed by me and so i i back


---------87:09----------
off the fact that i back off really


---------87:11----------
quickly at all


---------87:12----------
um and that i don't


---------87:14----------
super like i i feel like i'm trying but


---------87:16----------
i think that i am


---------87:18----------
kind of half trying you know i'm not


---------87:20----------
like really trying uh yeah


---------87:23----------
and the fact that a lot of that can be


---------87:26----------
it's


---------87:27----------
i mean like i'm aware that it's


---------87:28----------
something that's been a part of my life


---------87:30----------
even before streaming um so i know that


---------87:32----------
it's not directly as a result of


---------87:33----------
streaming it's just something that is


---------87:35----------
really exacerbated by the circumstances


---------87:37----------
of streaming


---------87:39----------
um


---------87:40----------
so yeah


---------87:41----------
and that's that was a beautiful summary


---------87:45----------
uh the one thing i'd kind of add i


---------87:47----------
really love the way you said you'd have


---------87:48----------
trying so here's what i think you're


---------87:49----------
doing i think you're trying really hard


---------87:52----------
in one direction and not trying it all


---------87:54----------
in like another direction


---------87:58----------
that also sounds like something that i


---------87:59----------
do yes yes


---------88:01----------
yeah right so you're willing to like


---------88:03----------
there's a certain game that you feel


---------88:04----------
very comfortable playing and you're like


---------88:06----------
a try hard there but i'm not going to


---------88:08----------
touch this other way right right


---------88:12----------
i'm really happy to hear by the way that


---------88:13----------
you're it sounds like you're in a


---------88:14----------
relationship and i hope that's going


---------88:16----------
very well for you um


---------88:18----------
you know be a little bit careful about


---------88:19----------
some of these things popping up there


---------88:21----------
like you may occasionally get a pop-up


---------88:23----------
ad but my sense is that once you get to


---------88:25----------
a certain tier of intimacy with someone


---------88:28----------
the pop-up ad stop


---------88:34----------
maybe


---------88:36----------
do you get pop-up ads with your mom


---------88:40----------
uh no


---------88:44----------
sometimes


---------88:45----------
so


---------88:46----------
it's not the same kind of bad but


---------88:51----------
i wonder if my mom loves me i'm not sure


---------88:54----------
so


---------88:55----------
i think a lot of it may have to do with


---------88:56----------
your intrinsic sense of value so when


---------88:59----------
you feel valued and loved by someone i


---------89:01----------
suspect the pop-up ads will stop


---------89:03----------
but


---------89:04----------
anyway


---------89:06----------
um


---------89:06----------
now i have to you want to talk a little


---------89:08----------
bit about meditation or you have any


---------89:10----------
questions before we kind of potentially


---------89:12----------
do meditation and wind down anything


---------89:14----------
else you want to talk about


---------89:15----------
uh nope


---------89:16----------
i think we're good


---------89:17----------
um so


---------89:20----------
meditation yay


---------89:21----------
you don't have to say yes you're allowed


---------89:23----------
to say no i've never not really like


---------89:25----------
done it before so i don't know


---------89:28----------
i don't know how to say yes or no


---------89:29----------
because i'm not sure what it is


---------89:31----------
okay


---------89:32----------
i mean i understand the general concept


---------89:33----------
of meditation but


---------89:35----------
never tried it before


---------89:42----------
okay let me think for a second


---------89:46----------
okay so i'd like to teach you a


---------89:48----------
meditative practice that will ideally


---------89:51----------
help you with your relationships


---------89:54----------
okay


---------89:54----------
okay


---------89:56----------
this meditation practice i'm afraid will


---------89:58----------
be a little bit memish


---------90:00----------
because it's going to be it's going to


---------90:03----------
involve


---------90:05----------
yeah it's gonna be a little bit mimic so


---------90:07----------
you're welcome to decline or ask for


---------90:08----------
something else okay


---------90:10----------
okay so in the theory of meditation


---------90:12----------
there's this idea that we have these


---------90:14----------
different chakras chakras which are


---------90:17----------
centers of energy


---------90:19----------
and that different chakras within our


---------90:21----------
body govern like different attributes of


---------90:24----------
our life


---------90:25----------
so scientifically if we look at the


---------90:26----------
science of meditation we know that


---------90:28----------
meditation has a lot of scientific


---------90:30----------
benefits like reduces our cortisol level


---------90:33----------
you know reduces our stress


---------90:35----------
reduces our experience of anxiety and


---------90:37----------
depression and all that kind of stuff


---------90:39----------
there's really and people have looked


---------90:41----------
so


---------90:43----------
i would say that there is evidence that


---------90:45----------
chakras do not exist


---------90:47----------
so we're not saying that we don't know


---------90:49----------
we're saying that people have looked for


---------90:51----------
it and have failed to find it


---------90:53----------
with me


---------90:55----------
at the same time i'd like to teach you a


---------90:56----------
practice that is


---------90:58----------
governs your swadhisthana chakra which


---------91:01----------
is the chakra that supposedly governs


---------91:04----------
relationships


---------91:06----------
okay okay the mean part of this is that


---------91:08----------
your swadhisthana chakra is located


---------91:11----------
halfway between your navel and your


---------91:16----------
perineum


---------91:18----------
okay the perennium is also colloqui you


---------91:20----------
know what the perennium is


---------91:21----------
nope okay so it's like the point halfway


---------91:24----------
between um


---------91:26----------
the


---------91:27----------
scrotum and the anus


---------91:29----------
the taint if it were i know it's kind of


---------91:31----------
neemish so the sweat is actually located


---------91:35----------
at like your pubic symphysis which is


---------91:37----------
like the point where your two hips your


---------91:39----------
hip bones kind of meet so for men it's


---------91:41----------
kind of like the top it's kind of like


---------91:43----------
where your bladder is basically


---------91:46----------
okay


---------91:47----------
so what's kind of meamish about this is


---------91:48----------
like that you know that region is close


---------91:50----------
to the genitals and so everyone's like


---------91:52----------
hahaha genitals


---------91:54----------
so


---------91:55----------
um for


---------91:57----------
you know you can kind of view the


---------91:59----------
swadhisthana chakra is kind of like


---------92:01----------
where


---------92:02----------
um yeah so it's your pubic symphysis so


---------92:04----------
it's kind of like at the top of your


---------92:07----------
in the center at the top of your hips


---------92:10----------
like we think about hips on the outside


---------92:11----------
but the hips actually wrap around and


---------92:13----------
they like touch in the center okay


---------92:15----------
so what we're gonna do


---------92:17----------
is


---------92:18----------
actually breathe into that part of your


---------92:20----------
body


---------92:21----------
it's just a very introductory practice


---------92:23----------
okay so i want you to sit up straight


---------92:25----------
you okay doing this or is that too weird


---------92:27----------
for you like too close to them


---------92:29----------
all right so i want you to think for a


---------92:31----------
second about you know when you really


---------92:32----------
need to pee like where do you feel that


---------92:35----------
okay right so you know like the general


---------92:37----------
region of the body


---------92:39----------
so i'm going to ask you to sit up


---------92:40----------
straight


---------92:42----------
and close your eyes


---------92:43----------
okay


---------92:44----------
and slowly start to breathe in through


---------92:46----------
your nose


---------92:48----------
okay


---------92:49----------
and so notice that cool air entering


---------92:51----------
your nose you'll feel the coolness in


---------92:53----------
your in your nose


---------92:55----------
maybe in the back of your throat


---------92:58----------
maybe in the pit of your throat


---------93:00----------
you'll feel your lungs expand


---------93:03----------
you can go ahead and exhale whenever you


---------93:05----------
know whenever you're ready to


---------93:07----------
then as you breathe in again


---------93:10----------
you can kind of notice like your solar


---------93:11----------
plexus area will also kind of maybe feel


---------93:14----------
cool or expand a little bit


---------93:18----------
and then let the breath go down into the


---------93:20----------
abdomen


---------93:22----------
go ahead and exhale


---------93:25----------
and now when you breathe in i want you


---------93:27----------
to push your belly button out so expand


---------93:30----------
your abdomen let your diaphragm come


---------93:32----------
down


---------93:35----------
and then breathe out and contract your


---------93:37----------
abdomen


---------93:41----------
and let's just focus on abdominal


---------93:42----------
breathing for just a second so deep


---------93:44----------
breath in push the belly out


---------93:49----------
and exhale let the belly relax


---------93:53----------
pull your navel in towards your spine


---------93:59----------
if people are watching y'all can do this


---------94:01----------
too


---------94:03----------
some of the imagery may not work for you


---------94:05----------
it's not a big deal you don't have to


---------94:06----------
try to do everything just go with the


---------94:08----------
general direction of it


---------94:10----------
and now take a deep breath in follow the


---------94:12----------
breath all the way from the nose down


---------94:15----------
into the throat expanding the chest into


---------94:17----------
the abdomen


---------94:20----------
and then exhale and notice the warmth of


---------94:23----------
the return flow


---------94:29----------
and take a few moments to breathe


---------94:33----------
expanding the abdomen with each breath


---------94:35----------
contracting the abdomen


---------94:54----------
and now what i want you to do is notice


---------94:56----------
that when you expand the abdomen


---------94:59----------
there's kind of like a bottom


---------95:01----------
part of the abdomen


---------95:03----------
which is going to be kind of right at


---------95:05----------
your pubic synthesis synthesis


---------95:08----------
as you breathe in


---------95:10----------
you're going to kind of feel almost like


---------95:11----------
a slight pressure around your bladder


---------95:16----------
do you feel that


---------95:20----------
so i want you to focus on the spot where


---------95:23----------
you feel that pressure


---------95:32----------
and then as you exhale you'll notice a


---------95:34----------
relaxation in the area of your bladder


---------95:37----------
that that pressure kind of gets relieved


---------95:40----------
and gets loosened


---------95:42----------
and kind of like


---------95:46----------
i don't know how to say this but when


---------95:48----------
you breathe in it's like you're pushing


---------95:50----------
something into that


---------95:51----------
and when you breathe out you're creating


---------95:53----------
a vacuum and letting it kind of come out


---------95:56----------
does that make sense at all


---------95:58----------
yeah i think so


---------96:00----------
cool that means you're doing it right


---------96:04----------
so now what i want you to


---------96:06----------
just practice sort of


---------96:09----------
pushing the breath into that part of


---------96:11----------
your body and letting the breath come


---------96:13----------
out of that body and it's almost like


---------96:15----------
you're


---------96:15----------
bringing like cool nourishing air


---------96:19----------
and that you're letting out like heat


---------96:21----------
and toxicity and like like pent up


---------96:24----------
energy


---------96:30----------
so kind of breathe


---------96:31----------
into the pubic bone and out of the pubic


---------96:34----------
bone breathe into the bladder or out of


---------96:35----------
the bladder call it whatever you want to


---------96:43----------
and now i want you to think about the


---------96:45----------
sensation


---------96:47----------
of bothering people


---------96:50----------
and recognize that there are times where


---------96:52----------
your mind is telling you


---------96:54----------
oh this person doesn't like you


---------96:58----------
or that this person wouldn't enjoy


---------97:00----------
hanging out with you


---------97:02----------
or other kinds of negative thoughts


---------97:05----------
and imagine that all those negative


---------97:06----------
thoughts are kind of stored


---------97:09----------
in that


---------97:11----------
where the pubic symphysis is in the


---------97:13----------
swathe of chakra and that with each


---------97:15----------
breath


---------97:16----------
you're bringing stuff into that and


---------97:18----------
letting those kind of like negative


---------97:19----------
thoughts out


---------97:31----------
and we're gonna do three more breaths


---------97:36----------
nice and slow


---------97:55----------
and now let yourself relax


---------98:00----------
kind of shrug your shoulders a little


---------98:01----------
bit move around


---------98:04----------
when you're ready you can kind of open


---------98:05----------
your eyes


---------98:11----------
okay


---------98:12----------
what was that like


---------98:14----------
uh it was a bit weird at first because


---------98:17----------
i'm aware that i'm on camera um


---------98:20----------
but it was


---------98:22----------
relaxing


---------98:24----------
where did the sense of weirdness go


---------98:26----------
uh


---------98:28----------
i i just left i guess


---------98:31----------
yes


---------98:32----------
so that is the purpose of meditation


---------98:35----------
right so when you say weirdness like


---------98:36----------
your mind may have been thinking oh what


---------98:38----------
do people think about me


---------98:40----------
right oh no so the weirdness i would


---------98:42----------
even argue as a pop-up


---------98:46----------
being concerned about the opinions of


---------98:47----------
others and so the purpose of this


---------98:49----------
practice is to do away with those kinds


---------98:52----------
of thoughts


---------98:54----------
right so as you the next time you feel


---------98:56----------
the bungee cord pulling you back


---------98:59----------
i'd practice this maybe three times a


---------99:00----------
week or


---------99:02----------
potentially even every day but i'd shoot


---------99:03----------
for three times a week five minutes


---------99:05----------
that's it


---------99:06----------
okay 15 minutes a week


---------99:08----------
and then if you the next time you kind


---------99:10----------
of engage in a social interaction and


---------99:12----------
you feel that pop-up coming up


---------99:14----------
close your eyes for a second breathe


---------99:16----------
into the bladder


---------99:18----------
and then


---------99:19----------
try to like


---------99:21----------
act in a slightly different way


---------99:24----------
okay


---------99:26----------
cool


---------99:27----------
cool


---------99:29----------
thoughts questions


---------99:31----------
conclusions


---------99:33----------
um


---------99:35----------
well we kind of summarized before i feel


---------99:37----------
like there's a lot of analogies that


---------99:39----------
will help me


---------99:41----------
think about


---------99:43----------
how i'm interacting with people and


---------99:45----------
what i what i default to and how i can


---------99:48----------
um


---------99:49----------
kind of change that


---------99:50----------
yeah and


---------99:52----------
the meditation thing is


---------99:55----------
um


---------99:56----------
something i i'll try


---------99:58----------
um


---------99:59----------
i'm not like i'm not against it it's


---------100:00----------
just something that i've never really


---------100:02----------
done sure


---------100:03----------
so


---------100:04----------
you don't have to do it yeah but it's


---------100:06----------
just something that i offer and if you


---------100:09----------
know if it works for you great if it


---------100:10----------
doesn't work for you no big deal and now


---------100:12----------
the next time some someone asks you have


---------100:14----------
you ever tried meditation you can say


---------100:15----------
yeah i've tried it once


---------100:17----------
yeah


---------100:19----------
it's okay


---------100:20----------
you know so that's the point right so


---------100:21----------
it's it's not to commit to anything or


---------100:23----------
anything like that it's just it's just


---------100:25----------
give it a shot


---------100:26----------
it works for you great if not no biggie


---------100:29----------
all right


---------100:30----------
okay do you want to just tell us one


---------100:31----------
last time and where we can kind of find


---------100:33----------

---------100:36----------
