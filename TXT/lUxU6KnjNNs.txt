---------00:00----------
today's talk is really about anxiety but


---------00:03----------
what i really love about it is there are


---------00:05----------
a few dimensions to this anxiety


---------00:07----------
the first is we can see how growing up


---------00:09----------
in a particular environment


---------00:11----------
predisposes your mind to anxiety the


---------00:14----------
second element that we're going to dig


---------00:15----------
into


---------00:16----------
is how using substances can sometimes


---------00:19----------
exacerbate our anxiety


---------00:21----------
or even sort of create particular


---------00:23----------
situations in our mind that


---------00:25----------
feel like anxiety but may actually have


---------00:27----------
a different diagnostic


---------00:29----------
kind of perspective and then the last


---------00:32----------
thing about today's video is sort of how


---------00:34----------
do we deal with anxiety and sort of


---------00:36----------
overcoming some of the hesitations that


---------00:39----------
people have


---------00:40----------
around getting treatment so i really


---------00:42----------
thought that chuck's


---------00:43----------
chuck did a fantastic job um of


---------00:46----------
of like touching on i really loved this


---------00:49----------
discussion about anxiety


---------00:51----------
because we talk about anxiety like it's


---------00:53----------
monolithic


---------00:54----------
right like i have anxiety like you have


---------00:57----------
anxiety we all have anxiety


---------00:59----------
what is the treatment for anxiety like


---------01:02----------
you know in western medicine we


---------01:03----------
you know it's like you have anxiety


---------01:05----------
period and we heard from chuck he's like


---------01:07----------
you know my doctor


---------01:08----------
gives me this medicine and like because


---------01:10----------
i have anxiety


---------01:11----------
and and so it it like our system of


---------01:13----------
medicine we treat anxiety we don't treat


---------01:15----------
people


---------01:16----------
but what i really love about today's


---------01:18----------
talk is it's an exploration of where


---------01:20----------
anxiety starts


---------01:22----------
how your upbringing brings you to


---------01:24----------
anxiety


---------01:25----------
how substances can actually exacerbate


---------01:27----------
things


---------01:28----------
or make things worse and then also how a


---------01:31----------
lot of things that look like anxiety may


---------01:33----------
be a little bit more diagnostically


---------01:35----------
nuanced


---------01:36----------
and then finally about like how getting


---------01:39----------
treatment


---------01:40----------
is important but what are the things


---------01:42----------
that can get in the way of you wanting


---------01:44----------
treatment


---------01:46----------
and so all that kind of stuff is um


---------01:50----------
you know is fantastic so i think this is


---------01:52----------
really what like


---------01:53----------
explorations of anxiety look like where


---------01:55----------
i want you guys to understand


---------01:57----------
that it's not just about a clinical


---------01:59----------
diagnosis


---------02:00----------
and a medication it's about a whole


---------02:02----------
spectrum


---------02:03----------
of like origins of where you how you got


---------02:06----------
to hear


---------02:07----------
thinking about these other influences


---------02:09----------
that have compounded your anxiety over


---------02:11----------
time


---------02:11----------
and how to approach it in a truly


---------02:13----------
multi-disciplinary manner


---------02:15----------
venting that negative energy using


---------02:17----------
meditation taking medication


---------02:19----------
seeking a therapist overcoming your


---------02:21----------
fears that you kind of internally face


---------02:24----------
having to face those fears deal with


---------02:25----------
those fears etcetera


---------02:27----------
really fantastic how's it going


---------02:31----------

---------02:34----------

---------02:45----------

---------02:48----------

---------02:52----------

---------02:59----------

---------02:59----------

---------03:03----------

---------03:05----------

---------03:10----------

---------03:14----------
chuck yep that works mono syllable and


---------03:18----------
um


---------03:18----------
okay so chuck is there something in


---------03:19----------
particular that you uh you know


---------03:21----------
you were thinking we could talk about


---------03:23----------
today or maybe something that we could


---------03:25----------
help you with


---------03:26----------
um i mean i guess i could uh


---------03:30----------
kind of you know break down what i'm


---------03:32----------
going through i don't like i don't


---------03:33----------
really


---------03:33----------
like talk about this so i'm not really


---------03:35----------
sure like what i should be talking about


---------03:37----------
or what you're interested in or


---------03:39----------
what you can do to help me um


---------03:42----------
but you know basically i've been i've


---------03:43----------
been dealing with like anxiety for a


---------03:45----------
long time


---------03:46----------
and i would say it's gotten


---------03:47----------
progressively worse um it started to


---------03:49----------
like hit me


---------03:50----------
really bad when my wife was pregnant


---------03:52----------
with her first kid i don't know if it


---------03:54----------
was related


---------03:55----------
i feel like subconsciously i guess it


---------03:57----------
would have to be related if that's like


---------03:59----------
when it started getting bad but um


---------04:02----------
basically i'm like


---------04:05----------
it's kind of weird like i'm actually


---------04:08----------
like afraid to have anxiety


---------04:09----------
like i think my my biggest fear is like


---------04:11----------
having a panic attack because like one


---------04:13----------
time i had like a panic attack that


---------04:14----------
lasted like


---------04:16----------
what i would say was like an hour or


---------04:17----------
something and i felt like i i wasn't in


---------04:19----------
control of my body like i felt like


---------04:21----------
i felt like reality became like fake you


---------04:24----------
know what i mean


---------04:25----------
um it's kind of hard to explain so i


---------04:28----------
feel like that's like my biggest fear


---------04:30----------
and like


---------04:30----------
i feel like i'm constantly like


---------04:32----------
overthinking and i just like


---------04:34----------
i just have like um constant like


---------04:36----------
chatter in my head like


---------04:38----------
okay am i gonna have a panic attack okay


---------04:39----------
i'm feeling nervous like


---------04:41----------
like the slightest thing like wow i feel


---------04:43----------
like a tingle like in my body


---------04:45----------
like oh my my heart is like beating


---------04:47----------
faster like


---------04:48----------
you know anything just kind of starts


---------04:50----------
like those


---------04:51----------
thoughts that just don't ever stop if


---------04:53----------
that makes sense like it's just


---------04:55----------
true most of the time i would say


---------04:58----------
it's like an all-day thing but um you


---------05:01----------
know i kind of had like this uh


---------05:03----------
this thing on my stream a few days ago


---------05:05----------
which you know kind of started


---------05:07----------
you know me reaching out and trying to


---------05:08----------
make like small improvements and uh


---------05:11----------
i would say for the most part it's been


---------05:12----------
better like you know


---------05:14----------
significantly better and generally it is


---------05:15----------
better i think i just had a


---------05:17----------
string of like really bad days but um


---------05:20----------
you know even then like when i'm feeling


---------05:21----------
normal like my brain is just so weird


---------05:23----------
i'll be like


---------05:24----------
wow i haven't thought about anxiety in a


---------05:26----------
while oh


---------05:27----------
now i'm going to start thinking about it


---------05:28----------
you know it's like like i noticed myself


---------05:30----------
feeling good


---------05:31----------
and then i start to question oh yeah i'm


---------05:33----------
feeling good your anxiety is like


---------05:35----------
you're not allowed to do that it doesn't


---------05:37----------
stop it doesn't stop yeah


---------05:39----------
wow dude it sounds heavy bro


---------05:42----------
i mean you know um i i don't want to


---------05:46----------
i guess oversell it like i feel like you


---------05:48----------
know


---------05:49----------
i'm probably doing better than some


---------05:51----------
other people that are dealing with this


---------05:53----------
because i do


---------05:53----------
i do do my daily things and you know i i


---------05:56----------
travel


---------05:56----------
i go out and stuff like that but it's


---------05:58----------
definitely


---------06:00----------
sometimes i feel like it's harder to


---------06:01----------
enjoy like living in the moment you know


---------06:03----------
and


---------06:03----------
it kind of makes me sad sometimes so


---------06:07----------
yeah yeah


---------06:10----------
absolutely man how long have you been


---------06:12----------
kind of carrying this around like


---------06:14----------
how long has this anxiety been with you


---------06:16----------
i mean like i said i've had it


---------06:18----------
at a young age i would probably well i


---------06:20----------
don't know how young is young but like


---------06:21----------
maybe like my mid teenage years like 16


---------06:23----------
or something is like when i you know


---------06:24----------
experienced my first panic attack and


---------06:26----------
then uh it's probably been


---------06:29----------
pretty rough for like three ish years


---------06:30----------
now like you know my son's almost three


---------06:32----------
and it was like while we were pregnant


---------06:34----------
with him so um i would say that's like


---------06:36----------
when it started to get


---------06:38----------
not nearly as manageable like i actually


---------06:41----------
had to


---------06:42----------
get like medicated for it because i was


---------06:44----------
waking up


---------06:45----------
every single day shaking like my my


---------06:48----------
whole day would be me like literally


---------06:49----------
shaking


---------06:50----------
and i i couldn't stop it and it was i


---------06:52----------
couldn't eat and i was


---------06:54----------
you know i was struggling really bad and


---------06:56----------
i tried you know


---------06:57----------
really hard to not do that but like the


---------07:00----------
medication helped me so much that i was


---------07:02----------
like this this just had to be


---------07:04----------
you know the answer because i couldn't


---------07:06----------
live the way i was living


---------07:08----------
absolutely man so i'm glad that you got


---------07:12----------
mental health treatment um because it


---------07:14----------
certainly sounds to me like this is like


---------07:16----------
a clinical case of anxiety


---------07:19----------
and um i'm also kind of noticing


---------07:24----------
so so can do you mind if i ask you a


---------07:26----------
couple of questions just about what kind


---------07:27----------
of treatment you've tried in a little


---------07:29----------
bit of your


---------07:30----------
treatment history sure


---------07:33----------
um yeah go ahead feel free to ask me


---------07:35----------
anything yeah so so in


---------07:36----------
the so let me take a step back and


---------07:38----------
explain why i'm asking so usually we


---------07:40----------
steer clear of clinical topics on stream


---------07:42----------
because this really isn't


---------07:43----------
supposed to be medical advice the reason


---------07:46----------
i want to ask you a little bit about


---------07:48----------
your treatment history is because in my


---------07:50----------
experience


---------07:51----------
as a psychiatrist there are some things


---------07:54----------
that have to do with


---------07:55----------
clinical anxiety and there are actually


---------07:58----------
non-clinical solutions that we can learn


---------08:00----------
around anxiety as well


---------08:02----------
and i basically want to parse out how


---------08:04----------
much of the clinical stuff has been done


---------08:07----------
so that i know how to approach the


---------08:09----------
non-clinical stuff


---------08:10----------
if that makes sense so i've got a couple


---------08:12----------
of like basic questions for you okay


---------08:15----------
you don't have to answer anything


---------08:16----------
because this is for your personal


---------08:17----------
medical history it's going to be like


---------08:18----------
super high level stuff


---------08:20----------
so it sounds like uh you're taking


---------08:22----------
medication now and that the medication


---------08:24----------
helps


---------08:25----------
yeah okay um and it sounds like you


---------08:28----------
started medication around the time that


---------08:30----------
your wife was pregnant


---------08:33----------
okay have you tried psychotherapy or


---------08:35----------
something besides medication


---------08:38----------
no okay so that that's that's that's


---------08:41----------
basically all the questions i need to


---------08:42----------
ask


---------08:43----------
because um that'll sort of help me


---------08:45----------
understand like what to include and what


---------08:47----------
not to include and


---------08:48----------
and kind of how we go from here sure um


---------08:51----------
any particular reason you haven't tried


---------08:54----------
uh psychotherapy


---------08:56----------
honestly um i would feel i would say


---------08:59----------
like


---------08:59----------
until as of like recently um i kind of


---------09:03----------
feel like


---------09:04----------
i just my thought process was like if i


---------09:06----------
just kind of deal with this and like


---------09:08----------
try and forget about it it'll go away


---------09:10----------
like i didn't really like talking about


---------09:11----------
it like this conversation actually is


---------09:13----------
like kind of like


---------09:14----------
making me nervous a little bit but i'm


---------09:16----------
happy to be here and like


---------09:18----------
i i also didn't really like want to go


---------09:20----------
to a


---------09:21----------
like you know i guess a psychologist is


---------09:24----------
that


---------09:24----------
because like i don't know i just


---------09:28----------
i guess i guess it just made me a little


---------09:30----------
bit nervous you know like it


---------09:32----------
sure so let's start let's start because


---------09:35----------
he said that you have trouble being


---------09:36----------
present focused right so let's start in


---------09:38----------
the present so i noticed that when we


---------09:40----------
started the conversation you were doing


---------09:41----------
well


---------09:42----------
and then and then as especially when i


---------09:44----------
asked you a little bit about your


---------09:45----------
treatment history you've started


---------09:47----------
crossing your arms


---------09:48----------
i'm noticing you're feeling more nervous


---------09:50----------
so tell me how you feel right now


---------09:53----------
i mean i guess i i guess i feel a little


---------09:55----------
bit nervous you know


---------09:56----------
i'm okay you know i definitely make it


---------09:58----------
through the conversation but


---------09:59----------
yeah absolutely so so i want to just


---------10:01----------
point out that language because it's so


---------10:03----------
interesting right it's like


---------10:04----------
you're uh you play wow right yes


---------10:08----------
so what i'm hearing is like you've got a


---------10:10----------
couple of dots on you and your hp is


---------10:12----------
it's [ __ ] ticking down but you're


---------10:15----------
like you know i'll make it like i'm


---------10:16----------
still gonna wipe


---------10:17----------
like you know we're still gonna win the


---------10:18----------
raid like we're running out of mana like


---------10:20----------
this boat is sinking but we're gonna


---------10:22----------
make it to shore


---------10:24----------
that's what i'm hearing from you which


---------10:27----------
which is like


---------10:28----------
it's a god-awful way to go through life


---------10:31----------
for sure yeah i don't disagree


---------10:33----------
you know so so i i think that our goal


---------10:35----------
here is not to make it through to some


---------10:38----------
you know it's like let's figure out how


---------10:40----------
we can


---------10:41----------
you know cleanse those dots right


---------10:43----------
because what i want to help you with is


---------10:45----------
like to not


---------10:46----------
have to live this way it's not about


---------10:49----------
overcoming your anxiety to survive like


---------10:51----------
that's just not


---------10:52----------
any way to live life right and i i can


---------10:55----------
see that


---------10:56----------
you've learned how to do that really


---------10:57----------
well actually really awesome and noble


---------10:59----------
like i'm sure that you're


---------11:00----------
you know your kid is grateful your


---------11:02----------
family is grateful that you've learned


---------11:04----------
how to manage that anxiety but it's also


---------11:06----------
like


---------11:06----------
i can see it kind of clawing away at you


---------11:09----------
and you're sort of like keeping it at


---------11:10----------
bay while you're trying to live your


---------11:12----------
life


---------11:13----------
and you're sort of protecting your loved


---------11:15----------
ones from the impact of that anxiety


---------11:18----------
does that make sense to you or resonate


---------11:20----------
at all yeah it does


---------11:23----------
how do you feel right now uh


---------11:26----------
i feel you know the same okay


---------11:29----------
did that do anything to your nervousness


---------11:31----------
as you were listening to that


---------11:34----------
not necessarily i think it's kind of


---------11:36----------
like i think it like kind of plateaus


---------11:38----------
you know i mean okay so the most part


---------11:41----------
tell me what


---------11:42----------
what do you mean by nervousness um


---------11:47----------
what do you experience right now


---------11:50----------
uh i guess like i just kind of like if i


---------11:52----------
feel like weird in my own skin does that


---------11:54----------
make sense like


---------11:56----------
i guess and then um


---------12:00----------
maybe that's kind of it i don't know


---------12:02----------
like i just


---------12:03----------
i guess i like try and just do things


---------12:05----------
like like fiddle my hands and you know


---------12:07----------
move


---------12:07----------
move around a little bit um


---------12:11----------
i don't know and this may sound so i'm


---------12:14----------
gonna


---------12:15----------
you know see your weird statement and


---------12:17----------
raise you


---------12:18----------
in a weirder statement do you think that


---------12:20----------
sometimes when you fiddle and stuff


---------12:21----------
you're trying to find your way back into


---------12:23----------
your own skin


---------12:25----------
i'm not sure i feel like it's a way for


---------12:27----------
me to just like


---------12:29----------
do something and i guess like just keep


---------12:31----------
my hands moving or


---------12:33----------
okay i mean just like a like maybe like


---------12:35----------
a nervous tic or something like


---------12:37----------
tapping your leg or you know like


---------12:39----------
playing with something in your hands


---------12:41----------
just


---------12:41----------
just to move around i guess okay are you


---------12:44----------
having particular thoughts right now


---------12:47----------
no i feel like for the most part


---------12:50----------
unless like my mind is like running


---------12:52----------
really crazy


---------12:53----------
when i'm like distracted i'm like


---------12:55----------
generally okay


---------12:57----------
um and like i said you know since like


---------12:59----------
that those a few days ago


---------13:01----------
i started like uh trying to eat better


---------13:03----------
and trying to exercise a little bit i'm


---------13:05----------
not doing anything crazy and


---------13:06----------
you know some people recommended like 15


---------13:08----------
minutes of you know deep breaths


---------13:10----------
before and after you wake up and i've


---------13:12----------
been doing that and i i kind of felt


---------13:13----------
like there was like immediate results


---------13:15----------
like i felt like my my uh my thought


---------13:18----------
process slowed down quite a bit


---------13:20----------
not like in a i can't like function way


---------13:22----------
but like


---------13:23----------
the racing thoughts like definitely


---------13:25----------
almost went away immediately


---------13:27----------
okay um like i had a string of


---------13:30----------
excuse me uh really bad days


---------13:33----------
and uh where i just kind of felt like my


---------13:35----------
whole day i just couldn't


---------13:37----------
like enjoy anything except the fact that


---------13:39----------
like you're not gonna have a panic


---------13:40----------
attack you're not gonna


---------13:41----------
like you're gonna be okay like you know


---------13:42----------
that just you know


---------13:45----------
so that's what the racing thoughts are


---------13:46----------
they're kind of sometimes


---------13:48----------
you know that's definitely i would say


---------13:50----------
like the start of it


---------13:52----------
um you know sometimes it could get worse


---------13:54----------
than that um


---------13:56----------
you know i've always been like


---------13:59----------
yeah what percentage of your anxiety is


---------14:01----------
about being anxious


---------14:03----------
a lot i would say i like i


---------14:07----------
like i told you like my my first panic


---------14:09----------
attack was like


---------14:11----------
um like super like scary to me like


---------14:14----------
to a traumatizing matter like i was you


---------14:16----------
know i thought i was gonna die


---------14:17----------
and i was afraid that um


---------14:21----------
you know i was afraid that uh


---------14:24----------
i would like potentially like i could


---------14:26----------
lose my mind and never like be brought


---------14:28----------
back to sanity


---------14:29----------
and um i wouldn't you know i wouldn't be


---------14:32----------
able to control myself and you know


---------14:34----------
there would be times where i'm driving


---------14:35----------
like what if i have a panic attack right


---------14:37----------
now do i just die


---------14:38----------
like you know like um


---------14:41----------
going on flights and stuff like what if


---------14:43----------
i have a panic attack on the plane


---------14:44----------
you know like what the hell is going to


---------14:47----------
happen like i can't get off like


---------14:48----------
you know chuck have you ever heard of


---------14:51----------
the term agoraphobia


---------14:54----------
uh i'm recently started reading uh panic


---------14:57----------
to power


---------14:58----------
and i think it's been used in there a


---------14:59----------
few times do you have a


---------15:02----------
have they explained in the book or do


---------15:03----------
you remember in the book how they


---------15:04----------
describe


---------15:05----------
agoraphobia so i want to explain this


---------15:08----------
just to educate people okay


---------15:10----------
so um you know this is something that


---------15:12----------
you should consider talking to your


---------15:14----------
your your provider about but just to


---------15:16----------
explain to you kind of how this works


---------15:18----------
so first of all what bro what you're


---------15:20----------
describing is like completely normal


---------15:23----------
in the sense that some people for


---------15:24----------
whatever reason and we can get to that


---------15:26----------
in a second


---------15:27----------
are kind of like when they create their


---------15:28----------
character they get the they get the


---------15:30----------
panic or anxiety


---------15:31----------
trait and and so sometimes what happens


---------15:34----------
is people who have panic attacks


---------15:37----------
will sometimes become agoraphobic and


---------15:39----------
what agoraphobic means


---------15:40----------
is fear of going outside so they stay


---------15:43----------
home and and sometimes in really severe


---------15:45----------
cases they'll be


---------15:46----------
you know stuck in their home for years


---------15:48----------
at a time sounds like


---------15:49----------
you've already you know i don't think


---------15:50----------
that's going to happen to you so because


---------15:52----------
if


---------15:53----------
if it was gonna happen it would have


---------15:54----------
already happened so i think you kind of


---------15:56----------
dodged that bullet


---------15:57----------
but i think the reason that i bring up


---------15:59----------
agoraphobia right now is because i think


---------16:00----------
it illustrates a lot of what you're


---------16:02----------
going through


---------16:03----------
so the reason that people become


---------16:04----------
agoraphobic is out of a fear


---------16:07----------
of having a panic attack and being in an


---------16:09----------
uncontrolled environment when they have


---------16:11----------
a panic attack


---------16:12----------
so it's not like they literally like are


---------16:14----------
afraid of the sun or the sky or other


---------16:16----------
people


---------16:17----------
literally if you talk to people who are


---------16:19----------
agoraphobic and these are people who


---------16:20----------
like you know it's very hard for them to


---------16:22----------
leave the house


---------16:23----------
what they tell you is what if i have a


---------16:25----------
panic attack


---------16:26----------
in those kinds of places and they're so


---------16:29----------
afraid of losing control


---------16:31----------
in the outside like outside of their


---------16:33----------
home that they


---------16:34----------
end up that fear becomes so powerful


---------16:36----------
that they never leave


---------16:38----------
and there's also sort of like this


---------16:40----------
agoraphobia light


---------16:42----------
which is like when people are able to


---------16:44----------
actually leave the home


---------16:46----------
but whenever they leave the home their


---------16:48----------
mind is constantly


---------16:49----------
scanning for like methods of escape


---------16:52----------
like what if i have a panic attack while


---------16:54----------
i'm on a plane like what would i do


---------16:56----------
what if i have a panic attack if i go to


---------16:58----------
a party like how am i gonna escape from


---------17:00----------
that situation if i start to lose


---------17:02----------
control


---------17:03----------
does that do you have those kinds of


---------17:05----------
thoughts


---------17:07----------
i would say it's not like as bad as


---------17:10----------
you're describing it like the plain one


---------17:11----------
is definitely


---------17:12----------
uh you know a fear of mine for sure like


---------17:15----------
i'm not afraid


---------17:16----------
to fly i'm not afraid like the plane is


---------17:19----------
going to crash like you know


---------17:21----------
like it's literally just like i'm afraid


---------17:24----------
i'm gonna get uncomfortable on the plane


---------17:26----------
and um you know i've definitely been in


---------17:28----------
that situation before


---------17:30----------
where i i started to feel panic attack


---------17:32----------
coming on and i've i've gotten this like


---------17:35----------
you know even recently


---------17:37----------
and although it scares the living crap


---------17:38----------
out of me i just tell myself


---------17:40----------
you know shut up and take deep breaths


---------17:42----------
and no one will even notice like you're


---------17:43----------
going to be 100 fine


---------17:45----------
and that's what happens like if i feel


---------17:47----------
like one coming on like i don't know


---------17:49----------
explain it like hits me


---------17:50----------
and i'm like in shock for a second i'm


---------17:52----------
just like


---------17:55----------
and then i feel like a little bit tingly


---------17:58----------
you know i mean like i feel like a


---------17:59----------
little bit tingly and then i'm i'm


---------18:01----------
okay you know like that's just that's


---------18:03----------
just it and um


---------18:05----------
it's weird because i feel like um you


---------18:08----------
know i said about driving and stuff like


---------18:09----------
sometimes


---------18:11----------
i'll think about what happens and i'm


---------18:12----------
just like doesn't matter you got to live


---------18:14----------
your life you know like


---------18:15----------
if it happens you know worse worst case


---------18:18----------
scenario pull over


---------18:19----------
like yep you'll be 100 fine like and


---------18:22----------
it's never happened while driving before


---------18:24----------
and


---------18:25----------
so i'm noticing that there's like a


---------18:26----------
dialogue in your head


---------18:28----------
oh 100 i talk to myself all the time


---------18:30----------
hope that doesn't make me crazy


---------18:32----------
nope doesn't it makes sense um


---------18:35----------
so so uh chuck i'm going to lay out a


---------18:38----------
couple of options okay


---------18:40----------
actually let me make a like one or two


---------18:42----------
observations so


---------18:43----------
um i i think today could be really good


---------18:46----------
in terms of we can like discuss and i


---------18:49----------
can explain how are you feeling by the


---------18:50----------
way


---------18:51----------
i'm all right you know i would say just


---------18:53----------
all right like


---------18:55----------
i mean i could i could say i'm good but


---------18:58----------
obviously like i am i am a little


---------19:00----------
nervous i was a little nervous about uh


---------19:02----------
uh coming on here in general like i said


---------19:04----------
like this isn't something i


---------19:05----------
i've done ever like i i don't talk about


---------19:08----------
this really and i just kind of broke


---------19:10----------
down


---------19:10----------
you know a few days ago and you know


---------19:12----------
i'll talk to my wife and stuff like she


---------19:13----------
obviously knows but


---------19:15----------
this is obviously something i've never


---------19:16----------
done publicly before


---------19:18----------
um sounds like you haven't really done


---------19:20----------
it much privately either


---------19:22----------
no yeah i don't i don't what keeps you


---------19:24----------
what keeps you from talking about it


---------19:26----------
i would honestly say like i felt like my


---------19:29----------
thought process was if i ignored it


---------19:32----------
it'll go away and the more i talk about


---------19:34----------
it the more real it is


---------19:35----------
you know like sure


---------19:38----------
like i don't i i literally don't like


---------19:41----------
talking about it like people would come


---------19:42----------
in my chat and say like


---------19:43----------
what are you going on dr k for and i


---------19:45----------
like don't even want to answer that


---------19:46----------
question


---------19:47----------
even though like i'm the one who did it


---------19:49----------
publicly like and and how does it feel


---------19:52----------
when they ask you that question i don't


---------19:54----------
i don't even like


---------19:55----------
like saying the word anxiety or reading


---------19:58----------
it or anything like it


---------19:59----------
you know because i feel like once i see


---------20:01----------
it then i uh


---------20:02----------
like it doesn't stop in my brain you


---------20:05----------
know i mean like i could be completely


---------20:06----------
fine and i see it and then i'm like oh


---------20:08----------
shoot here we go you know like i just


---------20:10----------
gotta think about it until it goes away


---------20:13----------
yeah so i know this sounds kind of like


---------20:15----------
this is gonna be a weird question


---------20:17----------
um what do you think about


---------20:21----------
thinking that if you ignore it it'll go


---------20:23----------
away


---------20:26----------
um that's kind of like what i i guess


---------20:29----------
like what my philosophy was originally


---------20:31----------
right like


---------20:32----------
yeah why do you think you had that


---------20:34----------
philosophy


---------20:36----------
i guess because in my younger years for


---------20:40----------
the most part it worked


---------20:41----------
does that make sense excellent yeah good


---------20:44----------
so so i'm really happy to hear you say


---------20:46----------
that chuck because a lot of people


---------20:48----------
who are listening may think that that's


---------20:52----------
a bad philosophy to have


---------20:53----------
like if you ignore problems they don't


---------20:55----------
go away but this is the first thing i


---------20:56----------
want you to understand


---------20:58----------
if your mind is doing something there's


---------20:59----------
a damn good reason for it


---------21:02----------
and so oddly enough i do think that


---------21:04----------
ignoring it will make it go away


---------21:07----------
is actually an oddly effective strategy


---------21:09----------
that sort of worked for you


---------21:11----------
because let's remember if we really


---------21:12----------
tunnel down to i know it sounds really


---------21:14----------
weird but


---------21:14----------
if we really tunnel down into it what


---------21:16----------
happens if you open the door to your


---------21:18----------
anxiety


---------21:20----------
it kind of like pours out like it's


---------21:22----------
absolutely right


---------21:23----------
so like ignoring it is your way of


---------21:26----------
keeping the door closed


---------21:27----------
because one thing that we can listen to


---------21:29----------
you and if you really like if you just


---------21:30----------
kind of think about it for a second


---------21:32----------
the anxiety gets out of your control so


---------21:34----------
easily


---------21:36----------
so it's like a bucking bronco that gets


---------21:38----------
like let loose in your house and then


---------21:40----------
it's just like


---------21:41----------
jumping all over this place smashing


---------21:43----------
furniture


---------21:44----------
and so really the only thing that you've


---------21:46----------
learned or not the only


---------21:47----------
the most effective thing that you have


---------21:49----------
learned so far is just to keep it


---------21:51----------
outside of the house


---------21:52----------
and and this is where i don't think that


---------21:54----------
ignoring it is really fair what i'd


---------21:56----------
really say is like


---------21:57----------
not letting it into your mind because


---------21:59----------
what i'm hearing from you is that once


---------22:00----------
it gets into your mind


---------22:02----------
there's racing thoughts there's thought


---------22:04----------
loops you know one thought leads to


---------22:05----------
another leads to another leads to


---------22:07----------
another


---------22:07----------
and then you like start having this


---------22:09----------
dialogue with yourself and then that


---------22:11----------
kind of like fuels your anxiety even


---------22:13----------
further


---------22:13----------
and sometimes you you win but i'd also


---------22:16----------
venture that sometimes when you argue


---------22:17----------
with yourself the anxiety is kind of


---------22:19----------
like a punching bag


---------22:20----------
where the harder you hit it the harder


---------22:23----------
it swings back


---------22:25----------
and so ignoring it is actually it's not


---------22:27----------
really like


---------22:28----------
ignoring it per se when this is where


---------22:30----------
ignoring really means


---------22:32----------
not letting it into your mind because if


---------22:34----------
we think about what is the word ignore


---------22:35----------
mean


---------22:36----------
it means the active process of


---------22:39----------
preventing


---------22:40----------
thoughts about something in your mind


---------22:43----------
right


---------22:44----------
so i think ignoring it is a fantastic


---------22:47----------
tool


---------22:48----------
in your arsenal of dealing with anxiety


---------22:52----------
second thing i want to point out so then


---------22:53----------
there's this dialogue component where


---------22:55----------
sometimes you fight with your anxiety


---------22:57----------
and sometimes you win and sometimes you


---------22:59----------
lose but the problem with fighting with


---------23:01----------
your anxiety is that oftentimes it fuels


---------23:05----------
the tension in your mind right and if we


---------23:08----------
think about it like the low


---------23:09----------
anxiety states are actually states of


---------23:12----------
low energy in the mind


---------23:14----------
would you agree with that statement or


---------23:15----------
does that make statement make sense with


---------23:17----------
you


---------23:18----------
for you um not exactly


---------23:21----------
in terms of making sense okay so like


---------23:25----------
when you're calm your mind is not


---------23:28----------
doing a whole lot and when you're


---------23:31----------
anxious your mind is doing a ton


---------23:35----------
and i would venture that when you fight


---------23:37----------
against your anxiety the


---------23:39----------
total amount of activity in the mind is


---------23:41----------
increasing


---------23:43----------
and i would also venture that when the


---------23:45----------
total amount of activity in the mind


---------23:47----------
increases


---------23:48----------
you get closer to anxiety okay


---------23:51----------
and if you really think about it when


---------23:53----------
you succeed in fighting your anxiety


---------23:56----------
and you stop and you take deep breaths


---------23:58----------
what happens


---------23:59----------
to the energy in your mind i guess it


---------24:02----------
would go down


---------24:03----------
absolutely right so the more energy in


---------24:06----------
your mind it's almost like there's like


---------24:08----------
this portal that is spawning anxious


---------24:09----------
thoughts


---------24:10----------
and the more energy you pump into the


---------24:12----------
mind the more anxious thoughts it spawns


---------24:15----------
and sometimes you actually like attack


---------24:17----------
the portal and you try to like


---------24:18----------
you know overcome it with willpower that


---------24:20----------
can actually make your anxiety worse


---------24:22----------
and what actually works is stopping to


---------24:25----------
fight it's just like


---------24:26----------
zoning out right like you're just like i


---------24:28----------
can definitely agree with that


---------24:30----------
um yeah and and so if we think about it


---------24:33----------
zoning out


---------24:34----------
is also like ignoring like ignoring is


---------24:37----------
not letting


---------24:37----------
not zoning in the first place there's no


---------24:40----------
zoning in there's no aggro


---------24:41----------
and sometimes now what you've learned is


---------24:43----------
like okay like i don't want to zone in


---------24:45----------
and now that like we're aggroed like


---------24:47----------
let's just zone out


---------24:49----------
because sometimes you'll sit there and


---------24:50----------
you'll like you know you get aggro you


---------24:51----------
start tanking you start spamming all


---------24:53----------
your buttons and all your cooldowns


---------24:55----------
and sometimes you win and sometimes you


---------24:56----------
wipe but either way like even while


---------24:59----------
you're fighting that battle


---------25:00----------
life continues going on you know time to


---------25:03----------
feed your kid and put your kid to bed


---------25:05----------
and here you are [ __ ]


---------25:06----------
spamming your cooldowns trying to fight


---------25:08----------
that anxiety like in your head


---------25:10----------
you know no one else is aware but you're


---------25:12----------
like getting wiped in a raid


---------25:15----------
you know and so there's this really


---------25:17----------
interesting like principle of like


---------25:18----------
energy and anxiety where actually what


---------25:20----------
we want to do is


---------25:21----------
unplug our mind and so this is where


---------25:24----------
breathing exercises can help


---------25:25----------
that's just kind of a point that i


---------25:27----------
wanted to make i'm going to toss out a


---------25:28----------
couple different things


---------25:29----------
and then you tell me what you want to


---------25:31----------
talk about okay


---------25:32----------
next thing that i want to point out is


---------25:34----------
that you know your problem is not the


---------25:36----------
anxiety


---------25:37----------
it is also your response to the anxiety


---------25:40----------
so the anxiety is not something that you


---------25:42----------
control


---------25:44----------
but then you do something like half of


---------25:46----------
your panic is around


---------25:48----------
the fear of future anxiety it's not even


---------25:50----------
like the core anxiety


---------25:52----------
so our mind does this thing where


---------25:53----------
sometimes um


---------25:56----------
you know we have adaptations to


---------25:58----------
circumstances


---------25:59----------
and then sometimes the adaptations


---------26:01----------
actually end up hurting us more


---------26:04----------
like just to give you an example if i'm


---------26:06----------
depressed and i start drinking because


---------26:08----------
it makes the feelings of depression


---------26:10----------
go away then that sort of works but like


---------26:13----------
now i've created a whole new problem


---------26:16----------
so in your case i think there are two


---------26:17----------
area two ways you can move forward one


---------26:19----------
is you can move forward with the root of


---------26:21----------
your anxiety


---------26:22----------
and the second is you can move forward


---------26:23----------
with the response to your anxiety


---------26:26----------
does that make sense um


---------26:30----------
are you going to like kind of go in


---------26:31----------
detail and like uh


---------26:33----------
yeah go ahead yeah so like there's the


---------26:36----------
original panic


---------26:37----------
attack which you sort of can't control


---------26:41----------
and then there's your fear there's


---------26:42----------
almost like the ptsd


---------26:44----------
from the panic attack and what i'm


---------26:47----------
saying is that if we really look at it


---------26:49----------
those are like


---------26:49----------
two separate issues


---------26:53----------
and and so what i mean is that like you


---------26:54----------
can tackle both of those and your


---------26:56----------
anxiety can get better by


---------26:57----------
preventing the original panic attack or


---------26:59----------
working through that original panic


---------27:00----------
attack


---------27:01----------
but also by like re-learning how to deal


---------27:04----------
with that


---------27:05----------
original panic attack does that make


---------27:08----------
sense


---------27:09----------
yes okay and then kind of the last thing


---------27:13----------
or two more things that we can kind of


---------27:14----------
touch on and i know it's kind of


---------27:15----------
scattered when i'm kind of pointing out


---------27:17----------
i'm gonna use the shotgun approach and


---------27:19----------
then you let me know like what you're


---------27:20----------
interested in okay


---------27:22----------
um so is that we can get to the origins


---------27:25----------
so i can ask you like you know what was


---------27:27----------
going on in your teenage years what was


---------27:29----------
your upbringing like


---------27:30----------
what was your first panic attack like


---------27:32----------
what happened when your wife got


---------27:34----------
pregnant


---------27:35----------
and we can kind of you kind of say


---------27:36----------
subconsciously there has to be a


---------27:38----------
connection


---------27:39----------
you're right by the way and so we can


---------27:41----------
kind of dig into that and maybe help you


---------27:43----------
see that connection if you want to a lot


---------27:44----------
of people do that kind of stuff like


---------27:46----------
those are the kinds of conversations


---------27:47----------
that a lot of people


---------27:48----------
benefit from on stream but we don't have


---------27:49----------
to do that and then the last thing that


---------27:51----------
we can talk about is like a little bit


---------27:53----------
about the physiology of


---------27:54----------
anxiety and so almost like a


---------27:56----------
neuroscience perspective like you're


---------27:58----------
you're using these phrases like i don't


---------28:00----------
feel like i'm in my own skin


---------28:03----------
and like what is actually happening in


---------28:04----------
your body what is happening in your


---------28:06----------
brain


---------28:07----------
to create these kinds of sensations of


---------28:10----------
like depersonalization


---------28:12----------
where you feel like you're not in


---------28:14----------
reality anymore and then that begs the


---------28:15----------
question what is reality and what is you


---------28:18----------
so there's sort of like this physiologic


---------28:20----------
neuroscience like weirdly spiritual


---------28:23----------
you know like let's talk about the


---------28:24----------
nature of the universe in existence


---------28:26----------
men so there's like kind of that tact


---------28:29----------
too and i think these are all


---------28:30----------
like useful things to talk about it's


---------28:32----------
kind of like


---------28:33----------
what you were interested in um


---------28:40----------
let's see here um i


---------28:43----------
i kind of i kind of feel like we should


---------28:47----------
go with the first one and


---------28:48----------
it's gonna sound really weird but i feel


---------28:50----------
like that is the one that is gonna like


---------28:51----------
make me


---------28:52----------
like the most anxious to talk about


---------28:55----------
because i like have only talked about it


---------28:57----------
like once or twice like


---------28:58----------
you know like um number one if you


---------29:01----------
wanted to know more about like my


---------29:02----------
childhood i'm


---------29:03----------
more than happy to tell you but like the


---------29:06----------
manner and like how i had a panic attack


---------29:07----------
and stuff like it kind of still scares


---------29:09----------
me to this day


---------29:10----------
um so maybe like getting that out and


---------29:13----------
like having you


---------29:14----------
touch up on it would maybe make me feel


---------29:16----------
better i don't know


---------29:17----------
okay good so so beautiful


---------29:21----------
so now chuck we're gonna be scientists


---------29:23----------
okay we're gonna party up


---------29:25----------
we're gonna we're gonna be scientists so


---------29:28----------
i want you to pay attention


---------29:30----------
notice your fear and wanting to talk


---------29:32----------
about it


---------29:34----------
notice that you're pushing yourself in


---------29:36----------
spite of your fear


---------29:38----------
and what i want you to keep track of


---------29:40----------
because you're the only one that can do


---------29:41----------
this


---------29:42----------
is notice what happens to your various


---------29:45----------
thoughts and emotions


---------29:46----------
as we talk about it so do things get


---------29:48----------
better


---------29:49----------
do they get worse both are possibilities


---------29:52----------
do they feel the same


---------29:53----------
do some things get better and some


---------29:55----------
things feel relieving like all kinds of


---------29:57----------
stuff okay


---------29:58----------
so let's just see if it does help


---------30:00----------
because maybe if it does help


---------30:02----------
maybe you sh you know we can talk a


---------30:04----------
little bit about seeing a therapist


---------30:05----------
more long term okay sure so tell me


---------30:08----------
about your childhood bro


---------30:10----------
um where should i start


---------30:13----------
i don't know what was growing up like um


---------30:16----------
i'm sorry i guess


---------30:17----------
i would um my my parents eventually


---------30:20----------
ended up getting divorced


---------30:22----------
um so i would say that that was not a


---------30:24----------
very good marriage


---------30:26----------
um it was actually like pretty openly


---------30:28----------
bad like i feel like they would actually


---------30:30----------
fight quite a bit


---------30:32----------
um it was my dad was like a little like


---------30:35----------
ocd crazy


---------30:38----------
what does that mean like if if something


---------30:41----------
wasn't like


---------30:42----------
completely straight or not done his way


---------30:45----------
like it was a problem


---------30:46----------
like it was like um


---------30:50----------
maybe like military status like you know


---------30:52----------
you walk in the house she was off at the


---------30:53----------
door if you leave your bedroom


---------30:55----------
it has to be perfect we weren't allowed


---------30:57----------
to sit on our beds unless it was bedtime


---------31:00----------
um so we would literally watch tv in our


---------31:02----------
rooms on the floor um


---------31:05----------
if we were to leave our house we would


---------31:06----------
have to have bedroom checks


---------31:08----------
to like make sure it was straight enough


---------31:10----------
in order for us to be able to leave


---------31:12----------
um there would be times where like we


---------31:14----------
would eat dinner


---------31:15----------
and if i wasn't eating fast enough like


---------31:17----------
if i didn't like


---------31:18----------
finish my food by a certain time i would


---------31:20----------
have to go to bed like my dad would like


---------31:22----------
put a timer on


---------31:24----------
um before i say all this i should


---------31:25----------
probably say i actually have a good


---------31:26----------
relationship with my dad now like i know


---------31:28----------
that you know when he was younger he was


---------31:30----------
kind of like i don't want to say crazy


---------31:32----------
but you know he was a little


---------31:34----------
his methods probably weren't the best


---------31:36----------
for parenting sure sure but


---------31:38----------
you know we're definitely uh we're


---------31:40----------
definitely past that


---------31:41----------
okay but i would say you know my sister


---------31:44----------
and i probably favored my mom


---------31:46----------
like my dad would go away for work and


---------31:47----------
we would always be like pretty happy


---------31:49----------
when he was gone


---------31:50----------
we would stay up late and you know


---------31:53----------
um yeah do you remember what it


---------31:57----------
felt like like when you were eating your


---------32:00----------
food


---------32:01----------
i didn't like it i was i was like there


---------32:04----------
was i actually this thing


---------32:05----------
for a long time where i wouldn't eat the


---------32:08----------
last bite of my food


---------32:09----------
like it was like i don't know why


---------32:12----------
because i feel like


---------32:13----------
i i think one time i like overeat and


---------32:16----------
threw up but like i don't know i there


---------32:18----------
was


---------32:19----------
for a long time i wouldn't eat the last


---------32:20----------
bite of my food


---------32:22----------
because i felt like uh maybe i would


---------32:25----------
throw up or maybe


---------32:27----------
i'd like since i wasn't being forced to


---------32:29----------
i didn't have to i don't know but i just


---------32:31----------
i do remember that was like a part of


---------32:33----------
like a mindset for a while


---------32:35----------
okay so


---------32:39----------
um can i ask you a couple more questions


---------32:41----------
yeah for sure


---------32:43----------
i'm gonna need a second to try to find


---------32:45----------
the right question is that okay


---------32:54----------
what was it like growing up with a dad


---------32:56----------
like that


---------32:59----------
i mean for me it was normal i guess like


---------33:01----------
i didn't i didn't


---------33:02----------
really think much of it at the time


---------33:06----------
um i definitely spent like a lot of time


---------33:08----------
at friends houses like


---------33:10----------
i would almost say like a few of my


---------33:12----------
friends parents like would have like


---------33:13----------
literally adopted me or considered me


---------33:15----------
their kid at the time like i would i


---------33:16----------
would be there all the time i had like a


---------33:18----------
bunch of different friends where i would


---------33:19----------
be there non-stop stay over nonstop


---------33:22----------
almost every single weekend i probably


---------33:23----------
never stayed home wow


---------33:26----------
not even because like i didn't want to


---------33:28----------
be home but because i enjoyed like you


---------33:30----------
know i would say my other friend's house


---------33:31----------
is like way more


---------33:32----------
like more gym yeah what did you enjoy


---------33:35----------
about being there


---------33:36----------
i mean probably spending time with my


---------33:38----------
friends more freedom


---------33:39----------
in general um you know i just felt like


---------33:42----------
we got to do a lot more


---------33:44----------
like my house was like always really


---------33:45----------
strict when my dad was home


---------33:47----------
um and i wouldn't say it was very fun


---------33:50----------
yeah


---------33:50----------
um and i actually remember one time


---------33:52----------
specifically this is probably like a


---------33:53----------
little off topic and completely random


---------33:55----------
but my mom came home with like a


---------33:57----------
video game for computers called mech


---------33:58----------
wars


---------34:00----------
and my dad made her go back to the store


---------34:02----------
and take it back and specifically said


---------34:04----------
computers are not


---------34:05----------
meant for video games and i still i


---------34:07----------
still give them hell for that comment to


---------34:09----------
this day because i'm like that's how i


---------34:10----------
make my living now but


---------34:12----------
yeah you know so sometimes i would go to


---------34:14----------
my friends houses and play computer


---------34:15----------
games


---------34:16----------
and what do you do you remember how you


---------34:19----------
felt when your dad made your mom do that


---------34:22----------
probably pretty sad i was like damn that


---------34:23----------
game looks super awesome


---------34:25----------
and it's funny because i would play


---------34:26----------
video games on my computer all the time


---------34:28----------
but it was just like pinball and stuff


---------34:29----------
like that


---------34:30----------
and this came with the computer and i


---------34:31----------
don't think he knew


---------34:33----------
yeah so it sounds like there were you


---------34:36----------
know


---------34:38----------
and what did they fight about


---------34:41----------
everything i can't remember specific


---------34:43----------
arguments but they just did not


---------34:45----------
get along very well when i was in eighth


---------34:48----------
grade


---------34:49----------
okay when you were 13 yeah just about


---------34:53----------
yeah when was your first panic attack


---------34:55----------
like 16 okay but i i will say and like


---------34:59----------
this is uh


---------35:00----------
this is um you know maybe not relevant


---------35:04----------
but like


---------35:04----------
i experienced my first panic attack when


---------35:06----------
i was smoking weed


---------35:08----------
so it's actually very relevant


---------35:11----------
okay we can talk about that too um


---------35:15----------
so uh


---------35:22----------
i'm gonna just i'm trying to figure out


---------35:23----------
how to


---------35:25----------
goose step around this but i just gonna


---------35:27----------
come out so it sounds like you know you


---------35:29----------
grew up in a household that breeds


---------35:30----------
anxious kids


---------35:32----------
potentially i mean my my mom dealt with


---------35:35----------
uh


---------35:35----------
pretty bad anxiety my sister deals with


---------35:38----------
anxiety depression


---------35:39----------
and uh i deal with anxiety so it's you


---------35:41----------
know


---------35:42----------
possibly pass down as well but yeah so


---------35:45----------
sure there's a hereditary component so


---------35:47----------
there's a really interesting study


---------35:48----------
kind of bizarre so they take kids who


---------35:51----------
are anxious


---------35:51----------
and parents who are anxious and what


---------35:53----------
they actually do is give anxiety


---------35:54----------
medication to the parents and then the


---------35:58----------
kids anxiety goes down


---------36:00----------
interesting gets almost the same


---------36:02----------
therapeutic benefit as medicating the


---------36:04----------
kid


---------36:07----------
and and it's really weird but like


---------36:09----------
anxiety is sort of you know


---------36:10----------
kids are very attuned to their parents


---------36:14----------
and so like when the parent is anxious


---------36:15----------
like imagine you're six years old and


---------36:17----------
like your mom is like


---------36:18----------
freaking out right like what like the


---------36:21----------
kid is gonna be like


---------36:22----------
what's wrong i'm freaking out i don't


---------36:26----------
understand what's going on but i can


---------36:27----------
tell it's bad


---------36:29----------
it's a really fascinating study but what


---------36:31----------
i'm kind of really noticing is that like


---------36:33----------
if we think about anxiety what i think


---------36:34----------
about


---------36:35----------
as of anxiety is like anticipation of


---------36:37----------
danger


---------36:38----------
so if you really think about you know i


---------36:40----------
know it sounds kind of like a weird


---------36:41----------
question but


---------36:41----------
why do human beings get anxious like why


---------36:44----------
like but we have parts of our brain that


---------36:48----------
make us anxious and why does our brain


---------36:50----------
do that and it's because anxiety is


---------36:52----------
actually a protective mechanism


---------36:54----------
so our brain's capacity to anticipate


---------36:56----------
danger actually protects us


---------36:58----------
and what i'm actually noticing is that


---------37:00----------
your house was sort of a dangerous place


---------37:03----------
like if you sit on the bed like you got


---------37:05----------
like you like you know i don't i mean


---------37:07----------
this may be so booked into you


---------37:09----------
but like you know i can't imagine what


---------37:11----------
it's like to


---------37:12----------
live in a house where like if you sit in


---------37:14----------
your bed like what would your dad do


---------37:17----------
it wouldn't like hurt us but we'd


---------37:18----------
probably get yelled at and right


---------37:21----------
to go up on that even more like i know i


---------37:23----------
know everything that i dealt with


---------37:25----------
as a kid was obviously very strange and


---------37:27----------
i'm i'm like pretty close with my wife


---------37:29----------
and her dad and like we kind of like


---------37:31----------
you know we talk about it and laugh


---------37:33----------
about it and like when we're at family


---------37:34----------
dinners like


---------37:36----------
i tell my dad the crazy stuff he did


---------37:38----------
he's like that never happened


---------37:40----------
you know you know we laugh about it but


---------37:41----------
um


---------37:43----------
he says that never happened doesn't


---------37:46----------
bother me because me and my sister know


---------37:47----------
it was true you know we don't


---------37:48----------
we're not making this stuff up um but


---------37:51----------
when


---------37:51----------
we were like living there like we were


---------37:53----------
only allowed to eat at like designated


---------37:55----------
eat times


---------37:56----------
and i mean like there was breakfast


---------37:57----------
lunch and dinner and there was no in


---------37:59----------
between


---------38:00----------
and we would we would literally sneak


---------38:02----------
snacks


---------38:04----------
um and because we'd be hungry and like


---------38:08----------
eventually when my parents got divorced


---------38:10----------
um i lived my dad for the first year and


---------38:12----------
i didn't like it because my mom and my


---------38:13----------
sister weren't there


---------38:14----------
so i ended up living my mom and


---------38:15----------
eventually my dad found like all these


---------38:17----------
hidden like snack wrappers and trash


---------38:19----------
in my closet because if we threw him in


---------38:21----------
the trash you would see him


---------38:22----------
like legit and i remember going to bed


---------38:24----------
hungry and i would have to


---------38:26----------
like tell my mom like i'm hungry and she


---------38:28----------
would have to sneak me food


---------38:30----------
like she would literally sneak me like


---------38:32----------
ham and cheese and stuff like in my bed


---------38:35----------
just so i wouldn't go to bed hungry


---------38:39----------
do you remember how you felt when you


---------38:41----------
were hungry and she was doing that


---------38:44----------
no like i said i didn't i just thought


---------38:48----------
my dad was super strict


---------38:49----------
and you know my mom wasn't strict like


---------38:51----------
that was my thought process it wasn't


---------38:53----------
like


---------38:54----------
my dad is a horrible human being and


---------38:55----------
people are probably thinking that and i


---------38:57----------
don't really want them to think that


---------38:58----------
you know looking back at it he was


---------38:59----------
definitely kind of a dick but


---------39:01----------
i don't know if it's how he was you know


---------39:03----------
raised and whatnot


---------39:04----------
my grandpa was like the nicest guy on


---------39:06----------
earth by the way so i don't know


---------39:08----------
i don't know if that's where he got it


---------39:10----------
from but


---------39:12----------
yeah so um i want to just say a couple


---------39:15----------
of things so first


---------39:16----------
is that you know sometimes when people


---------39:18----------
come on stream and they share


---------39:19----------
like things from their upbringing like


---------39:22----------
they can paint their parents to be in a


---------39:24----------
really bad light


---------39:25----------
and that's not really what we're here


---------39:26----------
for oh yeah


---------39:28----------
and and so i think it's like especially


---------39:31----------
as children


---------39:32----------
you know i'm sure your dad did all kinds


---------39:34----------
of awesome stuff too we're just not


---------39:35----------
talking about it


---------39:37----------
it actually sounds like or maybe not


---------39:39----------
maybe


---------39:40----------
i mean he used to play baseball with me


---------39:42----------
and take me to my games and stuff like


---------39:43----------
that but


---------39:44----------
yeah i mean there was probably some


---------39:46----------
there's probably some


---------39:47----------
you know awesome stuff in there all


---------39:49----------
right so let's just


---------39:50----------
let's you know we're not we're not here


---------39:52----------
to bash your dad and at the same time i


---------39:54----------
think it's really important


---------39:56----------
to not let protecting


---------39:59----------
a parent get in the way of your


---------40:02----------
authentic experience of growing right


---------40:03----------
yeah


---------40:04----------
right um but i mean i i


---------40:08----------
this is gonna sound kind of weird chuck


---------40:09----------
but like you know you kind of grew up in


---------40:11----------
a [ __ ] up household bro


---------40:13----------
i've i've gotten that before right and


---------40:17----------
and so i think the the important thing


---------40:18----------
there is that like i could imagine


---------40:21----------
like i could just imagine like when i


---------40:23----------
put myself in your shoes like having


---------40:25----------
you know it sounds like and i i don't i


---------40:28----------
know this is gonna make your dad


---------40:29----------
sound like in a bad light but it


---------40:31----------
actually like reminds me like i've


---------40:32----------
worked with some people who are like


---------40:34----------
holocaust survivors and like they're


---------40:37----------
like you know they're being snuck


---------40:38----------
food like living in like they're like in


---------40:41----------
a closet


---------40:42----------
and someone has to like sneak them food


---------40:46----------
you know like being snuck food is like


---------40:51----------
it's just not a common experience


---------40:54----------
yeah as as a father i couldn't imagine


---------40:56----------
like my kid you know


---------40:58----------
saying he's hungry and i'm like no go to


---------41:00----------
bed like it's not time to eat like


---------41:02----------
it's like absolutely right and and so


---------41:05----------
the other interesting thing is like


---------41:07----------
what i'm hearing from you chuck is that


---------41:08----------
the anxiety is like baked into you


---------41:12----------
possibly yeah and the interesting thing


---------41:14----------
is if you really think about it like


---------41:15----------
what would happen


---------41:16----------
if your dad caught your mom sneaking you


---------41:19----------
ham and cheese


---------41:20----------
i don't know if i yelled her right so


---------41:24----------
in that and so the tricky thing here is


---------41:26----------
that i'm asking you how you felt


---------41:28----------
but i think it was so normalized to be


---------41:30----------
anxious


---------41:31----------
and then just let's not even talk let's


---------41:33----------
separate the emotion from it for a


---------41:35----------
second


---------41:36----------
it was such a normal part of your


---------41:38----------
thought process


---------41:39----------
to anticipate danger and to be in danger


---------41:44----------
what do you think about that it's just


---------41:46----------
like it's just how the household worked


---------41:48----------
right it's like


---------41:49----------
now i'm home dad can't see me playing


---------41:52----------
ping pong


---------41:53----------
gotta gotta be not anxious i gotta


---------41:55----------
anticipate that danger


---------41:57----------
dad can't see me sit on my bed oh crap i


---------41:59----------
threw my book on my bed i better


---------42:01----------
clean it up before dad sees the


---------42:03----------
impression of the weight of the book on


---------42:05----------
my bed


---------42:07----------
if i eat too fast i'm gonna puke if i


---------42:09----------
eat too slow


---------42:10----------
i'm not gonna get to eat there's like


---------42:13----------
danger anticipation like


---------42:14----------
everywhere you look in the household


---------42:17----------
possibly


---------42:18----------
created like a lot of my overthinking


---------42:19----------
potentially like i wouldn't say that i


---------42:21----------
had like anxious thoughts back then


---------42:23----------
but it's maybe uh helped like


---------42:27----------
form the way that i think today and if


---------42:28----------
that makes sense absolutely


---------42:30----------
i think it makes a lot of sense i think


---------42:32----------
the way that you think today


---------42:34----------
is a survival adaptation from how you


---------42:37----------
grew up


---------42:38----------
what do you think about that it's very


---------42:40----------
possible yeah


---------42:42----------
right so like your anxiety isn't an


---------42:44----------
enemy


---------42:46----------
it's just like when i'm you know so this


---------42:48----------
is how our mind works it's kind of like


---------42:50----------
cement


---------42:51----------
so like the early changes in our mind


---------42:54----------
mind solidify later in time it's like


---------42:56----------
why


---------42:57----------
if you think about like learning how to


---------42:58----------
walk do you know how to walk


---------43:01----------
i think so yeah how solidly do you know


---------43:03----------
how to walk


---------43:05----------
some people say not very well since i


---------43:08----------
walk on my toes


---------43:09----------
but i get i get from a to b yeah right


---------43:12----------
so


---------43:12----------
so when we think about it like so much


---------43:14----------
fundamental programming is laid down


---------43:16----------
like our capacity for language


---------43:19----------
our capacity to understand what what do


---------43:21----------
you do with your face right now


---------43:22----------
what is that what do we call that


---------43:26----------
i think i'm just smiling yeah but what


---------43:28----------
is that how did you how did you learn


---------43:29----------
how to do that


---------43:31----------
i think it's just programmed yeah right


---------43:34----------
it's so baked in


---------43:36----------
yeah and so what i'm noticing is that


---------43:38----------
early on


---------43:39----------
because here's the thing those are just


---------43:40----------
the things that you remember and it


---------43:42----------
sounds like your dad has gotten better


---------43:44----------
over time


---------43:46----------
yeah he's all right now right so like i


---------43:48----------
don't even know like what he did


---------43:50----------
when you you know pooped your pants when


---------43:52----------
you were one


---------43:55----------
honestly he comes over and he sees my


---------43:57----------
kids


---------43:58----------
and like i'm convinced he didn't have


---------44:01----------
kids


---------44:01----------
because this guy is you know like i love


---------44:03----------
my dad but he doesn't know how to talk


---------44:05----------
to him he doesn't know how to hold him


---------44:06----------
he doesn't know how to like it's just


---------44:08----------
like


---------44:08----------
hey you guys are my grandkids you're


---------44:10----------
awesome but it's like


---------44:12----------
you know yeah so it looks like he has no


---------44:15----------
idea what's going on


---------44:16----------
i'm gonna assume that my mom took care


---------44:17----------
of everything so chuck i'm gonna ask you


---------44:19----------
a question


---------44:21----------
what would it be like you have a son i


---------44:23----------
have two sons actually


---------44:24----------
oh oh so you have two sons what would it


---------44:28----------
be


---------44:28----------
like for them if they


---------44:32----------
never interacted with their dad or their


---------44:34----------
dad never took care of them


---------44:36----------
i think they would be pretty sad i'm


---------44:38----------
pretty awesome


---------44:40----------
you certainly love that i don't i don't


---------44:42----------
think they would be sad because they


---------44:43----------
wouldn't know


---------44:45----------
oh right well i feel like now you're


---------44:47----------
throwing shade at me no i'm just kidding


---------44:49----------
no no but i'm saying i'm saying like


---------44:51----------
like so so this is


---------44:53----------
i think for you there were a lot of


---------44:54----------
things that i think you missed out on


---------44:56----------
that you don't even realize you missed


---------44:57----------
out on because but you certainly miss


---------44:58----------
out like it would be


---------44:59----------
it they wouldn't be sad it would be sad


---------45:02----------
for them right does that make sense


---------45:06----------
yeah and like um like i said my my


---------45:08----------
wife's dad comes here a lot


---------45:10----------
um and we talk about stories of like


---------45:13----------
what they did with


---------45:13----------
as like kids and what he did for them


---------45:15----------
and i'm like they'd be like yeah you


---------45:16----------
never do this and i'm like


---------45:18----------
no you know so definitely


---------45:21----------
i'm very aware you know the childhood i


---------45:24----------
had


---------45:24----------
right it's kind of weird because it's


---------45:26----------
not even like you you sort of know


---------45:28----------
intellectually you missed out but like


---------45:29----------
you didn't miss out


---------45:31----------
kind of emotionally because it was just


---------45:32----------
normal for you


---------45:35----------
but i am noticing that there's a you


---------45:36----------
know there's a lot of evidence that


---------45:38----------
your mind learned how to anticipate


---------45:41----------
danger


---------45:42----------
and that you were kind of like a home


---------45:44----------
base your place of safety required a lot


---------45:46----------
of vigilance


---------45:48----------
so here's another term that i'm going to


---------45:50----------
toss out which i think describes your


---------45:52----------
anxiety very well


---------45:53----------
hyper vigilance what do you think


---------45:58----------
so vigilance means you know to be


---------46:01----------
watchful


---------46:02----------
and hyper is to be like constantly


---------46:04----------
watchful constantly on guard


---------46:08----------
do you think that describes what happens


---------46:10----------
in your mind


---------46:12----------
uh possibly possibly i still kind of


---------46:16----------
feel like


---------46:17----------
i mean i guess i'm constantly on guard


---------46:18----------
of like my own emotions


---------46:20----------
per se like you know not necessarily


---------46:21----------
like my environment and stuff like


---------46:23----------
i'm generally pretty easygoing like i


---------46:25----------
would say like my wife is like


---------46:27----------
way more like you know what's going on


---------46:28----------
around me you know what's this what's


---------46:29----------
that


---------46:30----------
i'm just constantly on guard like okay i


---------46:32----------
don't want to have a panic attack right


---------46:33----------
now like you know


---------46:35----------
yeah that's like so i'm noticing that


---------46:37----------
the guard is internal instead of


---------46:39----------
external


---------46:40----------
like you're manning the walls of your


---------46:42----------
own mind to make sure that the bucking


---------46:44----------
bronco doesn't get in


---------46:45----------
[Music]


---------46:49----------
um how did it feel to talk about your


---------46:53----------
upbringing


---------46:55----------
honestly it doesn't it doesn't really


---------46:56----------
bother me too much like that wasn't the


---------46:58----------
thing that i was actually too nervous


---------46:59----------
about because i i've talked about it


---------47:01----------
before


---------47:01----------
like you know even on stream maybe not


---------47:03----------
too often you know i've talked about


---------47:04----------
like my friends obviously you know knew


---------47:07----------
me and kind of knew my dad was a little


---------47:09----------
crazy and my wife and every i actually


---------47:11----------
just think it's funny at this point


---------47:12----------
you know okay okay um so i would i would


---------47:15----------
say things didn't necessarily get better


---------47:17----------
but they also didn't get worse you know


---------47:19----------
okay


---------47:20----------
okay so it sounds like and what's your


---------47:22----------
understanding of why you're smiling


---------47:23----------
right now


---------47:25----------
because i i just think it's funny like


---------47:26----------
okay yeah this is


---------47:29----------
yeah i guess you either laugh or cry and


---------47:31----------
uh yep


---------47:33----------
yeah i just i don't know i've told these


---------47:35----------
stories a thousand times like at this


---------47:36----------
point like i i really do


---------47:38----------
think they're kind of funny have you


---------47:40----------
cried about them


---------47:42----------
maybe i if if i did i couldn't remember


---------47:44----------
okay


---------47:45----------
i doubt i did but yeah and so it sounds


---------47:48----------
like you were


---------47:49----------
very nervous about sharing something


---------47:51----------
else can you help us understand what


---------47:53----------
that is we don't necessarily have to


---------47:54----------
share it i'm just curious what we're


---------47:55----------
doing


---------47:56----------
i'm okay to share it um but like the way


---------47:58----------
i like experience my first panic attack


---------48:00----------
and stuff like


---------48:03----------
it's just it's scary it's you know i i


---------48:06----------
remember it so


---------48:07----------
so vividly and uh you know exactly what


---------48:10----------
was going on in my brain and just like


---------48:12----------
it was just a lot


---------48:13----------
it's a lot i think like that's like my


---------48:16----------
my fear to like get back to that place i


---------48:17----------
guess


---------48:19----------
are you afraid that if we talk about it


---------48:21----------
you'll let the bucking bronco back into


---------48:23----------
your mind


---------48:24----------
not necessarily because i feel like um i


---------48:27----------
i have talked about it before


---------48:29----------
um but i was like definitely in a better


---------48:32----------
mind state and if that makes sense like


---------48:35----------
so


---------48:36----------
this is this is the series of events


---------48:38----------
that happen like my sister growing up


---------48:40----------
like


---------48:40----------
kind of i think she dealt with our our


---------48:43----------
childhood differently like she kind of


---------48:44----------
like you know did smoke and did drink at


---------48:46----------
a younger age and stuff like that


---------48:48----------
and i saw that and i didn't really like


---------48:49----------
want to be a part of that


---------48:51----------
and um you know like my friends smoked


---------48:54----------
and stuff and i i just didn't care like


---------48:55----------
my friends would drink i didn't want to


---------48:57----------
my friends would smoke and i didn't want


---------48:58----------
to


---------48:59----------
and one day one of my friends convinced


---------49:02----------
me to smoke and we smoked it was chill


---------49:03----------
and then he convinced me again


---------49:05----------
and i had like that really terrible


---------49:07----------
experience which i can get to


---------49:08----------
into into more detail and you know i


---------49:11----------
just kind of chalked it up as like wow


---------49:13----------
like that was bad they're like yeah you


---------49:14----------
know you had a tough time you know it's


---------49:16----------
whatever


---------49:17----------
but it didn't really affect me you know


---------49:19----------
i mean it didn't affect me and then i


---------49:20----------
tried smoking again it was fine and i


---------49:22----------
tried smoking again and then that's when


---------49:25----------
that's when the problems occurred it was


---------49:26----------
the fourth time and i remember


---------49:29----------
what happened was like i started


---------49:31----------
experiencing like what i experienced the


---------49:32----------
first time


---------49:33----------
and i was in someone's house and i went


---------49:35----------
outside and i sat there in the freezing


---------49:36----------
cold


---------49:37----------
shivering like you know for like an hour


---------49:40----------
like


---------49:40----------
and it didn't take control of me like it


---------49:42----------
did the first time


---------49:44----------
but like it kept feeling like it was and


---------49:46----------
but i remember during that time having


---------49:47----------
the thought process what is this what if


---------49:49----------
this never goes away


---------49:51----------
and as soon as that thought went into my


---------49:53----------
mind


---------49:54----------
i've had to deal with it forever and i


---------49:56----------
remember like you know the next few days


---------49:57----------
going out


---------49:58----------
like like just being in random people's


---------50:01----------
car things that i never would have


---------50:02----------
thought about before like what if i have


---------50:04----------
a panic attack right now


---------50:05----------
you know and then um for like a week it


---------50:08----------
went away


---------50:09----------
like completely and i mean like not even


---------50:11----------
it wasn't even thought in my mind and i


---------50:12----------
remember


---------50:13----------
you know i don't i don't know what


---------50:15----------
caused it but i just remember that


---------50:16----------
morning like i would


---------50:17----------
i was over at my friend's house we


---------50:18----------
stayed up all morning we were playing


---------50:20----------
basketball in the morning


---------50:21----------
and later that night we went to a movie


---------50:22----------
theater and someone in the movie theater


---------50:25----------
came up to me


---------50:26----------
they're like you're cedu and i lost it


---------50:29----------
completely lost it like i i felt all


---------50:32----------
those feelings coming back i don't know


---------50:33----------
if i was in shock or what i


---------50:35----------
i i ran out of the movie theater and i


---------50:37----------
was crying i had to get my sister picked


---------50:38----------
me up and


---------50:40----------
you know ever since then like it was


---------50:41----------
always a


---------50:43----------
thought in my mind like almost i would


---------50:45----------
say almost


---------50:46----------
every single day like there was a


---------50:47----------
thought in my mind that i might have a


---------50:48----------
panic attack


---------50:49----------
like since that that day what when you


---------50:52----------
said the feelings came up what what does


---------50:54----------
that mean


---------50:55----------
how do i explain it it feels like it


---------50:57----------
almost feels like


---------51:00----------
i'm like i'm like looking at things


---------51:02----------
through my mind not my eyes like i i


---------51:04----------
i'm experiencing things around me like


---------51:06----------
it just it feels like


---------51:08----------
everything stops and i could explain to


---------51:10----------
you like what happens like


---------51:12----------
what happened in my first panic attack


---------51:13----------
but um when i feel like i'm having a


---------51:16----------
panic attack it feels like everything


---------51:17----------
stops like


---------51:18----------
and in my original panic attack i froze


---------51:20----------
like and i felt like you know it wasn't


---------51:22----------
reality but so i remember


---------51:24----------
very specifically my first panic attack


---------51:25----------
i was eating bacon cheddar cheese fries


---------51:27----------
they were one of my favorite meals


---------51:28----------
and i remember swallowing one and


---------51:32----------
my mind envisioned it going down my


---------51:34----------
throat like i could see it today


---------51:36----------
like you know i mean things that don't


---------51:37----------
even make sense and i remember


---------51:40----------
sitting up and i said oh my god i'm


---------51:43----------
gonna die


---------51:44----------
and my friend my friend immediately


---------51:47----------
like reacted to that like what what what


---------51:49----------
don't say that don't say that like


---------51:51----------
and that scared me even more and i


---------51:53----------
remember like freaking out saying like


---------51:54----------
oh my god i'm gonna die i'm gonna die


---------51:56----------
and i had bunk beds and i started


---------51:57----------
punching my bunk beds as hard as i could


---------51:59----------
because i i didn't feel


---------52:00----------
like you know i wanted to feel something


---------52:03----------
and then i remember like


---------52:04----------
literally like standing up like hovered


---------52:06----------
over like this


---------52:09----------
and i don't know why but this was my


---------52:12----------
thought process


---------52:13----------
i was i was on trial for life and death


---------52:16----------
and i remember


---------52:17----------
being on a stage and having a full


---------52:20----------
audience around me and i had to plea my


---------52:23----------
case why i shouldn't die today


---------52:25----------
and i was literally pleading like you


---------52:26----------
know what like there's a school


---------52:28----------
girl i really like in school like i


---------52:29----------
never talked to her i swear i'm gonna


---------52:31----------
talk to her like


---------52:32----------
and i was trying to beg to not die


---------52:35----------
like that was my that was my first panic


---------52:37----------
attack and


---------52:39----------
you know i just i can still like


---------52:40----------
remember everything around me and like


---------52:43----------
clearly um yeah it was it was pretty bad


---------52:46----------
it was pretty bad and then um you know


---------52:49----------
eventually i kind of like


---------52:51----------
snapped out of it i would say and i like


---------52:52----------
took a cold shower and i remember like


---------52:54----------
some of the feelings coming back on in


---------52:55----------
the shower where like


---------52:57----------
you know it felt like i was kind of like


---------53:00----------
getting like sucked in again almost and


---------53:01----------
then i would just be like nope i'm fine


---------53:03----------
like you're gonna be good


---------53:04----------
but that was my first panic attack and


---------53:06----------
it was uh that's what i'm afraid of i


---------53:08----------
guess is like losing full control to


---------53:10----------
where like


---------53:10----------
i felt like i couldn't move like i don't


---------53:12----------
like i swear i felt like i was stoned


---------53:14----------
like i couldn't move like i was just


---------53:16----------
stuck in place


---------53:20----------
have you talked to you the person who


---------53:21----------
prescribes your medication about this


---------53:24----------
no i don't know if i necessarily like


---------53:26----------
that guy


---------53:27----------
i told him like my anxieties about


---------53:28----------
anxiety he's like no it's not i'm like


---------53:30----------
okay you just don't really want to


---------53:31----------
listen you just want to prescribe


---------53:32----------
medicine like


---------53:34----------
wait when he said your anxiety is about


---------53:38----------
anxiety and he said no it's not yeah it


---------53:41----------
didn't


---------53:42----------
yeah like you know i'm i'm not


---------53:45----------
i don't really think he's like the


---------53:46----------
person for me to talk to okay i mean


---------53:50----------
okay i think he just prescribes medicine


---------53:51----------
and you know he's like no


---------53:53----------
no it's not like there's there's there's


---------53:55----------
a different route and i'm like


---------53:56----------
you know i think about this stuff a lot


---------53:58----------
and i kind of feel like i know what the


---------53:59----------
route is


---------54:00----------
but what's the route i kind of feel like


---------54:02----------
that was the route right there i feel


---------54:03----------
like that was damn right it is


---------54:05----------
yeah i feel like that was the day that


---------54:07----------
like you know like i always tell myself


---------54:09----------
i wish i never smoked weed and


---------54:11----------
you know but i feel like eventually i


---------54:13----------
would have dealt with this problem


---------54:14----------
anyway


---------54:15----------
because it's it's happened before


---------54:16----------
without smoking you know


---------54:19----------
not not to that extent but can i think


---------54:22----------
for a second


---------54:23----------
yeah take your time


---------54:42----------
so um chuck i i want to just acknowledge


---------54:45----------
something for a second so i think that


---------54:46----------
like what i'm about to say


---------54:48----------
is it's still sort of


---------54:52----------
for educational purposes but it's gonna


---------54:55----------
use a lot of diagnostic language


---------54:57----------
and i would really hesitate to say this


---------55:00----------
for a couple of reasons


---------55:02----------
the main reason that i'm i'm gonna offer


---------55:04----------
to share something in a moment


---------55:06----------
is because you do have a provider and i


---------55:08----------
think that ultimately


---------55:10----------
our goal here on stream is to try to


---------55:12----------
like help you


---------55:14----------
right so i want to share sort of a


---------55:17----------
different perspective based on some of


---------55:18----------
the attributes that you're sharing


---------55:20----------
which i definitely think you should


---------55:22----------
follow up with a medical professional


---------55:24----------
think about it and follow up with a


---------55:26----------
medical professional


---------55:28----------
and and because you know we don't really


---------55:30----------
diagnose or treat things on stream but i


---------55:32----------
feel like i have an ethical


---------55:34----------
responsibility to share with you another


---------55:36----------
perspective


---------55:38----------
for looking at your anxiety


---------55:42----------
um is that okay yeah


---------55:45----------
so what you're describing to me because


---------55:47----------
you were smoking marijuana so like


---------55:48----------
sometimes when people


---------55:50----------
so now we're gonna go real general okay


---------55:51----------
and i want you to just kind of think


---------55:53----------
about this and figure out whether this


---------55:54----------
is


---------55:55----------
you know applies to you or not you know


---------55:57----------
in a different scenario if you were


---------55:58----------
actually my patient i would tunnel down


---------56:00----------
into this more


---------56:01----------
and i think it's a useful thing for you


---------56:04----------
to tunnel down with a provider


---------56:05----------
unfortunately i can't do it that with


---------56:07----------
you


---------56:08----------
but i feel like i would be honestly


---------56:10----------
doing you an ethical disservice if i at


---------56:12----------
least didn't float this idea and give


---------56:13----------
you the opportunity


---------56:15----------
to talk to a licensed professional about


---------56:16----------
it is that okay


---------56:18----------
yeah yeah definitely so when we smoke


---------56:20----------
marijuana


---------56:22----------
marijuana actually has two kind of


---------56:24----------
components


---------56:26----------
one is sort of a pro-psychotic component


---------56:28----------
and one is an antipsychotic component


---------56:31----------
and there's a there's a version of


---------56:32----------
marijuana called k2 which is synthetic


---------56:35----------
marijuana


---------56:36----------
and the problem with synthetic marijuana


---------56:38----------
is that if normal marijuana has like thc


---------56:41----------
and cbd and has a bunch of other


---------56:42----------
compounds


---------56:43----------
but basically depending on the blend of


---------56:46----------
thc and cbd


---------56:48----------
it has a certain propensity to like


---------56:50----------
because you know like pot makes people


---------56:51----------
paranoid right


---------56:54----------
so some of that paranoia is kind of like


---------56:56----------
more in line with psychosis


---------56:59----------
and and so it when people use synthetic


---------57:01----------
k2


---------57:02----------
the problem with k2 it like makes people


---------57:04----------
like really freaking psychotic and they


---------57:06----------
get


---------57:06----------
you know brought to the er really steer


---------57:08----------
clear of k2 and


---------57:10----------
in general marijuana as well um


---------57:13----------
but what i'm really hearing from you


---------57:15----------
doesn't sound like a panic attack it


---------57:17----------
sounds like sort of like more like a bad


---------57:19----------
trip does that make sense


---------57:22----------
yes and so sometimes what happens with


---------57:25----------
people who have bad trips


---------57:27----------
is not that they have anxiety so we call


---------57:31----------
it anxiety


---------57:32----------
but what i'm almost hearing is like a


---------57:35----------
traumatic experience from a bad trip


---------57:39----------
and really what i'm hearing sounds to me


---------57:41----------
like i think you need a


---------57:42----------
far more thorough kind of diagnostic


---------57:44----------
with someone who listens


---------57:46----------
so like what we're dealing with may be


---------57:48----------
an anxiety disorder


---------57:50----------
not really our place to determine here


---------57:51----------
but could also be ptsd from


---------57:54----------
a bad trip and this is where sometimes


---------57:56----------
from a treatment perspective it's really


---------57:58----------
important to have a clinician who


---------57:59----------
listens to you


---------58:00----------
because the treatments are actually


---------58:02----------
quite different


---------58:04----------
and and i don't know that you're ever


---------58:05----------
like like approaching it as an anxiety


---------58:08----------
disorder and approaching it


---------58:10----------
as ptsd from a bad trip are gonna like


---------58:13----------
help you


---------58:14----------
approach it in different ways and may


---------58:16----------
actually help you


---------58:17----------
and if you're not getting better and


---------58:19----------
this is also just general principles now


---------58:21----------
okay


---------58:22----------
so if you're working with a psychiatric


---------58:24----------
provider and you're not getting better


---------58:26----------
to your satisfaction i strongly


---------58:28----------
encourage


---------58:29----------
everyone out there to bring up your


---------58:31----------
dissatisfaction with the psychiatric


---------58:33----------
provider


---------58:34----------
because a lot of times this is you know


---------58:36----------
not really specific to you really at


---------58:38----------
this point but


---------58:39----------
a lot of times like you know as a


---------58:41----------
psychiatric provider


---------58:42----------
i ask you how's the medication working


---------58:44----------
and most people like


---------58:46----------
it's working some you know it's not


---------58:48----------
perfect but it seems to be doing a good


---------58:50----------
job


---------58:51----------
and then as a clinician i don't know if


---------58:52----------
that's just like your anxiety is so


---------58:54----------
severe and we're kind of like okay with


---------58:56----------
this


---------58:56----------
or if what i should do as a clinician is


---------58:59----------
sit down and rethink your diagnosis


---------59:02----------
that may be a different kind of like why


---------59:03----------
are we wiping on the raid


---------59:05----------
you know is it like is it that you know


---------59:08----------
we're we're hitting the dps or are we


---------59:10----------
messing up at the dps race


---------59:12----------
or is it that our comp is messed up or


---------59:14----------
like there are all kinds of differential


---------59:16----------
diagnoses


---------59:17----------
for why the rate is not succeeding and


---------59:20----------
sometimes


---------59:22----------
that involves like just further anxiety


---------59:25----------
treatment


---------59:25----------
but if we start to treat your anxiety


---------59:27----------
double down on anxiety treatment when


---------59:29----------
what you really have is


---------59:30----------
ptsd related to like uh like a psychotic


---------59:34----------
hallucinatory experience


---------59:36----------
those are different things and they can


---------59:38----------
both look


---------59:39----------
like anxiety but this is where you know


---------59:42----------
out of


---------59:43----------
everyone that i've ever talked to on


---------59:44----------
stream i would encourage you


---------59:46----------
the most to go and really get like


---------59:50----------
re-evaluated or have a really good


---------59:52----------
in-depth conversation


---------59:54----------
with a licensed mental health


---------59:55----------
professional about your situation


---------59:57----------
and i would share this stuff with them


---------59:59----------
because in a sense it's not their


---------60:01----------
fault it


---------60:04----------
you know you can't hold them accountable


---------60:06----------
if you're not sharing


---------60:08----------
information so i would really go and


---------60:10----------
share this experience


---------60:11----------
and then kind of like you know find


---------60:13----------
someone that you like and you trust


---------60:15----------
and then really kind of get a good like


---------60:17----------
thorough diagnostic evaluation which


---------60:19----------
sometimes can take hours


---------60:21----------
so can happen over the course of weeks


---------60:22----------
and things like that but what i'm


---------60:24----------
hearing right now


---------60:25----------
just really makes me concerned that you


---------60:27----------
know what we're talking about is like


---------60:29----------
you know this intense moment where you


---------60:30----------
were like


---------60:31----------
in this courtroom like that's like


---------60:33----------
divorced from reality


---------60:34----------
right like that wasn't actually


---------60:36----------
happening and this is what's kind of


---------60:37----------
interesting is when people have like


---------60:39----------
hallucinations and stuff when they use


---------60:41----------
substances it


---------60:42----------
feels real and the impact on your brain


---------60:46----------
even if it's not real your brain


---------60:49----------
experiences it does that make sense


---------60:52----------
definitely yeah and so the effects on


---------60:55----------
your neurochemistry


---------60:56----------
in the way that your brain wires are as


---------60:59----------
if it's real


---------61:00----------
and this also gets into a whole other


---------61:02----------
thing about like what is the nature of


---------61:03----------
reality and dreams and all this kind of


---------61:05----------
crap


---------61:06----------
we had a good conversation with ludwig


---------61:07----------
about it that if you want to go back and


---------61:09----------
watch like it may give you some insight


---------61:11----------
into this


---------61:11----------
but at this point i just want to check


---------61:13----------
in with you what do you think about


---------61:15----------
what we're talking about chuck in


---------61:17----------
regards to what like just like this


---------61:19----------
conversation


---------61:21----------
like how do you feel about where we are


---------61:24----------
i mean i guess i feel okay


---------61:25----------
i wouldn't i wouldn't say i i feel like


---------61:28----------
any type of way about it


---------61:29----------
um i would say like i was definitely a


---------61:32----------
little nervous to share


---------61:33----------
like what i went through i'm not really


---------61:34----------
sure why but


---------61:36----------
um you know didn't it didn't really like


---------61:39----------
you know because i i thought i've been


---------61:40----------
thinking about this for like the whole


---------61:42----------
week like you know is he gonna ask me


---------61:44----------
like how i experienced my first panic


---------61:45----------
attack and stuff like that


---------61:47----------
and then you know my brain kind of goes


---------61:48----------
down the road of like you know thinking


---------61:50----------
about him like oh crap i don't really


---------61:52----------
want to think about this you know but


---------61:54----------
um i don't know and i definitely um


---------61:57----------
i definitely kind of agree with you i i


---------61:59----------
do think to a certain extent


---------62:01----------
i do have anxiety because um


---------62:04----------
i just kind of do feel like i deal with


---------62:06----------
every everyday stress and stuff and i do


---------62:07----------
think the medication is helping me


---------62:09----------
um but in the same sense i do think that


---------62:11----------
like i do have that like trauma of like


---------62:14----------
that's not where i want to get back to


---------62:16----------
like that's yeah that's there's a living


---------62:18----------
crap out of me


---------62:19----------
yeah so so just so you understand like


---------62:21----------
you know this hyper vigilance that i


---------62:22----------
referenced earlier is really a feature


---------62:24----------
of ptsd


---------62:27----------
so like what happens if you think about


---------62:28----------
a traumatic event


---------62:30----------
like you know if i've been sexually


---------62:32----------
assaulted in a parking lot


---------62:34----------
like i'm going to steer like i never


---------62:35----------
want to be in a parking lot at night


---------62:37----------
again like i will come hell or high


---------62:40----------
water i will avoid that situation at all


---------62:42----------
costs


---------62:43----------
and what i'm really like so early on


---------62:45----------
when i mentioned agoraphobia to you


---------62:47----------
remember like


---------62:48----------
agoraphobia is about avoidance


---------62:51----------
it's all about avoidance and what i'm


---------62:53----------
hearing when we talk about the bucking


---------62:55----------
bronco


---------62:55----------
and ignoring your thoughts it's about


---------62:57----------
avoidance avoidance avoidance


---------62:58----------
so could this be an anxiety disorder


---------63:00----------
absolutely could this be


---------63:02----------
uh like you know hallucinator like a


---------63:06----------
marijuana-induced ptsd


---------63:08----------
absolutely and that's something where i


---------63:09----------
think really like you deserve


---------63:11----------
to have someone a licensed mental health


---------63:13----------
professional sit down with you and


---------63:15----------
really talk through that


---------63:17----------
um do you what was it like to actually


---------63:20----------
share that experience


---------63:22----------
it was all right i mean i've shared it


---------63:24----------
before to people


---------63:26----------
uh who are close to me obviously like


---------63:29----------
you know i was with my friend at the


---------63:30----------
time


---------63:31----------
you know during it um but i mean yeah


---------63:34----------
well i guess it wasn't as bad as i


---------63:35----------
thought it was gonna be


---------63:36----------
like i feel like i'm kind of relaxed


---------63:38----------
right now for the most part


---------63:40----------
what do you mean by relaxed do you mean


---------63:42----------
your baseline level of anxiety


---------63:44----------
or do you mean relaxed


---------63:48----------
i guess in these days it's kind of hard


---------63:50----------
to tell a difference


---------63:51----------
because i kind of feel like it's always


---------63:52----------
there yeah i understand that so like i


---------63:55----------
want to just point something out to you


---------63:56----------
you've never used the word


---------63:58----------
relaxed today


---------64:02----------
so like i think that that's the right


---------64:03----------
word i think you actually


---------64:05----------
are somewhat relaxed and the reason that


---------64:07----------
i think you should see a therapist is


---------64:09----------
because this is how therapy works


---------64:11----------
right right so like when you share the


---------64:13----------
thoughts that you have inside


---------64:15----------
you know remember how we talked about


---------64:17----------
and this isn't


---------64:18----------
not there are many ways to do this but i


---------64:20----------
want to just explain this principle of


---------64:21----------
the mind


---------64:22----------
which is remember we were talking about


---------64:24----------
when you add energy to the mind


---------64:26----------
the anxiety gets worse so one of the


---------64:29----------
ways that we can vent


---------64:30----------
energy from the mind is through things


---------64:34----------
like therapy


---------64:35----------
but essentially what you're doing is


---------64:37----------
letting that excess energy out


---------64:38----------
so like their thoughts and i don't know


---------64:40----------
if this makes sense this is really more


---------64:41----------
like a yogic


---------64:42----------
perspective so you can journal for


---------64:44----------
example or you could do therapy


---------64:46----------
or you could share it with a friend the


---------64:49----------
point is that you want to vent because


---------64:51----------
right now what happens when you have


---------64:52----------
thoughts


---------64:53----------
is they just bounce around in your head


---------64:54----------
and they have nowhere to go


---------64:56----------
does that make sense yep and so what you


---------64:59----------
need to do it doesn't matter whether


---------65:00----------
it's actually therapy or not but like


---------65:02----------
you just need some way to vent the


---------65:05----------
energy in the mind


---------65:06----------
and as you vent the energy in the mind


---------65:08----------
whether through journaling through


---------65:10----------
therapy through talking through a friend


---------65:11----------
doesn't


---------65:12----------
you can talk to your dog if you want to


---------65:13----------
like it doesn't really matter like it's


---------65:15----------
not about


---------65:15----------
who's on the other end it's about


---------65:20----------
venting it from your mind and then


---------65:21----------
you're gonna feel more relaxed


---------65:24----------
because it's no longer bouncing around


---------65:27----------
now the reason to do therapy is because


---------65:28----------
the person


---------65:29----------
on the other end of the table unlike a


---------65:32----------
dog is gonna be


---------65:33----------
trained at helping you vent


---------65:37----------
right what are you thinking now you


---------65:40----------
started smiling


---------65:42----------
uh my dogs are definitely not trained in


---------65:44----------
anything so


---------65:45----------
[Laughter]


---------65:47----------
they definitely they're definitely not


---------65:48----------
gonna be helping me out with anything


---------65:51----------
yeah how many dogs do you have i have


---------65:54----------
four


---------65:55----------
okay wow that's a lot man it's a lot of


---------65:59----------
dogs yep


---------66:00----------
four dogs two kids two cats oh and cats


---------66:05----------
wow so that's


---------66:09----------
busy it is very busy


---------66:13----------
and married to boot what's up


---------66:17----------
i said and married on top of that sir


---------66:19----------
yep yep


---------66:20----------
yeah wow wow it sounds like you have


---------66:23----------
quite a full life chuck


---------66:25----------
i do and i actually like it quite a bit


---------66:27----------
you know i i really do like my life i'm


---------66:30----------
i'm very you know lucky to be able to do


---------66:32----------
what i do and you know


---------66:34----------
uh afford to even have you know this


---------66:36----------
many


---------66:37----------
things relying on me um


---------66:40----------
but yeah it's just uh this is this is i


---------66:42----------
guess the one the one little


---------66:44----------
area in which i struggle with them


---------66:48----------
yeah can can we talk about when your


---------66:50----------
wife was pregnant


---------66:52----------
sure so what happened then


---------66:56----------
i mean it's hard for me to say i guess


---------66:58----------
like maybe i'm not like the greatest at


---------67:00----------
like


---------67:01----------
um i'm not the greatest at uh


---------67:06----------
i guess picking up on my emotions but i


---------67:08----------
definitely


---------67:09----------
just i started to notice like those


---------67:11----------
feelings like of anxiety like hitting me


---------67:13----------
like randomly


---------67:14----------
like you know and almost like it was


---------67:17----------
like building up like


---------67:18----------
like i was playing in like hockey


---------67:20----------
leagues and i just remember like playing


---------67:21----------
hockey and be like


---------67:23----------
feeling kind of anxious right now like


---------67:25----------
this is abnormal


---------67:26----------
like you know like you know it wasn't


---------67:29----------
just like the thoughts like oh i don't


---------67:30----------
have


---------67:31----------
like i was kind of feeling it like


---------67:33----------
almost like a panic attack was coming on


---------67:35----------
and like i said i'm pretty good at like


---------67:36----------
deterring those now just because like


---------67:39----------
as afraid as i am of them happening i'm


---------67:43----------
also like fully aware of like when


---------67:44----------
they're happening and i


---------67:45----------
and i like you know understand like


---------67:49----------
you know the more you feed in the worst


---------67:50----------
it's going to be just got to take deep


---------67:52----------
breaths and just


---------67:53----------
you know do what you got to do um


---------67:56----------
and i just it's almost like it's almost


---------67:59----------
like weird how it happened but


---------68:00----------
um you know i don't i also don't talk


---------68:03----------
about this very often but


---------68:04----------
i'm religious and i go to church and


---------68:05----------
stuff and i was just sitting in church


---------68:06----------
one day


---------68:07----------
um you know with my wife and my my dad


---------68:10----------
and


---------68:10----------
his wife his new wife and it just hit me


---------68:14----------
and i didn't have a panic attack it


---------68:16----------
didn't hit me like that


---------68:18----------
it just hit me like a wrecking ball of


---------68:21----------
nervousness where i'm just like you know


---------68:23----------
i couldn't stop shaking i couldn't stop


---------68:25----------
thinking and it's like it was like a


---------68:26----------
completely different experience of what


---------68:28----------
i experienced as my panic attack


---------68:31----------
does that make sense yeah so tell me


---------68:34----------
what was your experience of being hit


---------68:36----------
what did you get hit by it just it just


---------68:39----------
felt like


---------68:39----------
constant overthinking constant


---------68:41----------
nervousness like


---------68:43----------
i i couldn't even tell you what i was


---------68:44----------
thinking at the time but like that was


---------68:46----------
like the


---------68:46----------
the day that i kind of felt like you


---------68:48----------
know broke the broke the camel's back or


---------68:51----------
you know stroller broke the back and i


---------68:52----------
just remember


---------68:53----------
going home that night and just being


---------68:55----------
like unbelievably


---------68:56----------
nervous and i couldn't stop over


---------68:58----------
thinking and um


---------69:01----------
um you know i i have taken like you know


---------69:03----------
small dosages of xanax before


---------69:06----------
because you know i've had like this


---------69:08----------
issue for a long time it's been


---------69:09----------
prescribed i really don't take it almost


---------69:12----------
ever like literally almost ever


---------69:13----------
and i had like you know half of like a


---------69:15----------
small dose of one just kind of calm me


---------69:17----------
down a little bit


---------69:18----------
and i just kind of thought like


---------69:21----------
um i guess just like random stuff like


---------69:24----------
this this is completely like


---------69:26----------
maybe irrelevant but like one of the


---------69:28----------
thoughts in my mind was like


---------69:29----------
the lead singer of linkin park or maybe


---------69:32----------
not the lead singer but he like recently


---------69:33----------
committed suicide and i'm like


---------69:35----------
is this why is it is this what he was


---------69:37----------
dealing with like that that thought has


---------69:38----------
crossed my mind before too where it's


---------69:40----------
like


---------69:41----------
is this what people you know decide to


---------69:45----------
say like they can't take it anymore and


---------69:47----------
like that obviously really scared me and


---------69:49----------
um yeah it's just


---------69:52----------
you know that day it never like really


---------69:54----------
got better like that was the day where


---------69:56----------
for months


---------69:57----------
i couldn't live my life like literally


---------70:00----------
every single day i would wake up


---------70:02----------
first thing on my mind i would i sleep


---------70:04----------
like a rock so i would go to sleep and i


---------70:06----------
wake up


---------70:06----------
shaking and the first thing on my mind


---------70:07----------
is like okay i'm anxious okay like i'm


---------70:09----------
gonna have panic attack today


---------70:10----------
like even even like even today like the


---------70:14----------
first thing when i open my mind


---------70:16----------
the first word on my in my my head is


---------70:18----------
anxiety


---------70:19----------
every single day like and it wasn't


---------70:22----------
always like that you know sometimes i


---------70:24----------
could wake up and


---------70:25----------
i wouldn't think about it for a few


---------70:26----------
hours but it is literally the


---------70:28----------
default thought process in my brain


---------70:30----------
right now is just that word


---------70:32----------
like anxiety sounds angry


---------70:36----------
it sucks i i just don't like it you know


---------70:38----------
it bothers me


---------70:39----------
i don't want it to be there you know i


---------70:42----------
wake up in the morning with my kids


---------70:44----------
or my dogs or whatever reasons the first


---------70:45----------
thing i think about


---------70:47----------
you know it's what i got to think about


---------70:48----------
before i go to sleep and you know it's


---------70:50----------
like


---------70:51----------
i just don't like most of the time i


---------70:53----------
will say it's definitely better as of


---------70:55----------
recently


---------70:55----------
i don't have what i want to call it my


---------70:57----------
peace of mind i don't have my mind just


---------70:59----------
resting thinking about


---------71:00----------
useless stuff you know it's just it's


---------71:03----------
just always


---------71:04----------
lasered in on this subject most of the


---------71:06----------
time sometimes i do


---------71:07----------
and sometimes i'll literally like get a


---------71:09----------
break and i'll be like


---------71:10----------
wow i was thinking about random stuff


---------71:12----------
well now that i'm thinking about this


---------71:14----------
now it's time to think about anxiety


---------71:15----------
like it literally like circles back like


---------71:17----------
oh wow i had a break i can't believe i


---------71:20----------
had a break


---------71:21----------
now i'm not gonna have a break because


---------71:22----------
i'm overthinking it like


---------71:25----------
uh chuck is there a part of you that's


---------71:27----------
afraid that like something fundamentally


---------71:29----------
broke that day and will never be fixed


---------71:32----------
maybe essentially like i do think like


---------71:34----------
you know maybe i'll never have like what


---------71:36----------
was my normal


---------71:37----------
um i think like maybe that's kind of


---------71:39----------
like why sometimes i


---------71:41----------
i'm actually afraid to get help because


---------71:43----------
what if it doesn't help


---------71:45----------
you know what if all the stuff that is


---------71:47----------
supposed to help me


---------71:48----------
doesn't help


---------71:51----------
so what i'm hearing is that you know if


---------71:53----------
you get help if you as long as you're


---------71:55----------
not getting help you're delaying


---------71:57----------
final doom potentially uh


---------72:00----------
um you know a good reason to avoid help


---------72:04----------
yeah i just


---------72:08----------
yeah i'm just stuck in a loophole it


---------72:10----------
feels like that just doesn't end


---------72:14----------
i'm sorry bro yeah i appreciate it


---------72:18----------
can i offer a couple of thoughts


---------72:20----------
absolutely


---------72:22----------
so i don't think you are broken


---------72:27----------
i think what you have can be fixed


---------72:31----------
um i think that the mind has an amazing


---------72:35----------
reparative quality


---------72:38----------
um the body has an amazing reparative


---------72:40----------
quality


---------72:42----------
i think that um somehow what what you're


---------72:46----------
doing is you're doing like


---------72:47----------
end game content at level 52 that's what


---------72:50----------
it feels like to me


---------72:52----------
i actually feel like you're doing


---------72:53----------
remarkably well given how much you've


---------72:56----------
handicapped yourself


---------72:59----------
i think it's really amazing that you've


---------73:01----------
uh you know managed to


---------73:04----------
continue to build a life and not let


---------73:06----------
what sounds like truly crippling levels


---------73:08----------
of anxiety


---------73:10----------
and and by crippling what i mean is like


---------73:13----------
not that they're crippling in their


---------73:14----------
intensity but they're like


---------73:17----------
you sound to be like a dude who's been


---------73:20----------
you know raiding for the last three


---------73:22----------
years


---------73:23----------
in one encounter


---------73:26----------
like you've just been like it's a


---------73:28----------
marathon man like i'm hearing a marathon


---------73:30----------
of just never ending and like somehow


---------73:35----------
you know you're still like you haven't


---------73:37----------
wiped yet


---------73:38----------
and and it's it's kind of like what i'm


---------73:40----------
hearing from you in terms of


---------73:42----------
you know getting treatment is that


---------73:43----------
there's a lot of like resistance


---------73:46----------
and that resistance comes from first of


---------73:48----------
all the fear that like what if this


---------73:49----------
doesn't help because then you're like


---------73:51----------
truly sol like


---------73:52----------
like it's it's kind of interesting but


---------73:53----------
sometimes the reason that we don't


---------73:56----------
shoot our shot is because if we fail


---------73:59----------
then we've got nothing


---------74:02----------
you know i see this oddly enough in the


---------74:03----------
weirdest places like people who


---------74:05----------
like have a crush and like as long as i


---------74:08----------
don't get rejected there's


---------74:10----------
always the chance that something will


---------74:12----------
happen but if i shoot my shot


---------74:14----------
and they say no it's like then i'm truly


---------74:17----------
finished


---------74:19----------
right and and so i sort of get where


---------74:22----------
you're coming from because i think that


---------74:24----------
there is


---------74:25----------
that too is like by the way a product of


---------74:27----------
your mind it's not like it's not like


---------74:29----------
you know you're incorrect i imagine that


---------74:33----------
there have been experiences in your life


---------74:35----------
where you've like


---------74:37----------
put yourself out there like and this


---------74:40----------
could be like really small kind of


---------74:41----------
insignificant things but like where you


---------74:43----------
told your dad dad i'm hungry


---------74:45----------
and he's like no way you're getting food


---------74:49----------
it didn't exactly happen like that but


---------74:51----------
yeah right and so like your mind learned


---------74:53----------
early on that like


---------74:55----------
and then maybe even like your mom would


---------74:57----------
have said oh well like now that you


---------74:58----------
asked your dad i can't sneak it for you


---------75:01----------
but in limbo there's like there's some


---------75:03----------
kind of


---------75:04----------
you know in limbo we can actually


---------75:06----------
benefit


---------75:07----------
um so so i sort of get that you're kind


---------75:10----------
of feeling like fatalistic about it


---------75:13----------
um i think that a lot of your fears are


---------75:15----------
also kind of coming in there where like


---------75:17----------
there's this


---------75:18----------
like you know this mention this thing


---------75:19----------
about linkin park and it's sort of like


---------75:21----------
if i try to get help and it doesn't work


---------75:24----------
what i


---------75:24----------
see you kind of being afraid of is then


---------75:26----------
you wind up where that guy was


---------75:30----------
i'm very afraid of that yeah right so so


---------75:33----------
this is where like


---------75:34----------
you know


---------75:38----------
i can understand that you're afraid of


---------75:40----------
it but that's actually what gives me


---------75:41----------
hope


---------75:42----------
because that crap we can deal with like


---------75:45----------
you know deal


---------75:46----------
like like chuck the reason i'm hopeful


---------75:49----------
for you is because i think you actually


---------75:50----------
haven't you're i mean there you are in


---------75:53----------
the level 60 raid


---------75:54----------
being level 52 and you're like i don't


---------75:57----------
know if i can win and what i see is like


---------75:59----------
bro you can level you can gain eight


---------76:01----------
levels


---------76:03----------
there's still a lot of things that you


---------76:05----------
can try it sounds like you haven't tried


---------76:06----------
psychotherapy


---------76:08----------
you know it sounds like maybe a


---------76:09----------
reformulation of your diagnosis


---------76:11----------
it sounds like like continuing to learn


---------76:14----------
like different kinds of breathing


---------76:15----------
practices


---------76:16----------
learning meditation doing some of this


---------76:18----------
exploratory work


---------76:19----------
potentially journaling or other things


---------76:21----------
there's a lot of stuff


---------76:23----------
that you can still do so oddly enough


---------76:27----------
even though you feel like a little bit


---------76:29----------
hopeless


---------76:30----------
or really what i'm getting from you is


---------76:31----------
that you don't want to roll the dice and


---------76:33----------
wind up hopeless


---------76:35----------
yeah um but what i'm really seeing is


---------76:38----------
that there's like you're kind of like


---------76:40----------
i'm opening up your character and like


---------76:41----------
i'm seeing that you have a sword and


---------76:43----------
shield equipped but you don't


---------76:45----------
you don't even have a helmet on and like


---------76:48----------
you don't even have boots on


---------76:50----------
and it's like there's a lot you can do


---------76:51----------
because then then what it's almost like


---------76:53----------
you're going into a raid and you're like


---------76:55----------
okay i can wipe and at least i have an


---------76:57----------
excuse for wiping because i don't even


---------76:59----------
have the right gear


---------77:00----------
but if i gear up properly and then i


---------77:03----------
wipe well then like then i can't clear


---------77:06----------
it


---------77:06----------
right like i have nothing nothing left


---------77:09----------
no excuses does that make sense or is


---------77:11----------
that just is my analogy just getting


---------77:13----------
worse and worse and worse


---------77:14----------
i but i understand so so those are the


---------77:17----------
things that actually make me really


---------77:18----------
hopeful for you that i think if you like


---------77:20----------
you know if you


---------77:20----------
put on if you fill up every gear slot


---------77:24----------
don't even worry about like enchanting


---------77:26----------
and putting in gems and crap like that


---------77:28----------
because you have all that too i mean


---------77:29----------
we're talking


---------77:30----------
about basics we're not even talking


---------77:31----------
about i mean there are some people who


---------77:33----------
will come in and we'll have like five


---------77:35----------
years of therapy under their belt


---------77:36----------
and i'm still hopeful because they


---------77:38----------
haven't tried this other kind of therapy


---------77:40----------
and so there's a lot of like enchanting


---------77:42----------
and like you know gem


---------77:44----------
kind of work and like other kinds of set


---------77:47----------
bonuses


---------77:47----------
like we haven't even gotten there we're


---------77:49----------
talking about the basics we're talking


---------77:50----------
about


---------77:51----------
finding a therapist and like talking to


---------77:53----------
them about something like that how do


---------77:55----------
you feel about that


---------77:56----------
now anyway i guess i i guess i


---------78:00----------
can try and find a therapist like i said


---------78:02----------
you know i kind of for a while


---------78:04----------
felt like if i went to a therapist it


---------78:05----------
could like


---------78:07----------
i i don't know i it's something i didn't


---------78:10----------
necessarily want to do i guess like my


---------78:13----------
my thought process was like you know


---------78:15----------
does this make me crazy


---------78:16----------
like or something like that


---------78:21----------
yeah i mean how do you feel about that i


---------78:23----------
mean


---------78:24----------
i definitely can see uh


---------78:28----------
positive benefits of talking about it in


---------78:29----------
general you know i mean like in just


---------78:32----------
i'll tell you right now like generally


---------78:33----------
speaking twitch chat is not


---------78:35----------
all these you know in some sections it's


---------78:38----------
not the place to be vulnerable and like


---------78:40----------
me me like having that experience on


---------78:43----------
stream


---------78:43----------
and like getting like such a positive uh


---------78:46----------
benefit


---------78:47----------
out of it when i was like my most


---------78:49----------
vulnerable like


---------78:50----------
you know it definitely means that


---------78:53----------
talking about it has got to be


---------78:55----------
good because it made things better


---------78:58----------
you know so yeah so chuck i i think


---------79:01----------
first of all


---------79:02----------
i think that we all do this where i


---------79:04----------
think we


---------79:07----------
aren't entirely fair to twitch at


---------79:09----------
because i find that twitch chat


---------79:11----------
is almost like a kid where like the


---------79:14----------
the standard that you hold them up to is


---------79:17----------
the standard that they're going to live


---------79:18----------
up to


---------79:19----------
fair enough and and so sometimes you


---------79:22----------
know parents will come to me with


---------79:23----------
problematic kids so like i once had this


---------79:25----------
kid who was


---------79:26----------
you know having a lot of behavioral


---------79:28----------
problems and


---------79:30----------
my treatment for him was to hook him up


---------79:33----------
he was a


---------79:33----------
high school kid to set him up with an


---------79:36----------
internship at harvard medical school


---------79:38----------
and i was like this kid's problem is


---------79:40----------
that like


---------79:41----------
people are not treating they're treating


---------79:43----------
him too lowly


---------79:45----------
and that's what i found with with twitch


---------79:46----------
chat is when you when you act like


---------79:48----------
twitch chat is a bunch


---------79:50----------
of degenerate noobs they'll live up to


---------79:53----------
your expectations


---------79:54----------
and when you act like twitch chat can


---------79:58----------
save the world


---------79:59----------
they won't let you down whatever your


---------80:01----------
expectations are twitch chat will


---------80:04----------
arise to meet them i want to just talk


---------80:07----------
about one thing that you said that if


---------80:08----------
you see a therapist that kind of makes


---------80:10----------
you crazy


---------80:11----------
so this is going to sound kind of weird


---------80:13----------
that was like my thought process in a


---------80:14----------
sense yes it's a completely reasonable


---------80:16----------
thought process


---------80:17----------
so so i don't think that people are


---------80:20----------
crazy


---------80:21----------
like makes me crazy so i definitely


---------80:24----------
think that you know some of the


---------80:25----------
experiences you're describing


---------80:27----------
i think like crazy sort of fits right


---------80:30----------
but like i


---------80:30----------
i think this is important to understand


---------80:32----------
i i'm not trying to be judgmental but i


---------80:34----------
want you to understand that like


---------80:36----------
the experiences that you had are quite


---------80:38----------
drastic


---------80:39----------
and outside of the realm of normal


---------80:42----------
experience


---------80:43----------
and at the same time that doesn't say


---------80:44----------
anything about you as a person


---------80:46----------
and and i'm sorry if this you know is


---------80:49----------
offensive but


---------80:50----------
i want everyone to understand that our


---------80:52----------
mind has crazy experiences it's just


---------80:55----------
what our mind does and and i don't think


---------80:58----------
you're crazy you actually


---------81:00----------
sound shocked to me to be incredibly


---------81:02----------
sane and like i said


---------81:03----------
even some of these things like if i


---------81:05----------
ignore my anxiety and it'll go away


---------81:07----------
a lot of people will hear that and think


---------81:09----------
that it's stupid i think it's actually


---------81:11----------
brilliant


---------81:12----------
because i think it's what you have


---------81:14----------
learned that actually works


---------81:16----------
and one of the biggest things that i try


---------81:17----------
to explain to people is that the mind


---------81:19----------
oftentimes doesn't malfunction


---------81:21----------
the mind functions the best way it knows


---------81:23----------
how to and when we stop us


---------81:26----------
when we start when we stop assuming that


---------81:28----------
the mind is broken


---------81:30----------
is when we truly get power over it


---------81:32----------
that's when we truly understand it


---------81:33----------
that everything that your mind does


---------81:35----------
usually and not everything but a lot of


---------81:37----------
what your mind does is for a reason


---------81:39----------
and the more that we understand even


---------81:41----------
your resistance to therapy is completely


---------81:43----------
logical


---------81:44----------
right there's a lot of stuff riding on


---------81:46----------
that like you know


---------81:47----------
you're kind of like because your


---------81:48----------
strategy is to ignore it and it'll go


---------81:50----------
away going to therapy is like the


---------81:52----------
opposite of your winning strategy


---------81:53----------
so of course you're going to be


---------81:54----------
resistant to it and it's not it's not


---------81:56----------
dumb to be resistant to therapy it makes


---------81:58----------
a lot of sense


---------81:59----------
but now this is where i would ask you


---------82:01----------
you know how is your experience today


---------82:03----------
talking about it been it's been fine


---------82:06----------
like obviously i was like a little


---------82:07----------
nervous about being on here and stuff


---------82:08----------
but i'd


---------82:10----------
you know i i feel like uh i've benefited


---------82:14----------
being on here today and i knew i would


---------82:17----------
well number one i feel like uh i'm kind


---------82:19----------
of like getting over fears of sharing


---------82:22----------
um and i feel like that was something


---------82:24----------
that i


---------82:25----------
i definitely didn't do especially with


---------82:26----------
strangers um number two you know you


---------82:29----------
kind of


---------82:29----------
are uh making me feel like a little less


---------82:32----------
bad about myself saying like some of the


---------82:34----------
strategies and stuff that you know


---------82:36----------
i've been doing is okay and like i'm


---------82:38----------
having like normal thought processes and


---------82:40----------
stuff like that


---------82:40----------
so um i don't know it's just like


---------82:44----------
reassuring i guess


---------82:45----------
yeah why are you smiling now


---------82:50----------
i guess i like to be right i answered


---------82:53----------
your question right


---------82:54----------
i i i don't know i mean you're


---------82:57----------
you're the one who tell i asked you how


---------83:00----------
it's it's your answer


---------83:03----------
i don't know the right answer you have


---------83:05----------
the right answer chuck


---------83:06----------
um but yeah i mean i i think you've done


---------83:09----------
a really good job today i think it's


---------83:11----------
you know i do not envy you i think you


---------83:14----------
you come across


---------83:15----------
as an incredibly i think you're


---------83:16----------
incredibly strong chuck


---------83:18----------
like when i hear about the fullness of


---------83:20----------
your life like i understand that you're


---------83:22----------
grateful and stuff which is all awesome


---------83:23----------
but


---------83:25----------
it doesn't sound easy bro it's not


---------83:29----------
you know to wake up with anxiety every


---------83:31----------
day it just doesn't sound


---------83:33----------
easy for sure


---------83:37----------
yeah man and so what i'm really hoping i


---------83:39----------
i think you'd


---------83:40----------
you don't need to i mean i i don't think


---------83:42----------
you deserve to be


---------83:43----------
fight you know running that marathon and


---------83:46----------
this epic


---------83:47----------
never-ending struggle against anxiety


---------83:50----------
and my hope is that some of these like


---------83:52----------
really simple principles like


---------83:54----------
um


---------83:58----------
you know venting some of that energy


---------84:00----------
from your mind because


---------84:01----------
you know when you say that you wake up


---------84:02----------
and anxiety is the first thing there


---------84:04----------
it's because


---------84:05----------
it's like a gas that's trapped you've


---------84:07----------
like farted into a bottle


---------84:09----------
and you've closed the stopper and so


---------84:11----------
like


---------84:12----------
in that bottle is methane and it smells


---------84:15----------
bad and what you've really got to do is


---------84:17----------
just pop that cork and


---------84:18----------
let that bad boy rip you know


---------84:22----------
and and so there's a lot of negativity


---------84:24----------
in there there's a lot of fear in there


---------84:26----------
i understand that you


---------84:27----------
carry it every day with like you carry


---------84:30----------
it right that's the best word that i


---------84:32----------
have


---------84:32----------
i think it's an encumbrance problem more


---------84:34----------
than anything else


---------84:36----------
and and so i really hope that you can


---------84:39----------
you know i'd strongly ask you to


---------84:41----------
consider you know really seeing a


---------84:43----------
therapist


---------84:44----------
i definitely will look into it for sure


---------84:46----------
i guess um


---------84:47----------
i just got to try and find someone with


---------84:49----------
good reviews because i don't you know i


---------84:51----------
don't want to get someone that


---------84:52----------
isn't right for me i suppose sure so i


---------84:55----------
think that good reviews go a long way


---------84:57----------
but


---------84:57----------
fit goes a long way too so a couple of


---------84:59----------
rules of thumb and you know if you need


---------85:01----------
a little bit of support i think we've


---------85:02----------
got like a


---------85:03----------
you know quick guide or something we can


---------85:05----------
send your way about finding a good


---------85:06----------
therapist


---------85:07----------
we do have a creator coaching program


---------85:10----------
which normally at this point in the


---------85:11----------
interview i would recommend to some


---------85:12----------
people


---------85:13----------
i think you should actually see a


---------85:14----------
therapist though you're welcome to sign


---------85:16----------
up for our coaching program like they


---------85:17----------
work with things like


---------85:18----------
you know they're more specialized in


---------85:19----------
things like burnout and imposter


---------85:22----------
syndrome


---------85:22----------
and and those kinds of things so they


---------85:24----------
work with we have a contract with twitch


---------85:26----------
so twitch is actually sponsoring it


---------85:28----------
um but i think in your case i would go


---------85:30----------
see a therapist


---------85:32----------
i think that's really um and you could


---------85:33----------
try out coaching if you want to but


---------85:35----------
but i really think that you know mental


---------85:37----------
health treatment is


---------85:38----------
appropriate for you um does that sound


---------85:41----------
judgmental to you


---------85:43----------
no okay do you have any questions for me


---------85:47----------
how long no i know i sort of feel like


---------85:50----------
we're at a decent stopping point but at


---------85:52----------
the same time you know there are a lot


---------85:54----------
of other things that we could talk about


---------85:56----------
like i'm still you know i think another


---------85:58----------
thing that is worth digging into is the


---------86:00----------
sort of


---------86:00----------
whatever happened subconsciously when


---------86:03----------
your wife became pregnant


---------86:05----------
and and you know how that i think that


---------86:08----------
may be a conversation for another day


---------86:10----------
um because i don't know how short that's


---------86:12----------
going to be but


---------86:15----------
i sort of feel like this is a decent


---------86:19----------
stopping point because i've shared a lot


---------86:21----------
with you


---------86:21----------
and i'd love it if you could kind of


---------86:23----------
digest that and i don't wanna


---------86:25----------
how can i say this sometimes i reach a


---------86:26----------
point in a conversation where i i feel


---------86:28----------
if we keep talking


---------86:30----------
we may start to overwrite what we've


---------86:32----------
covered so far


---------86:34----------
and my real desire to potentially pause


---------86:37----------
is because i don't think that anything


---------86:38----------
we're going to


---------86:39----------
talk about now will outweigh the value


---------86:41----------
of what we've talked about


---------86:43----------
already if that makes sense


---------86:46----------
does that sound okay to you yeah


---------86:48----------
absolutely


---------86:49----------
do you have any questions i


---------86:52----------
i don't i'm not i'm not a question guy


---------86:54----------
really i just can't okay


---------87:00----------
i'm intrigued by what


---------87:03----------
what does that mean to not be a question


---------87:05----------
guy but so be it i'll just let that


---------87:07----------
curiosity ride but go ahead


---------87:10----------
i just i uh i just generally people


---------87:13----------
always ask when you're done do you have


---------87:14----------
any questions and i always i'm the one


---------87:15----------
that looks at my wife like


---------87:18----------
because i'm good to go okay okay so and


---------87:21----------
then um are you interested in learning


---------87:22----------
meditation


---------87:24----------
um possibly i suppose


---------87:27----------
um i didn't really like so honestly i


---------87:30----------
had like this


---------87:31----------
fear of kind of like being alone with my


---------87:33----------
thoughts


---------87:34----------
um but like since i do the deep


---------87:37----------
breathing like i kind of close my eyes


---------87:40----------
and it's gonna sound like the craziest


---------87:42----------
thing ever but


---------87:43----------
when i do my deep breathing i would say


---------87:48----------
maybe just briefly for a second if that


---------87:50----------
there's


---------87:51----------
no negativity there's no anxiety you


---------87:54----------
know i mean like it's just completely


---------87:56----------
it's like all these like random thoughts


---------87:59----------
that make absolutely


---------88:00----------
no sense just kind of like pop into my


---------88:02----------
brain


---------88:03----------
like like it was my normal you know what


---------88:06----------
i mean


---------88:07----------
and um i would say that i was like


---------88:08----------
really afraid of that for a long time


---------88:10----------
and then doing that for the first night


---------88:11----------
i was like holy crap


---------88:12----------
like i guess this works you know so i


---------88:15----------
guess uh i guess i


---------88:16----------
could be interested in learning


---------88:18----------
meditation but like i was that was


---------88:20----------
something that i would have been opposed


---------88:21----------
to for a long time until i started


---------88:22----------
trying that breathing technique


---------88:24----------
okay so a couple of other reassuring


---------88:28----------
points so there's something cool about


---------88:29----------
meditation


---------88:31----------
so when you do your deep breathing


---------88:33----------
you're back to normal


---------88:35----------
and when you stop doing your deep


---------88:36----------
breathing normal


---------88:38----------
ends right


---------88:42----------
for the most part yeah but it's like


---------88:43----------
it's just kind of like me being weird


---------88:45----------
like


---------88:45----------
did that help like yeah you know is this


---------88:48----------
going to help like


---------88:49----------
so this is what studies on meditation


---------88:51----------
show that generally speaking when we


---------88:54----------
meditate


---------88:55----------
it creates temporary changes to our mind


---------88:58----------
and the longer that we meditate if you


---------89:00----------
meditate for at least 20 minutes a day


---------89:02----------
three days a week that's the bare


---------89:04----------
minimum the cool thing about meditation


---------89:06----------
is that


---------89:07----------
the longer you meditate and the better


---------89:09----------
you get at it


---------89:10----------
the more the longer the buff lasts


---------89:13----------
so it's sort of like when you start


---------89:15----------
meditating the buff lasts simply for the


---------89:17----------
duration of the channeling


---------89:18----------
so i'm going to channel meditation and


---------89:20----------
that's when i'm going to regain mana


---------89:22----------
right it's like what's that mage spell


---------89:24----------
that education


---------89:25----------
yeah so like for evocation i only gain


---------89:28----------
mana as long as i'm channeling


---------89:29----------
but something really magical happens


---------89:31----------
with meditation which is that


---------89:33----------
it reaches a point where it starts to


---------89:35----------
rewire your brain


---------89:37----------
and you actually like have a magnetic


---------89:39----------
post channeling


---------89:42----------
and this idea of like long-term


---------89:44----------
meditators who


---------89:45----------
throughout their entire day they're


---------89:47----------
happier and their anxiety is lower on a


---------89:49----------
baseline level


---------89:51----------
and that's because like as we literally


---------89:53----------
rewire our brain


---------89:55----------
there your neurons so thoughts are


---------89:57----------
generated by neurons


---------89:59----------
and so as you train your brain to


---------90:02----------
have senseless thoughts instead of


---------90:04----------
anxious thoughts those


---------90:06----------
patterns of neurons will start to like


---------90:08----------
wire together and then they'll activate


---------90:10----------
and then you'll be back to your normal


---------90:11----------
thinking um


---------90:14----------
i have worked with people and taught


---------90:15----------
them so people who have had


---------90:17----------
anxiety disorders like diagnose anxiety


---------90:20----------
disorders on medication for a decade


---------90:22----------
and after about a year or two of


---------90:24----------
medication they will be in what we call


---------90:26----------
in psychiatry's sustained remission


---------90:28----------
because we don't use the word cure


---------90:30----------
because who knows


---------90:32----------
so what sustained remission is is like


---------90:34----------
people who


---------90:37----------
don't have anxiety and are off of


---------90:40----------
medication


---------90:42----------
and you know i'm thinking about a


---------90:43----------
particular person it took like two years


---------90:46----------
but you know i think that it that is


---------90:48----------
possible um


---------90:50----------
so now i've got two options for you


---------90:53----------
one is that i've got a technique that


---------90:58----------
is a little bit of a high risk high


---------91:00----------
reward technique


---------91:03----------
so what i mean by that is that it's it's


---------91:05----------
a technique that's really going to work


---------91:06----------
on a physiologic level


---------91:08----------
and so when you have anxiety and like


---------91:10----------
kind of panic stuff i want you to


---------91:11----------
understand that


---------91:12----------
you know how it like hits you out of the


---------91:13----------
blue right so the mental process is not


---------91:16----------
the start


---------91:17----------
the start is actually physiology so


---------91:20----------
you have a physiologic change which then


---------91:22----------
triggers particular thoughts does that


---------91:24----------
make sense


---------91:26----------
um yes okay so there's a particular


---------91:30----------
technique that i think will work on your


---------91:32----------
physiology but may actually oddly enough


---------91:35----------
induce a little bit of anxiety if we do


---------91:37----------
it now if you're calm


---------91:40----------
but the idea behind this technique is


---------91:42----------
that


---------91:43----------
we're going to create anxiety and then


---------91:45----------
teach you how to get out of it


---------91:48----------
and so if you're already anxious it


---------91:49----------
won't make it worse but you'll kind of


---------91:51----------
practice it getting out of it


---------91:53----------
that's sort of what i what i feel like


---------91:55----------
teaching you today but i just want to be


---------91:56----------
a little bit cautious


---------91:58----------
um and then i have a more sort of stable


---------92:01----------
normal technique which is going to be


---------92:02----------
like


---------92:02----------
easy peasy lemon squeezy it's like do


---------92:05----------
you want an elite mob or do you want a


---------92:07----------
regular mob like what do you want to


---------92:08----------
grind on today


---------92:10----------
i feel like would you judge me if i just


---------92:12----------
say the regular one


---------92:13----------
not at all okay because i feel like


---------92:16----------
generally speaking like


---------92:18----------
i feel like my anxiety is always kind of


---------92:20----------
at a base level


---------92:21----------
you know for the most part and i feel


---------92:23----------
like i do like a pretty decent job


---------92:25----------
kind of like keeping myself calm and i


---------92:27----------
guess like


---------92:28----------
having that potentially be raised


---------92:32----------
like i don't know that scares me a


---------92:33----------
little bit that's totally fine that's


---------92:35----------
so so i you know the reason that i i


---------92:38----------
don't judge you at all


---------92:40----------
and the reason i give you the choice is


---------92:42----------
because i acknowledge that that could be


---------92:44----------
a concern


---------92:45----------
right so it's not like oh like you're


---------92:47----------
not going to go and they like you


---------92:48----------
you're like i don't want to wipe on the


---------92:49----------
elite mob and then run back


---------92:51----------
you know it's just i ain't nobody got


---------92:54----------
time for that i can get


---------92:55----------
elite mob is worth 20 more xp but like


---------92:58----------
grinding on regular mobs is normally how


---------92:59----------
you play wow right so


---------93:01----------
totally fine okay so i'm going to teach


---------93:03----------
you something called


---------93:04----------
um alternate nostril breathing okay


---------93:07----------
tends to be my go-to technique


---------93:10----------
but is really good from a physiologic


---------93:12----------
perspective as well but won't make


---------93:13----------
anything worse okay


---------93:14----------
so can you do so take your right hand


---------93:18----------
stick out your thumb and then can you


---------93:20----------
lift these two fingers


---------93:22----------
good so what i'm gonna do you have a


---------93:25----------
deviated septum by the way


---------93:27----------
i don't think so okay so what i'm gonna


---------93:30----------
do


---------93:31----------
and do it with me is block my right


---------93:32----------
nostril breathe in through my left


---------93:35----------
[Laughter]


---------93:36----------
[Music]


---------93:40----------
and then with a chest full of air i'm


---------93:42----------
going to block the other nostril with


---------93:43----------
the other two fingers


---------93:45----------
and then breathe out


---------93:51----------
breathe in through the same nostril


---------93:53----------
without switching


---------93:58----------
switch and breathe out


---------94:06----------
in


---------94:13----------
switch out


---------94:22----------
in


---------94:28----------
switch out


---------94:34----------
good now close your eyes and go at your


---------94:36----------
own pace


---------94:37----------
remember that you want to switch on a


---------94:39----------
full breath


---------94:48----------
good and then exhale and inhale again


---------94:51----------
through the same nostril and then switch


---------94:54----------
we'll practice for about two minutes


---------95:12----------
so


---------95:26----------
cool


---------97:11----------
let your eyes remain closed


---------97:14----------
go ahead and finish the breath that


---------97:16----------
you're on


---------97:16----------
[Music]


---------97:18----------
and relax just sit with yourself


---------97:30----------
if you want to continue deep breathing


---------97:32----------
you can but we'll just sort of sit


---------97:34----------
in silent meditation for about a minute


---------98:14----------
fish


---------98:18----------
now i want you to breathe in for three


---------98:20----------
seconds


---------98:21----------
and out for three


---------98:29----------
and now in for three and out for


---------98:33----------
five


---------98:42----------
and then in for three and out for seven


---------98:55----------
as you're ready to breathe in again


---------98:57----------
slowly open your eyes


---------99:25----------
supposed to say anything if you want to


---------99:32----------
i wasn't sure if you're waiting on me


---------99:37----------
yeah not really it's kind of awkward for


---------99:40----------
people they don't really know what


---------99:41----------
they're supposed to do


---------99:43----------
i would definitely say this is a little


---------99:44----------
bit you know


---------99:46----------
i would say that this is probably not a


---------99:47----------
very good public practice i feel like


---------99:49----------
people probably watching the stream are


---------99:51----------
probably like


---------99:52----------
you know okay we'll just sit here and


---------99:53----------
wait for him to finish his breathing you


---------99:55----------
know


---------99:57----------
yeah well ideally what happens is people


---------100:00----------
are meditating with us


---------100:02----------
oh okay that makes sense that definitely


---------100:05----------
that definitely makes a lot more sense


---------100:08----------
i guess i should have instructed people


---------100:09----------
but i hope i'm noticing now that you


---------100:11----------
were anxious about that


---------100:13----------
no not necessarily i just thought it was


---------100:15----------
kind of funny okay


---------100:20----------
hmm


---------100:22----------
yeah what was that like for you chuck it


---------100:25----------
was good


---------100:26----------
i mean um you know like i said i


---------100:29----------
i enjoy my deep breathing quite a bit i


---------100:31----------
feel like it just kind of takes my


---------100:33----------
my mind to a nice rested place


---------100:37----------
of relaxation and i like it quite a bit


---------100:39----------
like i i almost like i don't want to say


---------100:40----------
i look forward to it because maybe that


---------100:42----------
sounds dreadful that like i look forward


---------100:44----------
to


---------100:44----------
you know my 15 minutes before bed um


---------100:48----------
in my 15 minutes waking up but uh yeah


---------100:51----------
it's it's just nice like it's just


---------100:52----------
it's nice to have that nice like


---------100:54----------
relaxation before you sleep and like


---------100:56----------
when you wake up


---------100:57----------
although i must say like i have a little


---------100:58----------
bit of a different schedule where like


---------101:00----------
um


---------101:01----------
my wife wakes up with a kid so i wake up


---------101:03----------
a little earlier to feed the dogs or


---------101:04----------
else they go crazy


---------101:05----------
so i wake up and then i don't do my


---------101:06----------
breathing then i feed them and i kind of


---------101:08----------
chill for like 20 minutes while they're


---------101:09----------
outside then i go back upstairs and then


---------101:11----------
i go to sleep


---------101:12----------
and then i wake up for real and then i


---------101:14----------
do my breathing so maybe there's like a


---------101:15----------
little bit of a disconnect there i'm not


---------101:17----------
really sure


---------101:19----------
but yeah yeah i mean i don't think it


---------101:21----------
sounds bad at all


---------101:22----------
it sounds like you essentially you're


---------101:23----------
meditating um when you're doing deep


---------101:25----------
breathing


---------101:26----------
and yeah and yeah i don't think it


---------101:28----------
sounds crazy at all to look forward to


---------101:30----------
meditating


---------101:31----------
um you know just a couple things so


---------101:33----------
first thing is that do whatever practice


---------101:35----------
works for you


---------101:37----------
sometimes people find that so this


---------101:40----------
practice works a little bit more


---------101:41----------
physiologically than just plain deep


---------101:43----------
breathing


---------101:43----------
but the most important common element


---------101:46----------
chuck


---------101:47----------
is the length of your exhalation


---------101:49----------
correlates with the slowness of your


---------101:51----------
mind


---------101:52----------
so the longer you exhale the slower your


---------101:55----------
mind will be


---------101:56----------
um the question so you were instructing


---------101:59----------
three seconds of inhale


---------102:00----------
uh with longer exhales is that something


---------102:02----------
that you would recommend for deep


---------102:03----------
breathing too because generally i do


---------102:04----------
like


---------102:05----------
as big as i can and then let out as big


---------102:07----------
as i can and i definitely notice like


---------102:09----------
when i let out


---------102:10----------
like i try and like fully deflate


---------102:12----------
because i feel like that


---------102:14----------
that always feels like really good so so


---------102:18----------
not really so what i'm telling you is


---------102:20----------
the most important thing is the full


---------102:21----------
deflation


---------102:23----------
okay so what i uh the


---------102:26----------
reason to yeah so like that last bit


---------102:29----------
is really about coming out of the


---------102:31----------
meditative state and kind of like


---------102:33----------
re-anchoring us into the world


---------102:35----------
um but the length of the exhalation is


---------102:37----------
the most important thing so the reason


---------102:39----------
that this


---------102:39----------
meditative the one nostril breathing


---------102:41----------
practice is that it just slows your


---------102:43----------
breathing down because you're using half


---------102:45----------
your nostrils


---------102:47----------
to let the air in and let the air out


---------102:49----------
there are also some other kind of weird


---------102:51----------
physiologic things like it sort of


---------102:52----------
balances


---------102:53----------
it deactivates your parasympathetic


---------102:54----------
nervous system which is what releases


---------102:57----------
like adrenaline


---------102:58----------
and stuff like that so it'll slow down


---------103:00----------
it'll work in a physiologic way to like


---------103:02----------
reduce your


---------103:03----------
pro-anxiety hormonal state


---------103:07----------
but deep breathing can do it too so i'd


---------103:09----------
say ultimately do what works for you


---------103:12----------
this uh technique arguably is a little


---------103:15----------
bit


---------103:15----------
it will be like statistically slightly


---------103:18----------
more successful for people with anxiety


---------103:21----------
okay so would you recommend doing this


---------103:24----------
in place of like


---------103:25----------
the deep breathing uh before or after


---------103:27----------
sleep so so i would


---------103:29----------
i would recommend that you follow what


---------103:31----------
works for you


---------103:33----------
but a good place to start would be you


---------103:36----------
figure out which one you want to do


---------103:38----------
first but i would start probably with


---------103:39----------
this one for about


---------103:41----------
five to ten minutes and then do your


---------103:43----------
normal


---------103:44----------
deep breathing for about 10 minutes with


---------103:46----------
a goal of about 20 minutes of practice


---------103:49----------
okay that's uh that's completely


---------103:51----------
reasonable


---------103:52----------
um and then


---------103:55----------
so just other questions like how long


---------103:58----------
because you were kind of instructing me


---------103:59----------
this time like how long would you say


---------104:01----------
like do the nostrils and then like


---------104:02----------
like uh switch into the uh the regular


---------104:06----------
breathing


---------104:06----------
or whatever like i guess with both


---------104:08----------
nostrils is what i'm saying


---------104:10----------
yeah so so i would say do the alternate


---------104:12----------
nostril breathing for five to ten


---------104:14----------
minutes


---------104:15----------
and then do whatever deep breathing


---------104:17----------
practice you have been doing


---------104:19----------
for about 10 minutes so uh i mean like


---------104:22----------
literally like continue to swap the


---------104:24----------
nostrils for the full 10 minutes is that


---------104:25----------
what you're saying


---------104:26----------
no yeah for five to ten minutes yeah so


---------104:28----------
okay okay


---------104:29----------
gotcha okay


---------104:33----------
okay um and then after that do your own


---------104:36----------
deep breathing practice where you know


---------104:38----------
you're doing whatever


---------104:40----------
um another question is does it matter


---------104:42----------
like


---------104:44----------
how i'm doing it like generally i kind


---------104:45----------
of do my deep breathing laying down


---------104:48----------
like kind of preparing for bed like


---------104:49----------
would it be prefer to


---------104:51----------
uh sit up or good question so the most


---------104:54----------
important thing is that your spine and


---------104:55----------
your neck are straight


---------104:57----------
so laying down works fine sitting up


---------104:59----------
works


---------105:00----------
standing up works okay but your mind


---------105:03----------
your back needs to be straight


---------105:05----------
okay i i would say though if you're


---------105:08----------
gonna do


---------105:08----------
this alternate nostril breathing


---------105:09----------
practice i would do that sitting up and


---------105:11----------
then lay down and then do your


---------105:13----------
your regular deep breathing okay


---------105:17----------
i can do that okay excellent questions


---------105:19----------
look at who has questions now [ __ ]


---------105:27----------
all right sorry i need to i didn't need


---------105:30----------
to attack on the [ __ ] at the end


---------105:31----------
but that's okay you know not a fan


---------105:35----------
oh interesting right because like


---------105:39----------
great questions really fantastic


---------105:40----------
questions chuck love them


---------105:43----------
any any other questions now i may have


---------105:45----------
embarrassed you or


---------105:46----------
tanked it but no i i i actually don't


---------105:49----------
think i have any other questions


---------105:51----------
okay great excellent questions so good


---------105:53----------
luck to you


---------105:54----------
you know um you know let me know how


---------105:56----------
things go if you


---------105:57----------
if you kind of like i think we have like


---------105:59----------
a quick guide that will send people post


---------106:01----------
stream


---------106:02----------
um i hope i'm not shooting myself in the


---------106:04----------
foot but i'm pretty sure we do this


---------106:05----------
where


---------106:06----------
you know a lot of people uh you know


---------106:07----------
have like more private questions or


---------106:09----------
things like that about how to find a


---------106:11----------
therapist and stuff


---------106:12----------
so i think we've got a you know so we


---------106:13----------
can sort of help you with


---------106:15----------
with that a little bit um you know if


---------106:18----------
you


---------106:18----------
and so just take advantage of that if


---------106:20----------
you want to


---------106:22----------
um and then you know i think if you


---------106:27----------
if you want to i think there's still


---------106:28----------
other stuff we could still talk about so


---------106:30----------
we can i don't know exactly how


---------106:31----------
scheduling works but if you ever


---------106:33----------
you know want to come back i think um


---------106:36----------
definitely we can focus a little bit


---------106:37----------
more on


---------106:37----------
on what's happened over the last three


---------106:39----------
years um


---------106:41----------
but that's also something that you you


---------106:43----------
know i you don't need to do with us


---------106:44----------
you can definitely do with your


---------106:46----------
therapist but it just feels to me like


---------106:48----------
something that was pretty significant


---------106:49----------
that we kind of didn't have time for


---------106:51----------
which is fine


---------106:52----------
but you know i would encourage you to


---------106:54----------
continue exploring that with someone


---------106:56----------
for sure sound good yeah absolutely all


---------106:59----------
right good luck to you man


---------107:00----------
thank you so much for coming on yeah


---------107:02----------
