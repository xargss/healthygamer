---------00:00----------
mm-hmm so I'm I'm gonna use like an


---------00:02----------
analogy with food okay okay so I was


---------00:06----------
eating eggs and toast this morning


---------00:08----------
and I was sitting next to my


---------00:10----------
two-year-old and she wanted to buy to my


---------00:14----------
eggs and I said sure honey take a bite


---------00:16----------
of my eggs and then I asked her can I


---------00:18----------
have a bite of your eggs and she said no


---------00:22----------
because you're my eggs daddy and I was


---------00:26----------
like how is that fair is that I mean I


---------00:30----------
realize that it's like really apples and


---------00:32----------
oranges and night and data compared to


---------00:34----------
what you're talking about but is that


---------00:34----------
the general sentiment that you're


---------00:36----------
letting these people in and they're not


---------00:38----------
letting and they're pushing you out


---------00:44----------
okay let's do this all right hey so am i


---------00:50----------
calling you milena is that right yeah


---------00:52----------
that's my name


---------00:52----------
that's my real name and twitch name and


---------00:54----------
everything okay Oh anyone twitch mm-hmm


---------00:57----------
okay cool


---------00:59----------
so how are you handling Kovan um right


---------01:03----------
now I'm in Sweden and I'm stuck here


---------01:05----------
okay I'm separated from my fiancee okay


---------01:09----------
who's best aney okay about that yeah


---------01:11----------
yeah exactly


---------01:13----------
so that kind of sucks but it's it's okay


---------01:15----------
what about you yeah so I am NOT


---------01:19----------
quarantined from my partner we are


---------01:22----------
together so I'm actually with my family


---------01:25----------
we move from Boston to Texas actually


---------01:28----------
for the duration of kovat because we


---------01:33----------
have a relatively small place in Boston


---------01:34----------
and I have two young children and so


---------01:37----------
they need a place to run around so we


---------01:39----------
came down here for a little while so


---------01:42----------
it's been yeah it's been interesting you


---------01:45----------
know we had to ship down some stuff and


---------01:47----------
most of our stuff is still up there and


---------01:48----------
things like that but so like I


---------01:53----------
understand the topic today is like trust


---------01:54----------
issues can you help me understand what


---------01:57----------
that means


---------01:58----------
um so I would say especially since I got


---------02:03----------
out I'm not sure if it's because I'm


---------02:04----------
getting like older or if it's because


---------02:06----------
I've been on the internet or or if it's


---------02:09----------
because I've been traveling like outside


---------02:11----------
of Sweden or if it's because I've been


---------02:13----------
in America a lot I feel like a lot of


---------02:15----------
people lately it's been like


---------02:17----------
disappointing me and it feels like I've


---------02:20----------
met like a lot of people that it's like


---------02:23----------
it's always like turned out really


---------02:25----------
dramatic or I felt like they've like


---------02:27----------
become really mean basically and it just


---------02:30----------
makes me feel like like it's like hard


---------02:36----------
for me to like trust people okay and I'm


---------02:39----------
not sure if it's because I've been like


---------02:40----------
naive in the past or if it's like sure


---------02:43----------
yeah


---------02:43----------
yeah it can be hard if like people you


---------02:46----------
know if you give someone your trust and


---------02:48----------
then they don't you know treat it well


---------02:51----------
and they hurt you in some way or it can


---------02:54----------
be hard to trust me


---------02:55----------
you kind of get like betrayed you know


---------02:58----------
when you trust them yeah and it feels


---------02:59----------
like it's been like happening like


---------03:00----------
almost like if like I'm like a lot like


---------03:03----------
oh yeah lately yeah like in like just a


---------03:06----------

---------03:08----------
dramatic events and stuff wow that


---------03:10----------
sounds wrong yeah I don't know it's I'm


---------03:14----------
very like surprised and it's I remember


---------03:17----------
a few months ago I felt like like it may


---------03:23----------
be like sad especially like scared like


---------03:25----------
meeting new people and stuff no


---------03:27----------
interesting so you've found yourself


---------03:28----------
pulling back a little bit because of


---------03:30----------
what had happened and can you tell me a


---------03:33----------
little bit about what what happened over


---------03:36----------
the last year you said like uh several


---------03:38----------
events what do you mean by that yeah and


---------03:42----------
if there's anything you're not


---------03:43----------
comfortable sharing just let me know I'm


---------03:45----------
just I don't yeah I don't think it's it


---------03:47----------
would be like good to like talk about


---------03:49----------
like very varies like specific things


---------03:51----------
okay because there's like people that


---------03:54----------
maybe don't want that information to


---------03:56----------
like come out like Foley but there's it


---------03:58----------
has been out like the information it's


---------03:59----------
like out there for sure but I used I


---------04:01----------
used to feel like I think something that


---------04:04----------
was like really good about me was that I


---------04:07----------
used to like see a lot of positivity me


---------04:10----------
like positivity and stuff in people and


---------04:12----------
now I feel like I don't do that as much


---------04:15----------
anymore and it's kind of I don't know


---------04:17----------
how to say like the old turnings Nazi


---------04:19----------
positivity and people anymore


---------04:26----------
it's um hmm


---------04:29----------
I I just feel a bit scared it's almost


---------04:34----------
like it almost feels a bit trippy I


---------04:36----------
don't know it's like it's just like so


---------04:38----------
much it's just like intense I don't know


---------04:40----------
hmm what's intense about it like it


---------04:45----------
feels almost like a bit unreal so it


---------04:52----------
does it feel unreal because it's very


---------04:54----------
different from the way that you've seen


---------04:56----------
people before so you're kind of like


---------04:57----------
looking at like the world seems like a


---------04:59----------
different place to you or is it is that


---------05:02----------
what you mean I'm I'm a little bit I'm


---------05:05----------
trying to attain it what's unreal about


---------05:07----------
that um I'm not sure if maybe it was


---------05:12----------
like that before it but I use couldn't


---------05:13----------
really realize it but I see so the issue


---------05:17----------
was like and this kind of goes back to


---------05:19----------
earlier you were kind of saying like you


---------05:20----------
were wondering now whether you were


---------05:22----------
naive before or I mean do you believe


---------05:25----------
you were naive before what you are now


---------05:28----------
like that's what I've been told by


---------05:30----------
people so I don't know people tell me


---------05:33----------
like it's just like how the world is


---------05:34----------
sort of but he just like kind of sucks


---------05:37----------
because I really feel like I mean well


---------05:39----------
it's a lot of people and I would I would


---------05:42----------
say that I'm pretty like genuine and


---------05:44----------
like very generous yeah so it's tough


---------05:47----------
especially like we're the kind of


---------05:49----------
relationship that me and my fianc√©e us


---------05:51----------
and everything - what kind of


---------05:52----------
relationship do you hear in your field


---------05:54----------
what is that you have an open


---------05:55----------
relationship and help I mean so I have a


---------05:59----------
I have an idea of what that means what


---------06:01----------
what do you mean can you help me


---------06:03----------
understand what that means like like


---------06:08----------
we're able to like see people both


---------06:12----------
romantically and sexually like outside


---------06:15----------
of themselves it's basically yeah okay


---------06:17----------
and and your relationship with DES you


---------06:21----------
say he's your fiance and so you guys


---------06:24----------
have a romantic relationship yeah can


---------06:27----------
you help me understand a little bit


---------06:29----------
about is that something that you're


---------06:31----------
interested in talking about today or do


---------06:33----------
you want to talk kind of more about


---------06:34----------
trust and other people I think


---------06:36----------
everything just like goes like okay so


---------06:41----------
tell me a little can you just tell me a


---------06:43----------
little bit about your relationship with


---------06:44----------
destiny


---------06:45----------
like how you guys met and we met so I


---------06:49----------
was a friend of him okay like what is it


---------06:52----------
two years ago and you guys are watching


---------06:53----------
it on YouTube so I didn't know what


---------06:55----------
twitch was and then I yeah I I found out


---------07:00----------
that he had Instagram so it takes him


---------07:01----------
there and then we start chatting and


---------07:02----------
then he I was at UCL at the time


---------07:05----------
traveling around like in a van


---------07:07----------
he was like living life being very happy


---------07:08----------
probably like yeah like one of the most


---------07:11----------
like happiest times I've ever had


---------07:13----------
yeah and then Charlie look at that time


---------07:15----------
um so so like five years ago


---------07:23----------
I went to New Zealand with my mom and my


---------07:25----------
two sisters and we went there because


---------07:27----------
I'm a huge slaughtered ring-spun so yeah


---------07:30----------
we went there and when I got there I


---------07:32----------
felt like I felt like that's like where


---------07:36----------
I'm supposed to be so I saved up a lot


---------07:39----------
of money for about three four years


---------07:41----------
still when I was in high school and then


---------07:43----------
after high school I worked a lot to like


---------07:46----------
get over there and my whole plan was


---------07:48----------
basically it's like go there and like


---------07:52----------
started life here because I wasn't


---------07:53----------
really want to do there in New Zealand


---------07:55----------
and how old are you now I'm 21 I'm 22 in


---------07:59----------
the summer 21 and 22 okay oh yeah I'm


---------08:03----------
trying to this summer


---------08:04----------
okay and and so you had this idea to


---------08:08----------
move to New Zealand when you were like


---------08:10----------
18 um


---------08:12----------
no like 16 16 okay yes so then you saved


---------08:16----------
up money for three or four years and


---------08:18----------
then then what happened they I went


---------08:22----------
there we bought a car or like a van and


---------08:27----------
we lived in that one basically and just


---------08:29----------
like travelled around I really like


---------08:31----------
travelling I'm really into traveling me


---------08:33----------
and my partner at the time thanks okay


---------08:38----------
so you guys traveled around New Zealand


---------08:40----------
and that was one of the happiest times


---------08:41----------
of your life what was happy about it


---------08:45----------
cool yeah I'm I'm very I'm very much of


---------08:49----------
a person that really really like


---------08:51----------
traveling and I really like I don't know


---------08:53----------
the people are very nice very like open


---------08:56----------
and like genuine and like happy and


---------08:57----------
adventurous and everyone just likes to


---------09:00----------
like do fun things and create fun


---------09:03----------
memories and I would say that I'm like


---------09:05----------
that kind of person as well I've never


---------09:07----------
really felt like I belong in Sweden


---------09:09----------
where I come from hmm


---------09:11----------
I don't I've never really felt like it


---------09:13----------
fit in what


---------09:15----------
what about feeding the Sweden hasn't fit


---------09:17----------
with you um I think it's it's just like


---------09:25----------
I ever never really felt like I'm not


---------09:27----------
sure if it's because of like if my I


---------09:29----------
don't know I would say that I sort of


---------09:31----------
grew up with the idea of that Sweden


---------09:33----------
wasn't really the place for me to be and


---------09:35----------
I'm not sure if it has to do with has


---------09:38----------
that been the feeling that you've had


---------09:39----------
you just kind of always known that yeah


---------09:43----------
yeah cool that was a kid like very young


---------09:46----------
yeah so I was just like planning to let


---------09:48----------
go there and everything and that was


---------09:49----------
super fun and then Stephen came down and


---------09:53----------
that was really really good and then


---------09:56----------
yeah who's Steve destiny see you were


---------09:59----------
you're travelling in New Zealand mm-hmm


---------10:01----------
and and destiny came to visit you


---------10:03----------
yeah oh wow this is that the first time


---------10:06----------
you all had met yeah okay you're making


---------10:10----------
that sound so matter-of-fact but I think


---------10:12----------
it's quite remarkable is that it's


---------10:15----------
Connect Gracie it's kind of like I'm


---------10:17----------
like yeah that you yeah that I found him


---------10:21----------
Megan started like what she's like


---------10:22----------
content and stuff and then I got in


---------10:24----------
contact with him and then yeah he flew


---------10:27----------
all the way down there and that was


---------10:29----------
really good and we got along really well


---------10:30----------
and then we continued talking and then I


---------10:33----------
used like flew over to him and then we


---------10:36----------
like been travelling around together and


---------10:37----------
like doing stuff okay and so you said


---------10:40----------
you were traveling in New Zealand with


---------10:41----------
your partner at the time right so when


---------10:44----------
destiny came to visit you you guys were


---------10:46----------
friends or was there a kind of a


---------10:48----------
romantic element to the relationship so


---------10:51----------
this person that I was together with


---------10:53----------
back then he


---------10:55----------
and I reword together for about four


---------10:56----------
years and we had a polyamorous


---------10:58----------
relationship which meant that we could


---------11:00----------
like date multiple people at the same


---------11:01----------
time okay now we decided that hmm I


---------11:04----------
sorry what's the difference between the


---------11:05----------
polyamorous and open or is there one I


---------11:08----------
would guess that polyamorous means more


---------11:12----------
that you can like have feelings for


---------11:14----------
multiple people at the same time and


---------11:15----------
stuffing you like date them okay well


---------11:17----------
you think it's like dating I guess like


---------11:19----------
I think the labels are like bad I just


---------11:22----------
think she's like I'm very like okay sure


---------11:25----------
and and what so but I'm just trying to


---------11:28----------
understand when you use the word open


---------11:30----------
relationship and use the word


---------11:31----------
polyamorous or those the same thing or


---------11:33----------
those different I would say that we


---------11:36----------
maybe used open now because we're not


---------11:38----------
like living with like a third person or


---------11:40----------
like dating another person at the moment


---------11:41----------
okay so it's just like we're dating each


---------11:44----------
other we're not dating anyone else


---------11:45----------
they're like whenever we go to see


---------11:47----------
people we can like have feelings and


---------11:49----------
stuff for them as well or like have some


---------11:50----------
sort of romantic relationship with them


---------11:52----------
but we're not like like living with them


---------11:54----------
because I think both of us would see


---------11:56----------
living with someone it's like more of a


---------11:59----------
dating thing for us so okay so so like


---------12:02----------
like like a polyamorous relationship


---------12:05----------
people sometimes like live together with


---------12:07----------
like multiple partners yeah I think we


---------12:10----------
can do that if you want sure I think


---------12:12----------
it's just it's very non-monogamous


---------12:13----------
that's maybe that's like a better word


---------12:15----------
for a non-monogamous really so an open


---------12:19----------
relationship is a little bit more like


---------12:20----------
primarily monogamous but open is that


---------12:24----------
yeah I guess I would say maybe like a


---------12:27----------
non-monogamous is the right word to use


---------12:28----------
I don't know it's just words okay like


---------12:31----------
wait where yeah we can see multiple


---------12:33----------
people at the same like yeah okay same


---------12:34----------
time and so okay so you you started so


---------12:40----------
but you guys were when Dustin he came to


---------12:42----------
visit you guys were friends or was there


---------12:43----------
like a romantic element to that no I


---------12:46----------
didn't see anything romantic it was a


---------12:49----------
funny thing maybe like we texted and


---------12:51----------
stuff and it was fun and yeah I do


---------12:54----------
understand why he was coming to visit


---------12:56----------
you


---------12:59----------
like why he did that yeah he probably


---------13:03----------
thought it was like a fun idea and I


---------13:04----------
think he needed a break like from


---------13:07----------
streaming and like from yeah like


---------13:10----------
everything in his life at the moment and


---------13:12----------
he lives somewhere in North America


---------13:14----------
right he lives in California


---------13:16----------
okay okay so you thought that he was


---------13:19----------
coming to see you because he kind of


---------13:20----------
needed a break to recharge and and yeah


---------13:23----------
and that's not of a sick fun yeah


---------13:25----------
certainly it's a very nice place it's


---------13:28----------
like it's like a great looking like


---------13:30----------
vacation home was he on there for about


---------13:34----------
two weeks okay so it sounds like you


---------13:36----------
guys had a lot of a lot of fun sounds


---------13:38----------
great yeah yeah it was fun we did like


---------13:40----------
adventure stuff and like some beautiful


---------13:42----------
things like mountains like just like


---------13:45----------
really really fun I'm very adventurous


---------13:47----------
I like planning like adventurous stuff


---------13:49----------
cool though that's what we did you


---------13:51----------
strike me as somewhat of a free spirit


---------13:53----------
yeah I'm like I'm very um I like to


---------13:58----------
travel I'm like very I have a lot of


---------14:01----------
love to give mm-hm and iced tea or


---------14:04----------
whatever yeah and yeah that's I feel


---------14:08----------
like I figure out like what the meaning


---------14:10----------
of like my life is sort of it's just


---------14:12----------
that yeah I don't know it just gets me


---------14:16----------
sad when I see people like being like I


---------14:19----------
don't know


---------14:19----------
you know like about the trust thing


---------14:21----------
whatever yes all right


---------14:24----------
Malita I mean I'm honestly a little bit


---------14:26----------
confused cuz I really don't understand


---------14:28----------
what you mean by that because I don't


---------14:30----------
you know you're saying that and we don't


---------14:32----------
have to talk about it cuz you mentioned


---------14:34----------
that you kind of don't want to mention


---------14:36----------
it but I'm confused by what you mean by


---------14:38----------
that


---------14:39----------
okay right so like let me just tell you


---------14:42----------
what I heard so I'm envisioning you know


---------14:45----------
Molina traveling around New Zealand


---------14:47----------
being very adventurous free spirit never


---------14:50----------
really tied to Sweden and and that's


---------14:53----------
kind of who you are and I'm I see that


---------14:55----------
person and I understand where she's


---------14:56----------
coming from and I feel like I know her a


---------14:58----------
little bit and then something changes


---------15:00----------
and I can see how like that person could


---------15:03----------
change a little bit if if she gave her


---------15:06----------
trust too easily or too freely or maybe


---------15:08----------
people took advantage or something like


---------15:09----------
that I'm not so sure that I quite see


---------15:12----------
that way because I think you're a giver


---------15:14----------
like I think wait what are you talking


---------15:17----------
about I'm talking about you I think


---------15:18----------
you're a giver


---------15:19----------
yeah yeah I would say so yeah and I


---------15:23----------
think that would even like probably call


---------15:25----------
me a fixer I like I like I like like you


---------15:29----------
like make people happy around me yeah so


---------15:33----------
you know it's interesting fixer has such


---------15:35----------
a negative connotation to it right yeah


---------15:38----------
maybe yeah


---------15:39----------
but Adam I'm not sure if it's like a


---------15:41----------
good thing and I think you probably you


---------15:42----------
probably can't fix anyone I don't know


---------15:47----------
about thoughts on the past but now I


---------15:49----------
feel like I maybe I can't can I tell you


---------15:54----------
something completely random and


---------15:55----------
unrelated to what we're talking about


---------15:57----------
any interest in religion or spirituality


---------16:01----------
psychedelics okay so I just like to


---------16:05----------
share with you like a concept from the


---------16:07----------
Hindu tradition that I think actually


---------16:09----------
kind of describes you pretty well I'm


---------16:10----------
not saying that it's not really real


---------16:12----------
it's just a way of conceptualizing


---------16:13----------
people so when I look at you what I see


---------16:16----------
is something called Shakti Shakti is the


---------16:19----------
Sun script word for energy in the


---------16:21----------
interesting thing in the Sanskrit


---------16:24----------
language is that energy is a feminine


---------16:26----------
word so the idea of energy actually has


---------16:29----------
like a feminine connotation to it and


---------16:31----------
it's sort of like kind of a I mean this


---------16:33----------
is gonna sound yeah it's kind of weird


---------16:36----------
so like energy is just sort of a


---------16:37----------
feminine word and and this could be my


---------16:40----------
you know very much a bias of the culture


---------16:42----------
that I was raised in or studying some of


---------16:44----------
these things but I feel like I've met


---------16:45----------
some women who were just givers and


---------16:49----------
seemed to almost give out their energy


---------16:52----------
to other people and I've also noticed


---------16:55----------
that so the other thing about Shakti is


---------16:57----------
it sort of like a maternal kind of


---------16:59----------
energy or it can be and this may have


---------17:02----------
something to do with you know primitive


---------17:03----------
cultures and when they think about


---------17:05----------
creating life like that is like a very


---------17:07----------
energy intensive process and it's like


---------17:09----------
the woman who creates life so spend a


---------17:11----------
lot of academic study around like you


---------17:13----------
know 5,000 years ago when people were


---------17:15----------
living in India they sort of felt like


---------17:17----------
energy is of feminine quality which is a


---------17:21----------
little bit different in Western culture


---------17:22----------
and so sometimes I meet people who I


---------17:25----------
think have


---------17:26----------
shucks D so shucks D also is the word


---------17:27----------
it's the word for energy it's also the


---------17:29----------
word for goddess and so that that like


---------17:31----------
there are some kind of maternal or


---------17:36----------
maternal figures that sort of give


---------17:39----------
energy out to other people and you


---------17:41----------
strike me as one of those people who


---------17:43----------
sort of gives of themselves to other


---------17:46----------
people and then like and and kind of


---------17:48----------
there's this idea that like all energy


---------17:51----------
in the universe comes from the goddess


---------17:53----------
it's not actually doesn't come from God


---------17:54----------
it comes from the feminine version of


---------17:57----------
God and just listening to you and


---------18:00----------
talking to you and even looking at you I


---------18:01----------
sort of that where Chuck T comes to mind


---------18:04----------
because you seem to me to be a very


---------18:05----------
energetic and giving person and other


---------18:08----------
people I would guess so people who I've


---------18:10----------
met who seem to have a Shakti like yours


---------18:12----------
I'd say that you're almost like a light


---------18:16----------
that people are attracted to and it's


---------18:19----------
like they're drawn to you because you


---------18:21----------
give so freely and then people who are


---------18:23----------
kind of hungry come and want a piece of


---------18:27----------
your energy and you give it so freely


---------18:29----------
freely to them and they live in a world


---------18:30----------
where energy is not freely given and so


---------18:34----------
it can be very very intoxicating for


---------18:36----------
them to like be in your presence because


---------18:39----------
you so you are open in a world where


---------18:42----------
most people have trust issues does that


---------18:46----------
make sense at all


---------18:47----------
yeah does that fit at all with kind of


---------18:50----------
your experience about people kind of


---------18:51----------
coming to you to take your radiance for


---------18:55----------
lack of a better term yeah yeah I would


---------18:58----------
say so can you tell me in what way it


---------19:01----------
fits with you like what resonates about


---------19:03----------
that


---------19:10----------
I feel like like in situations for


---------19:16----------
example when if I've had like a really


---------19:18----------
close relationship with someone and it's


---------19:20----------
like really good and really fun and they


---------19:22----------
feel like they get like help from me and


---------19:24----------
stuff and I like like doing that with


---------19:26----------
them and I like to like make them happy


---------19:28----------
and stuff it's really like it happens a


---------19:31----------
lot that something happens that makes


---------19:33----------
them do something really mean or like


---------19:35----------
hurtful towards me and then a time goes


---------19:39----------
by and they come back later and it feels


---------19:42----------
really weird yeah I don't know it feels


---------19:44----------
really strange that's that's a very


---------19:46----------
that's a great description so I think


---------19:48----------
that's kind of what I envisioned that


---------19:50----------
almost like a mother right a mother is


---------19:54----------
someone that you have a conflict with


---------19:56----------
but then like you always kind of go back


---------19:58----------
does that sort of make sense like it's


---------20:00----------
almost like that kind of psychological


---------20:02----------
yeah maybe and it just yes if it feels


---------20:05----------
like I'm getting used somehow so it


---------20:08----------
sounds like the relationship is lopsided


---------20:11----------
so one of the hard things unfortunately


---------20:14----------
for people who have this Shakthi is that


---------20:16----------
their relationships often become


---------20:18----------
one-sided and oddly enough I don't


---------20:20----------
necessarily think that's a bad thing


---------20:21----------
once you understand it like once you


---------20:25----------
understand that you have something to


---------20:27----------
give anyway well we'll maybe get there


---------20:29----------
maybe but can you give me an example


---------20:32----------
because I'm just still having trouble


---------20:34----------
sort of envisioning like can you give me


---------20:36----------
an example of this happening um I think


---------20:42----------
it's like the people that I get


---------20:44----------
interested in like romantically not like


---------20:47----------
at the time now but like you have it's


---------20:49----------
happened in the past and stuff then


---------20:51----------
there's also like friends this is


---------20:55----------
something that people just like


---------20:56----------
generally know but like because of all


---------20:58----------
the drama that's happened like between


---------20:59----------
me and Stephen and like other people


---------21:02----------
that gets involved with like us


---------21:04----------
romantically or like sexually whatever


---------21:06----------
there's been a lot of people getting


---------21:09----------
really jealous probably and turn out


---------21:14----------
like being really mean or trying to like


---------21:16----------
sabotage and stuff and that feels really


---------21:18----------
shitty because I feel very generous and


---------21:21----------
I've never done anything to them


---------21:24----------
like that's bad or can you give me an


---------21:28----------
example of sabotage what does that mean


---------21:30----------
like trying to make me feel bad how do


---------21:33----------
they try to make you feel bad they try


---------21:35----------
to make me feel jealous Horace I think I


---------21:41----------
think what gosh no I feel like wait


---------21:50----------
just like being really mean and stuff


---------21:54----------
for like tried to make me feel bad that


---------21:55----------
they had some sort of romantic or sexual


---------21:57----------
relationship with my partner basically


---------22:00----------
by saying mean things are tried to like


---------22:03----------
tell me that they're sort of like the


---------22:06----------
one instead of me or something like that


---------22:08----------
basically so when someone says they're


---------22:11----------
the one instead of you or like they're


---------22:14----------
not saying it but they meet like they


---------22:16----------
mean it by their actions and stuff


---------22:17----------
encounter and I'm gonna so let me let me


---------22:21----------
tell you can I explain why I'm asking


---------22:22----------
you such specific questions so you're


---------22:26----------
saying that people you're talking about


---------22:28----------
your experience of people's actions


---------22:30----------
right you're saying they try to make me


---------22:33----------
feel bad they try to make me feel


---------22:34----------
jealous whereas in my experience often


---------22:38----------
times people don't try to make someone


---------22:41----------
feel a certain way usually when people


---------22:43----------
make other people feel bad that's like a


---------22:47----------
conic it's not the intended consequence


---------22:49----------
it's like almost like collateral damage


---------22:54----------
so for example let's say that I had a


---------22:56----------
relationship with destiny and I felt


---------22:58----------
like I was in love with him I may make


---------23:01----------
you feel like I'm the one or I may make


---------23:05----------
you feel like I think I'm the one but


---------23:07----------
that's not because I'm trying to make


---------23:09----------
you feel a certain way it's because I


---------23:11----------
want destiny all to myself does that


---------23:14----------
make sense and so I could understand how


---------23:16----------
you would feel that way but I don't


---------23:17----------
necessarily know that they're intending


---------23:19----------
to make you feel that way like I've had


---------23:22----------
girls basically like shutting like the


---------23:26----------
door in front of me with like that


---------23:28----------
person and him in the room like like


---------23:32----------
clinging on him and stuff and like


---------23:34----------
looking me in the eyes and like shutting


---------23:35----------
the door in front of me and tada make me


---------23:37----------
feel how does that make you feel like


---------23:44----------
I just don't understand like why


---------23:46----------
whatever he done like I think so okay so


---------23:50----------
why I really like this her relationship


---------23:52----------
and I know there's a lot of people like


---------23:53----------
naming and stuff on the internet that


---------23:55----------
I'm the one getting all of this like


---------23:57----------
like yeah the extra but the free


---------23:59----------
relationship whatever like I know the


---------24:00----------
one who's getting to see people and


---------24:02----------
stuff a lot of people think that but


---------24:05----------
like wait what have you been going with


---------24:08----------
this so you were telling me that someone


---------24:10----------
shut the door in your face and I'm like


---------24:12----------
someone you there's a physical room


---------24:15----------
where Destiny's in it and there's


---------24:16----------
another person and they shut the door in


---------24:18----------
your face oh yeah so I mean I think the


---------24:21----------
most like the the best thing about this


---------24:23----------
kind of relationship for me is that I


---------24:26----------
make it possible for my partner that I


---------24:29----------
love to like experience multiple things


---------24:32----------
in life and not just me you understand


---------24:35----------
for the rest of her or his life or


---------24:38----------
whatever right and and I also feel like


---------24:41----------
I really do love him so much and it


---------24:44----------
makes me happy thinking that he can like


---------24:46----------
give that happiness to other people as


---------24:47----------
well


---------24:48----------
so when people start like being really


---------24:51----------
mean and stuff and like this star job


---------24:52----------
and stuff and they they absolutely don't


---------24:54----------
have to it makes me really sad why don't


---------24:57----------
they have to start drama because I think


---------25:00----------
they like probably hopefully get but


---------25:03----------
they like can or one like I hope they


---------25:05----------
know that what they can get out of it


---------25:07----------
you know yeah but what if they what they


---------25:09----------
want is exclusivity then I guess it's I


---------25:15----------
don't know I don't think it's like it


---------25:16----------
doesn't have to like me and me right now


---------25:18----------
we're like yeah I completely agree with


---------25:20----------
you so I'm just so I'm gonna put myself


---------25:22----------
in the shoes of the person who closes


---------25:24----------
the door in your face for a moment right


---------25:27----------
so I'm imagining if I want exclusivity


---------25:28----------
with destiny then it's on me to try to


---------25:32----------
get it and part of that involves closing


---------25:35----------
the door in your face right and what are


---------25:42----------
you feeling right now you look like


---------25:43----------
you're getting a little bit


---------25:44----------
I'm sorry today no it's okay I'm curious


---------25:48----------
what you're feeling


---------25:59----------
it's I think it's just really unfair


---------26:01----------
what's unfair about it it does seem


---------26:05----------
unfair to me too it sounds to me like


---------26:10----------
you're being open but the other people


---------26:12----------
that you invite into your relationship


---------26:15----------
or not being as open as you are is that


---------26:19----------
what feels unfair about it yeah because


---------26:28----------
I don't know like I don't really know


---------26:32----------
like I guess like that is makes me feel


---------26:37----------
like I'm losing hope and people around


---------26:39----------
me I don't know because I just want


---------26:41----------
everyone to like be happier I mean it's


---------26:43----------
just like everything it's really


---------26:44----------
complicated I don't know or I don't know


---------26:49----------
all right when they don't when they do


---------26:51----------
that it's just really unfair


---------26:53----------
what's unfair about it because I feel


---------26:58----------
like I'm just like giving them a lot of


---------27:00----------
like happiness it's also the other way


---------27:04----------
around they could be they could be like


---------27:05----------
people getting jealous of him as well


---------27:08----------
like because they want to be with me and


---------27:10----------
I'm like I can't like even though like I


---------27:14----------
give them almost like oh I can't I don't


---------27:16----------
know it just feels like I don't know I


---------27:20----------
don't get it


---------27:23----------
yeah let me see Mike I understand you


---------27:25----------
yeah I know it's really it's really like


---------27:29----------
complicated it's like a lot but what


---------27:31----------
what's complicated about it it seems


---------27:35----------
like it's hard for you to understand


---------27:37----------
they were like not understand but like


---------27:38----------
it's hard to like explain maybe yeah so


---------27:41----------
let me see if I understand so I'm gonna


---------27:45----------
use like an analogy with food okay okay


---------27:48----------
so I was eating eggs and toast this


---------27:51----------
morning


---------27:51----------
and I was sitting next to my two year


---------27:54----------
old and she wanted to buy two my eggs


---------27:58----------
and I said sure honey take a bite of my


---------28:00----------
eggs and then I asked her can I have a


---------28:01----------
bite of your eggs and she said no these


---------28:06----------
are my eggs daddy and I was like how is


---------28:10----------
that fair


---------28:12----------
is that I mean I realize that it's like


---------28:14----------
really apples and oranges and night and


---------28:16----------
data compared to what you're talking


---------28:17----------
about but is that the general sentiment


---------28:19----------
that you're letting these people in and


---------28:21----------
they're not letting and they're pushing


---------28:23----------
you out like you're letting this person


---------28:26----------
into presumably your home I don't know


---------28:29----------
exactly if it's your home or you know


---------28:31----------
cuz you say that Dustin's your fiancee


---------28:33----------
but and so I'm I'm a little bit you know


---------28:37----------
I'm confused about the logistics of like


---------28:39----------
who's living where and you know where


---------28:40----------
are you and is that your home


---------28:42----------
like I live in Sweden so I'm only like


---------28:45----------
visiting him Thank You Missy


---------28:46----------
so there's like there's someone who


---------28:47----------
shuts the door in your face and in a


---------28:49----------
sense I mean I guess I have a certain


---------28:51----------
possessiveness when you use the word


---------28:54----------
fiance like I feel like you have dibs


---------28:56----------
you have the first right to destiny if


---------28:59----------
you want someone else and maybe that's


---------29:00----------
wrong maybe that that's not a friend


---------29:04----------
it's not really boyfriend that seems


---------29:06----------
kind of but partner I guess I don't know


---------29:08----------
I don't know it's just words to me yeah


---------29:11----------
but I mean I'm wondering like who's got


---------29:12----------
dibs right like does it do you get like


---------29:16----------
so you're the one who is that like if


---------29:18----------
you're if you're in a relationship with


---------29:20----------
someone who's your fiance like you sort


---------29:22----------
of you know let other people into your


---------29:24----------
relationship right but it's still you


---------29:28----------
letting the men they don't have a right


---------29:29----------
to come in it's like you you're choosing


---------29:31----------
to open the door and they're you're


---------29:33----------
letting them walk in if they want to but


---------29:35----------
it's still your door to open or close I


---------29:38----------
guess like the only boundary basically


---------29:40----------
that I haven't they were like the


---------29:42----------
boundary that we have is that if there's


---------29:43----------
someone that we were interested in there


---------29:45----------
were like doing some romantic or sexual


---------29:47----------
thing with if they don't respect our


---------29:50----------
relationship or or it tries to like


---------29:55----------
sabotage it or whatever or doesn't like


---------29:58----------
hates the other one like that's like the


---------30:01----------
boundary basically and it feels like


---------30:03----------
everything is going well until there's


---------30:05----------
like some point it doesn't and it's and


---------30:08----------
then I feel like I was like I don't know


---------30:09----------
she's really I think it's really sad


---------30:11----------
what's sad about it because I I used to


---------30:15----------
have like a lot of hope for for people


---------30:18----------
to just I don't know I think it's like a


---------30:19----------
beautiful thing that there's not really


---------30:21----------
like any I don't see love in some sort


---------30:24----------
of


---------30:24----------
when it comes to relationships basically


---------30:26----------
I think that's really for me that's


---------30:29----------
strange


---------30:30----------
and so if love isn't control what's


---------30:33----------
hurtful about someone closing the door


---------30:35----------
in your face what makes it hard for you


---------30:37----------
to just appreciate that there you know


---------30:41----------
that that person and destiny are about


---------30:43----------
to share something beautiful why is that


---------30:45----------
hurtful to you it's not like that it's


---------30:49----------
used more I don't think I don't think he


---------30:52----------
thinks that because like that person is


---------30:56----------
not really respecting us by being mean


---------30:59----------
to one another like to any of us


---------31:01----------
basically so like that person is not


---------31:06----------
respecting you guys I wouldn't say so if


---------31:09----------
one of it like if that person starts to


---------31:11----------
like get really mean and stuff for it


---------31:13----------
but is closing the door in your faces


---------31:15----------
that mean I would say so okay like try


---------31:19----------
to make me feel bad try to make you feel


---------31:23----------
bad yeah why do you think they're trying


---------31:27----------
to make you feel bad because they


---------31:31----------
probably wants him for themselves but


---------31:33----------
how but see in my mind those are two


---------31:35----------
different things


---------31:36----------
we know so so maybe this is it so I'd


---------31:39----------
like to clarify this in my mind like


---------31:42----------
let's say there's a pancake and just


---------31:47----------
because I want to eat the pancake


---------31:48----------
doesn't mean I want to take the pancake


---------31:50----------
away from someone else does that make


---------31:53----------
sense so you so in my mind you're kind


---------31:56----------
of just because somebody wants destiny


---------31:58----------
doesn't mean that they want to hurt you


---------32:01----------
like they get mean in other ways as well


---------32:05----------
like one of them made fun of me for


---------32:06----------
being Swedish because they wanted me to


---------32:10----------
feel like [ __ ] like why do you think


---------32:13----------
they won't hurt you because they they


---------32:18----------
probably wants to be in my position and


---------32:21----------
what is your position like the person


---------32:25----------
that lives for them and sees them every


---------32:27----------
single day so you get to like spend my


---------32:30----------
life with them in that way


---------32:32----------
okay


---------32:34----------
and that makes sense to me so it sounds


---------32:37----------
like they're jealous yeah and so let me


---------32:43----------
just take a step back so it sounds like


---------32:44----------
I feel like I'm getting it now so thank


---------32:47----------
you so much for explaining let me see if


---------32:48----------
I get it okay so you have this kind of


---------32:52----------
you know view that relationship so you


---------32:56----------
love destiny in destiny loves you okay


---------32:59----------
and that you guys have this open


---------33:02----------
relationship and you think it's a


---------33:03----------
beautiful thing to be able to love and


---------33:05----------
to be loved and you think that it's you


---------33:09----------
know beautiful to share that love and


---------33:11----------
for other people to experience destinies


---------33:13----------
love because you've experienced it as


---------33:15----------
well and it's a wonderful thing and you


---------33:17----------
want to share that so you're kind of


---------33:19----------
you're inviting everyone to the table


---------33:21----------
and let's all meet together right yeah


---------33:23----------
yeah absolutely


---------33:27----------
and and so everyone kind of brings it's


---------33:29----------
like a potluck so everyone brings


---------33:31----------
something and then we all share what we


---------33:32----------
all have to bring


---------33:33----------
yeah and so you also have this idea that


---------33:37----------
like other people can come to the table


---------33:39----------
and share in the way that you do yeah it


---------33:43----------
works it works sometimes but it feels


---------33:45----------
like most of the times things has gone


---------33:46----------
like really bad and like really horrible


---------33:49----------
really bad and really horrible I would


---------33:52----------
say so or like it's been like it's been


---------33:54----------
I would say it's horrible because I feel


---------33:57----------
I feel like I feel like tired or I feel


---------34:02----------
like that and it feels like it's like


---------34:04----------
really like affecting me pretty hard


---------34:06----------
what feels bad like the the way I start


---------34:13----------
to view people around me starts to come


---------34:15----------
really negative and every time there's


---------34:18----------
like a new person coming in I get really


---------34:20----------
scared instead of like being happy as I


---------34:22----------
used to be yeah and what not what do you


---------34:26----------
think about that why do you think you're


---------34:28----------
starting did you think it's really


---------34:29----------
because I feel like I've gotten like


---------34:31----------
disappointed


---------34:32----------
so much so many times so I start to like


---------34:36----------
feel really scared and that's like more


---------34:41----------
things happening and yeah and do you


---------34:43----------
already


---------34:45----------
and are you afraid that at some point


---------34:48----------
you're gonna have to change the way that


---------34:50----------
you view people yeah but I think it's


---------34:54----------
the worst waiter you may be well it's


---------34:55----------
not fun it's not it's not like I don't


---------34:58----------
know there seems like everyone has so


---------35:01----------
many issues and it's like everything is


---------35:02----------
just chaos like everyone is putting is


---------35:04----------
like their issues and everyone else


---------35:06----------
around them instead of least I don't


---------35:08----------
know I think it's really sad I think


---------35:10----------
it's sad too


---------35:11----------
I think it's sad that the world isn't a


---------35:13----------
perfect place and that people aren't


---------35:14----------
perfect is there a part of you that


---------35:21----------
doesn't want to be in a polyamorous or


---------35:22----------
open relationship not if I'm gonna get


---------35:25----------
hurt by people like this so you know


---------35:31----------
that but that's it like it's not like I


---------35:35----------
don't I don't think about it but I start


---------35:38----------
to like it scared that I'm going to like


---------35:40----------
a bad path what's a bad path it just


---------35:44----------
starts to affect me like mentally really


---------35:46----------
bad I guess but more like experiences


---------35:50----------
that's like really horrible yeah so if


---------35:54----------
would you be willing to be in a non


---------35:57----------
polyamorous relationship you would feel


---------36:02----------
really strange to me like try to control


---------36:04----------
my partner [ __ ] it comes for my partner


---------36:09----------
from feeling things for other people


---------36:11----------
ah interesting so you think that a non


---------36:15----------
polyamorous relationship involves


---------36:16----------
controlling your partner's feelings yeah


---------36:22----------
for me it does huh that's not my


---------36:28----------
impression of most monogamous


---------36:30----------
relationships I don't know it seems like


---------36:34----------
there's a lot of jealous hint stuff and


---------36:37----------
why is there John I'm confused why's it


---------36:40----------
have you been in a monogamous


---------36:41----------
relationship before


---------36:45----------
however so what's your understanding of


---------36:51----------
what a monogamous relationship is


---------36:57----------
basically want to be with one person


---------36:59----------
romantically and sexually you want to be


---------37:03----------
with one person what do you mean by the


---------37:06----------
word want like that's that's what you


---------37:16----------
like the way you choose time yeah so I I


---------37:21----------
like the word choose said two-year-old


---------37:26----------
is outside my window now he's confused


---------37:30----------
so I think I'm a little bit curious you


---------37:34----------
know that you're do you feel like you


---------37:38----------
would be a less good person if you chose


---------37:40----------
to be a monogamous relationship like


---------37:47----------
your take I haven't thought about it so


---------37:52----------
can I share with you what my


---------37:54----------
understanding of a monogamous


---------37:55----------
relationship is so I don't think it's


---------37:57----------
about controlling anyone's feelings in


---------37:59----------
fact I don't think it's about


---------38:00----------
controlling at all I think a good


---------38:02----------
monogamous relationship has nothing to


---------38:03----------
do with control a good monogamous


---------38:05----------
relationship has everything to do this


---------38:07----------
choice so it's when two people choose to


---------38:11----------
engage in a romantic and sexual


---------38:14----------
relationship only with each other and I


---------38:17----------
don't think that there's any controlling


---------38:18----------
to feelings like I don't think that so I


---------38:21----------
don't think it's reasonable to expect


---------38:22----------
people to control their own feelings let


---------38:26----------
alone have your partner control your


---------38:27----------
feelings that sounds like a toxic


---------38:29----------
relationship to me when one partner


---------38:31----------
tries to control the the way that the


---------38:33----------
other partner feels that sounds toxic to


---------38:36----------
me I'd say that that people have


---------38:38----------
feelings towards other human beings


---------38:41----------
that's completely normal I can be


---------38:43----------
romantically or sexually interested with


---------38:45----------
people that are not my wife she can be


---------38:47----------
romantically or sexually interested in


---------38:49----------
people that are not me that's completely


---------38:51----------
reasonable human beings have feelings we


---------38:53----------
don't really control our feelings what


---------38:55----------
we control are our actions and so I


---------38:58----------
think


---------38:59----------
a monogamous relationship is a choice


---------39:02----------
that your actions that you're going to


---------39:05----------
restrain certain certain feelings and


---------39:09----------
not choose to act on them for the sake


---------39:11----------
of supporting a particular relationship


---------39:18----------
what do you think about that make you


---------39:20----------
say that one more time


---------39:21----------
the last thing yeah so like it's not


---------39:23----------
about controlling your feelings it's


---------39:25----------
about controlling your actions for the


---------39:28----------
sake of your relationship right so I


---------39:31----------
choose to not act upon the impulses that


---------39:36----------
I have towards other women because I


---------39:38----------
value my relationship more than a


---------39:42----------
relationship with another woman okay


---------39:46----------
what do you think about that I guess it


---------39:51----------
makes sense what makes sense about it


---------39:59----------
that it's about like your actions for


---------40:01----------
the other like I don't know I don't know


---------40:04----------
what to say


---------40:05----------
sure did I because I don't think minami


---------40:08----------
monogamy is about control like that


---------40:11----------
that's my main point I think it's about


---------40:12----------
choice right it's sort of like I mean I


---------40:15----------
can choose to live in a van and drive


---------40:17----------
around in New Zealand and that's I'm not


---------40:19----------
saying that that's good or bad I'm


---------40:20----------
saying that or I can choose to have a


---------40:22----------
house and live there every day and sleep


---------40:25----------
in the same place every day I'm not


---------40:26----------
placing a value judgment I'm just saying


---------40:28----------
that they're different you think a lot


---------40:32----------
of people should like use it as some


---------40:34----------
sort of control absolutely I I think


---------40:37----------
that people are [ __ ] and I think


---------40:39----------
that being in a polyamorous relationship


---------40:41----------
does not protect you from [ __ ] and I


---------40:43----------
think that being a monogamous


---------40:45----------
relationship does not protect you from


---------40:46----------
[ __ ] although arguably yeah although


---------40:50----------
arguably being in a polyamorous


---------40:52----------
relationship protects you less from


---------40:54----------
[ __ ] because there are more people


---------40:56----------
coming in and out of the door of your


---------40:58----------
relationship does that make sense


---------41:00----------
I just think statistically like you know


---------41:03----------
if yeah with me I mean I'm not trying to


---------41:09----------
advocate that you should be in a


---------41:10----------
monogamous relationship or are you


---------41:12----------
getting that


---------41:13----------
No okay it's just your perception of a


---------41:17----------
monogamous relationship is different


---------41:18----------
from the way that I see it and so what


---------41:22----------
are you thinking let me just think for a


---------41:28----------
second


---------41:31----------
so no part of you wants to be in a


---------41:33----------
monogamous relationship of course I


---------41:37----------
could I could like I could probably be


---------41:41----------
happy with one person but I don't really


---------41:44----------
I don't feel like it's necessary for me


---------41:48----------
to like like try to like tell my partner


---------41:53----------
that that partner and I can't see anyone


---------41:57----------
else than me yes so that actually sounds


---------42:01----------
a lot like monogamy oddly enough so when


---------42:05----------
you tell me why so because I think that


---------42:06----------
in my wife I don't think at least I mean


---------42:09----------
I don't think I've ever you know my I'd


---------42:13----------
like to think that my wife doesn't see


---------42:15----------
other people because I tell her not to


---------42:17----------
she doesn't see other people because she


---------42:20----------
chooses not to all right I mean I should


---------42:22----------
speak for myself so my wife hasn't told


---------42:25----------
me that you know you're I'm not allowed


---------42:27----------
to see other women it's just we sort of


---------42:29----------
made a mutual choice that we're not


---------42:31----------
gonna do that so I don't get the sense


---------42:33----------
that I'm controlled by her at least not


---------42:35----------
in this aspect when it comes to how much


---------42:37----------
I play games and things like that she


---------42:39----------
definitely is very controlling you know


---------42:43----------
like so that's the thing is I mean you


---------42:45----------
keep on using the word control when when


---------42:48----------
you talk about a monogamous relationship


---------42:49----------
and certainly there are people who are


---------42:51----------
controlling but I just don't know that


---------42:54----------
that's restricted to monogamy so help me


---------42:59----------
understand what do you mean by fiancee


---------43:01----------
are you guys engaged to be married can


---------43:05----------
you help me understand a little bit


---------43:06----------
about how y'all decided to do that so we


---------43:10----------
can continue dating each other what does


---------43:14----------
marriage have to do with that because


---------43:16----------
I'm the Swedish citizen I see so just


---------43:19----------
from a logistical perspective it's hard


---------43:21----------
for you to visit him so often unless so


---------43:24----------
it's kind of like if if laws


---------43:26----------
did not prevent you if you lived in the


---------43:28----------
US and you had a green card or something


---------43:30----------
like that would you guys be getting


---------43:31----------
married I don't know


---------43:35----------
that's that's another dimension okay but


---------43:38----------
like yeah so I'm just hearing that that


---------43:42----------
so it seems like it's primarily a legal


---------43:44----------
thing it's not like you guys know we


---------43:46----------
love it should want to get married okay


---------43:48----------
so you guys so you value the instant


---------43:50----------
like that marriage means something to


---------43:51----------
you yeah of course okay I agree we go


---------43:55----------
through a lot to like be able to like be


---------43:57----------
together oh yeah yeah yeah what does it


---------43:59----------
mean to you to go through so much yeah


---------44:03----------
like with the person yeah that we become


---------44:07----------
really strong I would say what are you


---------44:15----------
feeling now


---------44:26----------
and some sort of a happy accident notes


---------44:33----------
if there's like we go through a lot of


---------44:35----------
things together if we become really good


---------44:38----------
I don't think I've ever got through so


---------44:44----------
much with so much in the fact that you


---------44:48----------
guys have stayed together through it all


---------44:50----------
seems to be really important yeah


---------44:53----------
because it sounds like last year the


---------44:55----------
last year of your life has been really


---------44:57----------
tough yeah but we always come out


---------45:01----------
together which is really cool it sounds


---------45:03----------
like you can really count on him yeah


---------45:07----------
yeah I really really do love him so much


---------45:10----------
I used to I used to get scared when like


---------45:13----------
more like bad stuff happens because I


---------45:15----------
just want us to be together so bad mix


---------45:17----------
what are you afraid of I'm scared that


---------45:24----------
I'm not gonna be able to uh should I go


---------45:27----------
through it go through a while and just


---------45:31----------
thank you more like difficult scenarios


---------45:38----------
that could basically be other people or


---------45:41----------
just [ __ ] pandemic or like his


---------45:44----------
paperwork like all of this stuff but you


---------45:46----------
so you know there's like a lot of like


---------45:49----------
scary stuff then yeah baby you're not


---------45:54----------
gonna be strong enough yeah where do you


---------45:58----------
get that idea because I'm not sure how


---------46:03----------
much I can push myself right all right


---------46:07----------
why are you pushing diesel because


---------46:11----------
because because that because it's really


---------46:16----------
important for me and for him to to do


---------46:19----------
that help me understand what so when you


---------46:22----------
say the phrase push yourself I think


---------46:26----------
about like when I push myself there's a


---------46:29----------
part of me that wants to do something


---------46:30----------
and there's a part of me that doesn't


---------46:31----------
want to do something and so the part of


---------46:34----------
me that wants to do it pushes the part


---------46:35----------
that doesn't want to do it that's what


---------46:37----------
pushing yourself is right what is the


---------46:39----------
part of you what do you


---------46:40----------
want to push yourself to do what do you


---------46:44----------
mean practically does that look like in


---------46:46----------
your relationship or in your life if


---------46:49----------
it's like it's just like a really hard


---------46:50----------
one to climb I guess what's the mountain


---------46:53----------
aankhen having trouble understanding


---------46:55----------
when you're combining a lot of feelings


---------46:57----------
and imagery so I get the sense that it's


---------47:00----------
a tall you know there's a long road


---------47:02----------
ahead of you right and it seems really


---------47:05----------
awesome that it's actually been a long


---------47:07----------
road behind you too and you guys have


---------47:09----------
been through it together and y'all are


---------47:10----------
still here y'all are still together and


---------47:12----------
there's still a long way to go that I


---------47:14----------
understand but I'm not quite sure what


---------47:16----------
the mountain looks like it could be a


---------47:21----------
just think about it like being me like


---------47:25----------
leaving New Zealand or like going to


---------47:30----------
America away from like a lot of friends


---------47:32----------
mmm


---------47:33----------
Sweden or being away from my friends in


---------47:35----------
New Zealand or having a lot of audience


---------47:39----------
on the internet or having not being able


---------47:43----------
to work because I can't work in America


---------47:48----------
by giving up a lot of things you know


---------47:51----------
Wow crazy people and like go through


---------47:57----------
like a lot and then now have long


---------47:59----------
distance that I don't know when it's


---------48:01----------
kind like this like a lot of things yeah


---------48:03----------
oh my god


---------48:04----------
very intense yeah it sounds overwhelming


---------48:08----------
actually I mean issues of yeah I mean it


---------48:13----------
sounds like being stuck in Sweden is


---------48:16----------
really rough on you


---------48:17----------
yeah I don't want to be here you never


---------48:21----------
wanted to be there no can I just think


---------48:27----------
for a second


---------48:39----------
it's so scary yeah I mean cuz you don't


---------48:44----------
know what's gonna happen right you don't


---------48:47----------
know what you're gonna like you're


---------48:49----------
thinking about what you're gonna give up


---------48:50----------
and what you're giving it up for and you


---------48:55----------
don't know when it's gonna happen or


---------48:57----------
what's gonna happen or I mean I can just


---------49:00----------
imagine that like if you're giving up


---------49:01----------
your friends in New Zealand and Sweden


---------49:03----------
to move to America and you're streaming


---------49:05----------
on Twitch and or there are other


---------49:08----------
streamers that have been part of the


---------49:10----------
drama between like involving you and


---------49:12----------
destiny or it's like non streamer people


---------49:14----------
there's three men on streaming people


---------49:16----------
yeah so just kind of like you know what


---------49:18----------
I'm hearing from you is that you're


---------49:20----------
engaged in this world right this world


---------49:22----------
of destiny and and open relationships


---------49:26----------
and and streaming and some of that stuff


---------49:29----------
has been awesome and is amazing and is


---------49:33----------
like really really a solid foundation


---------49:35----------
for you to build on and some of it


---------49:37----------
sounds like it's been kind of like


---------49:38----------
really toxic and hurtful and what I'm


---------49:42----------
the thing that just hearing everything


---------49:44----------
that you said the thing that kind of


---------49:45----------
worries me the most is you're you're


---------49:47----------
sort of diving into all of that really


---------49:50----------
quick really fast yeah yeah you're


---------49:53----------
really going yeah I'm only 21 I think


---------49:55----------
it's like a lot of it's a lot you know


---------49:58----------
what do you think about when are you


---------49:59----------
guys gonna get married do you know if


---------50:01----------
Kovac wasn't happening y'all talked


---------50:02----------
about him I was supposed like why I'm in


---------50:05----------
Sweden it's basically because I had to


---------50:06----------
do an interview but I can't do because


---------50:09----------
the American Embassy is closed I see and


---------50:12----------
and what do you think about getting


---------50:14----------
engaged at the age of 21 doesn't it


---------50:19----------
doesn't like to me it doesn't really


---------50:22----------
mean like I'm like becoming something


---------50:26----------
different like it doesn't really do that


---------50:29----------
for me like what it means is probably


---------50:32----------
but I'm going through a lot for a person


---------50:35----------
that I really love and that I really


---------50:36----------
care about and then I want to be bit and


---------50:40----------
how long do you guys think you're gonna


---------50:41----------
be together well here for the rest of my


---------50:44----------
life sure


---------50:46----------
yeah I hope so too it sounds like it's a


---------50:48----------
strong relationship that you've talked


---------50:54----------
to him - yeah I'm a huge fan of


---------50:56----------
destinies he's it yeah you know yeah I


---------51:01----------
think it's a right to be honest milena


---------51:04----------
I'm a little bit impressed he's in love


---------51:06----------
with you right that's not easy to do


---------51:09----------
for him yeah yeah that was that was also


---------51:15----------
struggled for a long time but yeah I


---------51:18----------
think yes I think we like came to a


---------51:19----------
point where it's like okay


---------51:21----------
I think that y'all's relationship is


---------51:23----------
really special yeah that's why I'm like


---------51:26----------
I can't like I'm not gonna give that up


---------51:28----------
[ __ ] no yeah that's worth fighting for


---------51:31----------
mm-hmm just something in particular I


---------51:36----------
can help you with I think you may be


---------51:42----------
like I felt I feel like I don't really


---------51:44----------
understand myself that well like why I'm


---------51:48----------
the way I am because I feel like like


---------51:50----------
with all of this experience


---------51:52----------
it feels like it's very hard for me to


---------51:53----------
like find people that that has gone


---------51:55----------
through something similar or that it's


---------51:57----------
like really similar like minded to me so


---------51:59----------
I feel a little bit lonely with it yeah


---------52:02----------
and I feel like I'm not like it yeah you


---------52:06----------
feel alone mm-hmm a bit like with with


---------52:10----------
that like


---------52:12----------
with my life I don't know it's just


---------52:15----------
people are like if I talk to people that


---------52:18----------
I used to know like five years ago it's


---------52:21----------
like we don't have anything to talk


---------52:22----------
about and if I really like have a lot of


---------52:24----------
things that I feel like I want to vent


---------52:26----------
about it's like they don't know like


---------52:29----------
what to say or like they don't really


---------52:31----------
know like they they don't know like they


---------52:33----------
can't understand what do you feel like


---------52:34----------
venting about today probably that I'm


---------52:41----------
scared you're scared of what what are


---------52:45----------
you afraid of


---------52:48----------
maybe like going in the wrong direction


---------52:51----------
what direction what is it what what does


---------52:54----------
that look like tell me what the direct


---------52:56----------
it's like the way the way life is now


---------52:59----------
compared to what it was about like two


---------53:01----------
years ago is very different and there's


---------53:04----------
like a lot of really cool things but


---------53:06----------
it's very very very intense what do you


---------53:08----------
know what's intense about it but there's


---------53:13----------
it feels like there's no like time to


---------53:15----------
like process because just like new


---------53:17----------
things all the time happening that gets


---------53:20----------
me and I feel like every time something


---------53:21----------
new happens I feel like I get like wait


---------53:24----------
like I feel like I get shattered because


---------53:26----------
of it because I feel like oh not another


---------53:28----------
like another thing happening can you


---------53:29----------
give me an example of a new thing that


---------53:31----------
happened recently that made you Saturn


---------53:34----------
the whole Kittery no drama for example


---------53:37----------
make me really sad what is that I don't


---------53:39----------
know what it's kind of a person you know


---------53:43----------
just streaming okay what happened what


---------53:50----------
can I say she basically was lying to a


---------53:55----------
bunch of people about what and really


---------54:01----------
[ __ ] hard to court and I'm sorry like


---------54:05----------
her she lied to a lot of people and


---------54:08----------
stuff about then about what like


---------54:12----------
romantically sort of she cheated on


---------54:18----------
people basically that's what she did she


---------54:19----------
cheated on people mm-hm


---------54:22----------
what does that have to do with you know


---------54:25----------
it just it just makes me sad to like see


---------54:27----------
that a person that I am close with can


---------54:30----------
do something like that I see yeah


---------54:32----------
because I never thought that like I


---------54:35----------
didn't know any like about anything and


---------54:37----------
then we just like came out and it's also


---------54:39----------
really sad that someone might get so


---------54:40----------
much hate from the dead as well and


---------54:42----------
stuff and it's just like really hard


---------54:44----------
Katerina I don't know what I hate yeah


---------54:46----------
how do you feel about that I don't think


---------54:50----------
anyone deserves that much hate no matter


---------54:52----------
what they do from so many people I don't


---------54:54----------
think the judgement of the Internet yeah


---------54:57----------
it's just but it's just like insane it's


---------54:59----------
just crazy and there's


---------55:01----------
we said that so many people can be so


---------55:02----------
mean about things they're not like


---------55:04----------
involved with at all and then that


---------55:07----------
someone that I care about and really


---------55:08----------
like I love Kate I do like seeing her


---------55:11----------
like doing something like that makes


---------55:12----------
them really sad and then like seeing


---------55:15----------
people that got hurt by it


---------55:17----------
feeling sad it makes me sad too I don't


---------55:18----------
know I just it has nothing to do with me


---------55:21----------
but I just feel sad about like watching


---------55:23----------
things like happening yeah it seems to


---------55:26----------
me like you're also someone so this


---------55:27----------
happens with people who have Shakti by


---------55:29----------
the way is that they take on the heart


---------55:31----------
of other people so it's almost like so


---------55:36----------
the people that I work with who have


---------55:37----------
powerful Shakti's I kind of think of


---------55:39----------
them like a sponge they so they can be a


---------55:42----------
wonderful influence for a family or a


---------55:45----------
company or a relationship because they


---------55:48----------
can absorb a lot of the hurt of other


---------55:50----------
people and that's part of what draws


---------55:51----------
people to you is that you know by by


---------55:55----------
having you be a part of their


---------55:56----------
conversations and things like that they


---------55:58----------
actually feel better because it's almost


---------56:00----------
like there's a transfer of their


---------56:02----------
painting to you does that sort of make


---------56:05----------
sense


---------56:06----------
they say one more time yeah so like it's


---------56:08----------
almost like they're transferring their


---------56:10----------
pain to you so I kind of think about you


---------56:14----------
like a sponge that's absorbing something


---------56:16----------
so if I have like water that's spilled


---------56:18----------
on the table and I take a sponge and I


---------56:20----------
wipe it across the table there's no more


---------56:23----------
water on the table but the water is in


---------56:25----------
the sponge and you are that sponge and


---------56:28----------
where there used to be like water on the


---------56:30----------
table like now that's filled you're


---------56:32----------
holding that and so a lot of people who


---------56:36----------
are who have shucked be like you do I


---------56:38----------
see this pattern where I have to teach


---------56:40----------
them how to squeeze out the water from


---------56:42----------
their sponge because they take it in so


---------56:45----------
easily from other people and it's kind


---------56:47----------
of like you know you we were talking


---------56:48----------
about this earlier about you giving you


---------56:50----------
give and you also absorb negativity from


---------56:53----------
others and you're very sensitive to


---------56:54----------
negativity you're probably also very


---------56:56----------
empathic that's another way that people


---------56:58----------
put it and I'm wondering if the reason


---------57:01----------
that you're scared so so I'm sorry you


---------57:04----------
were saying that maybe the way to you


---------57:06----------
maybe the way that I could help you is


---------57:08----------
by handling the intensity right


---------57:11----------
you were talking about intensity and all


---------57:13----------
this twitch streaming stuff it's a lot


---------57:15----------
of drama on twitch yeah and it sucks I


---------57:18----------
feel like I don't really know what the


---------57:20----------
[ __ ] I'm doing here because it because I


---------57:22----------
don't I don't really see myself as being


---------57:24----------
like it's which person like I'm not a


---------57:26----------
part of that why are you a part of it


---------57:28----------
then because I the way they are and the


---------57:33----------
way they do things and the way people


---------57:35----------
talk and the whole community and all


---------57:37----------
they're like that we call it like the


---------57:39----------
vibes from everything is just like very


---------57:41----------
like not from where I come from I'm


---------57:44----------
you're you're you're not built for


---------57:47----------
streaming you're built for being in the


---------57:48----------
van that's driving across New Zealand


---------57:50----------
yeah so why are you a part of this


---------57:54----------
community


---------57:55----------
um because it sort of lis just happened


---------57:59----------
because I'm dating a streamer so and and


---------58:01----------
then I think the the main thing for me


---------58:05----------
to do it the first place was to sort of


---------58:07----------
make more people happy with my words or


---------58:11----------
with to like show them like the


---------58:14----------
adventures that I do to like make them


---------58:16----------
happy or maybe like try to make them


---------58:18----------
feel like they can get out of there like


---------58:20----------
computer like chair and like go on an


---------58:22----------
adventure sort of because I do that


---------58:24----------
because it makes me really happy


---------58:25----------
so how long have you wanted to make


---------58:29----------
people happy


---------58:29----------
I just think that's just my nature it's


---------58:34----------
just like how I work I guess mm-hmm I


---------58:36----------
think I've always been like that since I


---------58:38----------
was very like young can you tell me what


---------58:41----------
growing up in Sweden was like um and two


---------58:47----------
sisters two younger ones my mom is very


---------58:51----------
very she's always been very depressed


---------58:53----------
very dramatic very emotional and she's


---------58:56----------
been putting it out on her kids a lot my


---------58:59----------
dad is very he's a happy person but you


---------59:05----------
can tell that he he he gets I can tell


---------59:10----------
that he gets really sad about really


---------59:11----------
dramatic sad people so he kind of just


---------59:14----------
like shuts off and like he doesn't


---------59:15----------
really show a lot of feelings in that


---------59:17----------
way but like you talk about feelings


---------59:19----------
shut off by a dramatic


---------59:21----------
yeah like he doesn't if whenever my mom


---------59:25----------
wanted to talk to him about something


---------59:27----------
she was like being very very dramatic he


---------59:30----------
would just like go up to his bedroom and


---------59:32----------
go to sleep and she would have sit and


---------59:34----------
cry or like take it out on us basically


---------59:37----------
that's like the whole when it comes to


---------59:39----------
family


---------59:39----------
how would your dad react to you when you


---------59:42----------
were happy I don't remember that


---------59:48----------
did you see you so that you've always


---------59:51----------
sort of wanted to make people happy can


---------59:54----------
you tell me a little bit about when you


---------59:56----------
said your mom was depressed and


---------59:58----------
emotional and something you said


---------60:00----------
something towards for kids what do you


---------60:03----------
mean by that


---------60:05----------
like I think she sort of did not think


---------60:09----------
about what to say to her kids she wasn't


---------60:13----------
she said she would tell I don't know she


---------60:20----------
would tell me a lot about her like


---------60:24----------
herself feeling really bad stuff how


---------60:27----------
would you feel when she told you those


---------60:29----------
kinds of things that it was my that I


---------60:32----------
was supposed to take care of her mm-hmm


---------60:35----------
like make you feel happy you felt a


---------60:38----------
responsibility to make her happy so like


---------60:44----------
uh like I became a little bit like your


---------60:47----------
therapist the kid


---------60:49----------
six seven since you were what hold on


---------60:54----------
let me see if I can switch overs since


---------60:56----------
you were seven cuz you're in Europe


---------61:00----------
right yeah hmm so it sounds like from a


---------61:07----------
young age you started to feel like you


---------61:11----------
were giving that energy to her actually


---------61:14----------
what about to your dad


---------61:19----------
he he was just like a lot on his own


---------61:23----------
sort of we're like a little bit like he


---------61:25----------
I think the best thing probably like


---------61:29----------
growing up was probably what my dad even


---------61:32----------
though he doesn't really he didn't


---------61:33----------
really talk about a feeling since though


---------61:34----------
he we ate we used to have a country


---------61:37----------
house where he grew up so he took us out


---------61:40----------
there and that was probably the best


---------61:41----------
thing in my whole childhood because I


---------61:43----------
just got to be in nature and just being


---------61:46----------
like alone like taking walks like going


---------61:49----------
this way like it was like being close to


---------61:53----------
nature was really important and like


---------61:54----------
watching movies for them and like him


---------61:56----------
like taking us like on walks and stuff


---------61:59----------
was really good even though he didn't


---------62:01----------
talk about feelings and stuff and my mom


---------62:03----------
did it really like come with us on that


---------62:06----------
at all she didn't like it hmm


---------62:09----------
do you think maybe the reason you


---------62:11----------
enjoyed it was because your mom wasn't


---------62:12----------
there wait what do you think maybe the


---------62:16----------
reason hold on let me see if I can


---------62:18----------
switch servers again because it's like


---------62:19----------
we're lagging yeah let's go straight to


---------62:20----------
Europe let me just check it real quick


---------62:25----------
all right so do you feel like any chance


---------62:30----------
that you reason one of the reasons you


---------62:31----------
liked being traveling with your dad was


---------62:34----------
because your mom didn't come with you


---------62:37----------
actually you weren't around her I


---------62:41----------
remember we wanted her to come all the


---------62:44----------
time but she didn't she was busy


---------62:46----------
everything and I remember there was like


---------62:49----------
um she if I'll actually focused a lot


---------62:53----------
about I like on like random people all


---------62:57----------
the time I remember that she had some


---------62:58----------
sort of friend from another country


---------63:01----------
coming up where about two weeks and she


---------63:02----------
took two weeks like vacation from her


---------63:07----------
job because she wanted to like show him


---------63:09----------
around in Sweden and I remember I felt


---------63:12----------
really sad because I felt like she never


---------63:16----------
took two weeks off to like be with us


---------63:20----------
and yeah I remember I was really sad


---------63:23----------
about that it's funny and maybe this is


---------63:26----------
a little bit too much of like you know


---------63:30----------
therapist Steve but I I mean it sounds


---------63:33----------
to me like now I understand why it was


---------63:36----------
so significant for destiny to fly


---------63:38----------
halfway across the world to like hang


---------63:39----------
out with you for two weeks why because


---------63:43----------
it sounds like it's the exact opposite


---------63:44----------
of what your mom did right I mean it's


---------63:47----------
like your your mom would spend go out of


---------63:50----------
her way to spend time with a random


---------63:51----------
person from another country but she


---------63:52----------
wouldn't come with you to like a cabin


---------63:55----------
in the wilderness and and you know so


---------63:59----------
she was prioritizing this random person


---------64:01----------
and like for destiny to fly halfway


---------64:04----------
across the world and and spend time with


---------64:06----------
you like he was you like you mattered to


---------64:08----------
him he wanted to be with you and that


---------64:11----------
sounds I mean I can sort of see does


---------64:14----------
that seem real that feel related to you


---------64:16----------
at all or not really we're lagging hold


---------64:23----------
on yeah [ __ ]


---------64:29----------
is it my entire third I'm not sure if


---------64:32----------
it's an Internet to be honest it could


---------64:35----------
just be the discord service and maybe


---------64:42----------
we're like how do what do you what do


---------64:44----------
you mean by that like that it's like


---------64:46----------
well I mean I just died so let me try to


---------64:51----------
share a couple of thoughts I don't know


---------64:52----------
how well these are gonna land with you


---------64:54----------
so I apologize I'm happy to sort of have


---------64:56----------
a follow-up conversation to kind of dig


---------64:58----------
into some of this stuff but so the first


---------65:01----------
thing Melina is that you know I think


---------65:04----------
that let me just think for a second


---------65:17----------
I think it's interesting that you grew


---------65:19----------
up in a place where it seems like you


---------65:25----------
had to have your happy feelings on the


---------65:30----------
outside and your sad feelings on the


---------65:32----------
inside that's kind of the picture that I


---------65:34----------
get and I think it really mattered about


---------65:39----------
me being said it probably mattered more


---------65:41----------
about other people being said of me


---------65:42----------
absolutely right so that because you


---------65:44----------
also said so it's it's not only your mom


---------65:46----------
because you kind of said that you were


---------65:47----------
sort of your mom's therapist from the


---------65:49----------
age of seven you were you would try to


---------65:51----------
comfort her you would try to make her


---------65:52----------
happy but you also said that your dad


---------65:55----------
shut down anytime someone approached him


---------66:00----------
with negative emotion and he would


---------66:01----------
withdraw from it so funny yeah so the


---------66:05----------
funny thing there is I'm in imagining


---------66:06----------
7-year old you and you have a pile of


---------66:09----------
feelings some of which are good and some


---------66:11----------
of which are bad and so if your mom sort


---------66:14----------
of takes all the good feelings because


---------66:16----------
those are the ones that you show her


---------66:17----------
where do you put the bad feelings and


---------66:20----------
usually what happens in a relationship


---------66:21----------
is you show those feelings to the other


---------66:23----------
parent right so like if if like


---------66:28----------
two-year-old once again if two-year-old


---------66:31----------
if I yell at my two-year-old she runs to


---------66:34----------
her mom for comfort so anytime like one


---------66:38----------
parent puts pressure on a child usually


---------66:41----------
that child turns to the other parent to


---------66:43----------
balance that pressure the tricky thing


---------66:46----------
about your situation


---------66:48----------
is that I'm hearing that I can imagine


---------66:50----------
that you probably when you were very


---------66:52----------
young tried to share your negative


---------66:54----------
feelings with your dad but you noticed


---------66:56----------
that he retreated from them and so you


---------66:59----------
had to be happy with your mom and you


---------67:01----------
had to be happy with your dad and and so


---------67:06----------
that's sort of makes sense because this


---------67:08----------
whole time we've been talking to you and


---------67:09----------
it seems like all you really care about


---------67:11----------
is other people's happiness like when we


---------67:14----------
ask you like you belong in a van in New


---------67:16----------
Zealand and camping and in nature in


---------67:18----------
wilderness and why are you streaming


---------67:21----------
it's because you want to make other


---------67:22----------
people happy that's what you said so


---------67:25----------
you're sacrificing yourself for the sake


---------67:27----------
of making other people happy


---------67:30----------
and would you say that you're someone


---------67:32----------
who does that yeah


---------67:34----------
and then we get to the polyamorous


---------67:36----------
relationship and so there's a


---------67:39----------
polyamorous relationship painful for you


---------67:43----------
well not working out with other people


---------67:46----------
yeah yeah so let me ask you again is the


---------67:51----------
polyamorous relationship painful for you


---------67:55----------
yes and and if we ask you why you do it


---------68:00----------
your answer is because you really love


---------68:03----------
being loved by destiny and you want to


---------68:05----------
you want other people to experience that


---------68:07----------
love so I think we have another case of


---------68:11----------
something actually being quite painful


---------68:13----------
for you and it sounds like it's been


---------68:15----------
pretty rough over the last year and


---------68:17----------
you're willing to do it to make other


---------68:20----------
people happy to give other people the


---------68:24----------
opportunity to be loved by destiny what


---------68:28----------
do you think about that


---------68:32----------
so I think the tricky thing for you


---------68:34----------
Melina's I wonder how we you would feel


---------68:38----------
if you started putting yourself first I


---------68:41----------
don't know I'm not sure if I've ever


---------68:47----------
done that yeah what do you think about


---------68:52----------
that


---------68:54----------
it tells me that itself it huh something


---------69:03----------
I don't know what's going on with this


---------69:06----------
server hold on one second let me see if


---------69:07----------
I can do this no I can't


---------69:12----------
I'm also yeah okay let's just let


---------69:16----------
goddamnit


---------69:17----------
we're right at the climax okay


---------69:22----------
all right try again how does it use put


---------69:27----------
yourself first something inside me tells


---------69:33----------
me that it's self so now we get to push


---------69:36----------
yourself because you said earlier that


---------69:39----------
you were pushing yourself and I think


---------69:40----------
what you're pushing what you have to


---------69:43----------
push against is the part of you that


---------69:45----------
feels like you're being selfish


---------69:47----------
what do you think this is I saw what


---------69:52----------
feels unfair to you because other people


---------69:55----------
are being selfish in your polyamorous


---------69:57----------
relationship and you are not


---------70:00----------
and so it's like other people are coming


---------70:02----------
and it's just like with the eggs like


---------70:04----------
she takes a bite of my eggs but I don't


---------70:06----------
get a bite of hers mm-hmm right that


---------70:09----------
doesn't work so milena I'm gonna share


---------70:12----------
one anything any thoughts or questions


---------70:14----------
no I think it's


---------70:22----------
so can I share with you like a story and


---------70:25----------
I guess we have maybe somewhat of a


---------70:28----------
conclusion for you mm-hmm so I think


---------70:31----------
you're a wonderful person and I think


---------70:33----------
it's wonderful that you put other people


---------70:34----------
first but I think unless you get to be


---------70:37----------
really really good at what you do you're


---------70:42----------
gonna get you're gonna continue getting


---------70:43----------
hurt if you continue to be in the


---------70:46----------
situation and I'm not trying to say you


---------70:47----------
should or shouldn't do anything it's


---------70:49----------
just I've worked with a fair number of


---------70:52----------
people who have been an open or


---------70:53----------
polyamorous relationships and there's


---------70:55----------
usually like a lot of hurt I don't know


---------70:59----------
how else to put it


---------71:01----------
can you hear me okay yeah okay so my mom


---------71:11----------
once told me that if you want to be


---------71:14----------
happy


---------71:14----------
yep okay let me just think about where


---------71:17----------
to start with this so in Hinduism there


---------71:19----------
are two incarnations of with this


---------71:21----------
particular God named Vishnu one of the


---------71:24----------
incarnations is this guy named ROM and


---------71:26----------
ROM was sort of like this idea of like


---------71:29----------
the ideal human being so he was just and


---------71:32----------
he was kind and he was Noble and he was


---------71:35----------
honest and he was giving and ROM story


---------71:38----------
is that he this is gonna be great


---------71:41----------
actually that's a great sir so what


---------71:43----------
happens is he decides that there's a


---------71:46----------
princess that he wants to marry and then


---------71:48----------
there's another king that wants to marry


---------71:49----------
that same princess the princess's name


---------71:51----------
is see that so they actually have this


---------71:54----------
kind of competition where the winner of


---------71:55----------
the competition gets to marry see that


---------71:57----------
and so rom ends up winning the


---------71:59----------
competition because see factually


---------72:01----------
doesn't let this other King this other


---------72:03----------
guy's name is Robin she doesn't let him


---------72:05----------
compete so gonna have a contest in the


---------72:07----------
winner of the contest get Sita's hand in


---------72:09----------
marriage so Rob wins he ends up marrying


---------72:11----------
Sita and see that doesn't let this guy


---------72:13----------
Robin she doesn't let him compete so


---------72:16----------
Robin gets pissed because he's like


---------72:17----------
that's unfair I should be able to


---------72:19----------
compete too and so after Rama and Sita


---------72:21----------
get married Robin actually kidnaps her


---------72:24----------
and takes her to his Island where he


---------72:27----------
tries to get her to fall in love with


---------72:29----------
him and then Rob essentially raises an


---------72:32----------
army and fights a war kills Robin and


---------72:34----------
then brings seatback


---------72:36----------
with me so far mm-hmm so once he comes


---------72:40----------
back something funny happened so ROM is


---------72:42----------
a king at this point in Cephas a queen


---------72:44----------
and his court really doesn't like Sita


---------72:47----------
and Rama's like what's wrong what I


---------72:49----------
don't understand like why don't you guys


---------72:50----------
like her and they say well she was kind


---------72:52----------
of like living in Robin's house for a


---------72:54----------
couple of years like you never really


---------72:56----------
know what happened maybe she was


---------72:58----------
unfaithful to you and Rama Rama says


---------73:00----------
well she says she's not an unfaithful


---------73:02----------
and and I don't I mean she says she was


---------73:04----------
faithful and I believed her


---------73:06----------
so like I don't see why it's a problem


---------73:08----------
for you guys and despite Rob's best


---------73:10----------
attempts to convince this court that


---------73:13----------
she's we should be everything should be


---------73:15----------
fine now because I fought a battle and I


---------73:16----------
won and I killed the bad guy and I came


---------73:19----------
home with the Queen like everything's


---------73:20----------
good right this is how the story ends


---------73:21----------
his court is basically like now we just


---------73:24----------
don't trust her they're haters they're


---------73:26----------
like the internet and so rom decides


---------73:30----------
that he's going to put the needs of the


---------73:32----------
kingdom ahead of his marriage and


---------73:35----------
decides that it's it's better for a


---------73:38----------
kingdom to have a queen that they can


---------73:40----------
love and respect even that's more


---------73:44----------
important than like whether she was


---------73:45----------
faithful or not so he ends up divorcing


---------73:47----------
her what do you think about that


---------73:56----------
I don't know okay so now let me tell you


---------74:00----------
about the other incarnation okay so a


---------74:02----------
thousand years later the same God


---------74:04----------
supposedly incarnate as another person


---------74:06----------
named Krishna and Krishna is different


---------74:08----------
from Rama even though it's sort of


---------74:09----------
supposed to be the same God in two


---------74:11----------
different bodies Krishna


---------74:13----------
you know grows up and has a couple of


---------74:17----------
wives and up to maybe a thousand


---------74:19----------
girlfriends so he maybe was it sounds


---------74:22----------
like he was in a polyamorous


---------74:23----------
relationship yeah and so part of the


---------74:26----------
reason that he actually had a thousand


---------74:28----------
girlfriends or what some people say is


---------74:29----------
that like there were a fair number of


---------74:31----------
women who were unsupported and so he


---------74:35----------
ended up marrying them maybe was a


---------74:38----------
player unclear actually he was a player


---------74:40----------
the stories also kind of described as a


---------74:42----------
player but he like supported a lot of


---------74:44----------
women and had like lots of wives and he


---------74:47----------
also does like all kinds of like


---------74:49----------
relatively shady things


---------74:50----------
so whereas ROM would never lie like


---------74:53----------
Krishna would let me try to come up with


---------74:57----------
a quick story so in ancient India there


---------75:00----------
was a code of war but am I losing you by


---------75:02----------
the way I don't know I can't tell okay


---------75:04----------
so is this code of war where you


---------75:06----------
basically are not allowed to fight after


---------75:08----------
the Sun Goes Down so like everyone wakes


---------75:11----------
up in the morning once Dawn once the Sun


---------75:13----------
is above the horizon you start fighting


---------75:14----------
and then you fight all day and when the


---------75:16----------
sun goes down you stop fighting no sneak


---------75:18----------
attacks no nighttime attacks nothing


---------75:20----------
like that so it was like a code that


---------75:22----------
people adhere to so one day Krishna


---------75:25----------
realizes that there's going to be an


---------75:26----------
eclipse and so it's gonna look like the


---------75:29----------
Sun is gonna go down so he goes to his


---------75:32----------
his army basically he's an advisor he


---------75:35----------
doesn't actually fight himself and he


---------75:36----------
says by the way something funny is gonna


---------75:38----------
happen today the Sun is gonna go down or


---------75:40----------
it's gonna look like it gets dark and


---------75:42----------
then you guys are gonna everyone's gonna


---------75:44----------
want to stop fighting and I want you


---------75:46----------
guys to stop fighting for like ten


---------75:47----------
minutes


---------75:48----------
and when the other army puts their


---------75:51----------
weapons away I want you to pull out your


---------75:52----------
weapons and then basically slaughter


---------75:54----------
them while they're defenseless and then


---------75:57----------
his troops are like but wait so you want


---------76:01----------
us to violate the code of war and he's


---------76:02----------
like no no no trust me you're not


---------76:04----------
violating the code of war but just do


---------76:06----------
what I say and so sure enough the


---------76:08----------
Eclipse happens the Sun appears to go


---------76:10----------
down


---------76:10----------
or it gets dark like the Sun is going


---------76:12----------
down so everyone stops fighting


---------76:14----------
everyone's kind of confused because it


---------76:15----------
happened a couple of hours early but


---------76:17----------
maybe they lost track of time and


---------76:19----------
krishna's side waits for everyone to put


---------76:21----------
their weapons away and then he gives the


---------76:23----------
order and then his troops basically


---------76:25----------
slaughter like thousands or tens of


---------76:28----------
thousands of unarmed people and they win


---------76:30----------
the day and then krishna says by the way


---------76:33----------
technically we didn't make a mistake


---------76:34----------
like technically we did exactly what we


---------76:36----------
were supposed to do so good job can you


---------76:38----------
see how rama and krishna are different


---------76:46----------
like if I sort of made it clear that


---------76:48----------
they're kind of like different people I


---------76:50----------
think you have to explain a little bit


---------76:52----------
so like Rob is a super noble guy like


---------76:54----------
Rob would never do that


---------76:56----------
he's a good guy he cares about other


---------76:58----------
people krishna doesn't give a [ __ ] about


---------76:59----------
other people


---------77:00----------
he'll adhere to the code of what he's


---------77:03----------
technically supposed to do but he puts


---------77:05----------
himself first


---------77:07----------
right rom puts other people first and


---------77:10----------
it's not that krishna puts himself first


---------77:12----------
at the expense of other people he's not


---------77:14----------
a bad person


---------77:16----------
but he doesn't like adhere to a code


---------77:18----------
he's sort of have you heard this phrase


---------77:20----------
the ends justifies the means no so


---------77:25----------
that's a phrase that means like you know


---------77:27----------
if you have to steal to feed your family


---------77:29----------
that's okay like the end goal is the


---------77:32----------
important thing even if you have to do


---------77:33----------
something bad in the middle like it's


---------77:35----------
okay to do something it's okay to do bad


---------77:38----------
things for good reasons does that make


---------77:41----------
sense so Rob is someone who would say


---------77:43----------
it's not okay to do bad things for good


---------77:46----------
reasons and Krishna is someone that it's


---------77:49----------
okay to do bad things if you're doing it


---------77:51----------
for the right reasons what do you think


---------77:53----------
do you think it's okay to do bad things


---------77:55----------
for good reasons another guy would do it


---------77:59----------
I completely agree yeah so I think


---------78:02----------
you're more like ROM than you are like


---------78:05----------
Krishna yeah so there are two things


---------78:07----------
that I leave you with my mom once told


---------78:09----------
me something very very wise when I was


---------78:11----------
fifteen she says if you want to live a


---------78:13----------
good life live like ROM and if you want


---------78:17----------
to live a happy life live like Krishna


---------78:20----------
so I put the same thing to you milena


---------78:23----------
that you


---------78:25----------
I don't really know but sometimes I


---------78:26----------
pretend to be a wise person when I


---------78:28----------
scream on Twitch so what I would tell


---------78:31----------
you is that I think the person that you


---------78:32----------
are who's incredibly giving and you put


---------78:35----------
other people ahead of yourself


---------78:36----------
the world is filled with a lot of people


---------78:39----------
who will take advantage of you and I'm


---------78:42----------
it's sad that you had to learn that


---------78:43----------
lesson but I also think that the world


---------78:46----------
is filled with lots of good people too


---------78:48----------
in fact I believe that it's not good


---------78:50----------
people are bad people that everyone has


---------78:52----------
a good side and everyone has a bad side


---------78:54----------
that's what I believe so I believe that


---------78:56----------
we all have ROM within us and we all


---------78:58----------
have Krishna within us and I think


---------79:01----------
you're in for a lot of suffering if you


---------79:03----------
don't if you continue to sort of


---------79:06----------
mindlessly put other people first so I


---------79:09----------
put other people first too but I'm just


---------79:11----------
really mindful about the way that I do


---------79:13----------
it like I think you know some people


---------79:15----------
think I'm a good person I think I'm kind


---------79:16----------
of like a good person kind of but I also


---------79:19----------
set limits like I'm not going to


---------79:21----------
sacrifice some things about my health


---------79:24----------
and well-being for the sake of helping


---------79:25----------
other people and I think going forward I


---------79:29----------
would really encourage you to think a


---------79:31----------
little bit about whether you can be a


---------79:32----------
little bit more selfish and what that


---------79:34----------
would feel like because I think you're


---------79:37----------
learning I'm right yeah go ahead sorry I


---------79:42----------
don't know how I can do that yeah I


---------79:45----------
don't know how you can do it either I'm


---------79:46----------
not even sure that you should do it


---------79:48----------
what I think you should do though is I


---------79:50----------
think you have this reflexive part of


---------79:53----------
you that probably started when you were


---------79:54----------
a child where you started putting other


---------79:57----------
people ahead of you and I think that


---------80:00----------
that's actually not healthy for people


---------80:02----------
it's not even healthy for the people


---------80:05----------
that you do that for and I don't know


---------80:07----------
maybe I can explain this real quick so


---------80:09----------
you know if you have a relationship


---------80:12----------
where one person does all of the work


---------80:13----------
and one person does all the relaxation


---------80:16----------
that's not healthy for either person


---------80:20----------
does that make sense yeah and so I


---------80:23----------
wonder if like all of these


---------80:25----------
relationships that you engage in you're


---------80:28----------
sharing your food and they're not


---------80:30----------
sharing theirs I don't know if that's


---------80:32----------
actually good for them it's like it's it


---------80:37----------
feels like it's every


---------80:38----------
I don't know if is like it's a lot of


---------80:40----------
people yeah so I think you've got to


---------80:44----------
make a decision about whether you want


---------80:46----------
to continue being taken advantage of


---------80:48----------
because it sounds like that's what's


---------80:50----------
happening would you say that that's fair


---------80:51----------
no no how would you describe it you


---------80:57----------
don't think you're getting taken


---------80:58----------
advantage of yeah yeah you think so okay


---------81:01----------
yeah yeah so I think you've got to think


---------81:04----------
a lot about whether you want to let


---------81:05----------
yourself do that and I think if if you


---------81:07----------
don't want to be taken advantage of I


---------81:09----------
think part of what that means is being a


---------81:11----------
little bit more selfish and I don't


---------81:13----------
think being selfish is a bad thing


---------81:14----------
that's the whole point of all of this


---------81:16----------
stuff is I think you've got to think


---------81:17----------
about it you know when you let someone


---------81:19----------
into your life because you want them to


---------81:21----------
be loved by destiny are you willing to


---------81:24----------
have them shut the door in your face no


---------81:27----------
okay


---------81:29----------
isn't that being selfish though aren't


---------81:34----------
you depriving them of destiny's love I


---------81:39----------
don't think it's okay to me good I don't


---------81:43----------
think it is either


---------81:44----------
and I don't think being selfish is a bad


---------81:46----------
person especially someone with you


---------81:48----------
because the last thing that I'll share


---------81:50----------
with you is this is what I see with


---------81:51----------
people who have Shakthi is that they get


---------81:54----------
drained dry by the hungry people that


---------81:58----------
everyone wants a piece of you and you're


---------82:00----------
so loving and you're so kind that


---------82:02----------
they're just gonna suck you dry and you


---------82:05----------
have to learn you have to learn how to


---------82:07----------
like when to give and when not to give


---------82:10----------
and that should be under your control


---------82:11----------
instead of it being like completely


---------82:14----------
random and under their control because


---------82:17----------
otherwise I think you're in for years


---------82:19----------
and years and years of suffering and


---------82:21----------
pain what like your situation is could


---------82:27----------
it be what situations could what like


---------82:30----------
years of suffering pain like I know like


---------82:33----------
more what situation could it be where I


---------82:36----------
have to like think more selfish I mean


---------82:41----------
personally I would start with the two


---------82:45----------
things I would think about would be


---------82:46----------
streaming in your relationship so I'd


---------82:49----------
think about everything that you do


---------82:52----------
a transaction you're giving something


---------82:55----------
and you're getting something because


---------82:57----------
that's what it is right if you don't if


---------82:58----------
if streaming opens you up to drama


---------83:01----------
you're what you're helping a bunch of


---------83:03----------
people but you're also opening yourself


---------83:05----------
up to drama so like which one do you


---------83:07----------
want to do like is it worth it or is it


---------83:09----------
not worth it that's one example I think


---------83:13----------
the other thing which I think you guys


---------83:14----------
are it sounds like y'all are already


---------83:16----------
exploring is like being a little bit


---------83:18----------
careful about who you let into your open


---------83:20----------
relationship yeah and the last thing


---------83:25----------
this is gonna be the hardest one is if


---------83:28----------
you feel hurt by something can you ask


---------83:33----------
people to make a sacrifice so that you


---------83:38----------
feel less hurt I guess I can ask do you


---------83:44----------
feel comfortable asking yeah so let's


---------83:49----------
say that there was someone that you felt


---------83:50----------
like was toxic for your relationship


---------83:52----------
would you feel comfortable asking that


---------83:54----------
destiny to like remove them from your


---------83:57----------
life or see less of them or anything


---------83:59----------
like that or would you feel like that's


---------84:00----------
controlling I don't think he would be


---------84:03----------
very happy with it


---------84:06----------
okay so beautiful so notice I asked you


---------84:10----------
a question and what was your answer he


---------84:13----------
wouldn't be happy with it which is not


---------84:16----------
selfish exactly that's that's exactly


---------84:19----------
what I'm saying that's what you need to


---------84:21----------
think about right so then you know I


---------84:23----------
mean if you guys are married in my mind


---------84:26----------
that means that y'all are special and


---------84:28----------
there are other people that are less


---------84:30----------
special than you are in the relationship


---------84:32----------
that could be a problem on my end right


---------84:34----------
that you guys love each other yeah so I


---------84:37----------
in in my mind that sort of means that


---------84:43----------
like so you the way that you're putting


---------84:44----------
him first I think he should put you


---------84:46----------
first right that's the only way it works


---------84:49----------
it's like you're saying like he wouldn't


---------84:51----------
be very happy with it and and that's so


---------84:53----------
the question is like are you okay with


---------84:55----------
that


---------84:55----------
is he okay with that are you guys in a


---------84:58----------
relationship where it's okay for him to


---------85:00----------
be happy because and because think about


---------85:03----------
the opposite like if you don't talk to


---------85:04----------
him about that you're unhappy


---------85:05----------
right if there's someone toxic in


---------85:08----------
y'all's relationship you're unhappy and


---------85:10----------
he's happy he's fine with it


---------85:12----------
and if you talk to him maybe he becomes


---------85:15----------
unhappy and then do you become happy or


---------85:17----------
does it end up somewhere in the middle I


---------85:21----------
would feel so bad yeah and I think it


---------85:24----------
would be happy about him not being happy


---------85:26----------
yeah so I in my mind it's not asking him


---------85:29----------
to necessarily do something I think the


---------85:31----------
healthiest thing to do is have a


---------85:32----------
conversation about it


---------85:33----------
mm-hmm right and and to me it seems very


---------85:37----------
clear that you put him ahead of you yeah


---------85:43----------
I would say so I feel like I give up a


---------85:45----------
lot of things yeah I think he does that


---------85:47----------
too sure and that's how a marriage works


---------85:49----------
yeah right so even an open one so I


---------85:52----------
think about marriage is giving 60 and


---------85:54----------
taking 40 you give 60 and he takes 40


---------85:58----------
and he gives 60 and you take 40 that's


---------86:01----------
the only way it works so but I mean I


---------86:05----------
hopefully you caught that right like the


---------86:07----------
your first thought is not about you it's


---------86:08----------
about other people


---------86:09----------
it doesn't make you anything that makes


---------86:11----------
you a good person for by all means and


---------86:13----------
I'm not saying that you should become a


---------86:14----------
selfish [ __ ] I'm not saying that you


---------86:15----------
should try to control destiny I'm saying


---------86:18----------
that if something hurts you and you're


---------86:20----------
in a relationship I would advise you to


---------86:22----------
talk to your partner or fiancee about


---------86:25----------
what's painful to you because you're not


---------86:27----------
remember once again it's not about like


---------86:29----------
you controlling him and making giving


---------86:32----------
making him give something up in my mind


---------86:35----------
it's about you sharing your feelings


---------86:37----------
with them and then hopefully he'll


---------86:39----------
choose what you would choose like if he


---------86:42----------
came to you and he said hey you're in


---------86:43----------
this relationship with this person it's


---------86:45----------
very hurtful to me what would you do I


---------86:49----------
would probably try to talk about it and


---------86:52----------
like see if there's any if there's


---------86:55----------
anything we could do or if there's any


---------86:57----------
misunderstandings or perfect yeah so I


---------87:01----------
think that's what we're talking about


---------87:02----------
right but I would be careful because


---------87:03----------
then I would imagine just based on your


---------87:06----------
thoughts that you wouldn't even bring it


---------87:07----------
up for with him because you're afraid


---------87:09----------
that he wouldn't like it


---------87:13----------
[Music]


---------87:15----------
I think I'm better at doing that now


---------87:18----------
good and I think you better I think yeah


---------87:22----------
yeah you think what I think if maybe it


---------87:26----------
was worse before maybe yep I can imagine


---------87:30----------
I think you're I'm sure you're better


---------87:32----------
now Molina I think you still have a


---------87:34----------
little ways to go


---------87:35----------
mm-hmm why do you think that because I


---------87:39----------
think it's hard to undo a life an


---------87:42----------
upbringing and a life of putting other


---------87:44----------
people first I think it's hard to be


---------87:49----------
less selfish I mean more software sorry


---------87:53----------
because you've you've been a giver your


---------87:55----------
entire life and it can feel very very


---------87:57----------
bad to not be a giver yeah but I'm I'm


---------88:03----------
happy for you I'm hopeful for you and


---------88:07----------
I'm rooting for you


---------88:09----------
I'm rooting for destiny I'm a big fan of


---------88:11----------
both you all at this point so I hope you


---------88:13----------
guys finally working huh why is that why


---------88:16----------
you're a big fan of you were four ugh


---------88:18----------
destiny both or anything I'm a big fan


---------88:22----------
of destiny because I just have a lot of


---------88:23----------
respect for him like I think he's uh I


---------88:27----------
think he's one of the very few people


---------88:29----------
who practices what he preaches so I


---------88:33----------
think that he doesn't take things at


---------88:37----------
face value in the conclusions that he


---------88:39----------
comes to are really like thought-out and


---------88:42----------
he's very open-minded so I respect him


---------88:45----------
for that I just personally I like him


---------88:47----------
like I enjoy watching his stream like I


---------88:49----------
find him to be entertaining why am i fan


---------88:52----------
for you because I think that you are a


---------88:53----------
good person


---------88:54----------
I'm not so sure he is but I think he


---------88:57----------
chooses to be good and I think he


---------89:00----------
chooses to be good yeah which I respect


---------89:02----------
more than someone who has to be good


---------89:04----------
which is you so I think you're not


---------89:07----------
actually in control of your goodness


---------89:09----------
which i think is actually a problem but


---------89:13----------
I think that you're a wonderful person


---------89:14----------
and I think that the world needs more


---------89:15----------
people like you and the world would be a


---------89:18----------
better place if there were more people


---------89:20----------
like you but unfortunately the world


---------89:22----------
isn't filled with people like you


---------89:24----------
so I think you're in for a lot of hurt


---------89:26----------
doesn't mean that you can't live


---------89:29----------
fulfilling life I think it'll just be


---------89:31----------
you're gonna have to make a lot of


---------89:32----------
sacrifices if you continue living the


---------89:35----------
way that you used to and I think it's


---------89:39----------
gonna be hard because you know you the


---------89:42----------
first thought that you have is about


---------89:43----------
other people yeah and that's that's a


---------89:48----------
painful way to live it's not my place to


---------89:52----------
say that you should do this or should


---------89:54----------
shouldn't do that I mean that's for you


---------89:56----------
to decide all I really want you to do is


---------89:58----------
notice when you think about other people


---------89:59----------
instead of yourself and especially if


---------90:02----------
there's one person in the world that you


---------90:03----------
should be able to have and this is my


---------90:05----------
value so this is my bias there's one


---------90:07----------
person in the world that you should be


---------90:08----------
able to have a conversation about your


---------90:09----------
feelings about even if it negatively


---------90:12----------
impacts them it's your fiance or husband


---------90:16----------
yeah right that's the one person that


---------90:18----------
you should not feel alone from whereas I


---------90:22----------
feel I can probably feel a lot like you


---------90:24----------
probably would hold a lot of stuff


---------90:26----------
because of the way that he you're


---------90:28----------
concerned about his reactions does that


---------90:32----------
make sense any other thoughts or


---------90:34----------
questions I think I think it's good I'm


---------90:39----------
really happy that I got to talk to you


---------90:41----------
me too I I'm afraid that I wasn't very


---------90:43----------
helpful to you but I really I don't know


---------90:47----------
I don't know if what I said I felt like


---------90:51----------
I wasn't very clear today no see it's um


---------90:57----------
sometimes this is a little bit hard for


---------90:59----------
me to follow I think especially with


---------91:01----------
like language stuff yeah but it's okay


---------91:03----------
like I feel loved everything yeah so


---------91:07----------
yeah thank you and you know if you have


---------91:09----------
any other questions or you want to


---------91:11----------
follow up at some point I'd be more than


---------91:13----------
happy to


---------91:13----------
and I really moline I wish you all the


---------91:15----------
best like I know covent sucks


---------91:17----------
and all that stuff but I really hope


---------91:19----------
that you know things do work out between


---------91:21----------
the two of y'all I'm sure they will it


---------91:22----------
sounds like both of you guys care a lot


---------91:24----------
about each other I think so yeah yeah


---------91:26----------
yeah and yeah I'm really happy that you


---------91:28----------
have someone in your life like that and


---------91:29----------
I'm really happy for destiny that he has


---------91:31----------
someone is life like you thank you take


---------91:35----------
care okay thank you so much bye

want it so I teach people meditation


---------92:15----------
sometimes on stream or you introduce


---------92:16----------
eight it comes in periods okay they do


---------92:22----------
that do you would you like to do some


---------92:24----------
attitude is there some kind of


---------92:25----------
meditation that you like to do I don't


---------92:30----------
think it there's like any specific ones


---------92:31----------
that I do it's just more like I don't


---------92:35----------
know I think it they're like a little


---------92:37----------
bit in my own way can I try to teach you


---------92:42----------
something yeah okay so this is I'm gonna


---------92:46----------
try to figure this out myself as we're


---------92:47----------
doing it okay so I apologize for that so


---------92:50----------
I want the people who are watching it


---------92:51----------
like it follow along but I'm just gonna


---------92:53----------
try something if it doesn't work well


---------92:54----------
I'll teach you some very focused


---------92:56----------
breathing or something like that so I


---------92:57----------
want you to close your eyes I'm gonna


---------92:59----------
ask you to explore some stuff within you


---------93:01----------
okay great see already the breath


---------93:04----------
changes so you're already doing it this


---------93:08----------
is fantastic so I want you to just


---------93:10----------
notice what are you doing how are you


---------93:12----------
what's changed when I focus on it yeah


---------93:16----------
like like do you feel different um yeah


---------93:22----------
how do you feel what's different we've


---------93:24----------
been talking for almost like an hour and


---------93:26----------
a half right so how do you feel


---------93:29----------
different now like like all of the


---------93:35----------
things that I usually think about when I


---------93:37----------
when I think you know you're gone yes


---------93:42----------
beautiful right so you guys can see it


---------93:44----------
like especially we can see your your


---------93:47----------
clavicle like a collarbone the the the


---------93:53----------
right side of your neck so because of


---------93:54----------
the shirt that you're wearing you can


---------93:56----------
actually see the way that you're taking


---------93:57----------
a breath really very easily so that's


---------93:59----------
very helpful actually so I'm gonna ask


---------94:03----------
you to look for the part of you that


---------94:07----------
wants to make the world a better place


---------94:11----------
look for that part inside you the part


---------94:14----------
of you that wants other people to be


---------94:16----------
happy can you find it


---------94:20----------
okay yeah what does that feel like I


---------94:26----------
think that's where I usually feel stuff


---------94:28----------
most from where it's either like a


---------94:31----------
pressure or I feel I don't know this is


---------94:34----------
where I feel anxious or this where I


---------94:35----------
feel like really like if I feel a lot of


---------94:37----------
love I feel it from there as well yeah


---------94:40----------
so then I want you to just think about


---------94:45----------
this when you feel a lot of love for


---------94:47----------
people is that just a positive feeling


---------94:53----------
in your chest or is there also a


---------94:54----------
negative feeling that comes with it


---------94:57----------
there's a negative so let's just pause


---------95:01----------
and think about that for a second


---------95:04----------
right that's kind of strange because


---------95:06----------
generally speaking when like what I


---------95:10----------
think about you know when I'm loving one


---------95:15----------
of my kids I don't have a negative


---------95:18----------
feeling that comes with that does that


---------95:19----------
make sense but I do imagine that when


---------95:23----------
you feel some amount of love sometimes


---------95:26----------
you feel something negative with it what


---------95:30----------
do you just can use can you help us


---------95:32----------
understand a little bit and this may be


---------95:33----------
hard can you help us understand like


---------95:36----------
what the positive feels like and what


---------95:37----------
the negative feels like but they're


---------95:39----------
almost like two sides of a coin the


---------95:43----------
positive is like that I want people to


---------95:47----------
be happy and I think that's good you


---------95:51----------
might want that and that makes me happy


---------95:53----------
yeah but I also feel like I'm not in the


---------95:55----------
picture yep what does that feel like in


---------96:00----------
your body what is not being in the


---------96:02----------
picture feel like in your body very


---------96:05----------
small yes and like that's worth it sort


---------96:10----------
of yeah right so I want you to just


---------96:15----------
focus on those two sensations I want you


---------96:20----------
to find the love in the positivity that


---------96:23----------
you feel towards other people and then I


---------96:26----------
want you to at the same time notice that


---------96:29----------
feeling of not being


---------96:30----------
in the picture


---------96:38----------
man that's such a good summary for our


---------96:40----------
entire conversation and because milena I


---------96:44----------
think that's beautifully put because I


---------96:46----------
think when you put other people first


---------96:48----------
you remove yourself in the picture from


---------96:51----------
the picture and I think the whole thing


---------96:53----------
is that for you to truly be peaceful I


---------96:55----------
think you have to be a part of that


---------96:57----------
picture that's what you did with your


---------96:59----------
mom right you set your own feelings


---------97:01----------
aside you let the whole picture the


---------97:03----------
whole picture is dominated by her and


---------97:08----------
notice whenever you I want you to think


---------97:10----------
back to like when she was struggling and


---------97:13----------
you were able to help her how good you


---------97:16----------
felt about yourself how good you felt


---------97:20----------
about her and then also try to catch


---------97:25----------
that little part of your sacrifice what


---------97:32----------
you gave up in order to do that you gave


---------97:37----------
something up from you and find that


---------97:40----------
little thing can you find it where is it


---------97:51----------
hmm it's like in the back I don't know


---------97:57----------
like it's like I don't know


---------98:00----------
it's kind it's hard to describe it it


---------98:04----------
feels like it like pulls me back a


---------98:05----------
little bit yeah it does pull you back


---------98:09----------
right because it helps it keeps you from


---------98:11----------
being this perfect person it's perfect


---------98:14----------
giver and how do you feel about that


---------98:18----------
part of you


---------98:47----------
something I realize that I do whenever I


---------98:50----------
look at a picture and myself as a kid I


---------98:52----------
get really sad yeah


---------98:55----------
and that's like the same feeling I get


---------98:58----------
when they think about this yeah


---------99:01----------
does your childhood was very sad


---------99:12----------
it's gonna want you to sit with that


---------99:14----------
feeling and I think what you've got to


---------99:18----------
stop doing is trying to push it away so


---------99:22----------
I want you to understand this milena


---------99:23----------
that you have a six year old or seven


---------99:26----------
year old inside you that wants to make


---------99:28----------
the world a better place for everyone


---------99:30----------
else but no one takes care of her right


---------99:35----------
oh that wouldn't make destiny very happy


---------99:38----------
there she is again


---------99:40----------
always looking to help others but she


---------99:45----------
needs someone to take care of her too


---------99:47----------
that person has to be you so right now


---------99:55----------
these two feelings of caring for others


---------99:58----------
and neglecting yourself for removing


---------100:02----------
yourself from the picture from feeling


---------100:04----------
like you're not in the picture that's


---------100:06----------
got to change


---------100:08----------
and I want you to sit with these two


---------100:11----------
feelings and just let them be and see if


---------100:15----------
there's some way that you can let both


---------100:16----------
of them coexist so take a deep breath in


---------100:19----------
and notice that the front of your chest


---------100:22----------
and your back both change they expand


---------100:24----------
they move away from each other and then


---------100:27----------
as you breathe out they come together


---------100:30----------
breathe in they move away and breathe


---------100:35----------
out they come together breathe in


---------100:43----------
and breathe out and I'll let them


---------100:45----------
naturally come together let them sit


---------100:49----------
with each other let them mingle together


---------101:04----------
now Melina I don't know exactly how to


---------101:07----------
do this but I just asked you to try I


---------101:09----------
want you to take that part of you that


---------101:12----------
puts that loves other people


---------101:14----------
unconditionally the part of you that's


---------101:17----------
capable of love and I want you to turn


---------101:20----------
it towards yourself because all of your


---------101:24----------
love always is going out is going out is


---------101:27----------
going out and then inside is a six or


---------101:30----------
seven year old girl who gets neglected


---------101:33----------
she's the one who's giving giving giving


---------101:36----------
and give that to yourself send it from


---------101:42----------
you to you


---------102:15----------
and now for the last phase I want you to


---------102:20----------
just try to notice your whole body we've


---------102:25----------
talked about things we've felt things


---------102:27----------
their feelings their thoughts emotions


---------102:30----------
physical sensations just notice all of


---------102:32----------
those things and take a moment to


---------102:36----------
realize that you are actually none of


---------102:39----------
that that's all in your body it's all in


---------102:41----------
your mind


---------102:42----------
but that there is a part of you that is


---------102:43----------
underneath or above all of that and can


---------102:47----------
see all of these things happening and


---------102:51----------
that that place is a little bit


---------102:54----------
separated it's a little bit peaceful


---------103:06----------
and now you can kind of take a little


---------103:08----------
bit of a time out from everything that


---------103:10----------
we've done and just sit with that part


---------103:12----------
and just watch your body let it do


---------103:13----------
whatever it wants now whether it be


---------103:16----------
breathing a certain way feeling a


---------103:17----------
certain way no problem good and when


---------103:28----------
you're ready let yourself come back


---------103:36----------
to Sweden to Cove it'd to uncertainty


---------103:43----------
streaming toxicity longing for a van in


---------103:48----------
New Zealand that is your life and it's


---------103:50----------
okay because you're you and you have


---------103:55----------
that peaceful part of you you have that


---------103:56----------
loving part of you that you have the


---------104:00----------
foundation of your relationship with


---------104:02----------
destiny and you guys have been through a


---------104:04----------
lot


---------104:16----------
doing okay mm-hmm


---------104:21----------
it's very nice good I'm glad you enjoyed


---------104:24----------
it I don't really know how you can do


---------104:27----------
that every day but do it just because I


---------104:31----------
tried to teach people meditation like a


---------104:33----------
practice they can do every day I'm not


---------104:36----------
quite sure but what I would say to you


---------104:37----------
is I want you to notice that those two


---------104:39----------
sides of the coin whenever you find


---------104:42----------
yourself like struggling to make a


---------104:45----------
decision should I talk should I not talk


---------104:47----------
should I say this or I feel hurt try to


---------104:49----------
find both of those parts of yourself and


---------104:51----------
try to bring them together and I think


---------104:52----------
that'll help you it's interesting I


---------104:57----------
never heard someone tell me this tell


---------105:00----------
you what that I seem to put myself away


---------105:04----------
from link because of other people did I


---------105:07----------
want to make them happy


---------105:08----------
yep oh yeah it I don't think people


---------105:11----------
notice it no they take it for granted


---------105:13----------
yeah that's what's unfair about it so I


---------105:17----------
feel very surprised which was kind of


---------105:19----------
what I really like it really happy that


---------105:21----------
but you know you sort of told me that


---------105:24----------
yeah so I'll leave you with one last


---------105:26----------
thing I want you to do a google image


---------105:28----------
search of durga durga is d you are GA


---------105:33----------
all of the MU in a second and just take


---------105:36----------
a look at it and let me know what you


---------105:38----------
see you know if it resonates with you at


---------105:40----------
all what you think that person


---------105:42----------
represents and then yeah we can I'm just


---------105:48----------
curious


---------105:48----------
but because I I think that that's you


---------105:51----------
when I see you I see the guy inside you


---------105:54----------
and so let's see what your reaction it's


---------105:57----------
may be yeah but anyway thank you so much


---------106:01----------
for coming on Melina I really am rooting


---------106:02----------
for you and I hope everything works out


---------106:04----------
and stay safe and stuff thank you so


---------106:06----------
much and if there's some way we can


---------106:07----------
support you just let us know


---------106:09----------
mm-hmm take care of thank you okay


---------106:18----------
so let's do this real quick


---------106:27----------
so let's just do this let me show you


---------106:29----------
guys


---------106:30----------
[Music]


---------106:41----------
so this is God can we do a full image


---------106:47----------
search on the dog I guess what I can


---------106:52----------
show you guys this


---------106:57----------
so this is durga if you guys are


---------106:59----------
wondering but i think she kind of really


---------107:03----------
embodies that absolutely so this guy


---------107:10----------
who's saying there were guys like do i


---------107:12----------
have to do everything around here


---------107:13----------
absolutely we'll go back to that real


---------107:14----------
quick let me show you guys this right so


---------107:18----------
yeah man like don't you guys like don't


---------107:21----------
you guys realize that's what Molina's


---------107:22----------
doing she's doing like 15 things she's


---------107:24----------
like taking care of her and everybody


---------107:26----------
like when when when people were trying


---------107:29----------
to symbolize people like Molina they


---------107:33----------
recognize that there are some you know


---------107:35----------
women especially who were very badass


---------107:38----------
and took care of everything around them


---------107:40----------
and they realized that like two hands is


---------107:42----------
insufficient to capture the essence of


---------107:47----------
who Molina is taking care of right so


---------107:51----------
here's so this is a good one see what


---------107:55----------
this is right so she's also like


---------108:00----------
stabbing people with Spears and [ __ ]


---------108:03----------
swipe it's quite a game of thrones kinda


---------108:09----------
it's like a fantasy RPG mythology


---------108:23----------
and Tiger symbolizes our friendship the


---------108:26----------
tiger King oh yeah man oh man that's too


---------108:30----------
funny okay let's see if we can do let's


---------108:33----------
do questions so we do questions here we


---------108:35----------
go okay


---------108:37----------
got a question hello hey hey okay so if


---------108:46----------
you're very empathic how should you live


---------108:50----------
leave relationship in reference to like


---------108:53----------
the difficulty of feeling the pain they


---------108:55----------
feel and like did you say how should you


---------108:58----------
leave a relationship yeah because we


---------109:02----------
were like milena can can do it milena


---------109:05----------
can like be in that relationship and she


---------109:07----------
can hold on and stuff but some people


---------109:09----------
can't handle relationships like when


---------109:14----------
they were very empathic yeah so it's


---------109:19----------
like the pain that you feel when you


---------109:22----------
hurt someone uh-huh is kind of like it


---------109:26----------
doesn't help when you want to break up


---------109:28----------
with them ah excellent question okay so


---------109:32----------
there are two kind of answers the first


---------109:35----------
is that if you are an empathic person


---------109:36----------
there is a general way that you should


---------109:40----------
learn how to manage your emotions and


---------109:44----------
then the breaking up is like a


---------109:47----------
particular instance of that so there's


---------109:49----------
like a general principle and this is a


---------109:51----------
practical application does that make


---------109:52----------
sense yeah okay so first of all the


---------109:56----------
general principle is that you have to


---------109:57----------
think about yourself like a sponge so


---------110:00----------
the thing about a sponges you absorb


---------110:01----------
things from other people and the goal of


---------110:03----------
a sponge is not necessarily to stop


---------110:05----------
absorbing it's to be able to wring the


---------110:07----------
sponge out so if you want to break up


---------110:10----------
with someone what you really need to do


---------110:11----------
is have a place where you can wring


---------110:14----------
those emotions out because if you try to


---------110:17----------
if the emotions are too much for you to


---------110:20----------
bear then you won't be able to break up


---------110:22----------
with them right that's the basic problem


---------110:25----------
yeah yeah I mean by place huh what do


---------110:30----------
you mean by a place to wring them out


---------110:33----------
yeah great question so that can be


---------110:35----------
anything from Fran


---------110:37----------
or other kinds of emotional support to


---------110:40----------
like physical practices like meditation


---------110:41----------
or yoga to seeing a therapist you just


---------110:45----------
need some way to let the emotion inside


---------110:47----------
you out because what's gonna happen is


---------110:52----------
as you fill up with their hurt your


---------110:56----------
desire to comfort them is gonna take


---------110:58----------
over because they're hurting and it's


---------111:00----------
gonna not let you break up with them


---------111:03----------
yeah that's what happens exactly so what


---------111:06----------
you need to do is take that hurt on and


---------111:08----------
instead of responding to it on your own


---------111:10----------
you need to like wring it out with


---------111:13----------
someone else


---------111:14----------
so that can be like talking to a friend


---------111:16----------
and just sort of talking to them about


---------111:18----------
like hey like I'm really afraid that I'm


---------111:20----------
hurting this person and I really want to


---------111:22----------
help them and and I don't want to break


---------111:24----------
up with them but like I feel like I have


---------111:26----------
to but I don't want to hurt them you


---------111:27----------
need some place to process those


---------111:29----------
emotions outside of giving in to the


---------111:32----------
relationship okay yeah so so that can be


---------111:39----------
I mean as bizarre as it sounds it like


---------111:42----------
that doesn't have to just be one thing


---------111:44----------
so I think a little bit about like you


---------111:45----------
know strengthening yourself in terms of


---------111:48----------
like do you do yoga


---------111:50----------
yeah yoga helped a lot absolutely right


---------111:54----------
so you say helped like it's in the past


---------111:56----------
tense so I when I started the the


---------112:01----------
webinar it really like helped a lot then


---------112:05----------
now it's just like helping good yeah so


---------112:08----------
so I would say like if you can like try


---------112:10----------
to even go to a yoga class because I


---------112:11----------
think doing an hour of yoga three times


---------112:14----------
a week


---------112:14----------
oh you can't go to yoga class that's


---------112:16----------
going never mind that doesn't help yeah


---------112:19----------
but I would say that you know doing a


---------112:21----------
formal yoga practice can help a lot and


---------112:24----------
then think a little bit about a couple


---------112:25----------
of I mean do you have social supports


---------112:27----------
you can lean on I have I have family I


---------112:31----------
guess I have people I can talk to but my


---------112:36----------
my issue then becomes like okay but then


---------112:39----------
I actually like I can leave my emotions


---------112:43----------
let's say with them and I can talk to


---------112:45----------
them about the hurt that I may feel but


---------112:49----------
you know the hurts still gonna


---------112:51----------
there it's just gonna be like less


---------112:52----------
absolutely and that's the beautiful part


---------112:55----------
so that I think the next thing is is to


---------112:58----------
recognize that this is gonna be painful


---------113:01----------
right and you have to develop and this


---------113:04----------
is why I like yoga and meditation is


---------113:05----------
important that you have to develop the


---------113:07----------
capacity within yourself to tolerate


---------113:09----------
some of that pain until you bring the


---------113:11----------
sponge out wring the sponge out so


---------113:13----------
you're gonna absorb a bunch of water


---------113:14----------
you're gonna have to hold it in your


---------113:16----------
sponge for a while and then you're gonna


---------113:18----------
wring it out over there and then you're


---------113:20----------
gonna come back and you're gonna mop up


---------113:22----------
more and then you're gonna go over there


---------113:24----------
and you're gonna wring it out and you're


---------113:25----------
gonna come back and you're gonna mop up


---------113:27----------
more and as you start to understand this


---------113:29----------
about yourself it'll actually become


---------113:31----------
easier because the problem is that when


---------113:33----------
you're a sponge and you don't have a


---------113:35----------
place to wring out you look at this


---------113:36----------
puddle of water and you're like I can't


---------113:38----------
take care of all this water so the


---------113:41----------
process of breaking up with this person


---------113:43----------
is gonna hurt them so much it's too much


---------113:44----------
heart for them to handle it's too much


---------113:46----------
hurt for you to handle so you don't


---------113:48----------
actually break up with them right yeah


---------113:50----------
so what you've got to do is recognize


---------113:52----------
that like you can manage that amount of


---------113:55----------
water if you can wring yourself out a


---------113:57----------
couple of times and while you're


---------113:59----------
carrying that sponge from the puddle to


---------114:01----------
where you're gonna wring it out in the


---------114:02----------
bucket or the sink it's gonna be painful


---------114:06----------
but the last thing that I would do is


---------114:09----------
consider telling your social supports


---------114:11----------
that hey I'm gonna try to break up with


---------114:12----------
so-and-so and I'm gonna need to lean on


---------114:15----------
you for a couple of weeks can we set


---------114:18----------
aside some time to like talk like every


---------114:20----------
other day or something like that and set


---------114:22----------
up like a formal structure to it and


---------114:23----------
then go through the process a structure


---------114:27----------
so like a schedule with like the friend


---------114:33----------
or whatever yeah so like you decide how


---------114:36----------
formal it is but just first of all


---------114:37----------
signal to them that you want to do this


---------114:41----------
and see if you can get them to like


---------114:43----------
understand that you are expecting


---------114:44----------
something from them over a couple of


---------114:46----------
weeks okay right like you don't want to


---------114:49----------
like start day 8 and they're like they


---------114:52----------
stop taking your calls because they


---------114:53----------
don't have the emotional bandwidth and


---------114:55----------
then you're kind of [ __ ] because


---------114:56----------
you're halfway through the process and


---------114:58----------
then some ways taking your bucket away


---------115:04----------
okay okay okay yeah I'm good with that


---------115:11----------
okay awesome okay good luck fantastic


---------115:13----------
question


---------115:15----------
[Music]


---------115:17----------
take care


---------115:20----------
ready hi hey how you doing - good


---------115:33----------
alright so my question is how do you


---------115:36----------
transition to being more selfish instead


---------115:39----------
of instead of putting putting people you


---------115:43----------
love and care like first without


---------115:46----------
neglecting them afterward well let me


---------115:53----------
think about that so first of all there


---------115:54----------
are a couple of different things in that


---------115:55----------
question so how do you get to be more


---------115:58----------
selfish without neglecting them so you


---------116:01----------
have to so this see that question is the


---------116:03----------
problem because you think that putting


---------116:06----------
yourself first is neglecting them do you


---------116:09----------
see that like you're tying neglecting


---------116:11----------
them with being selfish together that in


---------116:14----------
and of itself is the problem because


---------116:17----------
just because you're being selfish


---------116:18----------
doesn't mean that you're gonna be


---------116:20----------
neglecting them right if we think about


---------116:22----------
supporting another human being there's a


---------116:24----------
spectrum there's like 100 percent


---------116:27----------
supporting them and 0% of supporting


---------116:29----------
them let's say like less than 10 percent


---------116:31----------
support is neglectful but like there's a


---------116:36----------
big middle range there where you can


---------116:38----------
start to take care of yourself and


---------116:40----------
prioritize yourself without being


---------116:42----------
neglectful does that make sense sure I


---------116:50----------
follow


---------116:51----------
right so why do you think that being


---------116:53----------
selfish is gonna neglect other people


---------116:55----------
well it's a that sense that like people


---------116:58----------
rely on you you know it is like mental


---------117:01----------
support or like any kind of support or


---------117:03----------
like just being out there and like if


---------117:06----------
it's people you know for a long time now


---------117:09----------
you like have a change to be more about


---------117:12----------
yourself and like less like you more


---------117:15----------
focus on the own circle


---------117:16----------
because that makes yeah so I think you


---------117:19----------
can do that right so like you start to


---------117:20----------
focus on yourself and then you recognize


---------117:22----------
I think it's useful to have


---------117:23----------
conversations with people so like if you


---------117:26----------
think about who are the people that are


---------117:28----------
relying on you right now just start by


---------117:32----------
like picking two or three of them and


---------117:34----------
then like having conversations with them


---------117:36----------
and say like hey I'm going through some


---------117:38----------
stuff right now I really want to be able


---------117:40----------
to support you but I may not be quite as


---------117:43----------
available as I used to be could you have


---------117:45----------
a conversation like that sure but I


---------117:51----------
think like you get that like go through


---------117:54----------
like some sort of like realization what


---------117:56----------
do you want to achieve before you do


---------117:58----------
that but that's just me well there is


---------118:00----------
your problem so I don't think you know


---------118:02----------
you don't have to go through any


---------118:03----------
realization of what you need to achieve


---------118:05----------
before you start setting boundaries with


---------118:07----------
people who are emotionally dependent on


---------118:09----------
you you don't need to do that like I


---------118:12----------
understand that you're feeling you need


---------118:13----------
to do that but like do you see how


---------118:15----------
that's the part like how much you


---------118:17----------
support less so I think dude I think the


---------118:19----------
problem is that you spend so much of


---------118:21----------
your time supporting other people that


---------118:23----------
you never give yourself the time or


---------118:25----------
space to figure out what you want to


---------118:26----------
achieve you've got it backwards


---------118:32----------
what do you think about that yeah like


---------118:36----------
the whole meditation thing really like


---------118:39----------
resonated what you did with their Molina


---------118:41----------
so yeah I can't agree with that yeah so


---------118:45----------
the first yeah go ahead sorry I'm done


---------118:48----------
yeah yeah I mean so the first thing is


---------118:51----------
that you got it like like set aside some


---------118:53----------
time for yourself


---------118:54----------
even if you don't even if it's a waste


---------118:56----------
of time right because you probably feel


---------118:57----------
guilty if you're like okay why am I not


---------119:00----------
emotionally supporting this person if I


---------119:01----------
am like not working towards anything do


---------119:04----------
you have those kinds of thoughts oh yeah


---------119:07----------
sure yeah


---------119:08----------
so you got to let yourself think that


---------119:10----------
because you you know what you're working


---------119:12----------
towards is figuring out what you're


---------119:14----------
working towards and you can't do that if


---------119:18----------
you're consumed by helping other people


---------119:21----------
right like here's the problem you play


---------119:23----------
RPGs sure okay so like the problem here


---------119:28----------
is that you help you spend all of your


---------119:29----------
mana


---------119:30----------
like healing other people and then when


---------119:33----------
it comes to like self development your


---------119:34----------
own right so it starts by like reserving


---------119:40----------
some of your mana pool for yourself and


---------119:42----------
then letting people know that like hey I


---------119:45----------
can't answer my phone every time you


---------119:47----------
call I'm working on a couple of things


---------119:49----------
and all I call you back it like within


---------119:50----------
an hour - or shoot me a text if you need


---------119:52----------
to talk like right now right now I'm I


---------119:57----------
guess I never thought about those things


---------119:59----------
cuz when you like so far deep in you you


---------120:03----------
know you don't like really raise the


---------120:04----------
question absolutely you are a hundred


---------120:07----------
percent correct the deeper in you are


---------120:10----------
the harder it is to see right so this is


---------120:15----------
where you got us take a step back and


---------120:17----------
try to set some set some boundaries


---------120:19----------
which are gonna feel awkward but have a


---------120:22----------
conversation about it and be like hey I


---------120:23----------
want to continue to support you but I'm


---------120:25----------
working on a couple of things is it okay


---------120:27----------
if we like like I'm a big fan of


---------120:28----------
scheduling because scheduling lets


---------120:30----------
people know that they're a priority like


---------120:34----------
when I come to someone and I say that I


---------120:35----------
am taking time out of my day to be


---------120:37----------
available for you it's hard for people


---------120:39----------
to feel like you don't care about them


---------120:41----------
and more importantly it's hard for you


---------120:45----------
to feel like you don't care about them


---------120:54----------
got it yep okay other questions no


---------121:03----------
that's it okay good luck man


---------121:06----------
thank you thank you all right let's do


---------121:09----------
one more


---------121:10----------
Hey


---------121:11----------
[Music]


---------121:13----------
the person's mic isn't working so I'm


---------121:15----------
just gonna ask it for sure


---------121:17----------
[Music]


---------121:20----------
essentially is like being a sponge and


---------121:23----------
ego are they tied together because both


---------121:25----------
want to make like other people happy ego


---------121:30----------
doesn't want to make other people happy


---------121:31----------
so they can be tied together but let's


---------121:33----------
let's start by understanding this ego


---------121:34----------
doesn't want to make other half people


---------121:36----------
happy ego wants to make yourself feel


---------121:38----------
better so if we look at Malina


---------121:42----------
I think Molina's ego is actually quite


---------121:46----------
active so she doesn't come across as


---------121:47----------
egotistical but I think her ego is quite


---------121:49----------
strong and we see her ego because she


---------121:52----------
doesn't view herself as a selfish person


---------121:56----------
right so like her ego is about being


---------121:59----------
this like sulphate selfless loving


---------122:02----------
caring want to make the world a better


---------122:04----------
place and it's not that she's that's


---------122:06----------
false it's just the ego kind of takes


---------122:08----------
one part A one real part of us and then


---------122:13----------
like uses that to like shut down


---------122:14----------
everything else so if we think about you


---------122:17----------
know let's say like a league of Legends


---------122:18----------
or dota player who feels really really


---------122:20----------
like they're good at those games and so


---------122:22----------
their identity revolves around that like


---------122:24----------
people who are doctors have their


---------122:26----------
identity revolve around the doctor so


---------122:28----------
our ego tends to build on the things


---------122:31----------
about us that are true and positive and


---------122:33----------
in doing so it like shoves away a lot of


---------122:37----------
negative and darker stuff that then


---------122:39----------
becomes hard to work on so the sponge


---------122:41----------
and the ego can become related because


---------122:45----------
you can start to develop an ego around


---------122:47----------
being a sponge oh look at how helpful I


---------122:50----------
am look at how wonderful I am look at


---------122:52----------
how much I want the world to be a good


---------122:53----------
place all of these other people are


---------122:55----------
selfish but I am selfless I'm a good


---------122:59----------
person


---------122:59----------
and I want everyone to be happy and I'm


---------123:02----------
willing to sacrifice myself to other


---------123:04----------
people and then when you try to tell


---------123:06----------
that person oh maybe you should try


---------123:07----------
being a


---------123:08----------
little bit more selfish their ego rebels


---------123:10----------
against that because if they derive


---------123:13----------
their value from being a selfless person


---------123:14----------
and you threaten to take that away then


---------123:17----------
who are they they're no one does that


---------123:23----------
make sense yeah you said they answered


---------123:25----------
the question and he also says that he


---------123:27----------
loves you okay well I love him too but


---------123:31----------
not in a polyamorous open relationship


---------123:33----------
kind of way all right thanks a lot no


---------123:38----------
problem okay
