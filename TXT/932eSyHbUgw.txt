---------00:00----------
so the solution was when you play in


---------00:03----------
your region


---------00:04----------
how do you feel about the people in the


---------00:07----------
games that you're with


---------00:08----------
and he's like they're dog and i


---------00:10----------
told him as long as you treat them like


---------00:12----------
dog


---------00:13----------
you will be treated like you will think


---------00:15----------
that you are dog because that's the


---------00:16----------
construction


---------00:17----------
that's the play that your mind enacts


---------00:21----------
i recently discovered that a lot of the


---------00:23----------
emotions i've felt in the past can be


---------00:24----------
described as fear of missing out


---------00:26----------
or fomo i don't know if there's a mental


---------00:28----------
health equivalent


---------00:30----------
i've had the hardest time trying to


---------00:31----------
describe this feeling and i've always


---------00:33----------
defaulted to


---------00:34----------
envy that wasn't always true i get fomo


---------00:37----------
from people doing stuff i don't even


---------00:38----------
care about or want and it's borderline


---------00:40----------
debilitating


---------00:42----------
i've ended friendships because of the


---------00:43----------
life they live and how much it scared me


---------00:45----------
and upset me that they were living more


---------00:48----------
life than me even though i didn't care


---------00:50----------
to have that particular thing


---------00:52----------
i've recently pledged to myself to live


---------00:55----------
more and improve


---------00:56----------
doing more and experiencing stuff i


---------00:58----------
haven't experienced before


---------01:00----------
but i still get this absolutely


---------01:01----------
heartbreaking feeling that others are


---------01:03----------
somehow enjoying it more than me


---------01:05----------
and i get angry at myself for not


---------01:07----------
enjoying myself or finding satisfaction


---------01:09----------
in things


---------01:10----------
it's a vicious cycle that keeps feeding


---------01:12----------
in on itself and causing


---------01:13----------
causing me to want to give up even


---------01:15----------
trying


---------01:16----------
i think if i was somehow able to find


---------01:18----------
the real satisfaction in things


---------01:20----------
i do i'd be less likely to feel dwarfed


---------01:22----------
by other people's experiences


---------01:26----------
oh man i feel like each of these could


---------01:29----------
be an hour-long lecture chat


---------01:31----------
the fear of missing out is a really


---------01:33----------
interesting


---------01:34----------
challenge and i think once again it's


---------01:36----------
like an umbrella term that may have


---------01:38----------
multiple


---------01:39----------
roots to it okay the first thing that


---------01:42----------
i'm going to share with you guys


---------01:44----------
so is actually from yoga so it's a


---------01:46----------
really interesting


---------01:47----------
passage from i forget which upanishad


---------01:51----------
made maybe the taitreya upanishad


---------01:53----------
that talks about proximal emotions and


---------01:57----------
distal emotions


---------01:58----------
so what the yogis realized is that


---------02:00----------
there's a set of emotions that we


---------02:03----------
feel that are like


---------02:06----------
more acceptable that actually have like


---------02:09----------
underlying


---------02:10----------
more toxic emotions underneath


---------02:14----------
so like envy can actually be like the


---------02:17----------
proximal emotion


---------02:18----------
it's like oh like i feel happy for


---------02:21----------
someone


---------02:22----------
i wish i was like that and underneath


---------02:24----------
that can actually be like


---------02:26----------
anger or hatred so it's kind of really


---------02:29----------
interesting because i'm not surprised


---------02:31----------
that we see


---------02:32----------
if you guys paid attention to the case


---------02:34----------
right like the further down we go


---------02:36----------
the more we get to like hatred so


---------02:39----------
interestingly enough


---------02:40----------
when you're dealing with these proximal


---------02:42----------
emotions and distal emotions like the


---------02:43----------
acceptable emotion which is like envy


---------02:45----------
like it's okay to be envious of someone


---------02:47----------
right like i wish i had that


---------02:49----------
it's less okay to be like i hate that


---------02:51----------
person for having that


---------02:53----------
and so the interesting thing is that you


---------02:55----------
know a lot of this


---------02:57----------
could come from dealing with your hatred


---------03:01----------
so like do you hate those people


---------03:03----------
like do you hate people who have more


---------03:04----------
than you what is it like that


---------03:06----------
other people have had more than you and


---------03:08----------
you have not


---------03:10----------
so i would ask this person if you have


---------03:11----------
fomo and you kind of feel envious of


---------03:13----------
other people


---------03:14----------
ask yourself like step one underneath


---------03:17----------
the envy is their hatred


---------03:20----------
and like how do you because a lot of


---------03:21----------
times like we don't want to hate our


---------03:22----------
friends right like it's very


---------03:24----------
conflicting internally it's very


---------03:27----------
distinct


---------03:29----------
so we don't let ourselves feel that and


---------03:31----------
since we don't let ourselves feel that


---------03:33----------
it never goes away it just stays there


---------03:35----------
it lingers


---------03:36----------
it's the trash can that's rotting in the


---------03:38----------
corner that you never let yourself look


---------03:40----------
at


---------03:40----------
because you never explore it and so it


---------03:42----------
kind of like fuels this stuff


---------03:44----------
that's number one okay so explore for


---------03:47----------
hatred underneath


---------03:48----------
the second thing is to start to think a


---------03:50----------
little bit about like when did you miss


---------03:52----------
out


---------03:53----------
right so now we're gonna take the


---------03:54----------
sumscar approach so like i


---------03:56----------
if i was talking to this person in an


---------03:58----------
interview what i would kind of ask them


---------03:59----------
is like


---------04:00----------
when did you start missing out in life


---------04:03----------
what does it kind of feel like to miss


---------04:05----------
out like have there been times in your


---------04:07----------
life where like


---------04:08----------
you know there was someone who like got


---------04:10----------
something that you didn't have


---------04:13----------
and like there was like the person who


---------04:15----------
was happy and then there was like you


---------04:17----------
who was like neglected and you really


---------04:19----------
wanted to be that person


---------04:20----------
and explore that stuff that's how you


---------04:22----------
may find the root of it


---------04:23----------
okay so to ask yourself when did you


---------04:26----------
start missing out


---------04:27----------
when was the first time that you felt


---------04:28----------
fomo really really powerfully


---------04:30----------
and forget about social media because


---------04:32----------
chances are it has


---------04:33----------
like it may be something for your


---------04:35----------
personal life maybe something when you


---------04:36----------
were young


---------04:37----------
like your parents took your sibling on a


---------04:39----------
trip and they left you behind like


---------04:41----------
something like that okay


---------04:44----------
the third thing is that social media


---------04:47----------
makes fomo worse


---------04:49----------
right so like social media creates a


---------04:51----------
system for our brain


---------04:52----------
that is busted so if i have 30


---------04:56----------
friends on facebook the stuff that


---------04:59----------
facebook is going to populate my feed


---------05:01----------
with is the stuff that gets the most


---------05:02----------
likes


---------05:03----------
so person number one has a birthday


---------05:07----------
bunch of likes bunch of comments i see


---------05:09----------
that person number two the next day goes


---------05:11----------
on vacation


---------05:12----------
person number three has a baby person


---------05:15----------
number four graduates from college


---------05:18----------
person number five wins an award person


---------05:20----------
number six gets engaged


---------05:22----------
person number seven gets an uh promotion


---------05:25----------
person number eight


---------05:26----------
goes has a big surprise party that their


---------05:30----------
parents throw for them


---------05:31----------
person number 10 gets a gift from their


---------05:33----------
parents gets a brand new car


---------05:36----------
and what happens is our mind sees


---------05:39----------
all of these like high points from 30


---------05:43----------
different people's lives and then what


---------05:45----------
we


---------05:46----------
see appears to be like this glot of a


---------05:49----------
perfect life


---------05:50----------
because our brain doesn't really process


---------05:51----------
that like for every post this person


---------05:53----------
makes


---------05:54----------
that they get a thousand likes they make


---------05:56----------
a thousand posts that get one like


---------05:59----------
what your brain sees is the thousand


---------06:00----------
posts that you make that get one like


---------06:04----------
so this kind of fomo phenomenon is like


---------06:06----------
very clearly tied to social media


---------06:09----------
and like is almost predatory in terms of


---------06:11----------
the way that it like


---------06:14----------
you know enhances this feeling so there


---------06:17----------
is this stuff about you know


---------06:19----------
envy and hatred there's absolutely


---------06:21----------
finding the roots of it and then there's


---------06:22----------
like what propagates the phenomenon of


---------06:25----------
fomo in your life what builds up fomo


---------06:28----------
despite the roots


---------06:29----------
what's the fertilizer we're throwing


---------06:30----------
what's the fuel what's the gasoline


---------06:32----------
that we're pouring on top of the fire


---------06:34----------
the fire's there the fire is there


---------06:36----------
because of deep yogic roots


---------06:37----------
and past experiences in your life and


---------06:39----------
then social medias


---------06:41----------
the gasoline so this is where people say


---------06:44----------
just get off social media


---------06:45----------
which is challenging for any number of


---------06:47----------
reasons but my experience has been that


---------06:49----------
just getting off of social media doesn't


---------06:51----------
fix the problem that's the boomer


---------06:52----------
solution


---------06:54----------
just stop it no like people had fomo and


---------06:56----------
envy and hatred and jealousy far


---------06:58----------
before social media social media making


---------07:00----------
it worse is it aggravating it absolutely


---------07:04----------
right but then there's also like the


---------07:06----------
roots of the problem that you kind of


---------07:07----------
have to get to


---------07:09----------
so what i'd say to this person and if


---------07:10----------
you're kind of thinking about fomo right


---------07:12----------
is that like


---------07:13----------
it's normal to have fomo it's important


---------07:15----------
to understand that social media is going


---------07:17----------
to exacerbate it


---------07:18----------
but really ask yourself what are the


---------07:20----------
underlying emotions that are like


---------07:22----------
driving my feeling of fomo and then the


---------07:25----------
fourth thing that they said which i


---------07:26----------
think makes perfect sense


---------07:28----------
is um if i'm able to somehow find real


---------07:31----------
satisfaction in things i do i'd be less


---------07:33----------
likely to feel dwarfed by other people's


---------07:35----------
experiences


---------07:36----------
that person's precisely correct but it's


---------07:38----------
the other way around


---------07:40----------
you will never find real satisfaction in


---------07:42----------
things as long as you


---------07:44----------
are comparing based on other people


---------07:47----------
the way to find real satisfaction in


---------07:49----------
things is to let go of comparison


---------07:52----------
and so as long as your mind looks at


---------07:54----------
someone else and says this person is


---------07:56----------
better or worse than


---------07:58----------
mine me you will never find satisfaction


---------08:00----------
or happiness


---------08:02----------
and this is the really tricky thing so


---------08:04----------
the last thing if you the secret to fomo


---------08:06----------
okay if you want to really unplug fomo


---------08:08----------
there's one tiny psychological life hack


---------08:11----------
as much as i detest the term


---------08:13----------
that you can use that will actually


---------08:16----------
disarm fomo


---------08:17----------
and that is you feeling superior to


---------08:20----------
other people in particular situations


---------08:24----------
so as long as you let yourself feel


---------08:26----------
superior to others


---------08:28----------
the reverse of that will happen to you


---------08:31----------
you will feel inferior


---------08:33----------
so letting go of your feelings of


---------08:34----------
inferiority start by letting go of your


---------08:37----------
feelings of superiority


---------08:39----------
i was working with a professional player


---------08:42----------
from a particular region in a particular


---------08:44----------
sport


---------08:46----------
this person is very good was very high


---------08:49----------
up


---------08:50----------
in their region and traveled and would


---------08:53----------
boot camp in a different region that is


---------08:55----------
known to be a quote-unquote stronger


---------08:57----------
region


---------08:58----------
and he would find himself in pub games


---------09:01----------
with other people


---------09:03----------
who were like the top players for that


---------09:05----------
region and he felt


---------09:07----------
like his words literally dog


---------09:10----------
playing with them


---------09:11----------
any mistake he made he would feel like


---------09:13----------
oh my god like these


---------09:16----------
epic players that i've looked up to my


---------09:18----------
entire life must


---------09:19----------
think that i am dog he would think


---------09:22----------
that and he would ask me like how do i


---------09:24----------
let go of this like i just can't play


---------09:25----------
with these people


---------09:26----------
it's really messing up my mental so the


---------09:29----------
solution was when you play


---------09:31----------
in your region how do you feel


---------09:34----------
about the people in the games that


---------09:35----------
you're with and he's like they're dog



---------09:38----------
and i told them as long as you treat


---------09:40----------
them like dog


---------09:42----------
you will be treated like you will think


---------09:44----------
that you are dog because that's the


---------09:45----------
construction


---------09:46----------
that's the play that your mind enacts


---------09:49----------
and as long as you're feeling superior


---------09:51----------
it's just the flip side of the coin


---------09:53----------
and so it's interesting because he's


---------09:54----------
gotten a lot better


---------09:57----------
right like he's like oh like the less


---------09:59----------
judgmental he's become the less superior


---------10:02----------
he feels


---------10:03----------
right towards those people like actually


---------10:06----------
like he has gotten way better


---------10:08----------
and his performance is actually


---------10:10----------
objectively improved and


---------10:12----------
and he has been placing higher in


---------10:14----------
international events


---------10:16----------
so the last thing about fomo is if you


---------10:18----------
feel inferior to other people


---------10:20----------
you can also disarm the suit feeling of


---------10:23----------
superiority


---------10:23----------
notice that why do i feel better than


---------10:25----------
this person as you explore that you will


---------10:28----------
actually deflate the inferiority with it


---------10:30----------
it's both it's all ego


---------10:34----------
ahamkara right so the ahamkara so we'll


---------10:37----------
just summarize with like sanskrit baby


---------10:39----------
it goes back to the yoga


---------10:41----------
the ahamkada is the eye feeling it


---------10:44----------
compares


---------10:44----------
as long as the hum god is active you're


---------10:46----------
going to be making comparisons


---------10:48----------
the sense of identity the me the i'm a


---------10:51----------
doctor i went to harvard


---------10:53----------
in my mind every time i say i went to


---------10:55----------
harvard my mind is drawing a comparison


---------10:57----------
to everyone who did it


---------10:58----------
it makes me feel a little bit superior


---------11:00----------
so i have to notice that


---------11:02----------
each and every time and as long as i


---------11:05----------
notice that and i say actually you're


---------11:07----------
not better than anyone else


---------11:08----------
like just rng baby you just lucked out


---------11:11----------
like literally it was rng right


---------11:14----------
and so as long as you're feeling


---------11:16----------
superior to other people you're gonna be


---------11:17----------
feeling inferior somewhere else it's


---------11:19----------
it's because equality is equality man


---------11:21----------
like you can't


---------11:23----------
if you're not equal you're not equal and


---------11:25----------
that's gonna come with superiority and


---------11:27----------
inferiority


---------11:28----------
how to not feel guilty about your


---------11:29----------
successful rng like it's rng dude


---------11:32----------
just appreciate it just right so


---------11:35----------
it's it can be challenging that's


---------11:36----------
another thing so


---------11:38----------
when you say how to not feel guilty


---------11:40----------
about your successful rng it's not about


---------11:42----------
the rng it's about the feeling of guilt


---------11:43----------
so the question is like


---------11:44----------
why does your mind find something to


---------11:47----------
feel guilty about


---------11:49----------
just can't chill that's what you need to


---------11:51----------
work on forget about the rng you can


---------11:53----------
this is the problem is that a lot of


---------11:54----------
people look at the


---------11:55----------
object that their mind looks at instead


---------11:58----------
of the


---------11:59----------
way that their mind looks at it like a


---------12:00----------
case of the what ifs


---------12:02----------
right like a case of the shooter woulda


---------12:03----------
cut us i should have done this i could


---------12:05----------
have done this i would have done this


---------12:06----------
your mind is always thinking like oh i


---------12:07----------
should have done this i should have done


---------12:09----------
this i should have done this


---------12:10----------
why is your mind producing the should


---------12:11----------
thoughts to begin with that's what you


---------12:12----------
need to focus on


---------12:14----------
you should focus on why your mind is


---------12:16----------
focusing on


---------12:18----------
yeah i love this quote from billy fanboy


---------12:20----------
there's nothing from


---------12:21----------
ernest hemingway there's nothing noble


---------12:22----------
in being superior to your fellow man


---------12:24----------
truman nobility is being superior to


---------12:26----------
your former self


---------12:27----------
beautiful
