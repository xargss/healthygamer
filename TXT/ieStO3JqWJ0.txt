---------00:00----------
why are so many americans quitting their


---------00:01----------
jobs i don't know if this is an america


---------00:03----------
thing by the way if it is sorry


---------00:05----------
europeans and other east asians


---------00:07----------
southeast asians other people south


---------00:09----------
americans


---------00:10----------
um


---------00:11----------
i don't know that we have a huge


---------00:13----------
you know


---------00:14----------
following in africa but people outside


---------00:16----------
of america let's say


---------00:18----------
so there are a bunch of people who are


---------00:20----------
quitting their jobs and the anti-work


---------00:22----------
subreddit is one of the fastest growing


---------00:24----------
subreddits uh


---------00:26----------
right here


---------00:29----------
on reddit and so i wanted to talk a


---------00:32----------
little bit about why so many people seem


---------00:34----------
to be quitting their jobs


---------00:36----------
and kind of what's going on there


---------00:39----------
so to try to understand from a science


---------00:41----------
when i say scientific perspective i mean


---------00:43----------
sort of like a theoretical scientific


---------00:44----------
perspective what can we understand from


---------00:46----------
things like the theory of evolution what


---------00:48----------
can we understand about


---------00:50----------
um


---------00:51----------
large-scale psychological trends and


---------00:54----------
what can we understand about


---------00:56----------
psychology that propagates this kind of


---------00:59----------
thing


---------01:00----------
uh that makes it actually worse and so


---------01:02----------
we're just gonna sort of comment on it


---------01:04----------
it's gonna be kind of like


---------01:06----------
just dr k's thoughts about this thing


---------01:08----------
okay


---------01:09----------
so the first thing that i want to say is


---------01:11----------
that like i mentioned earlier this is


---------01:12----------
not something that i'm an expert in it's


---------01:14----------
not something that i'm going to be


---------01:16----------
citing sources or things like that


---------01:18----------
citing literature it's just sort of like


---------01:20----------
my take on


---------01:21----------
why people are quitting so much okay


---------01:25----------
so the first thing is that there seems


---------01:26----------
to be an unprecedented amount of people


---------01:29----------
quitting their jobs and doing so in a


---------01:31----------
spectacular and social media


---------01:34----------
karma farming sort of way right so


---------01:36----------
people will post


---------01:38----------
onto anti-work about oh like my my boss


---------01:41----------
told me to like work come in on saturday


---------01:42----------
and cancelled my vacation and cancelled


---------01:44----------
christmas so i said screw you and i quit


---------01:47----------
and so they post it on on the internet


---------01:50----------
it gets a bunch of karma and then people


---------01:52----------
post about it again and again and again


---------01:53----------
and again


---------01:55----------
and so what i i thought i'd talk a


---------01:57----------
little bit about like why this is


---------01:58----------
happening now like what forces led up to


---------02:00----------
this


---------02:01----------
and sort of understanding the psychology


---------02:03----------
behind it


---------02:04----------
so the first is that i think that the


---------02:06----------
internet has become one of the great


---------02:08----------
equalizers so generally speaking what


---------02:11----------
causes things to change


---------02:13----------
are when there are major humanity


---------02:16----------
human creations that will tend to level


---------02:18----------
the playing field


---------02:20----------
between like unequal


---------02:22----------
groups of people


---------02:23----------
and generally speaking i think the


---------02:25----------
internet is like the third biggest thing


---------02:28----------
that has been discovered so the two that


---------02:30----------
i'd say come before this for the first


---------02:32----------
is the printing press right so when when


---------02:35----------
reading and information became more


---------02:37----------
widely available we started to see a


---------02:39----------
drastic change within society


---------02:42----------
the second big thing that seemed to


---------02:44----------
equalize a lot of stuff was the


---------02:46----------
invention of gunpowder so if you look at


---------02:48----------
things like the american revolution in


---------02:49----------
like feudal societies


---------02:51----------
you know in the past what it used to be


---------02:53----------
that if you were stronger and had a


---------02:55----------
sword like you would you could kill


---------02:57----------
other people and so there was like a big


---------03:00----------
disparity in terms of power and like


---------03:02----------
physical strength


---------03:03----------
over time what seemed to happen is with


---------03:05----------
the invention of like gunpowder in the


---------03:06----------
pistol


---------03:07----------
you have people that are able to exert a


---------03:09----------
lot more power against like people who


---------03:12----------
are traditionally more powerful so you


---------03:14----------
have things like the american revolution


---------03:15----------
and and stuff like that but i think guns


---------03:17----------
have been another huge equalizer


---------03:19----------
and i think the third great equalizer


---------03:21----------
and there may be many more before this


---------03:22----------
i'm not a historian


---------03:24----------
but i'd say that the internet is a huge


---------03:26----------
equalizer and people have


---------03:28----------
um


---------03:30----------
i think not really understood the impact


---------03:33----------
of what the dissemination of information


---------03:35----------
has truly had on our society so 50 years


---------03:39----------
ago if you lived in a small town and you


---------03:41----------
had some crappy job like that was it


---------03:44----------
right like you're you looked around at


---------03:45----------
your options and you were not aware of


---------03:48----------
like what your other options were you


---------03:49----------
were vaguely aware that other jobs


---------03:51----------
existed elsewhere


---------03:53----------
but your ability to compare yourself to


---------03:55----------
other people and to understand what else


---------03:57----------
was out there was like quite quite


---------03:59----------
narrow


---------04:00----------
and we talk about some of the evils of


---------04:02----------
social media and information


---------04:04----------
dissemination fomo and things like that


---------04:06----------
on on this channel


---------04:08----------
you know we talk about


---------04:10----------
overly comparing and the the weaknesses


---------04:13----------
of overly comparing we talk about social


---------04:15----------
media and the dangers of social media in


---------04:16----------
terms of making people feel like they're


---------04:18----------
left out and things like that but i


---------04:20----------
think one of the things that it's


---------04:21----------
important to remember is that social


---------04:23----------
media just like video games are tools


---------04:25----------
and that tools can be used for good or


---------04:27----------
for ill


---------04:28----------
and so one of the things that started to


---------04:30----------
happen with the advent of the internet


---------04:31----------
is people have started to realize that


---------04:33----------
there's like better things out there


---------04:35----------
right so there's like a greater


---------04:37----------
awareness in general


---------04:38----------
that the world doesn't have to be as


---------04:40----------
crappy as your situation is


---------04:43----------
and i think this acknowledgment that


---------04:45----------
there are better options out there has


---------04:47----------
been absolutely devastating for certain


---------04:50----------
employers


---------04:51----------
so this is also where i'm gonna kind of


---------04:54----------
jump ahead here for a second but if we


---------04:56----------
look at why things have gotten so bad i


---------04:58----------
would say in short


---------05:00----------
employers have had no negative selection


---------05:03----------
pressure against poor practices


---------05:05----------
so if i'm you know if i own let's say a


---------05:08----------
major serial manufacturing company and


---------05:11----------
people are unhappy i haven't really had


---------05:14----------
any need to make my employees happy


---------05:17----------
right i've been able to say because


---------05:19----------
there hasn't been a selection pressure


---------05:21----------
or consequence you guys can go screw


---------05:23----------
yourselves right so i've been able to


---------05:25----------
say that thus far and so we've had


---------05:27----------
things like the creation of unions which


---------05:29----------
have been designed to balance corporate


---------05:31----------
power and all that stuff is fantastic


---------05:32----------
i'm not going to go down that road but i


---------05:34----------
think there's another huge balancing


---------05:37----------
issue here which is like the internet


---------05:39----------
because now we're beginning to see


---------05:42----------
huge movements towards equality so you


---------05:45----------
see these things like the arab spring


---------05:46----------
you see these things where people are


---------05:48----------
now aware


---------05:49----------
that other options exist right


---------05:53----------
so the first thing that's happened is


---------05:54----------
that that the internet has sort of


---------05:56----------
started to equalize the playing field in


---------05:58----------
terms of removing ignorance


---------06:01----------
um and so this is another thing that


---------06:03----------
corporations have benefited a lot from


---------06:04----------
it which is like you know praying


---------06:06----------
essentially on ignorance so like if my


---------06:08----------
workers don't know what else is out


---------06:10----------
there


---------06:11----------
i can give them crappy things so in


---------06:14----------
general like i think for example the


---------06:15----------
quality of food is thankfully in


---------06:18----------
restaurants like generally speaking


---------06:19----------
improved over the course of my life and


---------06:22----------
why is that it's because now i have so


---------06:24----------
much access to information about where i


---------06:27----------
can get food and where there is good


---------06:28----------
food and where there is bad food as a


---------06:30----------
result there were a lot of crappy


---------06:32----------
restaurants that you know existed when i


---------06:34----------
grew up that like i didn't realize that


---------06:36----------
i could drive 10 minutes away or further


---------06:39----------
and like find a really good restaurant


---------06:41----------
that was amazing it was all like word of


---------06:42----------
mouth but with the advent of internet


---------06:45----------
sharing information i've been able to


---------06:46----------
find good restaurants


---------06:48----------
as restaurants


---------06:50----------
as we sort of discover there are better


---------06:52----------
restaurants and worse restaurants like


---------06:53----------
better companies and worse companies


---------06:55----------
people have started gravitating towards


---------06:57----------
the better companies and moving away


---------06:58----------
from the worst companies so i think a


---------07:00----------
lot of corporations have continued to


---------07:02----------
exist very profitably


---------07:04----------
basically preying on the ignorance of


---------07:06----------
their employees and their employees not


---------07:08----------
realizing what else is out there


---------07:11----------
so there are a couple of other things


---------07:12----------
that have happened recently and i think


---------07:14----------
the biggest one is covid so i think


---------07:16----------
covet has been a great example of the


---------07:18----------
blindfold coming off


---------07:20----------
so for a long time companies have sort


---------07:22----------
of assumed or believed or taught their


---------07:25----------
employees to believe


---------07:27----------
that particular things were true the


---------07:30----------
first is that you have to be at the


---------07:31----------
office to work right and so what


---------07:33----------
companies would do is like there was


---------07:34----------
there's so much crap


---------07:36----------
that people had to put up with like


---------07:38----------
commuting is the top of the list right


---------07:39----------
where like you had to commute like a


---------07:41----------
commute was a given so when looking at a


---------07:43----------
job i even remember when when i got my


---------07:46----------
first place in boston or not just first


---------07:48----------
place every single place i had in boston


---------07:51----------
one of the main considerations i had


---------07:52----------
when i was like renting an apartment was


---------07:55----------
what does my commute look like what does


---------07:57----------
the commute look like what does the


---------07:58----------
commute look like what does the commute


---------07:59----------
look like because people were spending


---------08:01----------
half an hour or up to an hour i mean


---------08:04----------
depending on where you live and what


---------08:05----------
your situation is or five minutes if


---------08:06----------
you're super lucky


---------08:08----------
you know people would spend at anywhere


---------08:10----------
from five minutes to two hours of their


---------08:12----------
life per day


---------08:14----------
commuting to and from work


---------08:17----------
and so the the what's happened with


---------08:19----------
covet is we sort of started to realize


---------08:21----------
oh you actually don't need to commute to


---------08:23----------
work like you don't actually have to be


---------08:24----------
in the office and this was a huge like


---------08:27----------
revelation for a lot of people right so


---------08:29----------
the other thing that corporations tended


---------08:30----------
to take advantage of was almost like


---------08:33----------
geographical


---------08:35----------
predation


---------08:36----------
where like you know in the past


---------08:39----------
your job


---------08:41----------
um options were restricted by your


---------08:43----------
geography so if i live in like beaumont


---------08:46----------
texas or if i live in like some small


---------08:48----------
town in alabama or you know if i live in


---------08:51----------
some small town in india my only options


---------08:55----------
for work were like what was like


---------08:56----------
available around me and so with the


---------08:58----------
advent of the internet and especially


---------09:00----------
with covid and work from home you're no


---------09:02----------
longer geographically restricted so


---------09:04----------
there used to be some companies that


---------09:06----------
like i don't know if you guys have ever


---------09:07----------
heard of a company town where there's


---------09:09----------
like one major employer and most of the


---------09:11----------
people work for that employer and people


---------09:13----------
don't have a lot of


---------09:14----------
choice they don't have the a lot of


---------09:16----------
ability to like laterally move or or go


---------09:19----------
to other companies


---------09:20----------
and with the advent of covid and


---------09:22----------
everything moving online suddenly now


---------09:25----------
corporations are no longer able to


---------09:27----------
engage in like essentially geographical


---------09:29----------
predation right so like now if i don't


---------09:31----------
like the job that i have in in you know


---------09:34----------
mobile alabama i can go and apply for a


---------09:37----------
job in canada right so i can actually


---------09:39----------
like work in a different country i can


---------09:41----------
work in a different part of the state


---------09:43----------
this is something that corporations have


---------09:44----------
loved doing for a long time until it


---------09:46----------
starts to hurt them which is like when


---------09:48----------
there was all this concern about you


---------09:50----------
know shipping jobs overseas or


---------09:52----------
outsourcing to places like india and


---------09:54----------
china and companies have been thrilled


---------09:56----------
to do that thus far we've like moved


---------09:57----------
manufacturing over to china we've moved


---------09:59----------
manufacturing over to india and people


---------10:01----------
have lost their jobs here and like like


---------10:03----------
corporations have been like great like i


---------10:04----------
can move elsewhere i don't actually have


---------10:06----------
to employ the people here and now what's


---------10:09----------
happening is the reverse right so where


---------10:10----------
employees are starting to realize i


---------10:12----------
actually don't have to work for this


---------10:13----------
crap job with you i can actually work


---------10:14----------
remotely at this place that's somewhere


---------10:16----------
else and so like this has been a huge


---------10:20----------
thing that that covet has sort of


---------10:21----------
unveiled and i think companies are now


---------10:23----------
reeling from it


---------10:25----------
next thing that that kovit has revealed


---------10:27----------
to people is what they need to survive


---------10:30----------
so there used to be a huge like idea


---------10:33----------
about what it was what was required for


---------10:35----------
like survival success and happiness in


---------10:37----------
life right this is the idea of the grind


---------10:39----------
people are like grinding left and right


---------10:41----------
and it's like i'm gonna grind i'm gonna


---------10:43----------
work hard i'm gonna become successful


---------10:45----------
i'm gonna make more money and then i can


---------10:46----------
retire at the age of 65. i'm gonna


---------10:48----------
commute two day two hours of my life


---------10:51----------
every day to work nine hours a day so


---------10:53----------
it's going to be an 11 hour commitment


---------10:55----------
per day i'm gonna sleep for eight hours


---------10:57----------
which gives me like two hours a day of


---------10:59----------
of recreation or whatever i'm going to


---------11:01----------
do this for about 40 years and i'm going


---------11:03----------
to retire and i'm going to buy a


---------11:05----------
condo somewhere where it's warm and


---------11:07----------
where there's a beach and i'm going to


---------11:08----------
enjoy the rest of my life and this was


---------11:10----------
accepted this was just sort of like what


---------11:12----------
you know people used to be okay with


---------11:15----------
and and there's sort of this like idea


---------11:17----------
that you know the harder you work the


---------11:18----------
more successful you're gonna be


---------11:20----------
and then essentially what the


---------11:22----------
corporations did is took all the


---------11:23----------
hard-working people and like predated


---------11:25----------
them to extinction


---------11:26----------
and so they they essentially like you


---------11:28----------
know there's this idea that you have to


---------11:30----------
grind really hard and then you'll be


---------11:31----------
happy at the end


---------11:32----------
and what tends to happen instead like


---------11:34----------
during covet is people started to


---------11:35----------
realize like what is the value of money


---------11:37----------
what is the value of my time what do i


---------11:39----------
actually need to survive and what i


---------11:41----------
think what people really discovered is


---------11:43----------
that they don't need money nearly as


---------11:45----------
much as they thought they did and that


---------11:47----------
an extra five thousand dollars a year or


---------11:49----------
ten thousand dollars a year is not worth


---------11:51----------
an extra 15 hours a week


---------11:53----------
and so as as blindfol as covet has taken


---------11:56----------
the blindfold off a lot of people have


---------11:58----------
started to re-question their priorities


---------11:59----------
and what they're willing to sacrifice


---------12:02----------
so just kind of stepping into


---------12:03----------
evolutionary theory for a second


---------12:06----------
so i think that basically like covet has


---------12:07----------
put a selection pressure on jobs


---------12:10----------
right so this is where like before


---------12:13----------
these behaviors and practices by


---------12:15----------
companies went on unchecked because


---------12:18----------
there was no consequence in the


---------12:20----------
environment


---------12:21----------
so you know the theory of evolution says


---------12:24----------
survival of the fittest and since


---------12:26----------
companies were able to get away with


---------12:28----------
that sort of thing they did get away


---------12:30----------
with it because there was no consequence


---------12:31----------
for them and now what i think


---------12:33----------
corporations are really discovering is


---------12:34----------
that there is actually a selection


---------12:36----------
pressure which is what's happening right


---------12:38----------
so workers on mass are deciding to


---------12:40----------
select for


---------12:42----------
a particular kind of job and select


---------12:44----------
against another kind of job


---------12:46----------
and this is where a lot of people are


---------12:47----------
starting to get really upset and they're


---------12:49----------
saying there's a labor shortage there is


---------12:51----------
not a labor shortage there is a wage


---------12:53----------
shortage right the labor is there it's


---------12:55----------
just it doesn't want to work your crappy


---------12:57----------
job which you've been able to propagate


---------12:59----------
for a long time and haven't had to keep


---------13:01----------
up to snuff


---------13:03----------
because like there's been no selection


---------13:05----------
pressure against it right


---------13:06----------
so these companies have become like


---------13:08----------
bloated profit driven and i'm not like a


---------13:10----------
leftist by the way just you know i'm


---------13:12----------
just saying that if there's no like


---------13:14----------
selection pressure against something


---------13:16----------
it's gonna become bloated and like


---------13:18----------
overblown and like you know the wealth


---------13:20----------
inequality is increasing and people are


---------13:22----------
just not going to put up with it anymore


---------13:24----------
and so what we're sort of seeing there's


---------13:26----------
some really sort of simple evidence i'm


---------13:27----------
going to draw a very big correlation


---------13:29----------
here


---------13:31----------
but that basically if you want to like


---------13:32----------
play a game with someone you have to win


---------13:34----------
let them win at least 30 of the time so


---------13:37----------
if you look at like play behavior


---------13:38----------
amongst animals and even if you think


---------13:40----------
about like your kids for example like


---------13:42----------
you've got to let them win some of the


---------13:44----------
time right it's like a 30-70 swing if


---------13:46----------
they lose more than 70 percent of the


---------13:49----------
time they're going to stop playing if


---------13:50----------
they win 70 of the time they're gonna


---------13:52----------
more significantly more than 70 percent


---------13:54----------
of the time they're going to stop


---------13:55----------
playing so you even think about the way


---------13:57----------
that video games are designed video


---------13:58----------
games are not designed to be like 100


---------14:01----------
victory all the time right they sort of


---------14:02----------
are but they give you like false starts


---------14:04----------
you have to wipe on a boss multiple


---------14:06----------
times before you down it


---------14:08----------
and so what's been happening for far too


---------14:10----------
long is that like companies have been


---------14:11----------
racking up w's without taking l's and


---------14:14----------
now like their karmic seed is coming to


---------14:16----------
fruition where people just aren't


---------14:17----------
willing to put up for with it anymore


---------14:20----------
and so like now what's happening is


---------14:22----------
they've created these systems that have


---------14:24----------
become essentially bloated and


---------14:25----------
vulnerable to this kind of of you know


---------14:29----------
like like essentially like workers


---------14:31----------
hitting back right and i know this is


---------14:33----------
starting to sound like the communist


---------14:35----------
manifesto but i mean it's really more


---------14:37----------
about psychology and evolutionary theory


---------14:38----------
i'm not propagating i'm not suggesting


---------14:40----------
one is good or one is bad it's just this


---------14:42----------
is what's happened there have been too


---------14:44----------
many unchecked corporate excesses and


---------14:46----------
like people are just tired of it now


---------14:49----------
so there's another huge um thing that's


---------14:51----------
starting to change a little bit which i


---------14:53----------
i think i've worked with a lot of uh you


---------14:56----------
know startups i've worked with a lot of


---------14:57----------
ceos i've worked with a lot of


---------14:58----------
investment banks and i've started to see


---------15:00----------
some interesting changes in those places


---------15:03----------
so the first example that i'll give


---------15:05----------
y'all


---------15:06----------
is that investment working at an


---------15:08----------
investment bank like goldman sachs or


---------15:09----------
like jp morgan or whatever used to be a


---------15:12----------
very coveted job


---------15:14----------
and now what's what tends to happen is


---------15:16----------
people want to do their two years at a


---------15:18----------
place like goldman and they want a gtfo


---------15:20----------
as quickly as possible so this is kind


---------15:22----------
of interesting because even this is not


---------15:24----------
just something that's happening at the


---------15:25----------
bottom tier of like wage right this is


---------15:27----------
even happening very high up you see this


---------15:29----------
a lot in medicine you see it a lot in


---------15:31----------
residency where people are starting to


---------15:32----------
like you know decide like i'm not going


---------15:34----------
to become a doctor if i can become a


---------15:35----------
nurse practitioner because i can make


---------15:37----------
way more i can make sure i'll make less


---------15:40----------
money but the amount of time that i have


---------15:42----------
to sacrifice to become a doctor is no


---------15:44----------
longer worth it so i'm gonna go the np


---------15:46----------
route so we're seeing this at so many


---------15:48----------
different levels of work i absolutely


---------15:50----------
see it in investment banking


---------15:52----------
where i had a very prominent client who


---------15:55----------
was struggling with turnover


---------15:57----------
and so you know what they sort of had


---------15:58----------
this attitude that it's like you know


---------16:00----------
you work hard and like you invest you


---------16:02----------
you pay your dues


---------16:04----------
and then once you rise to the top that's


---------16:05----------
when you get to relax


---------16:07----------
and they sort of didn't understand that


---------16:09----------
like people are just not having that


---------16:10----------
anymore right like they're not willing


---------16:12----------
to


---------16:13----------
you know work their asses off for 20


---------16:16----------
years so that they can start flying


---------16:17----------
first class at the age of 46. people are


---------16:20----------
just not willing to make that trade so


---------16:22----------
in investment banking which you're


---------16:24----------
seeing is a massive exodus


---------16:26----------
from banking to easier fields so people


---------16:29----------
will go be cfo they'll go join vc


---------16:32----------
they'll go join private equity


---------16:34----------
things aren't really that much better in


---------16:36----------
in those fields as well but they tend to


---------16:37----------
be better


---------16:38----------
so what we're seeing even at higher


---------16:40----------
levels of education is like


---------16:42----------
um


---------16:43----------
you know much more turnover and like


---------16:45----------
selection pressures away from money so


---------16:48----------
another good example of this is like


---------16:49----------
i've worked with a lot of people who are


---------16:51----------
engineers at google and they actually


---------16:53----------
really love google so google's a good


---------16:54----------
example of someone who seems to be doing


---------16:56----------
this right so google in some ways


---------16:58----------
actually may pay less than


---------17:00----------
what someone is able to make somewhere


---------17:03----------
else but basically every person i've


---------17:05----------
ever worked with at google


---------17:07----------
loves working there and why do they love


---------17:09----------
working there even though they may get


---------17:11----------
paid five thousand dollars less it's


---------17:13----------
because google like sort of takes care


---------17:14----------
of them so they have a cafeteria that's


---------17:16----------
open for like 18 hours a day you can


---------17:19----------
come in and work when you want to where


---------17:21----------
you want to you don't have to come into


---------17:22----------
the office if you don't want to you can


---------17:24----------
work from like 10 p.m to like 6 a.m so


---------17:27----------
i've had people who work at google who


---------17:28----------
like will basically try to show up there


---------17:30----------
for dinner before the cafeteria closes


---------17:32----------
because the food is good


---------17:33----------
they work all night google keeps them


---------17:35----------
supplied with like energy drinks or


---------17:37----------
whatever other unhealthy crap they want


---------17:39----------
and then they have breakfast in the


---------17:40----------
morning they go home they game for a few


---------17:42----------
hours and they pass out


---------17:44----------
right so like some employers are


---------17:46----------
recognizing what people actually want


---------17:48----------
and some employers aren't


---------17:51----------
and the employers that are starting to


---------17:52----------
recognize that oh like turnover you know


---------17:55----------
this is turnover is happening because


---------17:57----------
people don't like working here and


---------17:59----------
throwing money at the problem which many


---------18:00----------
of them are not even doing


---------18:02----------
throwing money at the problem is not


---------18:04----------
actually a perfect solution


---------18:06----------
so what we're starting to see i'm seeing


---------18:08----------
this a lot more in terms of like


---------18:10----------
startups and and like young people that


---------18:11----------
i advise and people that i work with is


---------18:13----------
that even people who are in finance like


---------18:15----------
they don't want to just like


---------18:17----------
be doing gigantic murders mergers and


---------18:20----------
acquisitions for gigantic piles of money


---------18:22----------
that their the partner at their firm


---------18:24----------
sees which they see a tiny little slice


---------18:26----------
of they want to start doing work that is


---------18:28----------
meaningful and impactful and like they


---------18:29----------
can actually be proud of what they do


---------18:32----------
and so the the pressures on businesses


---------18:34----------
are changing and businesses aren't


---------18:35----------
keeping up


---------18:37----------
so this is the third thing that i'm


---------18:38----------
going to talk about and here's the real


---------18:39----------
psychological mistake that most


---------18:42----------
employers are making


---------18:44----------
so i'm going to ask you all a question


---------18:45----------
so when there's a kid who acts out and


---------18:48----------
has behavioral problems in school


---------18:51----------
and you punish the kid and you tell them


---------18:53----------
hey you're a bad kid bad kid what


---------18:56----------
happens to that kid does the kid act out


---------18:58----------
worse or do they get better when you


---------19:00----------
punish them and you say you're a dumb


---------19:02----------
kid you're a stupid kid you're a bad


---------19:03----------
behaved kid


---------19:06----------
it gets worse so what do you think is


---------19:08----------
happening when corporations are saying


---------19:10----------
oh these workers like kids nowadays are


---------19:12----------
so lazy


---------19:14----------
they're so lazy there's a labor shortage


---------19:16----------
people just don't want to work they just


---------19:18----------
want to get their federal hand out they


---------19:20----------
want to sit at home because they're lazy


---------19:23----------
they're lazy they're so lazy oh my


---------19:26----------
goodness


---------19:28----------
and this is this is their karmic seed


---------19:30----------
coming to fruition right this is their


---------19:33----------
chicken coming to hatch or rooster


---------19:34----------
coming to hatch or whatever


---------19:36----------
right so this is where the biggest


---------19:38----------
mistake that corporations have made is


---------19:40----------
that they have grossly invalidated the


---------19:42----------
experience of their workers


---------19:44----------
so i'll give you guys a prime example of


---------19:46----------
this and that is the field of pr so when


---------19:49----------
a company has a problem


---------19:51----------
right so let's say like there's let's


---------19:52----------
just say hypothetically that you're a


---------19:54----------
game developer who has you know


---------19:56----------
some kind of doj or department of labor


---------19:59----------
investigation against you for systemic


---------20:01----------
sexual discrimination


---------20:03----------
what do you do


---------20:05----------
you hire a pr firm right so somewhere


---------20:08----------
along the way


---------20:10----------
companies started resorting to pr to fix


---------20:13----------
their problems which is like a


---------20:14----------
fundamental mistake


---------20:15----------
right because it's like you're not


---------20:17----------
actually fixing the problem you're just


---------20:18----------
fixing the perception of the problem


---------20:21----------
and this is a huge problem because at


---------20:23----------
some point companies stopped actually


---------20:25----------
like listening to their employees and


---------20:27----------
what they want and what is hard for them


---------20:30----------
and instead what they started doing is


---------20:31----------
just like


---------20:33----------
focusing on pr


---------20:35----------
there's like a lack of transparency


---------20:36----------
there's a lack of understanding of what


---------20:38----------
people want and essentially it's


---------20:40----------
incredibly invalidating so the there are


---------20:42----------
a lot of companies out there that are


---------20:44----------
psychologically so invalidating to the


---------20:46----------
experiences of their employees


---------20:48----------
that the employees are just done with it


---------20:50----------
like they're going to act out worse and


---------20:51----------
so like a good example of this is i


---------20:53----------
heard recently that you know


---------20:55----------
someone was replacing strike workers and


---------20:58----------
then us trolls on the internet when i


---------20:59----------
say awesome i don't know if i'm really


---------21:01----------
included in this but trolls on the


---------21:03----------
internet decided to spam their their


---------21:06----------
job application website with like fake


---------21:08----------
applications


---------21:10----------
right like i don't think that people


---------21:11----------
realize that like


---------21:13----------
that invalidation of workers experiences


---------21:15----------
is going to lead to catastrophic


---------21:17----------
problems


---------21:18----------
and the reason that they have been able


---------21:20----------
to do this for so long is simply because


---------21:22----------
there hasn't been any selection pressure


---------21:24----------
for it right so you've been able to


---------21:26----------
invalidate the experience of your


---------21:28----------
employees and tell them to go screw


---------21:29----------
themselves for a long time which is


---------21:31----------
exactly why it's continued right there


---------21:33----------
has been no selection pressure against


---------21:35----------
it and now there is a selection pressure


---------21:37----------
against it and so the companies are


---------21:38----------
going to have two choices they can


---------21:40----------
continue to invalidate the experience of


---------21:42----------
their workers and call them lazy and et


---------21:44----------
cetera et cetera et cetera in which case


---------21:45----------
people are going to quit on mass and


---------21:47----------
then your company will close like you'll


---------21:49----------
shut your doors right and then you're


---------21:50----------
going to go thinking oh man like


---------21:52----------
my company shut down because people are


---------21:54----------
lazy now and they didn't used to be lazy


---------21:56----------
it's not my fault it's the world's fault


---------21:58----------
it has nothing to do with me there's


---------21:59----------
nothing i could have done differently


---------22:00----------
it's because workers are lazy now in


---------22:02----------
government handouts


---------22:05----------
i'm going to absolve myself of all


---------22:06----------
responsibility by blaming everyone


---------22:08----------
except for myself it's the government's


---------22:09----------
problem kids are lazy it's video games


---------22:12----------
it's drugs it's have you seen this


---------22:14----------
justin bieber like all of this stuff


---------22:16----------
it's it's no one's fault but my own


---------22:18----------
heaven forbid what are you saying are


---------22:19----------
you saying that i should have actually


---------22:20----------
asked my employees


---------22:22----------
what can i do to get you to stay


---------22:25----------
what


---------22:26----------
that's an absurd question why on earth


---------22:28----------
would i ever ask that


---------22:30----------
are you suggesting that i should ask my


---------22:32----------
employees like what what


---------22:34----------
what would make you happy here what are


---------22:36----------
you looking for how can we help you how


---------22:38----------
can we how can we do a better job as


---------22:41----------
employers


---------22:43----------
that's absurd


---------22:45----------
there's no way i can do better i'm


---------22:46----------
perfect like i thought you guys


---------22:47----------
understood that didn't we understand the


---------22:49----------
boss i make more money than you isn't


---------22:51----------
isn't the amount of money that i make


---------22:53----------
correlated with the amount of perfection


---------22:54----------
that i have and since i make more money


---------22:56----------
than you do i'm more perfect than you


---------22:58----------
are in my opinion matters more than


---------22:59----------
yours i'm the boss


---------23:01----------
i'm the boss i know what's right and i


---------23:03----------
know what's wrong i know what's better


---------23:04----------
for you i know it's good for you and


---------23:06----------
it's nine bucks an hour so i don't know


---------23:08----------
why you're complaining


---------23:12----------
right and then when problems happen so


---------23:14----------
here's like an example right so when


---------23:15----------
problems happen and i get into trouble


---------23:18----------
because heaven forbid like i change


---------23:19----------
anything that's ridiculous like why


---------23:20----------
would i change anything then what


---------23:22----------
happens is like when when


---------23:24----------
problems start to arise and there are


---------23:25----------
media stories and stuff like that


---------23:27----------
instead of i know it's kind of weird but


---------23:28----------
instead of fixing the problem and saying


---------23:30----------
hey maybe i screwed up here


---------23:32----------
what i do is i hire a pr firm and i'm


---------23:34----------
like fix my public image like i'm fat


---------23:37----------
and i'm bloated and i'm i'm a


---------23:39----------
corporation


---------23:40----------
and what i want you to do is is tailor


---------23:43----------
me a nice suit so it makes it look good


---------23:46----------
and then what we're going to do is we're


---------23:47----------
going to rebrand


---------23:49----------
right so we have like rebrand i like i


---------23:51----------
have nothing against pr like i think


---------23:52----------
that there's important things you know


---------23:54----------
for


---------23:55----------
why perception matters because sometimes


---------23:57----------
you have the flip side of the coin too


---------23:58----------
where you are doing a really good job


---------24:00----------
and because of some kind of slander


---------24:02----------
campaign or some kind of disgruntled


---------24:04----------
people like you know you have to


---------24:06----------
the battle of perception is important


---------24:08----------
i'm just saying that perception the


---------24:10----------
battle of perception should not be a


---------24:11----------
substitute for actually like making


---------24:14----------
improvement right and this is like


---------24:16----------
psychology 101 or maybe clinical


---------24:17----------
medicine 101 which is like if you know


---------24:20----------
if you have a problem in a relationship


---------24:22----------
you should try to understand the other


---------24:23----------
person's perspective instead of trying


---------24:25----------
to gaslight them through you the use of


---------24:27----------
pr and convincing the world that there


---------24:28----------
isn't actually a problem


---------24:30----------
and somewhere along the way corporations


---------24:32----------
just started doing that and it started


---------24:34----------
working really well which is why they


---------24:35----------
kept doing it because we didn't hold


---------24:37----------
them accountable for it right


---------24:39----------
when when we find out that for example


---------24:41----------
like you know


---------24:42----------
there's human rights stuff in china and


---------24:44----------
apple and all these kinds of stories


---------24:46----------
come out and nike is like using


---------24:48----------
sweatshops and stuff like that did we


---------24:49----------
stop purchasing nike equipment did we


---------24:52----------
stop buying apple products did we do any


---------24:54----------
of that stuff no


---------24:56----------
right and so like if


---------24:58----------
you know corporations are doing it


---------24:59----------
because they've been able to get away


---------25:01----------
with it because they haven't been held


---------25:02----------
accountable


---------25:03----------
and now things are are so


---------25:06----------
they're reaching a point due to the


---------25:07----------
access of information and due to you


---------25:10----------
know people like realizing that they


---------25:12----------
don't have to commute two hours to go to


---------25:14----------
work every day that the grass is


---------25:16----------
actually greener on the other side what


---------25:17----------
we're starting to see is like a lot of


---------25:19----------
companies are starting to suffer from


---------25:20----------
that right


---------25:22----------
and it's kind of interesting because


---------25:23----------
like there's just a lot of stuff that


---------25:25----------
companies are getting bit in the ass


---------25:27----------
where they were super happy when it


---------25:28----------
happened the first time around


---------25:29----------
outsourcing is one example another


---------25:30----------
example is like automation right so it's


---------25:32----------
kind of interesting because


---------25:34----------
you know when grocery stores move from


---------25:36----------
human people checking you out to


---------25:38----------
machines checking you out they didn't


---------25:39----------
drop prices at all it's not like


---------25:41----------
anything in the grocery store got


---------25:42----------
cheaper it's just the company made more


---------25:44----------
money and now when they're getting


---------25:46----------
automated bots that are clogging their


---------25:48----------
their applications i mean their their


---------25:50----------
job


---------25:50----------
application website with fake


---------25:52----------
applications like they seem to be crying


---------25:54----------
foul when it's like companies have had


---------25:56----------
no problem you know automating things


---------25:58----------
when it screws over workers but heaven


---------25:59----------
forbid workers start automating things


---------26:02----------
that screw over companies like that's


---------26:03----------
just unfair


---------26:04----------
the best example of this i actually had


---------26:06----------
a client who


---------26:08----------
wrote a script to do his job


---------26:10----------
and then like


---------26:11----------
someone found out about it and they sort


---------26:13----------
of fired him


---------26:15----------
and and then they got like super upset


---------26:17----------
and he's like okay you can fire me if


---------26:18----------
you want to but you're gonna have to pay


---------26:20----------
human to do this amount instead of


---------26:21----------
rewarding ingenuity in a company


---------26:23----------
actually like automating a worker


---------26:25----------
automating the job instead of giving


---------26:26----------
that person a gigantic raise and saying


---------26:28----------
hey is there anything else that you can


---------26:30----------
automate for us bro they just fired him


---------26:32----------
and got super upset


---------26:34----------
and it's like it goes both ways right so


---------26:37----------
i think what we're starting to see is


---------26:38----------
essentially like a karmic seed coming to


---------26:40----------
fruition


---------26:41----------
and this anti-worker movement is coming


---------26:43----------
it is now starting to really propagate


---------26:45----------
because people are aware that they don't


---------26:46----------
have to put up with this crap anymore


---------26:48----------
there's actually a selection pressure


---------26:50----------
that companies have become bloated


---------26:52----------
because they there have not been


---------26:53----------
selection pressures against them right


---------26:56----------
and now that there are selection


---------26:57----------
pressures against them they're starting


---------26:58----------
to feel the hurt and this is getting


---------27:00----------
further propagated by the fact that when


---------27:03----------
you have a problem


---------27:05----------
what instead of actually like addressing


---------27:07----------
the problem and trying to fix it and


---------27:08----------
listening to people's concerns you call


---------27:10----------
them lazy and blame the government and


---------27:12----------
as long as like you're doing that and


---------27:14----------
then you hire a pr firm those are the


---------27:15----------
three and if you keep on doing those


---------27:17----------
three things like do you all get that on


---------27:18----------
a very fundamental level like you're not


---------27:20----------
fixing the problem


---------27:22----------
you can whine about the government as


---------27:23----------
much as you want to but like until you


---------27:25----------
fix the problem until you make your


---------27:27----------
place


---------27:28----------
a place where people actually want to


---------27:30----------
work where they feel hopefully fairly


---------27:32----------
compensated which there is a flip side


---------27:34----------
to that coin too because human beings


---------27:36----------
never feel feel fairly compensated right


---------27:38----------
like you could always you always feel


---------27:40----------
like


---------27:41----------
you could be making more money for doing


---------27:42----------
the work that you do that's just part of


---------27:44----------
human psychology it's sort of like this


---------27:45----------
this too is a good example you look at


---------27:48----------
dishes that get done in a house right so


---------27:50----------
let's say you live with four roommates


---------27:52----------
everyone always feels like they're doing


---------27:53----------
the most dishes that's just how it is so


---------27:55----------
there are there are good reasons why you


---------27:58----------
know for example you can't just give in


---------28:00----------
to what workers want because workers may


---------28:03----------
always feel like they're unjustly


---------28:04----------
compensated which is human psychology


---------28:07----------
but at some point there's like there's


---------28:08----------
some some middle ground right where like


---------28:10----------
you don't screw them over and call them


---------28:12----------
lazy and hire a pr firm you actually


---------28:14----------
listen to what they say you do your best


---------28:16----------
to fairly compensate them and then you


---------28:18----------
also recognize that maybe if people are


---------28:20----------
leaving that you're a boss


---------28:22----------
maybe people are leaving you don't pay


---------28:24----------
him enough maybe people are leaving like


---------28:26----------
you should reconsider your work


---------28:28----------
environment and that you try to do what


---------28:30----------
you can to make your employees happy but


---------28:32----------
until people start doing that they're


---------28:34----------
going to keep seeing this i'm not saying


---------28:35----------
workers are right about 100 of things


---------28:37----------
but like it's just been way too much


---------28:39----------
like there have been too many problems


---------28:41----------
that get propagated


---------28:42----------
and not addressed and not fixed and it's


---------28:45----------
been going on for too long


---------28:47----------
so like the workers have been winning


---------28:49----------
only five percent of the time and so i


---------28:51----------
think they're tired of playing the game


---------28:52----------
which is why they're quitting


---------28:57----------
right and thankfully i've worked with


---------28:58----------
companies who and i like it's good so i


---------29:02----------
like working with companies and then


---------29:03----------
we'll talk about things like this right


---------29:05----------
so when i go to an investment bank and


---------29:07----------
and you know


---------29:08----------
we'll talk a little bit about because


---------29:10----------
you got to speak their language so i


---------29:11----------
i'll ask them questions like how much


---------29:13----------
does your turnover hurt you


---------29:15----------
what if you could


---------29:16----------
have it a place where there wasn't where


---------29:19----------
your turnover number was 50 they're like


---------29:21----------
oh my god that would be amazing


---------29:24----------
right and then you have to you can even


---------29:25----------
talk the language of dollars and cents


---------29:27----------
so you can tell them like how much would


---------29:28----------
that affect your bottom line and they're


---------29:30----------
like oh would affect our bottom line


---------29:31----------
like this much how many more deals could


---------29:32----------
you do a year oh we could do like so


---------29:34----------
many more deals a year


---------29:36----------
okay so then like you what's the value


---------29:37----------
of those deals okay so like why not give


---------29:39----------
people more money like


---------29:41----------
they're like but but they don't they


---------29:43----------
haven't earned it


---------29:44----------
right and there's some weird concept of


---------29:46----------
like haven't earned it it's like bro you


---------29:48----------
make 16 million dollars a year what have


---------29:49----------
you done to earn it


---------29:50----------
right this is something that i realized


---------29:52----------
in medicine so


---------29:53----------
i was talking to a doctor and it was


---------29:55----------
talking about you know how much money


---------29:56----------
they make


---------29:57----------
and they were like well i've worked my


---------29:58----------
ass off for like the last 16 years i


---------30:00----------
deserve to make x amount of money


---------30:02----------
i work 70 hours a week and it's like bro


---------30:07----------
the lady that just was in your office


---------30:08----------
that got diagnosed with breast cancer at


---------30:10----------
the age of 45 also works 70 hours a week


---------30:14----------
she just


---------30:15----------
works worse jobs than you do


---------30:17----------
she's been working 70 hours a week for


---------30:19----------
longer than you have


---------30:22----------
earned it is is tricky


---------30:26----------
right


---------30:27----------
and and this is where from a corporate


---------30:28----------
perspective you got to be kind of


---------30:29----------
careful right so like if you think about


---------30:31----------
oh but what about the justification of


---------30:32----------
that salary like there could be a good


---------30:33----------
reason for that so let's let's put you


---------30:35----------
in charge for a second chat let's say


---------30:36----------
you run a a company with 100 million


---------30:39----------
dollars that makes 100 million dollars


---------30:41----------
in revenue


---------30:42----------
and you have a choice you can hire one


---------30:44----------
dude for five million dollars a year


---------30:47----------
or you can hire another dude for 20


---------30:48----------
million dollars a year


---------30:50----------
the upside one guy increases your


---------30:54----------
profits by five percent the other guy


---------30:56----------
increases your offense profits by 50


---------30:58----------
and since that person is able to


---------31:00----------
increase your profits by 50 percent


---------31:02----------
people are willing to pay them 20


---------31:04----------
million dollars which one are you going


---------31:05----------
to hire


---------31:07----------
right it's tricky


---------31:08----------
there's a flip side of that coin


---------31:12----------
right


---------31:13----------
and so then you're willing to pay 20


---------31:15----------
million dollars and it's a justified


---------31:16----------
cost from your perspective that's how


---------31:18----------
that person is able to command the price


---------31:20----------
that they're able to command so i'm not


---------31:21----------
saying that you know high compensation


---------31:23----------
by definition is like an evil thing i


---------31:26----------
think there's an economic side to that


---------31:28----------
equation too which i've come to


---------31:29----------
understand working with like ceos and


---------31:31----------
entrepreneurs


---------31:33----------
but this is the kind of thing where you


---------31:34----------
know when you work with an investment


---------31:36----------
bank you got to help them understand


---------31:37----------
that hey if you keep like i think is


---------31:38----------
this my experience


---------31:40----------
is also what i do for like a lot of our


---------31:42----------
consulting is that i believe that the


---------31:44----------
happiest healthiest employees like are


---------31:46----------
the most productive and so do what you


---------31:48----------
can to make your happy healthy employees


---------31:50----------
like you know do what you can


---------31:53----------
and the more that you get their back


---------31:55----------
they'll have yours and what people are


---------31:56----------
have been expecting for far too long is


---------31:58----------
their employees to have their back and


---------31:59----------
they don't see any benefit from it


---------32:02----------
you got to be a team player you got to


---------32:03----------
come in and work christmas


---------32:05----------
what do you get for that nothing you get


---------32:07----------
to since you're the


---------32:09----------
since you're the person who's the


---------32:10----------
biggest doormat you're also going to


---------32:12----------
work thanksgiving because other people


---------32:13----------
are going to and moan but since


---------32:15----------
you're actually a team player and you're


---------32:16----------
willing to sacrifice i'm going to have


---------32:18----------
you work thanksgiving and july 4th and


---------32:21----------
new year's


---------32:22----------
right and this is the way that you work


---------32:24----------
your hardest employees to extinction


---------32:30----------
right


---------32:31----------
it's not unfair


---------32:32----------
let's be clear it's evolutionary


---------32:36----------
you can call evolution unfair if you


---------32:38----------
want to


---------32:39----------
but until you start selecting against


---------32:41----------
that kind of thing it'll continue to


---------32:43----------
happen


---------32:44----------
so what people have sort of discovered


---------32:46----------
if you're in the workplace is that


---------32:48----------
being grumpy and asked to do extra work


---------32:50----------
is can be a very good


---------32:53----------
quality right it can protect you in some


---------32:55----------
ways hurt you in other ways


---------32:57----------
who's likely to get promoted to manager


---------32:59----------
the person who comes in on


---------33:01----------
the four holidays of the year or the


---------33:03----------
person who puts on a grumpy face what do


---------33:05----------
y'all think chat


---------33:07----------
who's more likely to get promoted


---------33:15----------
all right so it's it's interesting


---------33:17----------
people are saying the grump


---------33:20----------
right so this is where so this is where


---------33:22----------
like it depends on the kind of boss that


---------33:24----------
you have does the boss


---------33:25----------
select for oh if i promote the doormat


---------33:29----------
then the grump is going to be grumpier


---------33:31----------
about it and i don't want him to be


---------33:32----------
grumpy about it


---------33:34----------
or do i


---------33:36----------
in promote


---------33:37----------
the doormat because he's a team player


---------33:39----------
and the grumpy's gonna be grumpy


---------33:41----------
it depends on what you've selected for


---------33:43----------
right so as a boss


---------33:44----------
if you've tolerated grumpy behavior then


---------33:47----------
you're gonna be selecting for that kind


---------33:48----------
of behavior


---------33:51----------
so it's tricky


---------33:53----------
it's very tricky


---------33:54----------
so i i think that you know just to


---------33:57----------
summarize i think the the great


---------33:58----------
resignation has been a long time in


---------34:00----------
coming


---------34:01----------
i think that there's been a lot of like


---------34:03----------
corporate invalidation of workers


---------34:05----------
experiences and so employees are just


---------34:07----------
not willing to put up with that anymore


---------34:08----------
they've started to re realize that they


---------34:10----------
don't have to because i don't i'm not


---------34:12----------
geographically restricted i can work


---------34:14----------
from home i and the other thing is that


---------34:16----------
i don't i'm like the exploitation is


---------34:18----------
just not worth it anymore right so the


---------34:21----------
being being forced to work all my


---------34:22----------
holidays


---------34:24----------
for some amount of money when the


---------34:25----------
company doesn't have my back in other


---------34:27----------
situations


---------34:29----------
it's just not worth it for me and i


---------34:30----------
think what we're seeing and just for the


---------34:32----------
record i think there are a lot of good


---------34:33----------
employers companies corporations out


---------34:35----------
there like i've heard great things about


---------34:36----------
costco for example like i haven't seen a


---------34:39----------
single post on the anti-work subreddit


---------34:40----------
about costco


---------34:42----------
right so it is possible to do a good job


---------34:45----------
you know i haven't seen a single post


---------34:47----------
about you know the cor the toxic culture


---------34:50----------
at like super giant games for example so


---------34:52----------
maybe there is one maybe there is i i


---------34:53----------
don't know


---------34:55----------
but you know there are some situations


---------34:56----------
where you see toxic people post about


---------34:58----------
toxic work cultures but there are a lot


---------34:59----------
of companies that are absent from that


---------35:04----------
so


---------35:06----------
you know


---------35:08----------
and then there's another evolutionary


---------35:10----------
thing which is that


---------35:13----------
instead of actually improving your your


---------35:15----------
game design


---------35:16----------
or optics which you do is just acquire


---------35:18----------
the studios that make good games and


---------35:21----------
then you drive them into the ground


---------35:22----------
that's another model which has been


---------35:23----------
evolutionarily supported


---------35:25----------
because we as gamers don't


---------35:28----------
continue buying the games once they've


---------35:30----------
been acquired and they start making crap


---------35:34----------
right so until until there's any kind of


---------35:37----------
selection pressure against it the the


---------35:38----------
behavior will propagate


---------35:56----------
you
