---------00:00----------
okay let's get started so welcome guys


---------00:03----------
to another


---------00:03----------
healthy gamer gg stream my name is olive


---------00:06----------
kenoji i'm a psychiatrist practicing in


---------00:08----------
boston massachusetts


---------00:09----------
can you tell us how masturbation is bad


---------00:11----------
so we'll get into that kind of stuff so


---------00:12----------
let's let's hop in


---------00:14----------
welcome friends hey um


---------00:17----------
so let's just do a quick uh we'll do


---------00:20----------
like a volume


---------00:21----------
check as we do introductions um


---------00:25----------
so welcome guys so i think this is this


---------00:27----------
is another stream talking about


---------00:29----------
i guess nofap and porn addiction


---------00:32----------
so first of all huge props see all for


---------00:35----------
coming on and talking about something


---------00:36----------
that


---------00:36----------
is a community we usually don't talk


---------00:38----------
about pretty openly


---------00:40----------
um and so we had a porn addiction stream


---------00:43----------
a couple of


---------00:44----------
months ago now and i think it was


---------00:45----------
actually


---------00:47----------
the most positive youtube comment


---------00:49----------
section i've ever seen on youtube which


---------00:51----------
is just really really bizarre


---------00:54----------
because it's something that normally


---------00:55----------
comes with a lot of shame so props to


---------00:57----------
you guys


---------00:58----------
for coming on and talking about this uh


---------01:02----------
so if you guys are on twitch i highly


---------01:04----------
recommend minimizing it


---------01:06----------
because i think it's only going to be


---------01:07----------
distracting


---------01:09----------
and let's go ahead and start with


---------01:10----------
introductions and and why don't y'all


---------01:12----------
you know tell us what you want to be


---------01:14----------
called over the course of the stream


---------01:17----------
um and tell us a little bit about your


---------01:19----------
experience with nofap or porn addiction


---------01:23----------
so i think i'll start um i'm going by


---------01:26----------
bob today


---------01:27----------
okay um i first


---------01:31----------
saw porn when i was about 12 years old


---------01:34----------
um


---------01:34----------
and there was a lot of like i had a lot


---------01:36----------
of like family


---------01:38----------
conflict and stuff at the time um and


---------01:41----------
that was my first introduction into it


---------01:44----------
and


---------01:45----------
uh it got a little bit better when i was


---------01:46----------
around 18.


---------01:48----------
i got a girlfriend and then um


---------01:51----------
lost said girlfriend and i started


---------01:53----------
looking at porn again


---------01:55----------
uh when i was around 19 and


---------01:59----------
it got gradually worse and worse along


---------02:00----------
with uh


---------02:02----------
you know issues of social anxiety and


---------02:04----------
isolation


---------02:05----------
along with the internet addiction and


---------02:07----------
then around


---------02:09----------
23 my dad got cancer and died


---------02:13----------
and that exacerbated it and it got worse


---------02:16----------
um and i had a series of


---------02:19----------
panic attacks and like pretty severe


---------02:23----------
issues um and it seemed to dovetail with


---------02:27----------
that


---------02:28----------
uh internet addiction video game


---------02:29----------
addiction and pornography addiction


---------02:32----------
um and there was a long period of using


---------02:35----------
for


---------02:36----------
hours on end losing sleep that sort of


---------02:39----------
thing


---------02:39----------
um intensification of just weirdness


---------02:43----------
in general in that department um


---------02:46----------
and i only started getting control of it


---------02:48----------
when i got to be around


---------02:51----------
26 or 27 and started thinking about it


---------02:55----------
as a problem


---------02:57----------
and tried to do what's


---------03:00----------
you know a streak for three days a week


---------03:04----------
a month and


---------03:08----------
i noticed that a lot of the time when i


---------03:10----------
would get on a long streak


---------03:13----------
a lot of these issues would come up


---------03:14----------
again


---------03:16----------
my life would improve in some ways or it


---------03:18----------
would get more difficult in other ways


---------03:21----------
um and whenever i got


---------03:25----------
on the the brahmacharya channel with all


---------03:28----------
these other people and i started talking


---------03:29----------
to them


---------03:31----------
we really we really had um


---------03:34----------
it was a great support group and it


---------03:36----------
really has helped me a lot to


---------03:38----------
figure out how to manage this why it's


---------03:41----------
happening


---------03:42----------
how i can sort of use this discipline to


---------03:45----------
improve my self-understanding in my life


---------03:48----------
and that is where i'm at now


---------03:51----------
look at the introduction bob thanks for


---------03:54----------
sharing man


---------03:56----------
thanks for having me anyone else want to


---------03:58----------
go


---------03:59----------
yeah i'll go next uh you can call me


---------04:01----------
moon um


---------04:02----------
so i first started watching porn


---------04:04----------
whenever i was you know probably about


---------04:05----------
12 as well


---------04:07----------
and it wasn't really a problem when i


---------04:08----------
was a kid but it kind of ramped up to


---------04:11----------
a way i would bury my emotions and kind


---------04:14----------
of


---------04:15----------
escape reality i'd say and


---------04:18----------
um i kind of built up to a really bad


---------04:19----------
problem you know in the past few years


---------04:22----------
and uh currently i'm on my longest


---------04:24----------
streak probably


---------04:25----------
in like five six years right now i have


---------04:28----------
50 days


---------04:29----------
without it of like porn or masturbation


---------04:32----------
so i'm pretty


---------04:33----------
happy with that but um yeah definitely


---------04:35----------
was a way that i would numb


---------04:37----------
my emotions okay


---------04:40----------
thanks for sharing moon we'll definitely


---------04:43----------
get into


---------04:44----------
you know what that what the nofap


---------04:47----------
streak is like and things like that so


---------04:49----------
cool sounds good


---------04:51----------
thanks for coming on man yeah then i go


---------04:54----------
next


---------04:55----------
you can call me atsai i


---------04:58----------
watched porn the first time when i was


---------05:00----------
10 years old


---------05:02----------
and it was usually i would say normal


---------05:05----------
like once a day and i had no


---------05:09----------
seemingly no problems outside of it but


---------05:13----------
then i became a christian on my own and


---------05:16----------
discovered


---------05:16----------
it's a sin and i need to stop and


---------05:20----------
i really had a hard time stopping and i


---------05:22----------
could only go for like


---------05:24----------
three days and then at some point i


---------05:27----------
googled porn addiction and then i found


---------05:30----------
oh it's not just


---------05:32----------
religious talk that it's harmful but


---------05:34----------
it's there also


---------05:36----------
a lot of there's also a lot of


---------05:37----------
scientific evidence and


---------05:40----------
many reports from people and seeing all


---------05:43----------
these reports


---------05:44----------
and describing their problems they had i


---------05:46----------
and


---------05:47----------
these were exactly the problems also i


---------05:49----------
had at the time


---------05:50----------
like social anxiety i was very shy and i


---------05:54----------
didn't


---------05:54----------
wanted to interact with people a lot and


---------05:59----------
once i got into it um i got my


---------06:02----------
longest streak back then it was around


---------06:05----------
it was in 2016


---------06:07----------
and i had a 70 day long streak


---------06:10----------
and in that time my life improved


---------06:13----------
drastically


---------06:14----------
in areas especially in like


---------06:18----------
social anxiety talking with girls and


---------06:22----------
just being in general i wasn't depressed


---------06:25----------
anymore i had more motivation and stuff


---------06:27----------
like that


---------06:28----------
but ever since then it got slightly


---------06:30----------
worse and i'm now


---------06:32----------
at a place where i'm struggling to get


---------06:34----------
over one week


---------06:35----------
and i started also to binge a lot which


---------06:39----------
didn't happen


---------06:40----------
which means like five times in a row


---------06:44----------
which is like extremely unhealthy hence


---------06:47----------
yeah that's


---------06:48----------
where i am right now wow sounds like


---------06:51----------
quite the journey


---------06:51----------
it's outside yeah exactly


---------06:56----------
thanks for sharing man


---------06:59----------
i think i'ma go next um you can call me


---------07:02----------
flo


---------07:03----------
[Music]


---------07:05----------
i started watching porn when i was 12


---------07:08----------
and it was like


---------07:12----------
at the same time as i was entering high


---------07:15----------
school and


---------07:17----------
that time a few friends that i had


---------07:20----------
been with on like primary school kind of


---------07:23----------
like turned on me and started bullying


---------07:25----------
me


---------07:25----------
in high school and um


---------07:30----------
yeah it was like pretty good timing to


---------07:32----------
discover pawn because i would like use


---------07:34----------
it to numb


---------07:35----------
like the pain i felt at that time um


---------07:39----------
around the same time i started like


---------07:41----------
getting like suicidal thoughts


---------07:43----------
and um yeah i'm not sure if i had like a


---------07:47----------
depression but i'm yeah i'm pretty


---------07:50----------
certain


---------07:50----------
and um then i


---------07:54----------
um just like went with it until i was 18


---------07:58----------
and traveling around in australia for a


---------08:01----------
year


---------08:02----------
and being there i had like no social


---------08:05----------
anxiety and like a lot of good friends


---------08:07----------
that


---------08:09----------
were there for me and i discovered that


---------08:11----------
i was


---------08:12----------
addicted to pornography because i was


---------08:14----------
just


---------08:15----------
um using it less and emotions were


---------08:18----------
coming up


---------08:19----------
and i was like feeling a lot of


---------08:21----------
different


---------08:22----------
emotions and um i started to


---------08:27----------
do like nofap and wasn't really able to


---------08:31----------
stop


---------08:31----------
and when i was back at home after


---------08:35----------
traveling


---------08:35----------
it got worse because i moved back in


---------08:37----------
with my parents


---------08:39----------
and i had like


---------08:42----------
lots of family issues with them


---------08:44----------
beforehand


---------08:45----------
and i felt really helpless


---------08:50----------
and so i went to a psychiatrist


---------08:53----------
and started therapy basically


---------08:57----------
with somebody like doing like behavioral


---------09:02----------
addictions and um


---------09:05----------
yeah i've been trying to quit since then


---------09:08----------
and


---------09:09----------
yeah i still feel pretty helpless with


---------09:11----------
this topic


---------09:12----------
sorry you feel that way hopefully we'll


---------09:15----------
i don't know if we can


---------09:17----------
make you feel less helpless but we're


---------09:19----------
hopefully we'll try to understand it a


---------09:20----------
little bit


---------09:21----------
sounds like you put in a lot of effort


---------09:22----------
to trying to get a control like get it


---------09:24----------
get a handle on it


---------09:26----------
has it been yeah all of us i think are


---------09:28----------
like


---------09:29----------
pretty um like trying their best


---------09:33----------
yeah is that good enough


---------09:39----------
well um


---------09:44----------
we all relapse at some point


---------09:47----------
but um i think it has improved


---------09:50----------
definitely also being with these guys


---------09:52----------
and


---------09:53----------
chatting about it cool


---------09:56----------
welcome club thanks for sharing thank


---------09:58----------
you


---------10:00----------
okay and uh i'll go next so on the


---------10:02----------
discord my name is azalea


---------10:04----------
bayes but i'll go by zz uh shout out to


---------10:06----------
ez moon


---------10:07----------
from drama chariot discord and my friend


---------10:09----------
tyler


---------10:10----------
so everybody else forgot but um so i


---------10:13----------
first watched porn when


---------10:15----------
i was 11 um and i got like a lot of


---------10:18----------
viruses


---------10:19----------
on my mom's computer so i mean everybody


---------10:22----------
i think everybody remembers that from


---------10:24----------
the old days of the internet it wasn't


---------10:25----------
exactly safe


---------10:26----------
to watch porn but now uh if i do


---------10:31----------
use i uh use it on my mobile phone which


---------10:34----------
i think is probably one of the hardest


---------10:36----------
things because now we have mobile phones


---------10:38----------
and ipads and that sort of thing the


---------10:41----------
longest streak i ever had was when i was


---------10:43----------
in a dual diagnosis


---------10:44----------
rehab so i have a i have like a mental


---------10:47----------
disability as well as like traditional


---------10:49----------
addiction um so 30 days without the


---------10:52----------
internet means


---------10:53----------
30 days without porn so


---------10:56----------
yeah and recently i found it very hard


---------10:58----------
to really start a streak a lot of


---------11:01----------
traumatic events have happened recently


---------11:02----------
i got into a car accident


---------11:04----------
i recently overdosed got into mental


---------11:06----------
hospitals i've been in mental hospitals


---------11:08----------
in and out


---------11:09----------
due to my disability but otherwise i'm


---------11:12----------
happy to be on the stream


---------11:13----------
and uh hopefully this helps other people


---------11:16----------
as well as myself


---------11:18----------
oh man wow it sounds like you've been


---------11:20----------
had some challenges


---------11:22----------
you all have


---------11:25----------
i guess that leaves me yeah sorry if i


---------11:28----------
ramble


---------11:29----------
um you guys can call me annie


---------11:32----------
uh i'm 20 years old and uh


---------11:35----------
i think i fur and tell me if my mic is


---------11:37----------
too loud um


---------11:39----------
first a time i got i saw porn


---------11:42----------
i think it was in my early teens and it


---------11:45----------
was mainly out of curiosity


---------11:47----------
um but now that i look back i think i


---------11:50----------
was kind of using it to


---------11:52----------
kind of escape my bullying and my very


---------11:55----------
toxic relationship with my parents


---------11:58----------
and um


---------12:02----------
sorry give me a sec


---------12:08----------
um and uh


---------12:12----------
i didn't think much about it and uh i


---------12:14----------
moved to america when i was 15.


---------12:16----------
and uh as my life started getting worse


---------12:18----------
um


---------12:20----------
i started using porn more as an escaping


---------12:22----------
tool


---------12:23----------
and uh to escape my insecurities mainly


---------12:27----------
because of my bad relationship


---------12:28----------
especially with my parents


---------12:30----------
and um


---------12:34----------
i started using it as a stress tool and


---------12:36----------
as a sleeping tool


---------12:38----------
as a stress relief tool and as a


---------12:39----------
sleeping tool and


---------12:41----------
um my depression my anxiety and my


---------12:44----------
trauma got


---------12:45----------
childhood trauma i got very bad over


---------12:47----------
time and the more and more


---------12:49----------
i got i felt deeper into depression the


---------12:50----------
more and more i started using porn


---------12:52----------
and uh eventually i kind of had like uh


---------12:57----------
i fell down very low i did stuff i


---------13:00----------
didn't want to do


---------13:01----------
like partying and being with people i


---------13:03----------
don't want to be and


---------13:05----------
i kind of lost it mentally and


---------13:09----------
i started a self-help journey after that


---------13:11----------
and i've been doing really good


---------13:13----------
and like doing good in school and


---------13:16----------
exercising and


---------13:17----------
breathing and meditating and uh i real


---------13:20----------
the more and more i started helping


---------13:21----------
myself the more and more started


---------13:22----------
realizing that


---------13:23----------
i'm addicted to porn uh i didn't want to


---------13:26----------
admit it


---------13:27----------
but um starting january i started really


---------13:30----------
taking care of myself


---------13:31----------
and uh i took it as a challenge to start


---------13:33----------
nofap


---------13:35----------
to prove to myself that i'm not addicted


---------13:36----------
to porn and the exact opposite happened


---------13:39----------
i um i couldn't last for more than a few


---------13:42----------
days


---------13:42----------
and when i came back i was binging


---------13:46----------
all day it consumed me i would do it


---------13:49----------
five six times in a row um very


---------13:52----------
unhealthy and


---------13:53----------
my whole day was just porn and and


---------13:56----------
fapping


---------13:57----------
and for months now i haven't been able


---------14:00----------
to keep a


---------14:01----------
streak longer than a week and actually


---------14:03----------
today will make my longest streak


---------14:05----------
of seven days and um


---------14:10----------
it's uh porn addiction i think is just


---------14:12----------
part of the puzzle


---------14:14----------
and um for me it kind of


---------14:17----------
fits with depression and anxiety and um


---------14:21----------
what i'm trying to learn from this


---------14:22----------
stream is mainly uh i guess the only


---------14:24----------
thing always holding me back from


---------14:25----------
keeping a very long streak


---------14:27----------
is um i kind of asked myself why am i


---------14:31----------
uh defying my urges like i feel great


---------14:35----------
when i'm on nofap uh


---------14:38----------
i feel very good i feel normal as you


---------14:39----------
would say and then when i binge i feel


---------14:42----------
horrible but


---------14:42----------
the urges feel great like the pleasure


---------14:45----------
so i don't know if i'm doing something


---------14:47----------
wrong by


---------14:48----------
defying my pleasures or defying the


---------14:50----------
urges


---------14:51----------
for like feeling normal on no fap


---------14:54----------
and sorry if i was speaking for too long


---------14:56----------
but i guess that's it no that that's


---------14:57----------
great man


---------14:58----------
it's bonnie yeah any


---------15:02----------
any okay


---------15:05----------
so that that was awesome in productions


---------15:08----------
everyone i think um if it's okay with


---------15:09----------
you guys i'm gonna just


---------15:11----------
try to outline like kind of a thread for


---------15:14----------
our discussions today


---------15:16----------
i'm gonna point out a couple of themes


---------15:18----------
and then propose sort of a


---------15:21----------
order to tackle them so


---------15:24----------
the first thing i think we should talk a


---------15:26----------
little bit about is


---------15:27----------
um you know how do you understand if


---------15:30----------
you're addicted to porn so i'm hearing


---------15:31----------
from many people


---------15:33----------
that they had kind of this journey where


---------15:36----------
they like sort of figured out at some


---------15:37----------
point


---------15:38----------
i'm addicted to porn and that this is


---------15:39----------
not okay


---------15:41----------
i think related to that a lot of people


---------15:43----------
have mentioned that they find


---------15:44----------
their addiction to be harmful um


---------15:47----------
and you know some people have mentioned


---------15:49----------
science or consequences or things like


---------15:51----------
that


---------15:51----------
so maybe we can talk first of all about


---------15:54----------
how you know you're addicted to porn


---------15:56----------
secondly about what's harmful or


---------15:59----------
unhealthy about it


---------16:01----------
third is kind of exploring so everyone


---------16:03----------
seems like they


---------16:04----------
add some difficulties or challenges and


---------16:07----------
that they use porn as an escape


---------16:10----------
so i think we should sort of think a


---------16:11----------
little bit about that idea of porn as an


---------16:14----------
escape


---------16:14----------
the other interesting uh thing that that


---------16:17----------
people have mentioned is that as they


---------16:18----------
start to do nofap


---------16:20----------
things come up for them right so i think


---------16:23----------
that's something that is very very


---------16:26----------
uh that's something that is very poorly


---------16:29----------
understood


---------16:30----------
so like even if we define and people


---------16:32----------
have a sense of like


---------16:33----------
you know this is what porn addiction is


---------16:34----------
i think one of the challenges that


---------16:36----------
happens is like as you start doing nofap


---------16:38----------
or something else


---------16:40----------
as you take away the coping mechanism


---------16:42----------
everything that it's been


---------16:44----------
balancing is going to come back up


---------16:47----------
so what's that experience been like for


---------16:49----------
you guys so um


---------16:51----------
and then yeah so like numb things coming


---------16:55----------
up


---------16:55----------
stuff like that and then um i think one


---------16:59----------
person said


---------17:00----------
i think it was bob who said you use the


---------17:02----------
phrase intensification of weirdness i'm


---------17:04----------
not sure exactly what he was referring


---------17:05----------
to


---------17:06----------
but you know it sounds like that the


---------17:07----------
journey has certain challenges that are


---------17:10----------
unexpected


---------17:11----------
and hopefully as we understand like what


---------17:13----------
we're dealing with we can get


---------17:15----------
better at dealing with it um then what


---------17:18----------
i'd like to kind of


---------17:19----------
think a little bit about is how you guys


---------17:21----------
got to nofap


---------17:23----------
like what nofap is what's been y'all's


---------17:25----------
experience of nofap and maybe that has


---------17:27----------
something to do with the coping


---------17:28----------
mechanisms as well and what comes up


---------17:30----------
uh and then we can think a little bit


---------17:33----------
about


---------17:35----------
um brahmacharya and what that means


---------17:36----------
because i imagine a lot of people


---------17:38----------
don't know what y'all are talking about


---------17:40----------
um what


---------17:41----------
what your experience with our community


---------17:43----------
has been


---------17:45----------
uh and then the last thing that we'll


---------17:47----------
kind of explore


---------17:48----------
is sort of like how to move forward so


---------17:52----------
this will be a discussion


---------17:53----------
um you know some people have mentioned


---------17:54----------
that they've tried behavioral treatment


---------17:57----------
uh things about defying the urge how can


---------17:59----------
we understand


---------18:00----------
urges how can can we understand what's


---------18:02----------
healthy what our body is doing what our


---------18:04----------
mind is doing


---------18:05----------
and and sort of maybe try to think a


---------18:07----------
little bit about like how to take


---------18:09----------
another step forward for those of you


---------18:11----------
who have done


---------18:13----------
longer streets maybe you can share with


---------18:15----------
us


---------18:16----------
you know what you've been able to do or


---------18:18----------
how you were able to do it


---------18:20----------
and we can talk a little bit about


---------18:21----------
streaks and you know how long they last


---------18:23----------
and what makes them easy what makes them


---------18:25----------
hard


---------18:25----------
does that sound okay this all sounds


---------18:28----------
great sounds good yeah


---------18:29----------
okay nice so let's start with how do you


---------18:32----------
know you're addicted to porn


---------18:34----------
um can i prefer something because it


---------18:36----------
goes like


---------18:37----------
hand in hand with what nofap is and how


---------18:40----------
we


---------18:41----------
like how we realized um


---------18:42----------
[Music]


---------18:45----------
so like nofap started off by like one


---------18:48----------
guy


---------18:49----------
um on the internet i don't know his name


---------18:52----------
but he started like a community where he


---------18:56----------
was trying to build awareness for porn


---------18:59----------
addiction


---------19:00----------
and he introduced it as like a challenge


---------19:03----------
i think of 30 days to just try and


---------19:07----------
stop consuming pornography and


---------19:11----------
like pmo so like pawn masturbation and


---------19:14----------
orgasm


---------19:15----------
and he basically built like


---------19:20----------
a pretty big community around him


---------19:22----------
there's a popular subreddit that's


---------19:24----------
called nofap


---------19:26----------
and basically i think all of us


---------19:30----------
realized because we tried to quit and


---------19:34----------
personally i looked at the nofap website


---------19:38----------
and i saw that there were like some


---------19:41----------
physical symptoms that people with


---------19:44----------
like abuse of masturbation had like for


---------19:47----------
example


---------19:48----------
um issues with


---------19:52----------
erections or um performing


---------19:55----------
um in bed with actual people in


---------19:59----------
contrast to master bedding on your own


---------20:02----------
or something like


---------20:06----------
a a fog in your mind that you can't


---------20:09----------
really think clearly from times to times


---------20:12----------
and i


---------20:12----------
basically checked like every single mark


---------20:16----------
or every box on that list and


---------20:19----------
yeah i thought it was um um


---------20:22----------
time to try and quit okay


---------20:26----------
when you say fog is that


---------20:29----------
during like is that like pretty constant


---------20:32----------
or is does that


---------20:33----------
change with fapping or not fapping


---------20:37----------
um before quitting i wasn't really sure


---------20:40----------
what it meant


---------20:40----------
but um basically when you


---------20:44----------
abstain from it like a longer time you


---------20:47----------
see that


---------20:48----------
for like a really long constant time


---------20:50----------
you've been thinking differently


---------20:52----------
and maybe you didn't have as much focus


---------20:56----------
in that time when you were like


---------20:58----------
relapsing every day or like a couple


---------21:00----------
times a day


---------21:02----------
so it was like a constant thing okay


---------21:04----------
great thanks for sharing


---------21:06----------
anybody else wanna chime in about how


---------21:09----------
they


---------21:09----------
figured out they were addicted sure um


---------21:13----------
to me i think like of porn as a escaping


---------21:16----------
tool


---------21:17----------
right and uh when thinking of any


---------21:20----------
escaping tool in my eyes


---------21:21----------
um you you see that you're using it


---------21:25----------
like if it helps you escape you you


---------21:27----------
understand if you're


---------21:28----------
spending hours like on twitch or youtube


---------21:30----------
or video games right


---------21:32----------
once you've done it for for a while


---------21:33----------
you're like okay


---------21:35----------
well i've been using this for a long


---------21:37----------
time i must be escaping right


---------21:39----------
and then it also comes to understanding


---------21:41----------
why you're using everything


---------21:43----------
so to me at least with porn it was like


---------21:46----------
i realized that i'm it's just a habit


---------21:49----------
anytime i


---------21:50----------
feel sad or stressed out i would use it


---------21:53----------
i would try to escape it


---------21:54----------
so once i realized that there was a


---------21:57----------
there was a


---------21:58----------
system right i guess stress i get


---------22:00----------
anxious i get sad i use


---------22:01----------
porn that's what i realized that like oh


---------22:05----------
i need it every time i i i get those


---------22:07----------
feelings


---------22:08----------
that's what i thought was addicting and


---------22:10----------
i try to deny it and then what also


---------22:12----------
proved it to me was


---------22:13----------
once i started nofap i couldn't deny it


---------22:17----------
i


---------22:17----------
i needed it when i felt those feelings


---------22:19----------
like when those feelings came back like


---------22:20----------
anxiety depression whatever right


---------22:22----------
whatever insecurities i had


---------22:24----------
and i didn't have that tool i felt i


---------22:27----------
felt horrible


---------22:28----------
i felt like i needed to escape and porn


---------22:30----------
is


---------22:31----------
easily the most instant gratification


---------22:34----------
for the least amount of work uh and it


---------22:37----------
also helps with relationships


---------22:39----------
like like um when you're insecure with


---------22:41----------
relationships and stuff


---------22:42----------
so it's a very common very common


---------22:44----------
escaping tool


---------22:46----------
bob i saw thanks a lot uh andy


---------22:51----------
thank you bob i i saw you nodding


---------22:53----------
emphatically at one point


---------22:56----------
yeah so uh i i


---------22:59----------
i was thinking that like when there's a


---------23:01----------
point where you can tell


---------23:03----------
that that your behavior and your life is


---------23:05----------
revolving around this thing and


---------23:09----------
you know that there's some component in


---------23:10----------
it that makes you feel better you're


---------23:12----------
hitting that


---------23:13----------
dopamine button over and over and over


---------23:15----------
again and


---------23:16----------
your for me it got bad to the point


---------23:19----------
where


---------23:20----------
a lot of lack of sleep watching it


---------23:22----------
consume my time and behavior


---------23:26----------
it got obvious to me but the only point


---------23:29----------
where i realized it was


---------23:30----------
that bad of an addiction is whenever the


---------23:33----------
idea was put in my mind that you could


---------23:35----------
try to quit


---------23:37----------
and that maybe this isn't good for you


---------23:39----------
you know


---------23:40----------
and like he said whenever you can't stop


---------23:42----------
you just know that this thing has


---------23:44----------
control over your your desire and your


---------23:47----------
behavior and it's


---------23:48----------
the effects are not you know just um


---------23:52----------
you know but trivial they're they're


---------23:55----------
they're pretty they've been pretty


---------23:57----------
serious


---------23:59----------
thanks for sharing that if i can add to


---------24:01----------
that for a second


---------24:03----------
um yeah it seems like um


---------24:06----------
when you relapse at least for me i don't


---------24:08----------
know if this is for anyone else


---------24:09----------
it feels like every like you're kind of


---------24:12----------
controlled by as as bob said it


---------24:14----------
kind of controls your like actions and


---------24:16----------
emotions and


---------24:18----------
you become someone else when for me i


---------24:20----------
become someone else


---------24:22----------
when i relapse my whole for me i mean


---------24:25----------
at best it's my whole day sometimes my


---------24:27----------
whole week


---------24:28----------
right like when i relapse because i


---------24:30----------
become it it like it controls me i feel


---------24:32----------
like i'm not myself that's why


---------24:34----------
i feel no fap is so great when you're on


---------24:36----------
it because i feel normal i guess is what


---------24:38----------
you say but


---------24:39----------
yeah i just want to add to that okay we


---------24:42----------
can talk about some of that


---------24:43----------
yeah the thing is for me when it started


---------24:46----------
when i discovered nofap it was just


---------24:48----------
i didn't have this realization that for


---------24:51----------
example


---------24:52----------
i how would you put it


---------24:55----------
it wasn't like i was in a deep mess it


---------24:57----------
was just like


---------24:59----------
purely for the religious purpose and so


---------25:04----------
um it just it was basically just this


---------25:07----------
and


---------25:08----------
having like a very big spiritual aspect


---------25:12----------
was for me a bit really big um helping


---------25:16----------
points


---------25:16----------
for trying to quit because i knew now i


---------25:21----------
i'm just i'm distancing myself from the


---------25:23----------
sin and i can be


---------25:25----------
i no longer have to be too much ashamed


---------25:28----------
of it


---------25:30----------
and really feeling like some


---------25:33----------
kind of spiritual or like big


---------25:36----------
meaning behind it and like some


---------25:38----------
connection to


---------25:40----------
gods and maybe nature


---------25:49----------
wait did he crash or is it just me yeah


---------25:51----------
i think


---------25:53----------
he lied out i gotta get scared


---------25:57----------
okay well we'll we'll come to back to


---------25:59----------
outside when


---------26:00----------
he's he's back with us um


---------26:03----------
anybody else kind of want to add how


---------26:06----------
they kind of


---------26:07----------
yeah go for it yeah so i'd say the way


---------26:09----------
that i found out that i was addicted was


---------26:11----------
it became routine


---------26:12----------
i would do it every day i would think


---------26:14----------
like do i even want to watch porn


---------26:15----------
tonight or like right now


---------26:17----------
i would think no and i would still do it


---------26:19----------
and i'd say an easy way for someone


---------26:21----------
watching to figure out


---------26:22----------
if they're addicted to porn is to try to


---------26:24----------
go let's say one week


---------26:26----------
two weeks without it and see if there's


---------26:29----------
any kind of like


---------26:30----------
you know want for it or desire and


---------26:33----------
like i have a friend who i bet 20 bucks


---------26:35----------
and he's pretty broke i bet 20 bucks


---------26:37----------
that he couldn't go two weeks without


---------26:38----------
you know watching porn


---------26:40----------
and he went like i think it was like six


---------26:41----------
or seven days so


---------26:43----------
i mean most people can't really go that


---------26:44----------
long without it so in my opinion that


---------26:46----------
means they're probably addicted


---------26:49----------
um what's what also plays like a role is


---------26:52----------
that it's not


---------26:53----------
it doesn't mean you don't have sexual


---------26:54----------
desires like for most of us


---------26:57----------
it it isn't even like a sexual thing


---------26:59----------
anymore


---------27:00----------
because um like


---------27:03----------
abstaining from porn doesn't mean you


---------27:06----------
can't like touch yourself


---------27:07----------
or have sexual thoughts or anything


---------27:10----------
but it's let's say purely the the pawn


---------27:14----------
that you're addicted to


---------27:15----------
some people try nofap which includes not


---------27:17----------
masturbating


---------27:18----------
but um like you can check if you're


---------27:21----------
addicted to pawn by just quitting pawn


---------27:23----------
and you can still have all the desires


---------27:26----------
that's like not


---------27:27----------
interesting yeah that that's a really


---------27:29----------
important point


---------27:30----------
i think so so it's it's not just the


---------27:33----------
masturbation


---------27:34----------
component or the orgasm component there


---------27:37----------
can be just a pure porn addiction where


---------27:39----------
you can still


---------27:40----------
have other kinds of sexual activity i


---------27:43----------
completely agree


---------27:44----------
um it it really seems like a dopamine


---------27:47----------
hijack


---------27:49----------
like the other stuff video game


---------27:50----------
addiction internet addiction


---------27:52----------
all that stuff it's just a different


---------27:53----------
flavor i think


---------27:57----------
great that's how i i think you uh cut


---------27:59----------
out there you were talking a little bit


---------28:01----------
yeah


---------28:02----------
yeah i'm sorry for that no problem


---------28:06----------
when did it cut out i think you were


---------28:08----------
talking a little bit about


---------28:09----------
sort of the the advantage of having sort


---------28:12----------
of a spiritual


---------28:13----------
component um something about a lack of


---------28:17----------
shame


---------28:18----------
that that helped you kind of overcome


---------28:19----------
shame yeah because it was


---------28:22----------
um at that time really like for me


---------28:26----------
a shameful thing and something in


---------28:28----------
general i didn't really


---------28:30----------
identify with even before like when all


---------28:33----------
the other


---------28:33----------
guys in my class would talk about porn


---------28:36----------
it was something i didn't like talking


---------28:38----------
about


---------28:39----------
and then when the religious aspect came


---------28:42----------
and said this is wrong and i need to


---------28:43----------
stop that was


---------28:44----------
something i could really identify with


---------28:46----------
and


---------28:48----------
as soon as i got over the first hurdles


---------28:51----------
like i always relapsed at day three


---------28:54----------
and then when i got over that hurdle it


---------28:56----------
just


---------28:57----------
flowed from there naturally and i just


---------29:00----------
felt


---------29:01----------
a real sense of pride of controlling


---------29:03----------
myself


---------29:04----------
and not engaging in this behavior i


---------29:06----------
don't want to be associated with


---------29:08----------
and so also the spiritual


---------29:11----------
aspect really helped me because i felt


---------29:13----------
like


---------29:15----------
it could be something because now i'm


---------29:18----------
atheist so things have changed since


---------29:21----------
then but


---------29:22----------
i would say i associated with nofap


---------29:26----------
something with a greater purpose like


---------29:28----------
being a


---------29:30----------
godly man and just having pride in


---------29:32----------
myself that i can


---------29:34----------
like i can take control over myself


---------29:37----------
which felt really good at that time


---------29:40----------
your religious journey sounds


---------29:42----------
fascinating outside


---------29:45----------
it's actually kinda um


---------29:48----------
[ __ ] up because it wasn't


---------29:51----------
i got into end time stuff and it was


---------29:55----------
actually kind of traumatizing because


---------29:59----------
at that time it shattered my whole world


---------30:01----------
view


---------30:02----------
and i was engaged in a lot of


---------30:03----------
conspiracies and


---------30:06----------
it's i'm in the i'm now really glad i'm


---------30:09----------
out of it because


---------30:10----------
it has gotten to a point where i cut


---------30:12----------
social ties with friends


---------30:14----------
i had but i kept


---------30:17----------
the nofap stuff because i know that it


---------30:20----------
isn't just


---------30:21----------
religious bogus there's actually science


---------30:23----------
behind it and


---------30:25----------
yeah cool sounds like a fascinating


---------30:28----------
story maybe for another day


---------30:31----------
um so do y'all wanna talk a little bit


---------30:35----------
about the harmful


---------30:36----------
effects of of being addicted to


---------30:38----------
pornography


---------30:39----------
um i've got an idea about like uh


---------30:42----------
addiction i just was the


---------30:43----------
last person to talk about go forward um


---------30:45----------
so


---------30:46----------
based on what otsa said um essentially i


---------30:50----------
view addiction in general as a spiritual


---------30:53----------
malady i was talking about this with bob


---------30:55----------
and a couple others uh last night and


---------30:58----------
what i view addiction is is it's a


---------31:01----------
spiritual malady in the sense that


---------31:03----------
there's a so this is a very catholic


---------31:05----------
interpretation of things but everybody


---------31:06----------
has a god-shaped hole in their heart and


---------31:09----------
everybody tries to fill it with


---------31:11----------
something else whether it be porn


---------31:13----------
or drugs or alcohol everybody has


---------31:15----------
something


---------31:16----------
which they need and what religion


---------31:19----------
and spirituality tells us is what we


---------31:21----------
need is the divine so


---------31:22----------
brahmacarya uh with saud guru said is


---------31:26----------
that it's one


---------31:26----------
on the path to the divine and it is the


---------31:29----------
pursuit of joy


---------31:30----------
instead of the pursuit of pleasure and


---------31:32----------
just add on what everybody else was


---------31:33----------
saying


---------31:34----------
um i'd say that if you


---------31:37----------
if you my biggest definition of


---------31:39----------
addiction is if you try to stop


---------31:42----------
but you find that you cannot that's


---------31:44----------
addiction


---------31:45----------
like the the harmful effects and


---------31:46----------
everything else comes later


---------31:48----------
it might not be there right now but if


---------31:50----------
you try to stop and you can't so try to


---------31:51----------
go a week


---------31:52----------
without uh fapping and if you can't you


---------31:55----------
might be an addict


---------31:57----------
okay yeah that i think that's go ahead


---------32:02----------
annie yep i think uh


---------32:05----------
for me addiction is


---------32:09----------
i just had a brain fart i'm sorry um


---------32:18----------
i think you were about to say something


---------32:19----------
about what your understanding of


---------32:20----------
addiction was or how you define it


---------32:23----------
yeah i just forgot what my point was


---------32:24----------
gonna be no problem i'm sure it'll come


---------32:26----------
back up um


---------32:28----------
i'll let you know so um let's think a


---------32:31----------
little bit about


---------32:32----------
so we can talk about addiction as a


---------32:34----------
spiritual malady maybe towards the end


---------32:36----------
and just how we understand


---------32:37----------
yeah uh i figured out um why i think


---------32:40----------
porn addiction is so


---------32:41----------
bad is because it's a instant


---------32:43----------
gratification tool


---------32:45----------
you're doing pretty much minimal work


---------32:50----------
in seconds or minutes or whatever and


---------32:53----------
you're getting


---------32:54----------
the one of the biggest dopamine effects


---------32:55----------
as you can


---------32:57----------
from from uh you know pleasure like


---------32:59----------
sexual pleasure


---------33:01----------
um and i think that's very toxic to


---------33:04----------
because it kind of sucks you into like


---------33:06----------
not put any work


---------33:08----------
and uh get instant gratification for it


---------33:11----------
unlike with like going out and searching


---------33:14----------
for


---------33:14----------
for like a partner and uh having a


---------33:17----------
relationship with them an intimate


---------33:18----------
relationship and


---------33:19----------
having sex as a connection rather than


---------33:23----------
just


---------33:23----------
an instant gratification tool i think


---------33:24----------
that's what's horrible about porn


---------33:26----------
addiction


---------33:26----------
or even you know even trying attempting


---------33:30----------
to


---------33:31----------
you know deal with those thoughts and


---------33:32----------
emotions about how to relate to other


---------33:34----------
people


---------33:35----------
to connect with other people you know


---------33:37----------
it's just much easier to just


---------33:39----------
have this compulsion and desire and then


---------33:41----------
that goes away


---------33:45----------
yeah we'll definitely get to that


---------33:48----------
um i i think in terms of how to move


---------33:51----------
forward i'm going to kind of table some


---------33:53----------
of those ideas about


---------33:54----------
what addiction is and and how we


---------33:56----------
understand it


---------33:58----------
what would you guys say are the harmful


---------34:00----------
effects


---------34:01----------
of uh porn addiction


---------34:06----------
um there's one thing i i'm still like


---------34:09----------
really worried about which is


---------34:10----------
um over sexualization which means that


---------34:14----------
um whenever i'm at like a bus stop


---------34:18----------
and i see like attractive


---------34:22----------
women um my


---------34:25----------
head goes right into like sexual


---------34:28----------
fantasies


---------34:28----------
and stuff like that um and i don't


---------34:32----------
like i don't have sexual desires at that


---------34:35----------
point


---------34:35----------
basically like i'm not horny but um


---------34:39----------
i fantasize instantly and


---------34:42----------
um like


---------34:45----------
that can even mess with friendships


---------34:48----------
for example that you just can't see


---------34:52----------
a person that like likes you for who you


---------34:56----------
are


---------34:57----------
other than as like this object


---------35:00----------
and it sucks because i know that


---------35:04----------
um it's not right and i'm


---------35:07----------
kind of being addicted to that person


---------35:10----------
but i have no


---------35:11----------
way of um like it's not like uh


---------35:15----------
there's no off switch to that it's just


---------35:17----------
like a like a mode my mind goes into


---------35:20----------
when i see attractive people


---------35:24----------
so i wanted there was also yeah if i


---------35:26----------
could just say one


---------35:28----------
yeah okay go ahead real quick outside so


---------35:31----------
i want to just


---------35:32----------
highlight something that we'll get back


---------35:33----------
to so i want you guys to notice for a


---------35:36----------
second that


---------35:37----------
what flow is saying is that he says he's


---------35:40----------
being a dick


---------35:42----------
but i don't think that that's accurate


---------35:45----------
so what's happening is that flow's mind


---------35:48----------
is automatically doing like so he's like


---------35:50----------
he laid it out pretty well right so


---------35:52----------
his mind automatically turns on a


---------35:54----------
particular program


---------35:56----------
whenever he gets it gets exposed to


---------35:58----------
certain stimuli


---------36:00----------
and flow himself doesn't want to think


---------36:02----------
those thoughts and he's not even horny


---------36:04----------
so if we think about like horniness


---------36:06----------
horniness is sort of like a


---------36:08----------
um you know it's sort of like a whole


---------36:10----------
being kind of thing


---------36:12----------
right and and what we can notice in flow


---------36:15----------
is that his mind has a certain kind of


---------36:17----------
like automaticity to it


---------36:18----------
that he himself is not happy about but


---------36:21----------
that's not flow


---------36:22----------
that's just the way his mind has been


---------36:25----------
programmed


---------36:26----------
and we'll kind of get to that more but


---------36:29----------
outside go ahead sorry


---------36:31----------
yeah concerning the it's like the


---------36:34----------
objectification of women is definitely a


---------36:36----------
big part of


---------36:37----------
porn and i saw that with a lot of my


---------36:40----------
friends at the time


---------36:42----------
and it was also something which i wasn't


---------36:44----------
really


---------36:46----------
like usually it's it would be considered


---------36:49----------
normal but it was


---------36:51----------
sometimes with my friends they would


---------36:52----------
talk just too much about how


---------36:55----------
like the body of a girl looks and how


---------36:57----------
nice it is but they would never talk


---------36:59----------
about


---------37:00----------
like the human aspect of a girl and when


---------37:03----------
i got


---------37:03----------
into my long streaks that definitely


---------37:05----------
started for me when i could really go


---------37:08----------
there was the first time i really


---------37:10----------
started to have friendships


---------37:11----------
with girls and not just have a


---------37:14----------
sexual interest in them it's like there


---------37:17----------
but


---------37:17----------
it's you start to develop more a


---------37:20----------
holistic view of


---------37:22----------
a woman of girls you see more the


---------37:24----------
personality because at some point


---------37:27----------
for me it was like every girl looked


---------37:29----------
that good that the


---------37:31----------
only thing that would like


---------37:34----------
is now differentiating them would be the


---------37:37----------
personality


---------37:39----------
and it feels kind of nicer to not just


---------37:43----------
look at the body but also start seeing


---------37:46----------
women as humans more which was for me


---------37:50----------
not the case before all of that how do


---------37:53----------
the rest of you all feel about what atai


---------37:54----------
is saying


---------37:55----------
i totally agree yeah um yes i feel like


---------37:58----------
porn makes you objectify women a lot and


---------38:00----------
once you're on nofap


---------38:01----------
for me at least it felt like i could


---------38:03----------
have like just a normal conversation


---------38:04----------
with a girl without


---------38:05----------
thinking anything or you know just


---------38:07----------
viewing them as a human you know


---------38:09----------
so what i think it is is a um a kind of


---------38:11----------
perceptual distortion


---------38:13----------
because there's that connection with the


---------38:15----------
dopamine


---------38:17----------
thing it's like um it's almost like it


---------38:20----------
it primes for that


---------38:21----------
and whenever you're taking that away


---------38:24----------
yeah and pouring conditions you for that


---------38:27----------
i mean no one


---------38:28----------
no one ever just goes on the porn site


---------38:30----------
and looks for


---------38:31----------
personality traits or something it's


---------38:33----------
just um


---------38:35----------
like it's just like body parts


---------38:38----------
and not a whole human that's the


---------38:41----------
category makes you feel at home


---------38:43----------
yeah and it's also the problem that has


---------38:46----------
gotten really


---------38:47----------
specific and it is also


---------38:50----------
tied to the desensitization with porn


---------38:53----------
addiction


---------38:55----------
with you needing more and more extreme


---------38:58----------
stuff


---------38:59----------
like i think for any one of us the stuff


---------39:02----------
you view at the beginning


---------39:03----------
doesn't stay the same and for some


---------39:05----------
people it gets


---------39:06----------
really extreme and i think that's why


---------39:09----------
there are these


---------39:10----------
like categories of stuff which you would


---------39:13----------
never


---------39:14----------
do in real life because


---------39:17----------
like the porn industry is just out for


---------39:20----------
profit


---------39:21----------
and if people are desensitized to the


---------39:24----------
stuff that is already there they need to


---------39:26----------
produce


---------39:26----------
more extreme stuff and that is also


---------39:29----------
a site of porn addiction which can be


---------39:31----------
really harmful that you are


---------39:32----------
training your brain to only become like


---------39:36----------
attracted to certain things which are


---------39:39----------
really


---------39:40----------
far from normality fantastical even


---------39:44----------
i i think that's a great point um i do


---------39:47----------
think that porn


---------39:48----------
um kind of builds a lie


---------39:51----------
on what sex is supposed to be and


---------39:55----------
i feel like it's kind of porn has kind


---------39:57----------
of been integrated in the culture


---------39:59----------
more where we kind of kind of view sex


---------40:01----------
more as a transaction


---------40:02----------
rather than a connection and i think


---------40:05----------
that's a big


---------40:06----------
big problem that porn builds and um


---------40:10----------
yeah i guess that's my point so can i


---------40:12----------
ask a little bit like of an off-topic


---------40:14----------
question that may be a


---------40:15----------
a touch controversial sure


---------40:18----------
sure so there are communities on the


---------40:21----------
internet


---------40:22----------
that actually actively try


---------40:25----------
to do the opposite of what you guys are


---------40:27----------
describing which is to view women


---------40:30----------
to view relationships with women as


---------40:32----------
transactional


---------40:34----------
um to think about women actively


---------40:37----------
teach and advocate for a view that does


---------40:40----------
not


---------40:41----------
view women as people but as like so i'm


---------40:43----------
thinking predominantly of communities


---------40:45----------
like red pill


---------40:46----------
are you all familiar with red pill yeah


---------40:48----------
yeah yeah


---------40:49----------
uh so does somebody want to explain what


---------40:51----------
red pill is


---------40:53----------
as far as i know it's just basically


---------40:57----------
there's a lot of they have the i think


---------40:59----------
they have the thoughts from


---------41:00----------
evolution and they think that there are


---------41:03----------
just certain evolutionary aspects that


---------41:05----------
make a man attractive


---------41:07----------
like status money and


---------41:11----------
all that stuff and they are really into


---------41:14----------
gaming


---------41:14----------
or daytime game where they try to figure


---------41:17----------
out the perfect way to approach women


---------41:19----------
and to get just the they try to figure


---------41:22----------
out the perfect way to


---------41:24----------
convince women to have sex with them but


---------41:27----------
also


---------41:27----------
not in the long term because they also


---------41:29----------
think that women have the


---------41:31----------
polygamous nature and they also are


---------41:34----------
just out for resources


---------41:39----------
and not very like relationship on the


---------41:42----------
human to human level


---------41:44----------
it's just very animalistic thinking i


---------41:46----------
would say it sounds like an online


---------41:48----------
fraternity


---------41:50----------
yeah that's a great way to describe it


---------41:53----------
so so like


---------41:54----------
negative yeah so what do you guys think


---------41:56----------
about that


---------41:58----------
it's [ __ ] up why


---------42:02----------
um you're making the woman literally


---------42:05----------
objects in their eyes


---------42:06----------
and they're not only doing it for


---------42:07----------
themselves but they're actually teaching


---------42:09----------
it to others


---------42:10----------
and spreading that toxic mindset


---------42:14----------
but what's what's wrong with that i know


---------42:16----------
it sounds like a weird question


---------42:18----------
but um kind of like they were saying


---------42:20----------
earlier i mean


---------42:21----------
women are people too it sounds funny to


---------42:23----------
say it like that but they're people as


---------42:24----------
well like they're not


---------42:26----------
you know they're not like a you know


---------42:27----------
just a way to have sex or you know an


---------42:30----------
emotional like


---------42:31----------
i don't know like island or whatever but


---------42:33----------
they're actual people who have feelings


---------42:35----------
and you know it can hurt somebody to


---------42:38----------
just take advantage of somebody


---------42:40----------
just to have sex like the idea with the


---------42:42----------
red red pill a lot of times is


---------42:44----------
uh i see a girl you know i have sex you


---------42:48----------
know i


---------42:48----------
pretend that i really like her and want


---------42:50----------
to be with her and then i have sex and


---------42:52----------
then i dump her


---------42:53----------
and that idea is absolutely [ __ ] up


---------42:55----------
that's just using somebody as a means to


---------42:57----------
an


---------42:58----------
end and not an end of itself


---------43:01----------
i think there's a lot of uh resentment


---------43:04----------
and fear of loss


---------43:05----------
in there that you know i can't be loved


---------43:09----------
for just being me


---------43:10----------
like it has to be status or money or


---------43:12----------
whatever


---------43:17----------
yeah it's just a very simple way of


---------43:18----------
looking at you know it's easy


---------43:20----------
oh um yeah as that was actually exactly


---------43:23----------
what i was about to say it's a very


---------43:25----------
simplistic view


---------43:26----------
of human relations um and using


---------43:29----------
like evolutionary psychology is still a


---------43:31----------
burgeoning field and we still don't know


---------43:33----------
everything


---------43:33----------
but the thing about the red pill is that


---------43:35----------
they say that they are an authority on


---------43:37----------
this so


---------43:38----------
as you were saying earlier uh the actual


---------43:40----------
ideology


---------43:41----------
is men are polygamous which means they


---------43:44----------
try to find as many women as possible


---------43:46----------
and


---------43:46----------
essentially spread the seed and have as


---------43:48----------
many as have as many men or have so


---------43:50----------
sorry


---------43:51----------
have as many women as possible um and


---------43:54----------
impregnate as many women as possible and


---------43:55----------
women are hypergamous


---------43:57----------
which means they try to find the


---------43:59----------
top-tier man


---------44:00----------
in their lives um and try to get


---------44:03----------
impregnated by that


---------44:04----------
person but it really and completely


---------44:06----------
sidelines


---------44:08----------
the entire emotional process behind


---------44:11----------
relationships


---------44:12----------
and it's all about tricks and it seems


---------44:14----------
like devious and


---------44:16----------
it by itself is part of the seduction


---------44:17----------
community and


---------44:19----------
it's it in itself is basically like


---------44:21----------
saying you


---------44:22----------
are a beta and we are chads


---------44:26----------
so we know what's best um so in order to


---------44:28----------
have sex


---------44:29----------
you need to listen to what chad said


---------44:32----------
that's essentially what it is and it's


---------44:33----------
very intoxicating how they recruit


---------44:36----------
what do you guys think that that people


---------44:38----------
who are a fan of red pill philosophy


---------44:40----------
would say about y'all


---------44:43----------
that we're weak yeah that we are blue


---------44:45----------
pills


---------44:46----------
yeah or beta so for what it actually is


---------44:51----------
i think also are you all simps is that


---------44:54----------
an


---------44:54----------
another no it could be a symbol


---------44:58----------
it's a little bit different i would say


---------45:00----------
i i'm


---------45:01----------
so what do you guys think about that are


---------45:03----------
you weak i'm just kind of


---------45:04----------
i'm just kind of annoyed by all of the


---------45:06----------
language period


---------45:08----------
like it suffuses the internet like


---------45:11----------
honestly i it annoys me and i don't


---------45:15----------
care really because i try to treat


---------45:18----------
people on an individual basis


---------45:19----------
but it's still there nonetheless


---------45:23----------
and you can turn it around i would say


---------45:26----------
like most of the time with these red


---------45:28----------
pill guys they don't invest


---------45:30----------
emotions into the relationships and they


---------45:32----------
try to stay


---------45:34----------
away from that and i don't want to get


---------45:36----------
hurt i would say


---------45:37----------
in these short-term pleasures because


---------45:40----------
you you can


---------45:41----------
you can keep like a fantasy alive and


---------45:44----------
just have the


---------45:45----------
not the thought of like a


---------45:48----------
woman that is not a human but more like


---------45:51----------
a


---------45:52----------
status symbol and a number you can say


---------45:54----------
like how


---------45:55----------
many girls you have slept with and


---------45:58----------
i would say there's a lot of emotional


---------46:00----------
detachment from these guys because


---------46:03----------
i think many of them have been hurt in


---------46:05----------
the past and they just just don't want


---------46:07----------
that to happen again


---------46:10----------
yeah i agree our problem was that we


---------46:13----------
didn't want to


---------46:14----------
face our emotions so we use porn as an


---------46:16----------
escape


---------46:17----------
and with the red pill the idea is


---------46:19----------
there's no emotional aspect to


---------46:21----------
talking to women so there's no reason to


---------46:23----------
have to worry about facing emotions it's


---------46:25----------
kind of like exactly what we're trying


---------46:26----------
to avoid it's like it's very like


---------46:27----------
stimulus response


---------46:29----------
it's like not emotional at all it's like


---------46:31----------
i'm trying to get


---------46:32----------
these inputs if i were to i mean i'm


---------46:35----------
going to draw kind of uh


---------46:37----------
yeah go for it uh i was gonna i was


---------46:40----------
gonna say for me personally


---------46:41----------
um i'm still trying to think like


---------46:46----------
is it wrong to be overly sexual because


---------46:48----------
because i've had a sexual relationship


---------46:50----------
before right


---------46:51----------
sexual transactions i would say and the


---------46:53----------
girls


---------46:54----------
in those relationships they didn't mind


---------46:55----------
they wanted to be a transaction


---------46:57----------
but at the end of it i felt emo


---------47:00----------
emotionally not completed


---------47:01----------
like i didn't feel fulfilled emotionally


---------47:03----------
and that's what


---------47:04----------
really strayed me away from just having


---------47:06----------
transactions as i was calling with girls


---------47:09----------
but they didn't mind so i'm like well if


---------47:11----------
they don't mind


---------47:12----------
why is this so wrong so i think i'm kind


---------47:15----------
of neutral on the topic


---------47:16----------
um i do think the internet has made it


---------47:19----------
very


---------47:20----------
easy to over sexualize and


---------47:23----------
you know build kind of societies or


---------47:25----------
whatever like red pill


---------47:27----------
um i think it's a i think it's a side


---------47:30----------
effect of the internet but i might be


---------47:32----------
wrong


---------47:33----------
and how kind of culture and porn since


---------47:35----------
it's so accessible how it's integrated


---------47:37----------
in the culture


---------47:40----------
so if i'm hearing you guys it's


---------47:42----------
interesting because i think moon was


---------47:43----------
sort of suggesting that


---------47:46----------
emotional hurt and the avoidance of


---------47:50----------
emotional hurt basically has like a


---------47:52----------
couple of strategies one is that you can


---------47:54----------
become addicted to porn and that allows


---------47:55----------
you to have an escape


---------47:57----------
the other is that you can actively and


---------47:59----------
intentionally sort of objectify women


---------48:01----------
remove emotional emotional stuff


---------48:05----------
from uh relationships and it kind of


---------48:07----------
becoming transactional


---------48:09----------
it almost sounds to me like like you


---------48:10----------
know there's a fork in the road


---------48:13----------
and and you know a common like a 13 year


---------48:16----------
old kid on the internet could


---------48:18----------
wind up like start in one place and


---------48:20----------
could wind up


---------48:22----------
in any number of communities that share


---------48:24----------
a common route


---------48:25----------
what do you guys think about that


---------48:26----------
absolutely absolutely


---------48:29----------
i think i agree interesting so


---------48:32----------
once again maybe a conversation for a


---------48:34----------
different day because we have


---------48:36----------
um you know a couple of other things so


---------48:39----------
like


---------48:40----------
yeah may i add two two little things


---------48:42----------
first of all


---------48:43----------
um i know we are all guys here but


---------48:46----------
i've read online that girls have similar


---------48:49----------
issues


---------48:49----------
some girls so if you are like a girl


---------48:51----------
watching this stream


---------48:53----------
it's not only guys that have been


---------48:55----------
addicted to pornography masturbation


---------48:58----------
and the other thing is i don't think we


---------49:01----------
are really


---------49:02----------
i mean i think we are weak like


---------49:05----------
on like the emotional aspect because we


---------49:08----------
still like


---------49:09----------
need that numbing effect but when


---------49:13----------
i see chats i would suspect


---------49:16----------
uh use red bull i always think like at


---------49:18----------
least we


---------49:20----------
are conscious of it and we are actively


---------49:23----------
trying to


---------49:24----------
fight against it and we are like one


---------49:27----------
step ahead of them


---------49:30----------
so what i've heard too is let's say i


---------49:31----------
was 16 years old when i first started


---------49:33----------
watching porn all the time


---------49:35----------
and let's say for the last you know


---------49:36----------
let's say six years let's say i'm 22 now


---------49:38----------
i've watched porn every day i'm pretty


---------49:41----------
much like


---------49:42----------
emotionally i'm still 16 years old


---------49:44----------
because i


---------49:45----------
never really faced any emotions since i


---------49:47----------
was 16.


---------49:48----------
so i never really grew up in that sense


---------49:50----------
that's kind of a common problem i've


---------49:51----------
seen with some people


---------49:55----------
yeah i want to talk a lot i mean this is


---------49:57----------
something that i've been writing a lot


---------49:58----------
about about how like


---------50:00----------
um is a community like we're stunted


---------50:03----------
developmentally like we get stuck


---------50:07----------
sometimes in terms of our growth and


---------50:09----------
it's it's almost like we stall


---------50:11----------
and i've been thinking a lot about how


---------50:13----------
to help people like get unstuck


---------50:15----------
i don't think i get that could you


---------50:17----------
elaborate that a bit


---------50:19----------
yeah so it's a half form thought um


---------50:21----------
annie first of all


---------50:22----------
but basically like you know moon was


---------50:24----------
saying that


---------50:26----------
he feels like he like when he started


---------50:28----------
watching porn every day like he didn't


---------50:30----------
continue to develop as a human being


---------50:32----------
like even at the age of 22 he sort of


---------50:34----------
still has the emotional


---------50:37----------
like his his you know emotional skill


---------50:40----------
level hasn't leveled up at all so he's


---------50:42----------
like stuck


---------50:43----------
at like level five or whatever he wasn't


---------50:45----------
so he hasn't been gaining any xp


---------50:48----------
and just as a community i think we tend


---------50:51----------
to get developmentally stuck in a lot of


---------50:53----------
ways like


---------50:54----------
in terms of the development of our


---------50:55----------
social skills in terms of our ability to


---------50:58----------
understand and manage our emotions


---------51:01----------
in terms of expectations that we have


---------51:03----------
for ourselves in terms of like really


---------51:05----------
really simple stuff like


---------51:06----------
how to plan and execute tasks


---------51:10----------
i i think as a community we're sort of


---------51:12----------
developmentally stunted like i think we


---------51:13----------
don't have good role models


---------51:15----------
so um you know recently we had a we had


---------51:18----------
a couple weeks ago we had a group of


---------51:19----------
female gamers who came on and i think


---------51:22----------
that like the the men that they interact


---------51:24----------
with online like


---------51:25----------
don't know how else to act


---------51:30----------
can i say something because i actually


---------51:33----------
wrote an


---------51:34----------
exam on it today in developmental


---------51:36----------
psychology


---------51:37----------
and i read something from


---------51:41----------
1973 and


---------51:43----------
it was like psychoanalytic stuff but it


---------51:46----------
basically talked about that


---------51:47----------
the adolescence phase like between 12


---------51:51----------
and 20 is the time where the sexuality


---------51:54----------
really develops


---------51:55----------
and because like today


---------51:59----------
in the text he says that in this time


---------52:01----------
you seek


---------52:02----------
for like sexual like


---------52:05----------
sexuality in your peer group and girls


---------52:08----------
in school and stuff like that


---------52:10----------
but at that time no one has the


---------52:14----------
idea of internet porn and in


---------52:17----------
psychonautic theory the


---------52:19----------
reality principle is really important


---------52:21----------
where you have to adapt to


---------52:22----------
your reality and i think with


---------52:26----------
online stuff and especially porn and


---------52:29----------
video games you can really escape into


---------52:32----------
another world and i think your


---------52:34----------
the human brain doesn't grasp the idea


---------52:38----------
of virtual reality and so


---------52:40----------
because there are when you go out and


---------52:42----------
want to


---------52:43----------
like get a girlfriend there are so much


---------52:47----------
more


---------52:47----------
challenges you have to overcome and you


---------52:50----------
have to go through


---------52:52----------
difficult feelings like feeling


---------52:55----------
sometimes worthless or unlovable and you


---------52:57----------
don't


---------52:57----------
experience these things with porn and


---------52:59----------
you don't go through these little


---------53:01----------
crises and so i think that is something


---------53:05----------
really important on the developmental


---------53:08----------
side that


---------53:09----------
there are so many more ways to just


---------53:11----------
escape the


---------53:12----------
usual normal um developmental


---------53:16----------
tasks a human has to go through


---------53:21----------
yeah absolutely that's a great point i


---------53:23----------
think we're


---------53:24----------
we're developmentally stunted for sure


---------53:27----------
is a community


---------53:29----------
um so let's kind of


---------53:32----------
shift gears a little bit so like you


---------53:35----------
guys were kind of


---------53:36----------
a common theme that's come up and and


---------53:38----------
even in terms of like the red pillars


---------53:40----------
in their emotional detachment we've


---------53:41----------
talked about escapism


---------53:43----------
we've talked about numbness and numbing


---------53:45----------
feelings


---------53:46----------
and we've also talked a little bit about


---------53:49----------
um how nofap


---------53:50----------
tends to bring out feelings


---------53:53----------
so can you guys explain to us a little


---------53:56----------
bit about like


---------53:58----------
you know what is it that you that porn


---------54:00----------
helped you escape from


---------54:01----------
how did it help you escape and then


---------54:03----------
we'll kind of cover


---------54:04----------
what happens when you stop escaping


---------54:09----------
um i think it's uh i think it's all


---------54:12----------
right uh


---------54:13----------
i think it's a a good point to kind of


---------54:16----------
base off from flo what he said


---------54:18----------
i think porn gives a a one-sided


---------54:20----------
relationship


---------54:21----------
so for me i try and escape my horrible


---------54:24----------
relationship with my parents


---------54:26----------
which was not obviously sexual but um


---------54:30----------
it was it was a very toxic uh horrible


---------54:32----------
relationship


---------54:34----------
um very abusive and uh porn kind of


---------54:37----------
doesn't have the other person to talk to


---------54:40----------
just kind of


---------54:41----------
you get what you want you you get


---------54:42----------
exactly what you want in seconds and


---------54:46----------
yeah in regards to


---------54:49----------
numbing um like one of the first things


---------54:53----------
i told my psychologist


---------54:55----------
um the way i feel when i


---------54:58----------
watch porn i have no idea what time it


---------55:02----------
is


---------55:02----------
i don't even know how much time i spend


---------55:04----------
on the computer


---------55:05----------
at that point i um


---------55:09----------
i have like tunnel vision into my pc


---------55:12----------
like i don't even notice anything around


---------55:14----------
me


---------55:15----------
which


---------55:19----------
basically shows itself when i um when my


---------55:22----------
place is like really


---------55:23----------
um


---------55:27----------
like dirty and i didn't like make my bed


---------55:30----------
or something like that


---------55:32----------
um because i would just like


---------55:35----------
watch my pc only and nothing else


---------55:39----------
and um while i'm watching porn i


---------55:43----------
have no worries i don't think about any


---------55:46----------
stressful thing


---------55:47----------
i have no anxiety like it was pretty


---------55:49----------
hard not to


---------55:50----------
watch porn today because i was so


---------55:52----------
nervous to be


---------55:54----------
here and um


---------55:57----------
it just like helps with like every


---------56:00----------
feeling you want to numb basically


---------56:03----------
it's got you it's like you have like


---------56:04----------
this little bubble like this little safe


---------56:07----------
little safe bubble of pleasure that like


---------56:10----------
everything outside of it is just not


---------56:11----------
there


---------56:14----------
i had a circuit oh okay


---------56:17----------
um i did this was i just needed to get


---------56:19----------
this off my mind because i'd say that a


---------56:21----------
lot of what


---------56:22----------
uh buddhism talks about is the


---------56:25----------
renunciation of the ego


---------56:27----------
and pornography is essentially


---------56:30----------
that uh heightening of the ego and a lot


---------56:33----------
of


---------56:34----------
uh drugs and psychic uh you know


---------56:37----------
things can also heighten the ego in this


---------56:39----------
way i would say that porn is a


---------56:40----------
maladaptive


---------56:42----------
coping mechanism first of all and it is


---------56:44----------
also


---------56:45----------
in a sense the worship of the self with


---------56:47----------
a harem of imaginary woman


---------56:50----------
and your brain really does not know the


---------56:52----------
difference so every time you masturbate


---------56:53----------
to a fantasy


---------56:55----------
um uh it can cause and i mean there are


---------56:57----------
symptoms


---------56:58----------
like low brain performance brain fog


---------57:00----------
memory issues


---------57:01----------
when you masturbate because of that like


---------57:03----------
refraction period


---------57:04----------
where it says your brain is telling you


---------57:06----------
or your body is telling you you have


---------57:08----------
orgasm


---------57:09----------
you can now just relax and do nothing


---------57:11----------
and i would say


---------57:13----------
last point that my emotional issues


---------57:16----------
kind of stem from like not really ever


---------57:18----------
having like a good sexual relationship


---------57:20----------
i'm 22 right now i've never been in a


---------57:21----------
sexual relationship


---------57:22----------
let alone a relationship with with a


---------57:24----------
girl and i'm courting this girl right


---------57:26----------
now and every time she doesn't respond i


---------57:28----------
know she works a lot


---------57:29----------
i'm just like oh she's not responding uh


---------57:32----------
my brain is just like go find another


---------57:34----------
woman to talk to and for me it was just


---------57:36----------
always


---------57:37----------
porn and that numbed my feelings for the


---------57:40----------
longest time


---------57:41----------
i would say i'm emotionally stunted um


---------57:43----------
like moon was saying


---------57:44----------
i'm still stuck in the mind of basically


---------57:46----------
like an 11 year old because that's when


---------57:48----------
i started using


---------57:49----------
um every time you masturbate to escape


---------57:52----------
a feeling i would say it's a maladaptive


---------57:55----------
coping mechanism


---------57:57----------
and it can cause serious harm to your


---------57:59----------
brain and


---------58:00----------
going on nofap and stopping fapping


---------58:03----------
allows your brain to return to normal


---------58:05----------
that symptomology


---------58:06----------
slowly but surely disappears


---------58:10----------
moon i saw you nodding and smiling at


---------58:13----------
some point too


---------58:15----------
yeah um going off of what you said


---------58:17----------
earlier too is easy is


---------58:18----------
uh almost like you know we have the hole


---------58:21----------
in our heart like a god shaped hole as


---------58:22----------
you described it


---------58:24----------
and filling that with porn is an easy


---------58:26----------
way to like


---------58:27----------
it's almost like a band-aid you know you


---------58:29----------
don't heal that hole or you don't fill


---------58:30----------
it with anything


---------58:31----------
you know worth while but you cover it up


---------58:34----------
and kind of ignore it for a while


---------58:36----------
and it builds up and um for me


---------58:39----------
what [ __ ] kind of comes up whenever uh


---------58:41----------
whenever i like


---------58:42----------
you know get into a streak is kind of


---------58:44----------
like usually what i would use it to uh


---------58:47----------
like numb was like feeling lonely or uh


---------58:50----------
depressed


---------58:51----------
and you know i wouldn't feel alone


---------58:53----------
whenever my brain thought i had a


---------58:54----------
partner on a screen


---------58:56----------
so you know i could go to bed and i'd


---------58:58----------
you know fall asleep just fine because


---------58:59----------
i'd be like you know


---------59:00----------
my brain thinks i have a partner and i


---------59:03----------
kind of just [ __ ] with the entire


---------59:04----------
wiring of my head and how


---------59:05----------
my brain thinks of things and [ __ ] like


---------59:07----------
that


---------59:10----------
so let me ask you guys a question why is


---------59:13----------
it so


---------59:13----------
hard to have a hole


---------59:18----------
in you right like i don't know how else


---------59:21----------
to ask question but like


---------59:22----------
we're using this kind of terminology


---------59:24----------
that you have you have this like hole in


---------59:26----------
your heart that


---------59:27----------
is in the shape of god so like what


---------59:30----------
makes


---------59:31----------
like why is that a bad situation like


---------59:33----------
why does some


---------59:34----------
like you know what about your life has


---------59:36----------
is intolerable


---------59:38----------
so that you read this in the first place


---------59:40----------
yeah i've heard describe also like being


---------59:41----------
like a shell of a person


---------59:43----------
and like you almost feel empty inside


---------59:45----------
it's kind of like a similar idea to that


---------59:46----------
i mean you don't want to feel empty


---------59:47----------
inside or a shell of a person you want


---------59:49----------
to be


---------59:49----------
your whole true self and so what what


---------59:52----------
makes like what is that feeling of being


---------59:54----------
a shell of a person i like that


---------59:55----------
terminology a lot


---------59:59----------
um it's almost like just living life on


---------60:01----------
autopilot you just kind of like you know


---------60:03----------
you wake up


---------60:04----------
you do your your [ __ ] you kind of don't


---------60:06----------
really think about things you're kind of


---------60:07----------
like in a constant state of like being


---------60:09----------
almost like


---------60:10----------
i guess sedated in a way not really


---------60:12----------
sedated but like you're not really


---------60:13----------
checked into


---------60:14----------
reality you're kind of like living it's


---------60:16----------
like the brain fog like we were saying


---------60:17----------
earlier


---------60:18----------
you're not really like seeing clarity


---------60:20----------
and you're not like trying to improve


---------60:21----------
yourself


---------60:22----------
you're kind of like it's like


---------60:23----------
surrendering and being okay with being


---------60:25----------
less than normal


---------60:26----------
and like you know i'm not happy with


---------60:28----------
where i'm at


---------60:29----------
but because i use porn every day i can


---------60:32----------
ignore that and


---------60:34----------
i i'm okay even though on the inside i'm


---------60:37----------
[ __ ] up on the outside i can be okay


---------60:41----------
i um i feel like while you're


---------60:44----------
um relapsing like oh well you


---------60:48----------
addicted you don't really notice that


---------60:50----------
whole like at all


---------60:51----------
like um you think it's


---------60:54----------
like you're fine and your emotional


---------60:56----------
state is like really fine but once you


---------60:58----------
quit


---------60:59----------
you just realize that there is a hole


---------61:02----------
and um


---------61:03----------
because you have been like numbing your


---------61:06----------
emotions for


---------61:07----------
such a long time it is even harder to


---------61:10----------
deal with that hole than it would have


---------61:12----------
been if you


---------61:14----------
just learned how to deal with things


---------61:16----------
that don't work out


---------61:17----------
as well or something like that so let's


---------61:21----------
talk about that for a second


---------61:22----------
so how did you guys come to


---------61:25----------
nofap and how did y'all make a decision


---------61:29----------
to


---------61:29----------
to try to stop masturbating


---------61:33----------
um probably uh your brain on porn


---------61:36----------
um i don't know how many people here


---------61:38----------
have


---------61:40----------
like heard about that a website right


---------61:42----------
it's a website


---------61:44----------
well it was a video by this guy um gary


---------61:47----------
wilson and he has like a whole


---------61:48----------
presentation on it and everything


---------61:51----------
and it just really got in my head that


---------61:53----------
you know i noticed


---------61:54----------
the emotional and physical and


---------61:58----------
perceptual distortions but i didn't


---------62:00----------
think about it in terms of


---------62:01----------
like an actual addiction and after that


---------62:04----------
i went to the subreddit and


---------62:06----------
i mean really it had been five to six


---------62:09----------
years of


---------62:10----------
trying to stop relapsing rationalizing


---------62:13----------
trying to stop again that sort of


---------62:16----------
pattern


---------62:18----------
um for me a friend recommended to me for


---------62:21----------
my depression


---------62:23----------
it really helped him and uh


---------62:26----------
i didn't think much of it at first i


---------62:27----------
thought it was kind of just more of a


---------62:28----------
challenge


---------62:29----------
uh but um i realized for me in my


---------62:33----------
journey


---------62:34----------
that uh escapism is the worst thing for


---------62:36----------
me


---------62:37----------
because i'm just avoiding all my


---------62:38----------
problems that i need to be facing in my


---------62:40----------
life


---------62:41----------
and porn is easily one of the easiest


---------62:44----------
ways to escape


---------62:45----------
so i made it i wanted to i'm trying to


---------62:48----------
get rid of all of my escapism like in


---------62:49----------
video game


---------62:50----------
escaping mechanisms like video games


---------62:52----------
twitch and or limit them


---------62:54----------
and um porn is just one of them and i


---------62:58----------
thought


---------62:59----------
well what can i do to ask to not use


---------63:02----------
porn as an escaping tone


---------63:03----------
nofap is what came to mind since a


---------63:05----------
friend recommended to me a while ago


---------63:08----------
and what has been y'all's experience of


---------63:10----------
nofap


---------63:15----------
well i'm sorry yeah for me yeah for me


---------63:18----------
um at first i didn't really feel


---------63:20----------
anything i felt like i'm just doing a


---------63:22----------
super challenge


---------63:23----------
but over time i uh of like a week of


---------63:26----------
relapsing and


---------63:27----------
a week of not being of being on nofap um


---------63:32----------
while i'm doing nofap i felt very


---------63:35----------
energetic and i felt very um i felt


---------63:38----------
more alive and i felt like i'm starting


---------63:40----------
to take action more


---------63:42----------
um and uh when i'm relapsing uh i just


---------63:46----------
felt horrible i felt like i'm being


---------63:47----------
consumed


---------63:49----------
so while on nofap for me in my


---------63:51----------
experience i felt more


---------63:52----------
free i feel like i'm not being


---------63:53----------
controlled my i'm taking my own actions


---------63:56----------
i'm myself right uh and it's


---------63:59----------
it's the same with any other escapism i


---------64:01----------
think yeah


---------64:03----------
this one to me seems especially strong


---------64:05----------
because it's so


---------64:06----------
like um it's so carnal


---------64:09----------
and it's so obsessive um


---------64:13----------
i think the first week usually i notice


---------64:16----------
for most people the first three days of


---------64:18----------
the first week


---------64:19----------
tends to be the hardest um and it'll


---------64:21----------
usually fall in that pattern


---------64:23----------
uh they'll feel like a boost of energy


---------64:25----------
i'm starting to feel normal again


---------64:28----------
and then from a week to two weeks


---------64:31----------
that that you know that that dopamine


---------64:33----------
thing starts to go down and there starts


---------64:35----------
to be that withdrawal feeling again and


---------64:36----------
that seems to be whenever all the


---------64:38----------
negative feelings start coming up again


---------64:40----------
and this will go in waves so um once it


---------64:43----------
comes to like


---------64:44----------
two weeks to four weeks to six weeks


---------64:47----------
that's when


---------64:48----------
um you'll start to feel


---------64:51----------
and see some some perceptual healing


---------64:54----------
like


---------64:55----------
uh motivation to be around friends uh


---------64:58----------
not sexualizing people like a lot of


---------65:00----------
those things get better


---------65:02----------
um the farthest i've gotten so far has


---------65:06----------
been like 45 days


---------65:07----------
moon 45 days at sci-70


---------65:10----------
um flow believe it or not like a year


---------65:14----------
right yeah


---------65:17----------
um it was one year


---------65:21----------
basically um one last day so


---------65:24----------
364 days um


---------65:27----------
because i thought like why celebrate a


---------65:30----------
year if you can just [ __ ] it up on the


---------65:31----------
last day


---------65:32----------
but um um


---------65:36----------
that's when i realized that like


---------65:37----------
basically masturbation wasn't


---------65:39----------
the issue for me because i um i didn't


---------65:42----------
make a year without pornography but i


---------65:44----------
made a year without masturbation so


---------65:46----------
i realized that that wasn't


---------65:50----------
like the fight i had to go through


---------65:53----------
and um go ahead


---------65:57----------
finish first um like the effects


---------66:01----------
[Music]


---------66:02----------
um like the main effects were that i


---------66:05----------
got very emotional um


---------66:08----------
it was like the first time that i cried


---------66:10----------
in a few years that


---------66:12----------
i was able to even experience good days


---------66:15----------
and bad days


---------66:16----------
because beforehand i had just like the


---------66:19----------
same


---------66:19----------
[ __ ] every day and it really didn't


---------66:22----------
didn't feel any different


---------66:24----------
so i had some ups and some downs


---------66:27----------
which was really exciting


---------66:31----------
and i would cry to like


---------66:35----------
i don't know i think like stranger


---------66:38----------
things


---------66:39----------
um like series finales and stuff like


---------66:42----------
that


---------66:43----------
because it was just like overwhelming


---------66:45----------
seeing like emotion


---------66:46----------
in in like a series or something and um


---------66:50----------
at that time i got together with my


---------66:52----------
girlfriend right when i stopped


---------66:54----------
and i think i still like owe


---------66:57----------
that time to her because like


---------67:00----------
my whole like a part of my whole is not


---------67:03----------
like feeling


---------67:04----------
like loved and respected and i got that


---------67:06----------
from her and


---------67:08----------
so it went really well like for the


---------67:09----------
first few months because i


---------67:11----------
i didn't really need to


---------67:15----------
deal with those issues because i


---------67:18----------
felt loved and i felt respected yeah


---------67:21----------
definitely for me


---------67:22----------
there are two things first of all i


---------67:24----------
wanted to say most people assume when


---------67:26----------
they try


---------67:27----------
to quit and that's what i heard from


---------67:29----------
many friends that it just


---------67:30----------
builds up builds up it's up and i don't


---------67:32----------
really feel


---------67:34----------
the benefits of feeling more confident


---------67:36----------
they just feel


---------67:38----------
really really horny extremely and it's


---------67:41----------
really


---------67:42----------
uncomfortable for them and i felt the


---------67:44----------
same but at some point


---------67:46----------
your brain realizes that it doesn't get


---------67:49----------
any more porn


---------67:50----------
and just starts to focus on other things


---------67:53----------
and for me also that was the time when


---------67:56----------
i've


---------67:56----------
really felt like connected to my


---------67:59----------
emotions


---------68:00----------
and could i could really show my


---------68:01----------
emotions because i always wanted to


---------68:04----------
talk to people and laugh and


---------68:07----------
um like show yeah basically show my


---------68:11----------
emotions to people


---------68:12----------
and that was possible in that time and


---------68:15----------
also


---------68:15----------
i think you can't just quit porn and


---------68:18----------
then


---------68:19----------
like if you are addicted it has already


---------68:22----------
taken


---------68:23----------
like a seat in your brain and you need


---------68:26----------
to fill that seat with


---------68:28----------
something because i know from that time


---------68:30----------
it was


---------68:31----------
the feeling of god and like like you


---------68:33----------
said flow


---------68:34----------
like the feeling of love like with god


---------68:37----------
it was just like an


---------68:38----------
infinite source no matter where i go and


---------68:41----------
i was bike riding a lot in nature


---------68:45----------
and just seeing a tree was for me like a


---------68:47----------
symbol


---------68:48----------
of the creative power


---------68:52----------
and love of gods and so i really had


---------68:55----------
a good replacement for the porn


---------68:57----------
addiction


---------68:59----------
i can agree with that um i've i mean as


---------69:02----------
far as like if we're going to separate


---------69:03----------
this from


---------69:05----------
like like psychology and trauma and just


---------69:08----------
talk about the spiritual side of it


---------69:09----------
it's like if you're doing it along with


---------69:12----------
different practices it's


---------69:13----------
fantastic it's beautiful it's a very


---------69:16----------
very wonderful thing


---------69:19----------
um go ahead go ahead okay um


---------69:22----------
yeah i think there must be a reason why


---------69:24----------
you should be doing nofap like i don't


---------69:26----------
think


---------69:26----------
you're gonna succeed if you just say oh


---------69:29----------
i'm just gonna try it


---------69:30----------
i think you gotta have like a like a


---------69:32----------
passion i guess almost like


---------69:34----------
to for me it's to better myself in


---------69:35----------
general right to to battle my depression


---------69:38----------
my anxiety


---------69:39----------
so for me i find more success when i


---------69:41----------
think about like


---------69:42----------
what i'm how i'm trying to help myself


---------69:46----------
so let me ask you guys a question what


---------69:49----------
when you guys start to do nofap what


---------69:51----------
comes


---------69:51----------
up um


---------69:55----------
i i felt like a huge loss of identity


---------69:59----------
when i stopped like um


---------70:03----------
i remember that i was like sitting on my


---------70:05----------
bed crying with my girlfriend next to me


---------70:08----------
because


---------70:08----------
um i had like no idea


---------70:13----------
what my dharma was like i had like no


---------70:16----------
sense


---------70:17----------
um in life and i didn't know who i was


---------70:20----------
because


---------70:21----------
um i just


---------70:25----------
like there were like these emotions that


---------70:28----------
i couldn't figure out


---------70:29----------
and they overwhelmed me and i um


---------70:33----------
i actually feel like at that point i


---------70:34----------
stuck to


---------70:36----------
like the um


---------70:39----------
sense that overcoming the addiction is


---------70:42----------
now like the plan


---------70:44----------
i'm gonna go with like my identity and


---------70:47----------
um i feel like that makes


---------70:50----------
like the relapse especially hard and the


---------70:53----------
shame that comes with it


---------70:54----------
because i'm basically um


---------70:58----------
doing something against my personality


---------71:00----------
if i relapse


---------71:03----------
yeah kind of like uh saying is like


---------71:06----------
uh i'm currently on like day 50 of nofap


---------71:08----------
and


---------71:09----------
i felt like some more like energy and


---------71:11----------
motivation and like search for dharma


---------71:13----------
like search for purpose


---------71:15----------
to like you know you know i'm like young


---------71:18----------
20s so i'm kind of like finding where


---------71:19----------
i'm going to go with my life


---------71:21----------
and i have more energy in life just like


---------71:23----------
i've been doing all these things that


---------71:24----------
i've been putting out for years like


---------71:26----------
meditating working out um things like


---------71:29----------
that


---------71:30----------
and i'm also like looking for like a


---------71:33----------
future life goal


---------71:34----------
and life purpose and not just like


---------71:36----------
sitting in the same spot


---------71:38----------
and you know in my own self you know


---------71:41----------
hate or self sadness


---------71:42----------
i'm actually moving forward in life but


---------71:46----------
i mean i thought like negatives


---------71:47----------
like you guys are you guys are sounding


---------71:49----------
so positive yeah


---------71:51----------
yeah i'm gonna find my purpose in life


---------71:53----------
like right


---------71:54----------
bro but you know does it sound like it's


---------71:58----------
a fun ride


---------72:00----------
yeah can i play something which happened


---------72:02----------
to me very recently it's


---------72:03----------
yes long but very recently for me at the


---------72:06----------
moment my hurdle is like seven days


---------72:09----------
and recently i got to 13 days but at


---------72:12----------
starting at day 7 i just cried


---------72:14----------
every single day for around 30 minutes


---------72:18----------
to like an hour


---------72:19----------
and it was just i felt like it was just


---------72:22----------
all the stuff


---------72:22----------
i've been pushing away and for me that


---------72:25----------
would be


---------72:26----------
like a lack of connection to another


---------72:29----------
human because for me also like


---------72:33----------
these i've never been in a relationship


---------72:35----------
and it was something that


---------72:38----------
is like constantly on my mind and i've


---------72:40----------
always pushed that away


---------72:42----------
especially in that time where


---------72:45----------
i had this long streak even beginning


---------72:47----------
like the longest week broke for me


---------72:49----------
because


---------72:50----------
also that time started to like in my


---------72:53----------
mind i was just saying


---------72:54----------
oh you know you need to get a partner


---------72:56----------
you need to get a girlfriend


---------72:58----------
and i had some bad stuff


---------73:01----------
happening and that area and so


---------73:05----------
it has been always something that i


---------73:06----------
pushed away all the time


---------73:08----------
and also like with mgtow like that was


---------73:12----------
like oh yeah


---------73:13----------
i'm just a perfect independent man i


---------73:15----------
don't need a woman i


---------73:16----------
i just stay away from that but i know


---------73:18----------
for myself


---------73:19----------
i feel like that for me is escapism like


---------73:22----------
i know in my heart there's the


---------73:24----------
desire for a relationship but i've just


---------73:27----------
ignored that


---------73:28----------
all my life and i feel like now it is


---------73:30----------
just all


---------73:31----------
hitting me in the face


---------73:37----------
i will say the the very hard thing about


---------73:39----------
nofap is


---------73:41----------
um it takes you out of the it takes you


---------73:43----------
out of the loop right um


---------73:44----------
takes you out of what you're escaping so


---------73:47----------
uh first few days or


---------73:49----------
weeks you you will have to face your


---------73:51----------
problems


---------73:52----------
and it's very very hard and it takes a


---------73:55----------
lot of willpower


---------73:56----------
and um also when i relapse


---------74:00----------
for me i i get devastated it it's


---------74:02----------
horrible it's one of the worst feelings


---------74:03----------
i've ever had in my life


---------74:05----------
every time every seven days or whenever


---------74:07----------
i relapse i i can't it's it's horrible


---------74:09----------
it makes me feel very depressed i feel


---------74:10----------
like i'm not taking action i'm i don't i


---------74:12----------
don't have any willpower i'm not


---------74:14----------
capable it is very devastating


---------74:18----------
bob did you want to say something


---------74:24----------
we were talking about negative emotions


---------74:25----------
on a streak right yeah


---------74:27----------
yeah so like i


---------74:30----------
i agree with everything that they've


---------74:32----------
said um it's the feeling is like


---------74:35----------
there's that emptiness but there's also


---------74:37----------
um


---------74:38----------
like grief from my dad came up like


---------74:42----------
um frustration uh


---------74:45----------
you know loneliness like outside was


---------74:47----------
talking about


---------74:48----------
you know like all these things that were


---------74:50----------
um that were pushed away or not


---------74:53----------
processed


---------74:54----------
and definitely the more you do it and


---------74:57----------
the longer


---------74:58----------
it goes like the deeper you can


---------75:01----------
get in there you know and kind of pull


---------75:04----------
some of that stuff out


---------75:07----------
so uh yeah it's easy oh um i would say


---------75:10----------
that a lot of what the negative emotions


---------75:12----------
are like it's kind of like when you


---------75:13----------
bottle something up like


---------75:15----------
a carbonated drink like this it's like


---------75:17----------
every time you well i mean that's


---------75:18----------
literally fattening but


---------75:20----------
um like every time you like shake it up


---------75:23----------
it like bottles them up even more so


---------75:26----------
that when you do


---------75:27----------
release like if i were to take the cap


---------75:29----------
off of this after shaking it


---------75:31----------
it explodes and you feel all these


---------75:33----------
emotions come to you at once and you're


---------75:35----------
like


---------75:35----------
so this is what anger and grief and


---------75:37----------
sadness feel like


---------75:38----------
and some people call that the flatline


---------75:40----------
some people call that there's a lot of


---------75:42----------
different things to call it flatline is


---------75:43----------
normally like a depression or something


---------75:45----------
but it


---------75:45----------
does refer to um the like negative


---------75:48----------
emotions that you can experience but


---------75:50----------
i do find that if you're able to


---------75:52----------
overcome those negative emotions that


---------75:54----------
i become a lot more productive and happy


---------75:56----------
for the most part it's just that every


---------75:58----------
now and then


---------75:59----------
i have to feel i think i think flatline


---------76:02----------
is a different thing i think


---------76:03----------
what i heard from experiences from other


---------76:05----------
people flatline is a state where


---------76:08----------
your brain basically shuts off the


---------76:11----------
sexual area or something like that and


---------76:14----------
you have people report that they have no


---------76:17----------
libido


---------76:18----------
and they feel like after they have they


---------76:21----------
have the feeling when they


---------76:23----------
like after they have just relapsed for a


---------76:25----------
certain period of time


---------76:27----------
and people say that is the time where


---------76:28----------
the brain just shuts everything down


---------76:31----------
and you have like this sort of numbness


---------76:35----------
again but it's just that the brain can


---------76:37----------
really


---------76:38----------
heal itself and


---------76:41----------
i never had that personally but it's


---------76:43----------
just like


---------76:44----------
just worth the wording because that is


---------76:46----------
something also people record


---------76:48----------
so how do you guys so zizi is saying


---------76:52----------
you know if you can overcome the


---------76:53----------
emotions


---------76:55----------
how do you do that how does that


---------76:58----------
actually happen


---------77:00----------
all this like you guys are opening up


---------77:02----------
you know


---------77:03----------
all this past trauma feelings of sadness


---------77:07----------
loneliness


---------77:10----------
this goes back to like friday's stream


---------77:12----------
but a lot of it is like finding a


---------77:13----------
therapist can really help i know i


---------77:15----------
actually have a therapist and


---------77:16----------
talking with her helps me deal with a


---------77:18----------
lot of my emotional [ __ ]


---------77:19----------
um as far as like by myself what i can


---------77:21----------
do is


---------77:22----------
sit with the emotion and understand it


---------77:24----------
either like you know meditate be mindful


---------77:27----------
be with


---------77:27----------
it and try to resolve it or realize if


---------77:30----------
it's not really an emotion that


---------77:32----------
i'm actually feeling it's just a thought


---------77:33----------
that i think is an emotion just let it


---------77:35----------
go


---------77:36----------
how do you sit with an emotion


---------77:39----------
um i guess normally my instinct is to go


---------77:43----------
like


---------77:44----------
watch twitch youtube you know watch porn


---------77:47----------
and avoid it but instead what i can do


---------77:49----------
is uh


---------77:51----------
just do nothing just sit there and like


---------77:53----------
you know observe like either my mind or


---------77:55----------
my body or how i


---------77:56----------
uh react to it and almost just like


---------77:58----------
understand what it really is


---------78:00----------
and not just instinctually avoid it


---------78:03----------
yeah learning to meditate has really


---------78:06----------
helped me with that


---------78:07----------
um for meditating for like two years now


---------78:10----------
and just um being able to


---------78:14----------
see the emotion arise is like


---------78:18----------
so powerful already um


---------78:21----------
sometimes um when you don't have any


---------78:25----------
option to numb yourself


---------78:26----------
um yeah you basically just sit there


---------78:29----------
like i was sitting with my girlfriend in


---------78:30----------
the


---------78:31----------
in the car and something came up and i


---------78:33----------
was just


---------78:34----------
like really trying to feel


---------78:37----------
what it felt like to be sad um


---------78:41----------
and yeah just started crying and didn't


---------78:43----------
didn't


---------78:44----------
stop myself basically but just waited


---------78:47----------
and


---------78:48----------
um saw what it was


---------78:54----------
what helps me at the moment is just


---------78:56----------
giving my


---------78:57----------
past or just seeing myself and all the


---------79:01----------
things that have happened to me as sort


---------79:02----------
of like a story


---------79:04----------
and so because i was always very afraid


---------79:08----------
of


---------79:09----------
like talking to girls and approaching


---------79:11----------
them is it has been a really big problem


---------79:14----------
but when you actually try to fix


---------79:17----------
such the problem of yourself it feels


---------79:20----------
extremely good and extremely meaningful


---------79:23----------
and i think that is also like it gives


---------79:26----------
the whole


---------79:28----------
let's say it's called a journey a lot


---------79:30----------
more spirits


---------79:31----------
and it's there's something definitely


---------79:34----------
that has helped me


---------79:38----------
um for me i feel like i'm still in a


---------79:41----------
journey trying to understand my emotions


---------79:42----------
and i


---------79:43----------
i have tried seeking therapy but it's


---------79:45----------
kind of very hard because of like trust


---------79:47----------
issues and


---------79:49----------
um but what has helped me is taking


---------79:52----------
action


---------79:53----------
so um i've been doing cold showers and


---------79:56----------
i've been


---------79:56----------
exercising and running and um


---------80:00----------
it really helps with willpower and um


---------80:04----------
that's what's helped me kind of like


---------80:07----------
understand your emotions i'm trying to


---------80:08----------
understand my emotions and then take


---------80:09----------
action to


---------80:10----------
solve them or face them or you know


---------80:13----------
under


---------80:13----------
at least kind of embrace them in a way


---------80:17----------
rather than avoid them with porn


---------80:20----------
does that hurt to face your emotions


---------80:23----------
though


---------80:24----------
this is something i was about to say um


---------80:27----------
i think of it like like when you're


---------80:29----------
sitting with like a really negative


---------80:31----------
feeling


---------80:32----------
i think there's something courageous


---------80:33----------
about it because you


---------80:35----------
have to have it dwell inside of you like


---------80:39----------
if it's grief


---------80:40----------
or if it's pain or if it's anxiety you


---------80:42----------
know um


---------80:45----------
there's there also seems to be like an


---------80:47----------
element of um


---------80:48----------
like self-forgiveness is really useful


---------80:51----------
just like


---------80:51----------
understanding that like this is not


---------80:54----------
wrong necessarily it's just


---------80:56----------
it is what it is it's part of you


---------80:59----------
and so speaking of self-forgiveness


---------81:02----------
what's it like to relapse


---------81:05----------
how does that happen


---------81:08----------
how does it happen or how does it feel


---------81:10----------
both


---------81:12----------
wha what leads to a relapse and then how


---------81:15----------
do you feel afterward


---------81:17----------
i'm going to run off real quick and come


---------81:18----------
back i drink too much water sorry


---------81:21----------
for me personally i would say it is when


---------81:22----------
i lose focus because


---------81:24----------
currently i have i would say i have a


---------81:27----------
dharma


---------81:28----------
and i have a clear reason why i want to


---------81:30----------
stop this


---------81:32----------
and it happens in times of boredom


---------81:36----------
when i just lose focus on what i do want


---------81:38----------
to do with my life and i just


---------81:41----------
sort of and most of the times i am just


---------81:43----------
like mindlessly


---------81:45----------
browsing on youtube videos or watching


---------81:47----------
youtube videos


---------81:49----------
and that is the time


---------81:52----------
like when relapses happen the most for


---------81:56----------
me is this in times where i lose


---------81:59----------
a side of the big picture i would say


---------82:03----------
um yeah i agree with losing focus i


---------82:07----------
think it's for me


---------82:08----------
is uh i'll find myself always relapsing


---------82:12----------
on a day where i don't kind of do the


---------82:14----------
habits that i said i would do


---------82:16----------
so if i said i'm going to wake up early


---------82:17----------
and take a cold shower and go for a run


---------82:19----------
and if i wake up at 2 p.m instead of 8


---------82:22----------
a.m


---------82:22----------
and don't take a cold shower i'll take a


---------82:25----------
hot shower i'll find myself


---------82:26----------
saying oh i'm okay i won't relapse today


---------82:28----------
but then eventually i will


---------82:30----------
uh so taking action and staying


---------82:32----------
consistent not being consistent and


---------82:34----------
losing focus


---------82:35----------
really uh goes into makes me relapse a


---------82:38----------
lot


---------82:40----------
for me it's uh different because even if


---------82:43----------
i have like the greatest day


---------82:45----------
and i did everything that i wanted


---------82:47----------
there's still like the same chance that


---------82:49----------
i will relapse


---------82:50----------
um it's


---------82:54----------
very much like automatic there are


---------82:56----------
things that


---------82:57----------
trigger me for example like seeing like


---------82:59----------
thumbnails on youtube


---------83:00----------
or something like that um it often


---------83:04----------
comes with being tired being exhausted


---------83:07----------
being stressed


---------83:09----------
[Music]


---------83:11----------
experience experiencing feelings that


---------83:15----------
i want to numb basically like feeling


---------83:17----------
sad or feeling lonely


---------83:19----------
and the relapse itself


---------83:24----------
once i've like


---------83:27----------
done a certain step for me probably if i


---------83:30----------
type in something in like my url bar


---------83:33----------
it's already too late


---------83:34----------
like i still have thoughts like i need


---------83:37----------
to quit now


---------83:38----------
i don't want to do this but there's no


---------83:41----------
point because


---------83:42----------
it's like one step too late already


---------83:46----------
and like while


---------83:50----------
i'm relapsing feel great don't feel


---------83:52----------
anything


---------83:53----------
don't need to worry about anything and


---------83:55----------
then right afterwards


---------83:57----------
like it's lots of shame


---------84:02----------
lots of um feeling like


---------84:06----------
i um


---------84:10----------
i've just it's a it's like pure failure


---------84:13----------
basically


---------84:14----------
because um yeah disappointment


---------84:17----------
um i've disappointed myself i've


---------84:19----------
disappointed


---------84:20----------
my girlfriend like everyone basically


---------84:24----------
and it really um yeah messes with your


---------84:27----------
day


---------84:27----------
but for example the last time


---------84:31----------
that i relapsed i was able to call


---------84:33----------
people from this chat


---------84:34----------
and was able to have a really great


---------84:37----------
afternoon because


---------84:38----------
i was able to share those emotions with


---------84:40----------
them and all of them


---------84:41----------
know exactly what i'm talking about


---------84:46----------
how do you feel about yourself when you


---------84:48----------
relapse


---------84:49----------
please can you tell them i was just


---------84:51----------
going to say how do you feel about


---------84:53----------
yourself when you relapse like what are


---------84:54----------
the thoughts that you have or


---------84:57----------
yeah since uh for me personally since


---------85:01----------
when it's


---------85:01----------
when i feel like i'm not taking action


---------85:03----------
when i relapse


---------85:04----------
i just blame myself very very much for


---------85:08----------
not being responsible not taking


---------85:09----------
responsibility and uh


---------85:12----------
not taking action it's a horrible


---------85:14----------
feeling um


---------85:15----------
i feel like uh i'm the only one that


---------85:17----------
could have prevented it and i did


---------85:18----------
nothing about it


---------85:20----------
so um my parents described me as a


---------85:25----------
generally shameless individual i don't


---------85:27----------
know why i'm like that


---------85:29----------
or maybe i just found that shame isn't


---------85:31----------
really useful to prevent


---------85:33----------
relapse so some people will feel very


---------85:35----------
ashamed and that's okay


---------85:37----------
but i'd say that sitting in that feeling


---------85:39----------
can


---------85:40----------
cause you to relapse more often


---------85:43----------
so really there's a there's a rocky


---------85:45----------
quote where he says like


---------85:46----------
it's not about um how hard you get hit


---------85:49----------
it's about


---------85:50----------
if you can get hit and keep moving


---------85:52----------
forward so really and truly it's all


---------85:53----------
about


---------85:54----------
every time you relapse there's this


---------85:56----------
thing called like a relapse autopsy


---------85:58----------
and there are stages of a relapse i


---------86:00----------
think bob can expand on that more


---------86:02----------
um like the desire the trigger or


---------86:04----------
something like that


---------86:05----------
and um you can look at it like what what


---------86:08----------
caused me to relapse well what normally


---------86:10----------
causes me to relapse is i use a system


---------86:12----------
called blast which is


---------86:13----------
bored like bored lonely angry


---------86:16----------
sad or tired and sometimes tired is


---------86:19----------
thirsty and there's also another one


---------86:21----------
which includes


---------86:22----------
hungry um and i'm always i'm normally


---------86:25----------
tired angry or lonely like oh the girl i


---------86:28----------
like didn't text me back well she works


---------86:30----------
like 72 hours a week dude like


---------86:32----------
of course she doesn't have all this time


---------86:33----------
she can't like you know give all this


---------86:35----------
time to you


---------86:36----------
but even then like my the irrational


---------86:39----------
part of my brain is like


---------86:40----------
oh you gotta it's just like well


---------86:42----------
whatever like


---------86:43----------
she's she's whatever just go you need to


---------86:46----------
find some other form of


---------86:48----------
digital companionship and that's what


---------86:49----------
causes me to relapse


---------86:53----------
yeah a relapse is a long chain i would


---------86:55----------
say it's not just


---------86:57----------
like you type it's it's not just typing


---------87:00----------
in the url


---------87:01----------
it's for me it starts even before that


---------87:03----------
sometimes


---------87:05----------
when i come home from work and i


---------87:08----------
sometimes start to eat foods i shouldn't


---------87:10----------
be eating


---------87:12----------
that is when i feel like


---------87:16----------
i crumble a bit and then i just


---------87:19----------
can't keep the discipline up and then


---------87:22----------
most of the time it starts like this


---------87:27----------
okay so let me ask you guys a question


---------87:30----------
um


---------87:32----------
are you going to relapse


---------87:38----------
yeah no i say no i believe in you men


---------87:43----------
so if you know you're going to relapse


---------87:47----------
how do how does that correlate with


---------87:50----------
shame or control


---------87:52----------
right because up here we have annie


---------87:54----------
saying i'm the only one that can do


---------87:55----------
something if he's like i'm definitely


---------87:56----------
going to relapse


---------87:58----------
how do we sit with those two thoughts


---------88:01----------
um i would say that uh relapse is


---------88:04----------
part of recovery relapse is a part of


---------88:06----------
most people's recovery


---------88:08----------
and um like as i was saying earlier do


---------88:11----------
the relapse autopsy figure out


---------88:13----------
why like um and the thing is


---------88:16----------
my friend in the addiction community he


---------88:18----------
said put up a defense


---------88:19----------
you need defenses and uh as flo was


---------88:22----------
saying earlier


---------88:23----------
a good defense is a community because i


---------88:25----------
would say um


---------88:26----------
there was one video i watched which said


---------88:28----------
the opposite of


---------88:30----------
addiction is connection so find a group


---------88:32----------
find


---------88:33----------
um if you like 12-step programs find a


---------88:35----------
sponsor there's stuff like sla


---------88:39----------
that can that can help uh or just find


---------88:41----------
an accountability partner


---------88:43----------
um find like things that help you set


---------88:45----------
your streaks like i use


---------88:47----------
done um that's an app on on the app


---------88:50----------
store


---------88:51----------
and it helps me a lot to like keep


---------88:53----------
pressing that button each day it's kind


---------88:54----------
of like the replacement like


---------88:56----------
every time i press that button and it


---------88:58----------
says oh you've made it two days you made


---------88:59----------
it three days you made it four days


---------89:01----------
it's really all about defense and


---------89:05----------
trying to find ways to root out the


---------89:07----------
causes that make you relapse well i'm


---------89:10----------
gonna add to that


---------89:11----------
and say that in my experience in that


---------89:13----------
channel


---------89:15----------
uh it never seems like shame helps very


---------89:18----------
much


---------89:18----------
but i i try to reorient it towards


---------89:22----------
you should learn about the process


---------89:25----------
what you're feeling why it happens


---------89:28----------
during the time


---------89:29----------
it's it's it's not


---------89:33----------
entirely your fault because it's part of


---------89:35----------
your being and


---------89:37----------
part of the culture that you're inside


---------89:38----------
you do have some control over it but


---------89:41----------
you can forgive yourself but i was like


---------89:43----------
that too


---------89:44----------
like i was there was a period in which


---------89:47----------
i went from a great deal of shame to


---------89:50----------
feeling neutral about it like it was


---------89:52----------
going to happen and i just needed to


---------89:54----------
watch it to


---------89:55----------
not really feeling that much shame


---------89:56----------
anymore and


---------89:58----------
this is a point where i have the most


---------90:00----------
control over it


---------90:03----------
i think it's important to know to


---------90:05----------
understand that relapsing is part of the


---------90:07----------
process


---------90:08----------
and for me i found myself that the more


---------90:10----------
and more


---------90:11----------
relapse the more more i understand why i


---------90:13----------
shouldn't be


---------90:14----------
like i'm facing my emotions more and


---------90:16----------
more and


---------90:19----------
i i know i i and and i feel like every


---------90:21----------
time there's less shame


---------90:22----------
last time that i relapsed there was less


---------90:25----------
shame than the time before


---------90:26----------
because i i i understood i took more


---------90:29----------
time to understand why


---------90:30----------
i'm relapsing and uh last time it was


---------90:34----------
because of emotions the emotion became


---------90:36----------
too much


---------90:36----------
and i understood that okay well


---------90:40----------
i'm doing what i can i'm starting to


---------90:41----------
face my emotions more so okay i


---------90:42----------
understand that


---------90:43----------
if i start facing my emotions more next


---------90:45----------
time i won't relapse as much and i won't


---------90:46----------
be


---------90:47----------
as shameful because i know i did i tried


---------90:49----------
right


---------90:51----------
um yeah yeah it's not the end of the


---------90:53----------
world


---------90:55----------
so i'm gonna try to just shift a couple


---------90:58----------
topics because we're


---------90:59----------
actually almost out of time so we've got


---------91:00----------
maybe about 15 minutes left


---------91:03----------
um so let me ask you guys what is what


---------91:05----------
is your understanding of like what's


---------91:06----------
brahmacharya


---------91:10----------
um sad guru is on the path to the divine


---------91:14----------
it's like the first stage of life i


---------91:16----------
think


---------91:16----------
from like it ends at the ages of 20 to


---------91:18----------
25. i just read the wikipedia article


---------91:20----------
but my understanding is is


---------91:22----------
one on the path to the divine is that is


---------91:24----------
what a brahmacharya is and for me it


---------91:27----------
means


---------91:27----------
um avoi it's like abstinence from from


---------91:30----------
things that are pleasurable and the


---------91:32----------
pursuit of joy


---------91:35----------
you described it as big chillin in the


---------91:38----------
last time


---------91:39----------
last stream i think yeah


---------91:43----------
what does that mean you said it


---------91:47----------
okay um at the end of like i think the


---------91:51----------
second porn stream


---------91:53----------
okay yeah so so


---------91:56----------
okay i'll i'll explain what i mean by


---------91:58----------
that is somebody else want to offer a


---------91:59----------
definition or their understanding


---------92:02----------
um i think about it as sort of like a


---------92:05----------
universal


---------92:06----------
discipline um of


---------92:09----------
all sensory desires and apparatus trying


---------92:11----------
to pull


---------92:13----------
away from being pulled outside of


---------92:15----------
yourself


---------92:16----------
and trying to cultivate


---------92:20----------
inner strength and um


---------92:23----------
i guess uh


---------92:27----------
nature okay i have a more


---------92:31----------
secular view of it but for me it's just


---------92:33----------
like


---------92:34----------
like the age around 2025 is just


---------92:37----------
the time where you give up your


---------92:40----------
childhood pleasures and need to start to


---------92:43----------
face


---------92:44----------
reality and live in reality and start to


---------92:47----------
become


---------92:47----------
a member of the society


---------92:51----------
i would say and giving up the pleasures


---------92:54----------
to fulfill some duty in the society is


---------92:57----------
like my current understanding of it


---------93:00----------
um for me it's uh


---------93:03----------
kind of like not being a slave to


---------93:06----------
pleasure


---------93:08----------
or pleasurable desires and kind of more


---------93:11----------
like seeking gratification and


---------93:12----------
fulfillment


---------93:13----------
from like long-term goals so like um


---------93:17----------
porn is like i'll just do it for a few


---------93:19----------
minutes and i'll get like an instant


---------93:21----------
pleasure whereas


---------93:22----------
it's like reading a book it might not be


---------93:25----------
pleasurable at the moment but


---------93:26----------
you get more more of a fulfillment over


---------93:29----------
time or gratification over time


---------93:31----------
okay those are all good definitions so i


---------93:34----------
i have some


---------93:35----------
thoughts to share but before we get to


---------93:37----------
those or if you guys want me to go first


---------93:38----------
i'm happy to


---------93:39----------
i guess the last general question that i


---------93:42----------
think we should explore is like where do


---------93:44----------
you go from here


---------93:46----------
now if if you guys have thoughts about


---------93:48----------
that i'd love to hear them otherwise


---------93:50----------
i can try to sum up some stuff but


---------93:53----------
i want to give you guys kind of a


---------93:54----------
platform like what's next yeah


---------93:56----------
hello um can i can i ask you a question


---------93:59----------
about that because


---------94:01----------
like i know that all of us have


---------94:04----------
like some kind of trauma and


---------94:08----------
um i'm not even sure if


---------94:11----------
we are able to deal with our emotions


---------94:14----------
without like getting therapy and


---------94:17----------
like figuring out what our hole in the


---------94:21----------
heart is


---------94:21----------
and dealing with that because sometimes


---------94:25----------
it feels like a fight that i can't win


---------94:28----------
right now


---------94:28----------
and that's really frustrating and i


---------94:32----------
um yeah i just want to know if if we can


---------94:35----------
even


---------94:36----------
do it because um i would rather know


---------94:39----------
that


---------94:40----------
it's something that i can face after


---------94:42----------
having like 20 years of therapy then


---------94:46----------
like um fighting every day and


---------94:49----------
not being yeah not knowing if we can


---------94:52----------
handle it


---------94:54----------
yeah so what i'm hearing from flow is is


---------94:57----------
there hope


---------94:58----------
for victory


---------95:01----------
yeah anybody else have uh


---------95:06----------
i would say this is something which is a


---------95:08----------
huge cliche


---------95:09----------
in the uh 12-step programs that i've


---------95:12----------
been in


---------95:13----------
but just one last thing basically is


---------95:16----------
don't give up until the miracle happens


---------95:19----------
and


---------95:19----------
what is the miracle who knows what it is


---------95:21----------
your life has changed completely


---------95:24----------
after the first week you might find that


---------95:26----------
things


---------95:27----------
really and truly have changed and a lot


---------95:29----------
of the things you might perceive


---------95:31----------
as negative at first will become


---------95:34----------
well slowly and surely it's it's not


---------95:37----------
about superpowers it's about


---------95:39----------
returning to baseline it's about


---------95:40----------
removing the symptoms of your


---------95:43----------
addiction because uh the thing is you


---------95:45----------
don't know


---------95:46----------
what water is until you're out of it so


---------95:49----------
you don't know what brain fog is


---------95:51----------
until you don't until you feel what


---------95:53----------
brain fog


---------95:54----------
like what it feels like not to have it


---------96:00----------
so does anybody else have questions


---------96:02----------
about like where to go


---------96:03----------
or thoughts about where we go from here


---------96:05----------
otherwise i'll collect my thoughts and


---------96:07----------
then try to answer a closed question


---------96:09----------
bob you can go first thank you um


---------96:12----------
i was going to say that that is a


---------96:14----------
process you know this is all


---------96:16----------
not these aren't discreet things i don't


---------96:18----------
think of it as


---------96:19----------
like there's a specific end point um


---------96:22----------
every day has potential for analyzing


---------96:25----------
your emotions


---------96:27----------
for trying to grow and be in the present


---------96:29----------
moment


---------96:30----------
it just takes work and you should be


---------96:33----------
honest with yourself that it may take a


---------96:35----------
lot of work but you can get there


---------96:37----------
you can feel better


---------96:41----------
yeah for me the whole story thing is a


---------96:43----------
big


---------96:45----------
is helping me in a big way because


---------96:48----------
i know the things that have happened in


---------96:50----------
the past and i can't change them


---------96:52----------
but i want to make sure that


---------96:56----------
i can overcome it because it's


---------96:59----------
really is beneficial to my dharma


---------97:02----------
and i want to be an example of


---------97:06----------
that it is possible to overcome the


---------97:08----------
problems you had in the past


---------97:10----------
and many great people had big issues


---------97:13----------
in their childhood and they didn't have


---------97:15----------
a perfect childhood and it's


---------97:17----------
and i think in a way overcoming


---------97:21----------
hardships gives you meaning it gives you


---------97:24----------
the feeling of power


---------97:25----------
and moving forward and i would say


---------97:28----------
that focusing on the future and building


---------97:32----------
a future


---------97:33----------
is something that i want to do and i


---------97:35----------
would even go so far


---------97:36----------
as to say that it's something anyone


---------97:39----------
should do


---------97:40----------
with regards to that because


---------97:43----------
it takes time to accept the past and


---------97:46----------
sometimes


---------97:46----------
you have to battle with traumas for the


---------97:49----------
rest of your life


---------97:51----------
but i think giving it some kind of


---------97:54----------
place where it has some meaning and


---------97:57----------
where it feels


---------97:58----------
like very personal and where you can


---------98:01----------
maybe even even help people


---------98:03----------
with that that it is something that is


---------98:06----------
like


---------98:07----------
very holistic and


---------98:10----------
good in a sense


---------98:13----------
any go ahead yep i think so you asked


---------98:16----------
what's next and i think for a lot of


---------98:18----------
people it should just be therapy


---------98:20----------
i feel like there's a lot of people in


---------98:22----------
chat right now that need it and are not


---------98:24----------
taking action to


---------98:25----------
to take any therapy and that's me that's


---------98:28----------
me i'm not doing it and i've been


---------98:30----------
avoiding it


---------98:31----------
and i think it's also finding a dharma


---------98:34----------
in my opinion


---------98:35----------
it's really it really helps the journey


---------98:37----------
it makes it much easier if you have a


---------98:39----------
purpose


---------98:40----------
and you have a reason to keep going um


---------98:43----------
and i just want to make that clear to


---------98:44----------
chat uh you get uh


---------98:47----------
if you guys need help you know i think


---------98:48----------
it's important to


---------98:50----------
okay so i'm gonna just think for a


---------98:53----------
little bit okay


---------98:54----------
try to collect my thoughts because i


---------98:55----------
want to highlight a lot of stuff


---------98:58----------
so overall this has been incredibly


---------98:59----------
helpful this is my


---------99:01----------
this is my notes from the page session


---------99:04----------
so there's


---------99:04----------
there's a lot to say


---------99:08----------
so give me just a minute


---------99:40----------
okay so the first thing that i want to


---------99:44----------
point out to people that are watching is


---------99:45----------
i i want you guys to pay attention and


---------99:47----------
maybe go back and watch the vod


---------99:50----------
i want you guys to pay attention to the


---------99:52----------
language that


---------99:53----------
people here use right so like the first


---------99:56----------
thing is that if we think about porn


---------99:58----------
addiction


---------99:58----------
what i'm hearing from you guys is like


---------100:00----------
almost like y'all are zombies


---------100:02----------
it's like like there's no like


---------100:06----------
awareness right it's like you guys use


---------100:09----------
these phrases like


---------100:10----------
autopilot my life is revolving around


---------100:13----------
this like you guys


---------100:14----------
really sound like zombies like from


---------100:16----------
movies where they just want


---------100:17----------
one thing and and it's interesting


---------100:20----------
because there's a certain like


---------100:22----------
neutrality like is a zombie unhappy like


---------100:24----------
it's a little bit unclear


---------100:26----------
are they unsatisfied are they hungry


---------100:29----------
absolutely


---------100:30----------
they're always hungry but it's not like


---------100:33----------
they're sad they're just hungry


---------100:37----------
and what we hear from you all about sort


---------100:39----------
of like you know pieces that are like


---------100:40----------
missing within us like that's what you


---------100:42----------
try to fill


---------100:43----------
with like porn or other addictions


---------100:45----------
because there's that hunger


---------100:47----------
and even in buddhism there's this idea


---------100:49----------
of like between


---------100:50----------
earth and hell there's like this middle


---------100:53----------
layer which is the realm of hungry


---------100:54----------
ghosts which isn't quite hell


---------100:56----------
but it's just for souls who are always


---------100:59----------
hungry and they never get filled up so


---------101:01----------
they seek pleasure they seek pleasure


---------101:02----------
they seek pleasure


---------101:04----------
and they never become satisfied


---------101:07----------
and so if you listen to like what these


---------101:08----------
people are saying if you guys like


---------101:09----------
really listen to


---------101:11----------
you guys i'm talking to twitch chat now


---------101:13----------
a lot of the questions


---------101:15----------
that we get asked like how do i


---------101:18----------
dot dot dot how do i find internal


---------101:20----------
motivation


---------101:21----------
how do i be less depressed how do i get


---------101:23----------
in touch with my emotions


---------101:25----------
like these are the questions that people


---------101:27----------
from our community ask and the


---------101:28----------
interesting thing is you guys should


---------101:29----------
listen to what they're saying because


---------101:31----------
they've actually y'all have done all


---------101:33----------
that


---------101:35----------
right you guys have found actually


---------101:36----------
bizarre you all have found the answers


---------101:39----------
because what we hear from you guys is


---------101:41----------
you know um like annie's talking about


---------101:44----------
you know taking cold showers every day


---------101:46----------
people are talking about like


---------101:47----------
you know finding relationships talking


---------101:49----------
to girls sitting with your emotions


---------101:51----------
learning how to deal with your emotions


---------101:53----------
finding purpose in life like grappling


---------101:55----------
with finding purpose in life getting


---------101:57----------
connected to other human beings like


---------101:58----------
this is what our community is missing


---------102:00----------
they don't know how to feel their


---------102:01----------
emotions they don't know what they're


---------102:02----------
feeling and you guys are like


---------102:04----------
i feel shame i feel like i [ __ ] up


---------102:08----------
i can understand flo earlier was saying


---------102:10----------
sometimes you think it's an emotion but


---------102:12----------
it's actually just a thought


---------102:14----------
right like that's that's what the people


---------102:17----------
in our community need to understand that


---------102:19----------
understanding


---------102:21----------
the other thing is that you guys talk a


---------102:22----------
lot about understanding


---------102:25----------
right so so like you guys aren't solving


---------102:27----------
any problems which is one of the really


---------102:28----------
confusing things for our community is


---------102:29----------
like they're like what do i do and my


---------102:31----------
answer is you don't do anything


---------102:33----------
what you do is you notice and notice


---------102:36----------
creates change


---------102:39----------
and it's kind of like what what's easy


---------102:40----------
was saying that there's a relapse


---------102:42----------
autopsy like what's the value of that


---------102:44----------
what do you do


---------102:45----------
the value is not about like figuring out


---------102:47----------
what the value is not about


---------102:49----------
doing the thing it's about figuring


---------102:53----------
out what to do that's where the change


---------102:55----------
happens


---------102:56----------
when your mind studies yourself and you


---------102:59----------
understand yourself


---------103:00----------
that's what gives you the power to do


---------103:02----------
because the problem with our community


---------103:03----------
isn't that they don't know what to do


---------103:04----------
everybody knows what to do they just


---------103:07----------
can't do it


---------103:09----------
right and he's saying like we all need


---------103:10----------
to see a therapist i'm included


---------103:12----------
like he knows he needs to see a


---------103:13----------
therapist why isn't he doing it


---------103:16----------
it's not a lack of what to do it's a


---------103:18----------
lack of like


---------103:19----------
understanding how you work so that you


---------103:21----------
can't do the things that you should do


---------103:25----------
and so how do you guys how have you all


---------103:27----------
succeeded because i actually think of


---------103:29----------
y'all


---------103:30----------
largely as success stories which may


---------103:31----------
sound weird because i hear you guys i


---------103:34----------
hear it in your language and it's


---------103:35----------
interesting because what you say is like


---------103:36----------
why do you relapse it's a loss of focus


---------103:39----------
which is bizarre right that's not what


---------103:41----------
we would expect it's not just a trigger


---------103:44----------
but it's a loss of focus and if we think


---------103:47----------
about you know how do you move forward


---------103:48----------
in life how do you find internal


---------103:49----------
motivation


---------103:50----------
how do you do things every day like this


---------103:52----------
is what our community needs


---------103:54----------
it's a loss of focus it's not a


---------103:57----------
it's actually not a lack of motivation


---------103:59----------
this is something that's subtle but like


---------104:01----------
needs to be understood


---------104:02----------
you know on january 1st when you make a


---------104:04----------
new year's resolution that you're going


---------104:06----------
to lose 10 pounds and you're going to


---------104:07----------
eat healthy and you go to the grocery


---------104:08----------
store


---------104:09----------
and you buy like all this healthy food


---------104:12----------
that's not


---------104:13----------
that's not a lack of motivation you have


---------104:15----------
plenty of motivation


---------104:16----------
the problem is that your mind wavers you


---------104:19----------
lose


---------104:19----------
focus on your motivation the


---------104:21----------
motivation's there it's just your mind


---------104:23----------
starts thinking about other things


---------104:25----------
and as you start to think about other


---------104:27----------
things then


---------104:28----------
bad behaviors start to arise again so


---------104:31----------
the key here is about the focus of the


---------104:33----------
mind because when y'all's mind is in the


---------104:35----------
right place


---------104:36----------
then you can control the behavior and


---------104:37----------
when your mind wanders then the behavior


---------104:39----------
controls you


---------104:41----------
which gets to this other idea of like


---------104:43----------
who are you and what is the behavior


---------104:45----------
because you guys are talking about this


---------104:48----------
thing


---------104:48----------
right like you use the phrase like


---------104:51----------
people were talking about this thing you


---------104:52----------
guys are like almost like you become


---------104:54----------
porn elementals and this is my favorite


---------104:57----------
like thing that i've stumbled upon in


---------104:59----------
stream recently


---------105:00----------
that you become one with the thing and


---------105:03----------
and and even if we if we like listen to


---------105:05----------
like flow flow saying that like


---------105:06----------
i've lost the battle before i even type


---------105:10----------
in the url


---------105:11----------
right so you become like one with this


---------105:13----------
thing and then you lose control and then


---------105:15----------
the scary thing is that there's actually


---------105:17----------
i don't know if you guys like this make


---------105:18----------
sense


---------105:19----------
but flo is actually trapped and he's


---------105:21----------
watching it happen


---------105:23----------
there's a part of his mind that is doing


---------105:25----------
something but flow's true his self is


---------105:28----------
watching it and he's screaming he's like


---------105:29----------
don't do it


---------105:30----------
don't do it but his mind is like [ __ ]


---------105:32----------
you flo


---------105:33----------
we're doing it right you know it's


---------105:36----------
happening and you know that you don't


---------105:37----------
want it to


---------105:39----------
and and the real flow is there and he's


---------105:41----------
watching


---------105:42----------
and he can't stop it and that that boat


---------105:46----------
of sale


---------105:47----------
so now this like gets to an important


---------105:48----------
thing about like okay how do you control


---------105:50----------
this thing so the first thing to


---------105:51----------
understand is that there's like


---------105:53----------
there's a brain but that's not


---------105:55----------
necessarily you


---------105:56----------
right so there are issues of like


---------105:58----------
dopamine and stuff like that which we'll


---------106:00----------
let's just talk about that for just a


---------106:02----------
second


---------106:04----------
so like y'all said so human beings have


---------106:07----------
evolved


---------106:08----------
to procreate that's why orgasm is so


---------106:12----------
pleasurable


---------106:13----------
right like it's it's pleasurable because


---------106:15----------
like if we didn't have a drive


---------106:17----------
to orgasm we like wouldn't procreate


---------106:20----------
so it's evolutionary that like


---------106:22----------
procreation and orgasm is like the most


---------106:25----------
like the highest goal of like a being


---------106:28----------
and so it's really really dangerous when


---------106:30----------
you guys have a shortcut to that feeling


---------106:34----------
because that's the end goal and if you


---------106:37----------
guys


---------106:38----------
can watch porn on your on your computer


---------106:40----------
screen or a mobile phone or


---------106:41----------
you know whatever and like why do you


---------106:45----------
need to do anything so if you guys are


---------106:46----------
thinking about like it's interesting


---------106:47----------
because a community


---------106:48----------
a question that we get from our


---------106:49----------
community is like how do we get


---------106:50----------
motivated


---------106:52----------
and now we can kind of see because it's


---------106:53----------
almost i i think it was andy who was


---------106:55----------
kind of saying that like


---------106:56----------
when you like you don't feel like doing


---------106:59----------
anything after you masturbate


---------107:01----------
and when you do it a ton you get this


---------107:03----------
brain fog


---------107:04----------
and what does that even mean it's like


---------107:05----------
it's sort of like this


---------107:07----------
complete lack of motivation like i


---------107:09----------
almost kind of think of you guys as sort


---------107:10----------
of like


---------107:11----------
pothead zombies right that's what brain


---------107:14----------
fog is


---------107:15----------
it's like you're just jerking off all


---------107:17----------
the time and like you're not really


---------107:18----------
doing anything and you're sort of like


---------107:20----------
you're not really even alive you're like


---------107:21----------
some sort of weird half-life


---------107:23----------
kind of creature and


---------107:26----------
and so you know it's tricky because


---------107:29----------
there certainly is dopamine and then


---------107:31----------
like it you know as you as you orgasm so


---------107:33----------
this is like just now talking a little


---------107:34----------
bit about spirituality


---------107:36----------
so the interesting thing is that a


---------107:37----------
blissful state is actually a no mind


---------107:40----------
state and one of the


---------107:40----------
quickest ways to get to a blissful state


---------107:43----------
with awareness is orgasm


---------107:45----------
so that's why tantric sex is actually


---------107:48----------
such a powerful technique


---------107:49----------
it's because it's a meditative practice


---------107:51----------
that brings you to like


---------107:52----------
a point of no mind so you're aware but


---------107:55----------
you have like no


---------107:56----------
thoughts you have no emotions you have


---------107:58----------
no feelings you just


---------107:59----------
exist purely in that moment which is


---------108:02----------
what orgasm is which is why it's so


---------108:03----------
addicting


---------108:05----------
and so meditation is actually the


---------108:07----------
process


---------108:08----------
of cultivating the mental state of


---------108:10----------
orgasm at all times


---------108:13----------
and when you have that state that's what


---------108:14----------
moksha is moksha is liberation or


---------108:17----------
enlightenment


---------108:18----------
it's essentially a state of perpetual


---------108:19----------
orgasm


---------108:22----------
and and not to say that it's actually


---------108:24----------
perpetual orgasm but it's the state of


---------108:26----------
consciousness


---------108:27----------
that orgasm creates for a few moments


---------108:30----------
that's what mork does and that's why


---------108:32----------
people use so satguru uses this word joy


---------108:35----------
so the word is anand it's bliss


---------108:38----------
and and now we get to something kind of


---------108:40----------
interesting which is like when you


---------108:41----------
meditate you start to do this stuff


---------108:42----------
as you start to feel feelings like how


---------108:45----------
is that good like isn't that bad


---------108:47----------
isn't that what you want to escape from


---------108:49----------
and someone said something about like


---------108:51----------
there are ups and downs but those feel


---------108:54----------
it feels good to feel them and now we


---------108:57----------
get to a really really important point


---------108:59----------
about spirituality which is that the


---------109:01----------
enlightened person


---------109:03----------
is not free of pain they have a certain


---------109:06----------
tranquility


---------109:07----------
with respect to the ups and downs that


---------109:10----------
allows them to somehow appreciate the


---------109:12----------
bad things in life


---------109:15----------
and that [ __ ] is op so that's your


---------109:18----------
ultimate salvation


---------109:20----------
imagine for a moment that a good thing


---------109:22----------
in your life and a bad thing in your


---------109:23----------
life


---------109:24----------
is something that you can deal with in


---------109:26----------
the same way


---------109:27----------
that you don't have to retreat from


---------109:29----------
badness


---------109:31----------
that is the most op buff you can ever


---------109:33----------
get


---------109:35----------
because suddenly things that are boring


---------109:37----------
or shaming are not things that


---------109:39----------
restrict your behavior they don't


---------109:41----------
control you anymore


---------109:43----------
and ultimately what i see you guys doing


---------109:45----------
is is a journey of control


---------109:48----------
that's what this is it's understanding


---------109:50----------
and control it's a journey of


---------109:51----------
how to control the self so now we get to


---------109:56----------
brahmacarya


---------109:58----------
so brahmacarya means to dwell in god


---------110:01----------
brahman really which is cosmic


---------110:03----------
consciousness or universal consciousness


---------110:06----------
and it means to have your mind focus on


---------110:09----------
things


---------110:10----------
on the divine as opposed to get lost in


---------110:13----------
desires


---------110:14----------
so brahmacari is sometimes translated as


---------110:16----------
celibacy


---------110:18----------
because it but really what it is is


---------110:20----------
non-lawfulness you can still actually


---------110:22----------
have sex


---------110:22----------
and be a brahmacari it's just you're not


---------110:25----------
allowed to be horny


---------110:27----------
so it it's it's control over it's it's


---------110:30----------
about


---------110:31----------
not losing your mind in the desire


---------110:35----------
right so like even even when we think


---------110:37----------
about like i'm kind of envisioning like


---------110:39----------
this the scenario where flo is like


---------110:41----------
he's opening up his browser and he's


---------110:42----------
like typing something into his url bar


---------110:44----------
and in that moment his mind is lost in


---------110:47----------
that


---------110:48----------
desire even though flow's aware of it


---------110:50----------
but like that the mind is kind of like


---------110:51----------
on autopilot at that point there's


---------110:53----------
like autopilot autopilot autopilot


---------110:55----------
that's what we've heard from you guys


---------110:56----------
over and over and over again so the


---------110:59----------
value of brahmacharya is that


---------111:00----------
you know as you guys grapple with this


---------111:02----------
and i want everyone who's watching to


---------111:04----------
really like understand this


---------111:05----------
these guys have grown immensely like


---------111:07----------
they understand this [ __ ] in a way that


---------111:09----------
very few people in our community do


---------111:11----------
and bizarrely like that's because


---------111:13----------
they've been grappling with themselves


---------111:15----------
for a long time


---------111:17----------
this is what happens this is what


---------111:18----------
spiritual growth actually looks like


---------111:20----------
it's grappling with yourself right and


---------111:23----------
it's like sort of saying like okay like


---------111:25----------
this is what my mind is doing


---------111:26----------
and then we see all these kinds of


---------111:27----------
effects like an appreciation for


---------111:29----------
negative emotions


---------111:30----------
which is bizarre the ability to sit with


---------111:33----------
it the ability to like feel better


---------111:35----------
afterward the ability to like process


---------111:37----------
and be somewhat past it


---------111:40----------
um


---------111:43----------
yeah like there's just so much stuff


---------111:45----------
about like being on autopilot like


---------111:46----------
the same [ __ ] every day like that's the


---------111:48----------
problem of our community


---------111:50----------
and what i'm hearing from you guys is


---------111:52----------
when you all know fat for a while


---------111:55----------
you don't it doesn't feel like life is


---------111:57----------
the same [ __ ] every day


---------111:59----------
and that's what living a life with


---------112:01----------
awareness is


---------112:02----------
and so bizarrely i think that nofap is a


---------112:04----------
wonderful spiritual tool because


---------112:06----------
you guys are constantly looking at


---------112:08----------
yourself because that's the only way


---------112:10----------
that you can


---------112:11----------
succeed with no fat you have to be


---------112:13----------
watching your desires


---------112:15----------
like you have to be aware of your


---------112:17----------
boredom


---------112:18----------
your not laziness what was it boredom


---------112:24----------
anyway whatever the blast actually is


---------112:26----------
angry angry yeah


---------112:27----------
yeah blast right right so like you guys


---------112:30----------
are watching yourself and all you have


---------112:31----------
to do is watch yourself


---------112:33----------
and then you'll start to gain control


---------112:36----------
and then as you gain control like


---------112:37----------
suddenly you get these buffs which is


---------112:39----------
like


---------112:40----------
sadness does not impact your action


---------112:43----------
that is one of the most op buffs shame


---------112:46----------
does not


---------112:46----------
impact your action you're able to sit


---------112:48----------
with it and that too even when we use


---------112:51----------
the phrase


---------112:52----------
sit with it you're no longer an


---------112:55----------
elemental at that point


---------112:57----------
because you can't when you're when you


---------112:59----------
are it that's when you're an elemental


---------113:01----------
the literally the process of sitting


---------113:03----------
with it is for flow to be there


---------113:05----------
and then the emotion or the desire or


---------113:07----------
the urge to be here and you're just


---------113:09----------
chilling with it and it's there with you


---------113:11----------
but that means that you are not


---------113:13----------
it it creates separation and over time


---------113:15----------
you'll control it


---------113:17----------
that's what happens


---------113:20----------
so when when zizi said that addiction is


---------113:23----------
a spiritual malady like i completely


---------113:25----------
agree


---------113:26----------
it's also a biological melody it's also


---------113:29----------
an energetic


---------113:30----------
malady but it's absolutely a spiritual


---------113:33----------
malady this is what i think is basically


---------113:35----------
lost in western understanding of the


---------113:38----------
mind


---------113:39----------
is that we think of it as exclusively


---------113:41----------
psychiatry


---------113:42----------
which are is there dopamine stuff is


---------113:44----------
there addiction stuff is there escapism


---------113:46----------
does therapy help


---------113:46----------
is there trauma like absolutely all of


---------113:49----------
those things


---------113:51----------
and that doesn't explain all of it


---------113:54----------
because there's also this level of like


---------113:56----------
hungry ghosts where there's something


---------113:57----------
within you


---------113:58----------
that just wants to like eat and eat and


---------114:00----------
eat and it never gets filled


---------114:02----------
right the more you masturbate like it


---------114:04----------
doesn't work


---------114:07----------
um yeah so like


---------114:10----------
where do you like is there hope for you


---------114:11----------
guys absolutely


---------114:13----------
you guys are way further along the path


---------114:16----------
than you realize


---------114:17----------
i mean flow's here asking the question


---------114:19----------
is there a hope for me and like the dude


---------114:21----------
has gone


---------114:22----------
364 days


---------114:25----------
without relapsing and relapse i agree is


---------114:29----------
part of the process like


---------114:30----------
you know so is there a hope for you


---------114:32----------
absolutely i think you guys are further


---------114:33----------
along than you realize


---------114:36----------
and at the end of the day because like


---------114:38----------
you said it's not


---------114:39----------
you know it's it the this this thought


---------114:42----------
pattern that arises in your mind is porn


---------114:44----------
addiction


---------114:45----------
is separate from actual like sexuality


---------114:47----------
and connection with another human being


---------114:49----------
and over time if you stop feeding it


---------114:51----------
it'll die


---------114:52----------
out the problem is that like it's grown


---------114:54----------
into a pretty big tree because you guys


---------114:56----------
have been


---------114:57----------
fertilizing it and watering it and


---------114:58----------
feeding it since the age of 10 to 12.


---------115:02----------
right so it's going to take a couple


---------115:04----------
years for it to completely die out but


---------115:05----------
you don't have to wait a couple years to


---------115:07----------
start making significant progress


---------115:09----------
what i'm hearing from you guys is that


---------115:10----------
you all are looking for your dharma


---------115:12----------
you're finding motivation


---------115:14----------
you're learning how to relate to women


---------115:15----------
like even when zizi says


---------115:17----------
i see my insecurities like that's what


---------115:19----------
this community is about


---------115:21----------
and like he sees his insecurity and once


---------115:23----------
he sees it then he can start to like


---------115:25----------
deal with it right he's like oh she


---------115:27----------
works 72 hours a week it has nothing to


---------115:29----------
do with me and that's how you start to


---------115:33----------
be like comfortable in a relationship


---------115:34----------
when they don't like text you back


---------115:37----------
it's because you acknowledge that your


---------115:39----------
insecurity doesn't prey


---------115:41----------
on a normal occurrence in the outside


---------115:42----------
world because this is what our mind does


---------115:44----------
it find something completely normal and


---------115:48----------
it preys on it


---------115:49----------
oh they didn't invite me to the party


---------115:51----------
i'm the only person who didn't get


---------115:52----------
invited


---------115:53----------
oh [ __ ] i changed my cell phone number


---------115:55----------
no one had a way of getting


---------115:56----------
a hold of me but we don't care our mind


---------115:59----------
doesn't care


---------116:00----------
because the insecurity is what we


---------116:02----------
believe when we become the insecure


---------116:04----------
elemental everything around us


---------116:07----------
feeds our insecurity and we just can't


---------116:09----------
see it


---------116:11----------
so overall i think you guys are doing


---------116:13----------
fantastic


---------116:15----------
um you know i think


---------116:18----------
i think just keep at it and the last


---------116:20----------
thing is i mean as you guys have already


---------116:21----------
said it sounds like the community has


---------116:23----------
been helpful


---------116:25----------
and so like keep engaging the community


---------116:27----------
and like


---------116:28----------
you know it sounds like you guys hang


---------116:29----------
out on our discord which is cool i


---------116:31----------
didn't know that [ __ ] like this happened


---------116:32----------
i mean i've always wondered whether


---------116:34----------
we're actually helping people or not


---------116:36----------
and and after hearing you guys i


---------116:38----------
actually feel pretty good about the work


---------116:39----------
that we're doing because you all have


---------116:40----------
grown immensely it's crazy


---------116:42----------
i never thought i would be able to talk


---------116:43----------
about this kind of stuff on


---------116:45----------
like in like these are higher level


---------116:48----------
discussions about like


---------116:49----------
brahmacharya like what it means and sort


---------116:52----------
of building awareness


---------116:54----------
and how like that's gonna happen like


---------116:56----------
everyone's wondering


---------116:57----------
how do you process your emotions you


---------116:58----------
guys are processing your emotions y'all


---------117:00----------
are doing it


---------117:01----------
everyone's like how like i don't know


---------117:02----------
exactly how but y'all are doing it


---------117:05----------
when when flo is sitting there in a bad


---------117:07----------
crying next to his girlfriend


---------117:08----------
and he's being the ultimate beta cuck


---------117:11----------
like that's


---------117:11----------
that's that's processing your emotions


---------117:15----------
yeah and then like over time those


---------117:18----------
emotions will burden you less


---------117:22----------
and they like won't weigh on you and


---------117:23----------
once they stop weighing on you


---------117:25----------
then you guys will be able to like move


---------117:27----------
forward without that [ __ ] on your back


---------117:31----------
and people were talking about you know


---------117:33----------
great people suffered from


---------117:35----------
like some of them suffered from great


---------117:36----------
things i think that's the reason they're


---------117:37----------
great


---------117:39----------
that's where greatness comes from it


---------117:41----------
comes from overcoming


---------117:42----------
challenges and triumphing and


---------117:44----------
understanding yourself


---------117:46----------
and the last point that i'll say is like


---------117:48----------
dharma so everyone's asking like how do


---------117:50----------
i find my dharma you guys


---------117:52----------
i've really done a bad job of explaining


---------117:54----------
this you don't find you're talking about


---------117:55----------
your dharma finds you


---------118:00----------
right so like healthy gamer like i


---------118:01----------
didn't i didn't like wake up


---------118:03----------
at the age of 20 and say like i'm gonna


---------118:06----------
try to help gamers


---------118:09----------
understand nofap that's absurd


---------118:13----------
it's dumb even six months ago


---------118:16----------
it was like we're gonna help gamers with


---------118:18----------
no that was it's absurd


---------118:22----------
so the boat best thing that you can do


---------118:23----------
is exactly what you all are doing


---------118:25----------
which is that you're you're not ready


---------118:27----------
for your


---------118:29----------
your karma will give you your dharma


---------118:32----------
when you're ready


---------118:33----------
and if you guys continue living like a


---------118:35----------
zombie on autopilot your


---------118:37----------
target will never present itself


---------118:40----------
it's kind of like saying like where's


---------118:42----------
the final boss like the final boss is in


---------118:43----------
the final boss room


---------118:45----------
but if you just hang around in like the


---------118:47----------
starting zone


---------118:49----------
afk then you're never going to find the


---------118:52----------
final boss


---------118:54----------
so your first dharma is to yourself this


---------118:57----------
is what the brahmacharya the stage of


---------118:59----------
life


---------119:00----------
that zizi was talking about the first


---------119:01----------
stage of life is brahmacharya


---------119:04----------
which is weird because it's kind of got


---------119:05----------
a double definition but what this means


---------119:07----------
is like it's kind of the student phase


---------119:08----------
that you should prepare yourself


---------119:10----------
and once you guys are ready for a


---------119:12----------
relationship a relationship will happen


---------119:16----------
once you guys are ready to save the


---------119:17----------
world the world will need saving


---------119:19----------
but y'all aren't ready yet so continue


---------119:22----------
doing the work that you're doing


---------119:23----------
continue working on yourself


---------119:25----------
continue leveling up and then eventually


---------119:27----------
the final boss will show up


---------119:30----------
and when it shows up you all will either


---------119:31----------
be ready or you won't be ready


---------119:34----------
right now life is giving you guys a


---------119:35----------
little bit of a pass because it's not


---------119:36----------
like you don't have aggro yet


---------119:38----------
which is good because you're not ready


---------119:42----------
and as someone i can tell you guys you


---------119:44----------
don't find dharma it just dumps itself


---------119:45----------
in your lap like


---------119:47----------
when you guys are ready thousands of


---------119:48----------
people on the internet will start asking


---------119:50----------
you for help


---------119:52----------
and right now there are people asking


---------119:54----------
you for help


---------119:55----------
it's crazy right


---------119:59----------
because like y'all have had struggles


---------120:02----------
and y'all have been there for each other


---------120:04----------
so that's your dharma


---------120:07----------
how did you find that


---------120:12----------
through your streams actually i would


---------120:15----------
say


---------120:16----------
through all the through all the pain and


---------120:18----------
negativity and suffering


---------120:19----------
it led to that understanding yeah


---------120:23----------
so our streams are karma right flo so so


---------120:26----------
you were ready to help someone


---------120:28----------
and when you were ready the stream


---------120:30----------
showed up and and sent you to our


---------120:32----------
community


---------120:33----------
but ultimately it's you who decided to


---------120:35----------
join the discord it's you who decided to


---------120:37----------
hang out in the brahmacharya


---------120:39----------
section and it's you who decided to both


---------120:41----------
share and support other people


---------120:44----------
so that's exactly what i'm saying like


---------120:46----------
dr k arose because


---------120:48----------
you were ready for that next phase of


---------120:50----------
your growth


---------120:52----------
and so when you guys are ready someone


---------120:54----------
will show up and this is the whole point


---------120:56----------
that we've been talking about is like


---------120:57----------
it's not it doesn't have to be me


---------121:01----------
you guys are doing the work and just


---------121:03----------
keep doing it and there's like


---------121:04----------
dude so much hope


---------121:08----------
so much hope you guys have no idea like


---------121:10----------
how far


---------121:11----------
like y'all are killing it that's that's


---------121:13----------
the greatest thing i've heard


---------121:14----------
ever yeah seriously i i i don't think


---------121:17----------
you're saying that


---------121:18----------
i don't think you guys understand how


---------121:19----------
you actually sound like you should go


---------121:21----------
back and watch the vod


---------121:22----------
because you guys have behind you what


---------121:25----------
half of our community thinks is the end


---------121:26----------
goal


---------121:28----------
and so like yeah like i know fap for 364


---------121:31----------
days and i felt motivated and


---------121:33----------
started to get in touch with my emotions


---------121:35----------
and like you know had my girlfriend and


---------121:37----------
like


---------121:37----------
cried in front of her and maybe she


---------121:39----------
dumped you we don't know but sounds like


---------121:40----------
she didn't


---------121:42----------
she's still there right so like what the


---------121:44----------
[ __ ]


---------121:47----------
you know and and it's like people are


---------121:49----------
like you guys have a history of trauma


---------121:51----------
and then we have like


---------121:52----------
you know odd size like roller coaster of


---------121:55----------
like atheism spirituality religion and


---------121:57----------
self-growth like


---------121:58----------
that's what people want right it's like


---------122:01----------
i want to wake up and be able to take a


---------122:02----------
cold shower every day like and


---------122:04----------
and go running like that's you guys are


---------122:06----------
living representations of the goals of


---------122:08----------
most of our community


---------122:10----------
and you ask me is there hope the [ __ ]


---------122:13----------
[Music]


---------122:16----------
that's what the shame really does to you


---------122:18----------
like it really leaves you helpless


---------122:20----------
yep so good so so


---------122:23----------
flo that's why there's hope for you


---------122:25----------
because now you're able to see


---------122:27----------
that your lack of hope is not a truth


---------122:30----------
it's your mind and it's the shame and


---------122:33----------
it's not


---------122:34----------
actually that you don't have hope like


---------122:36----------
that's it right there that's the


---------122:37----------
understanding i don't know if you guys


---------122:38----------
saw that


---------122:40----------
that's the shift he just did it


---------122:44----------
that's what the shame does to me right


---------122:47----------
his earlier question was do i have hope


---------122:50----------
and now he says that's what the shame


---------122:52----------
did to me he's now separate from the


---------122:54----------
shame


---------122:54----------
he's separate from the hopelessness and


---------122:57----------
it's in that space


---------123:00----------
that growth happens and that's the space


---------123:02----------
in which you get control over your life


---------123:05----------
fantastic all right we meditating


---------123:10----------
yes please yeah let's do it okay so um


---------123:15----------
all right so we're gonna this may be


---------123:17----------
something that you guys are actually


---------123:18----------
good at we're gonna do something that's


---------123:20----------
a little bit more open today


---------123:22----------
which is just how to sit with yourself


---------123:25----------
okay so like this is what i want you


---------123:26----------
guys to do i want you to sit up straight


---------123:29----------
not gonna even do any like breathing or


---------123:30----------
anything like that actually yeah let's


---------123:32----------
do this one


---------123:34----------
um okay so


---------123:37----------
what i want everybody to do we're gonna


---------123:39----------
play a fun game so everyone asks a


---------123:40----------
question


---------123:41----------
you know how do i change on the inside


---------123:44----------
and then what i always say is like all


---------123:45----------
you have to do is be aware


---------123:47----------
and notice and that's sufficient for


---------123:49----------
change and then everyone scratches their


---------123:50----------
head and is super confused


---------123:52----------
so we're going to teach you that right


---------123:53----------
now so i want you guys to close your


---------123:54----------
eyes


---------123:58----------
i want you to put your palms face up on


---------124:00----------
your knees


---------124:03----------
and focus on the sensation of your palms


---------124:14----------
and now notice that you have a certain


---------124:16----------
pattern of breath


---------124:20----------
and i want you to focus on your


---------124:22----------
breathing


---------124:24----------
but don't change it


---------124:27----------
don't control it just observe it


---------124:43----------
so what's happening to your breath as


---------124:44----------
you begin to observe it


---------125:12----------
now i guess that if you guys are trying


---------125:14----------
this practice that your breath


---------125:15----------
changes as you observe it


---------125:20----------
stop changing it let it go back to


---------125:32----------
normal


---------126:04----------
and try as you might the breath will


---------126:06----------
likely change if you observe it


---------126:09----------
so now what we're going to do is


---------126:13----------
focus on any sensation your body will be


---------126:16----------
sending you signals


---------126:19----------
learn to sit with them


---------126:22----------
the signal may be a thought


---------126:26----------
it may be an itch


---------126:29----------
it may be a tension


---------126:44----------
there may be a demand a desire to change


---------126:49----------
position


---------126:54----------
watch that impulse


---------127:56----------
now let yourself come back


---------128:10----------
so is anybody able to


---------128:15----------
observe the breath without changing it


---------128:21----------
so i'm seeing some people shake their


---------128:23----------
head no some people are saying yes


---------128:26----------
it's very it's like a razor's edge


---------128:30----------
you can feel you can feel get to a point


---------128:33----------
when it's when you're doing okay and


---------128:35----------
then it'll snap back again


---------128:37----------
and try to control it and you can feel


---------128:40----------
that


---------128:41----------
movement of the mind or the will


---------128:44----------
or whatever it is it's very subtle


---------128:48----------
i i feel like i started noticing my


---------128:49----------
breath and i started controlling it


---------128:52----------
but the more and more i kept noticing my


---------128:54----------
breath i kind of like


---------128:55----------
stopped focusing on it and i kind of


---------128:57----------
like started calming down


---------128:59----------
and then the moment like i started


---------129:01----------
having a thought about my breath that's


---------129:02----------
when it started changing again


---------129:05----------
so by itself like when i just by trying


---------129:08----------
not to control it


---------129:09----------
i stopped controlling like thinking


---------129:10----------
about controlling it


---------129:12----------
it started like kind of taking me in and


---------129:14----------
when i thought about it started


---------129:15----------
controlling again


---------129:17----------
what was the thing yeah flow going


---------129:21----------
i think what bob said was basically like


---------129:23----------
meditation summarized that you like


---------129:26----------
you notice this um


---------129:30----------
line that you can that you are able to


---------129:32----------
cross and you do like reps


---------129:34----------
like you notice that you get lost that's


---------129:36----------
basically


---------129:37----------
like meditation and you do it again and


---------129:39----------
again and again and again


---------129:40----------
yeah so my natural breath was pretty


---------129:44----------
shallow


---------129:44----------
and whenever i gave it awareness i


---------129:45----------
started actually breathing deeper and


---------129:47----------
longer


---------129:48----------
breaths


---------129:51----------
same with me so i mean


---------129:55----------
i i think that the main point here is


---------129:58----------
that like first of all


---------130:00----------
what was uh where you


---------130:02----------
[Music]


---------130:04----------
how did you guys feel when you were


---------130:05----------
meditating when your mind was focused on


---------130:07----------
the breath


---------130:11----------
i'd say uh content is how i felt in that


---------130:13----------
moment there wasn't really like a worry


---------130:15----------
on my mind i was kind of just


---------130:16----------
okay very peaceful yeah


---------130:20----------
right so it's interesting because


---------130:21----------
sometimes in order to get that focus


---------130:23----------
you have to have a task that's difficult


---------130:27----------
and so to retain your focus very quickly


---------130:30----------
to observe the breath but don't change


---------130:32----------
it because that requires effort


---------130:35----------
and then the other interesting thing


---------130:38----------
is you know uh annie was kind of talking


---------130:42----------
about how like


---------130:44----------
the more he focused on it the more it


---------130:46----------
changed but the more that he let go


---------130:48----------
focusing on it


---------130:49----------
the more natural it became and then but


---------130:52----------
at the same time like


---------130:53----------
like it sounds like letting go focusing


---------130:56----------
on it was


---------130:57----------
shattered by the presence of a thought


---------131:01----------
and then he tries to control it again


---------131:03----------
and so now i'm gonna turn


---------131:04----------
that's a very important principle that


---------131:06----------
very few people understand


---------131:08----------
so now i'm gonna go back to flow do you


---------131:10----------
have hope absolutely


---------131:12----------
all you need to do to keep on


---------131:14----------
progressing is stop worrying about


---------131:16----------
progressing


---------131:19----------
that's steep right it's exactly what


---------131:22----------
annie said which is like when you're


---------131:24----------
trying you're like am i doing it am i


---------131:26----------
doing it am i doing it and then your


---------131:28----------
shame is gonna say no


---------131:30----------
but how did you go 364 days


---------131:36----------
by focusing in the present and not


---------131:38----------
trying to go 364 days


---------131:43----------
if you say to yourself i'm going to be


---------131:44----------
sober for a year you're [ __ ]


---------131:48----------
i feel like with meditation though


---------131:50----------
there's like this


---------131:52----------
way you can have not enough focus


---------131:55----------
like there's like that you can be too


---------131:58----------
relaxed


---------131:59----------
and you can have too much focus and you


---------132:02----------
need to realize both of them


---------132:04----------
in order to get at like the point that


---------132:07----------
you need to be to meditate


---------132:08----------
so that point is best translated


---------132:12----------
into english is transcendence


---------132:15----------
there's an axis of focus on focus


---------132:20----------
and when you move beyond that axis


---------132:22----------
that's what transcendence is


---------132:25----------
so it's not that there are good days and


---------132:27----------
bad days we prefer good days over bad


---------132:29----------
days


---------132:30----------
but sometimes we can we can actually


---------132:33----------
appreciate both of them for what they


---------132:34----------
are


---------132:35----------
so we move beyond the axis into


---------132:37----------
transcendence and that's where


---------132:39----------
tranquility comes from


---------132:43----------
right because that's your money state


---------132:44----------
thing yeah


---------132:46----------
um i've spoken to the other guys about


---------132:49----------
it but


---------132:50----------
um i'll be attending a retreat


---------132:54----------
my first retreat and um i'm really


---------132:56----------
looking forward to it i think it's going


---------132:58----------
to be a lot of pain of a personal


---------132:59----------
retreat


---------133:01----------
um and as we've already been talking


---------133:04----------
about meditation is there anything like


---------133:06----------
you want to


---------133:07----------
give me for the retreat like any advice


---------133:10----------
or something


---------133:12----------
no okay


---------133:17----------
if you're yeah i mean if you're doing a


---------133:19----------
vibration treat you're doing a


---------133:20----------
passionate retreat there's nothing that


---------133:22----------
i say now that is going to influence


---------133:24----------
your experience of the retreat trust me


---------133:31----------
what do you think of like uh double mean


---------133:33----------
detoxing so i was actually thinking i


---------133:35----------
was finding myself like


---------133:37----------
being more uh like not relapsing by


---------133:41----------
controlling my environment more


---------133:42----------
and i was thinking maybe taking a week


---------133:44----------
of uh


---------133:45----------
removing all my electronic devices maybe


---------133:48----------
that's a bit too much


---------133:49----------
i'm thinking but uh maybe just like a


---------133:52----------
call and text phone and


---------133:53----------
just that so i can just communicate with


---------133:55----------
people if i need to but


---------133:57----------
i don't know what's your thoughts on


---------133:58----------
that i mean i think a dopamine detox


---------134:00----------
is a really good idea but it's hard to


---------134:02----------
do and should be set up properly


---------134:04----------
so i think the hardest thing about a


---------134:06----------
dopamine detox is people just sort of


---------134:07----------
like start doing it


---------134:09----------
but like i think that your environment


---------134:11----------
is very very important


---------134:12----------
so just for people to understand so


---------134:14----------
you're dope like just like any other


---------134:16----------
receptor in your brain you have a


---------134:18----------
certain amount of like dopamine


---------134:20----------
tolerance and so like if you think about


---------134:22----------
if you haven't played games for a while


---------134:24----------
and you sit down and you play a game


---------134:25----------
it's like a ton of fun


---------134:27----------
and the more you play the less fun it


---------134:29----------
becomes but then you don't even know why


---------134:31----------
you're playing it


---------134:31----------
you can't stop but it's not actually fun


---------134:34----------
that's when your dopamine tolerance sort


---------134:36----------
of builds up


---------134:36----------
right and it's just like caffeine


---------134:38----------
tolerance or nicotine tolerance or


---------134:39----------
alcohol tolerance


---------134:40----------
where you can get a certain amount of


---------134:42----------
dose and it doesn't create the


---------134:44----------
particular


---------134:45----------
effect and then you can grow dependent


---------134:48----------
on a minimum dose


---------134:49----------
so if you're addicted to caffeine if


---------134:51----------
you're dependent on caffeine


---------134:52----------
you know it's not that caffeine actually


---------134:54----------
like wakes you up it's just you become


---------134:56----------
dependent on it to function normally


---------135:00----------
so dopamine detoxing is the idea of like


---------135:02----------
resetting your dopamine circuitry which


---------135:04----------
actually takes like honestly


---------135:06----------
around two weeks three weeks and so i


---------135:08----------
think the biggest thing is that you have


---------135:10----------
to set up


---------135:11----------
activities that you can do like you


---------135:13----------
can't just


---------135:14----------
like replacement works way better than


---------135:17----------
abstinence


---------135:19----------
yeah so i was kind of thinking of for


---------135:21----------
the week to kind of focus more on


---------135:22----------
reading books like i was going to buy a


---------135:25----------
bo i bought a book


---------135:26----------
and uh i was going to kind of read the


---------135:27----------
book in the week and run focus on just


---------135:30----------
running


---------135:30----------
and reading the book yeah so like how


---------135:32----------
many hours are you going to run


---------135:36----------
a day anywhere from about uh


---------135:39----------
i'm like an endurance runner so i like


---------135:41----------
to run like anywhere from six to


---------135:43----------
eight miles in a day and uh probably i


---------135:46----------
don't know anywhere from two to four


---------135:47----------
hours with a bunch of breaks in


---------135:49----------
yeah okay and what how many hours are


---------135:51----------
you planning on reading


---------135:52----------
um hopefully anywhere from two to four


---------135:54----------
hours maybe i mean i don't read at all


---------135:56----------
so i think


---------135:57----------
reading like the first few days was


---------135:58----------
probably gonna be something like


---------136:00----------
i'm just gonna sit on my bed all day and


---------136:01----------
stare at the ceiling because i have


---------136:02----------
nothing else yeah that sounds like


---------136:04----------
that's not gonna work well


---------136:06----------
right so so like if you're gonna run for


---------136:08----------
two hours and you're gonna read a book


---------136:10----------
for two hours


---------136:11----------
then i think it's optimistic to think


---------136:13----------
about what you're gonna do for the other


---------136:14----------
12.


---------136:16----------
so so like this is where like i think


---------136:17----------
good dopamine detoxes involve a bunch of


---------136:20----------
stuff


---------136:21----------
right so like sometimes people will do


---------136:23----------
meal prep to learn how to cook


---------136:25----------
cooking and cleaning can take a long


---------136:26----------
time like i think about a couple of


---------136:27----------
projects


---------136:28----------
like are the things that you want to


---------136:30----------
work on


---------136:32----------
i was going to work on some music as


---------136:33----------
well yeah okay so like like i


---------136:35----------
you know the last thing about a dopamine


---------136:37----------
detox is it it's good if you do it with


---------136:39----------
someone


---------136:40----------
so you can check in with like i


---------136:42----------
recommend checking in with someone like


---------136:43----------
you know find two or three people


---------136:45----------
check in with people like for 15 minutes


---------136:47----------
a day and say like hey how's it going


---------136:48----------
like


---------136:49----------
what's your plan for the day things like


---------136:51----------
that


---------136:52----------
and then and then i mean i think


---------136:54----------
dopamine detoxes are like sort of


---------136:55----------
semi-naturally done like when you go


---------136:57----------
sometimes on like vacation and stuff


---------136:59----------
like if you go hiking


---------137:01----------
or something like that like i you know i


---------137:03----------
know cobit is tricky and depending on


---------137:04----------
where you are and stuff but i i really


---------137:06----------
think about like packing your day


---------137:09----------
because your your enemy's gonna be bored


---------137:14----------
right so meal prep cooking


---------137:17----------
reading is great and then think about


---------137:20----------
other things that are also like somewhat


---------137:22----------
stimulating


---------137:23----------
and the last thing about a dopamine


---------137:24----------
detox is understand that reading is


---------137:26----------
going to be hard


---------137:27----------
right it's not going to be fun at the


---------137:29----------
beginning


---------137:30----------
i think about an audio book too that's


---------137:32----------
something that you can kind of do that's


---------137:33----------
a little


---------137:35----------
besides reading


---------137:38----------
sound good yeah yeah i i kind of thought


---------137:41----------
that it's a bit too extreme to just


---------137:43----------
you know read a book and just run i i i


---------137:46----------
think i would succeed


---------137:47----------
anyway that's why i wanted to get it i


---------137:49----------
mean i think it's fine to try


---------137:50----------
right like so so you don't have to


---------137:52----------
succeed to learn


---------137:54----------
and grow and then like you can i mean at


---------137:56----------
the least maybe


---------137:57----------
in three days you'll relapse but at


---------137:59----------
least for three days like you'll be


---------138:00----------
better at reading books


---------138:02----------
i'm just trying to change like um


---------138:05----------
the hap like i feel like i have such a


---------138:08----------
dopamine fix that i need every day on


---------138:09----------
youtube


---------138:10----------
on twitch or whatever so i'm kind of


---------138:11----------
trying to transition slowly to like


---------138:15----------
because i don't like if you're going to


---------138:16----------
play video games all day and then you're


---------138:18----------
trying to read a book


---------138:18----------
in my case the book is unreadable i can


---------138:21----------
read a paragraph


---------138:22----------
because it doesn't give you as much


---------138:23----------
dopamine so i'm trying to kind of train


---------138:24----------
myself to


---------138:25----------
go enjoy the simpler things right so


---------138:28----------
guys


---------138:29----------
