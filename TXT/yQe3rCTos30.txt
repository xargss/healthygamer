---------01:08----------
here i'm really glad you agreed to come


---------01:10----------
on


---------01:10----------
couple of ground rules first of all


---------01:13----------
nothing that you you don't have to talk


---------01:14----------
about anything that you don't want to


---------01:16----------
talk about


---------01:17----------
we oftentimes have a reputation for


---------01:20----------
people coming on and expressing a lot of


---------01:21----------
emotion but we don't have to do that


---------01:24----------
i really view this as i'm a resource for


---------01:26----------
you and so anything that you want to


---------01:28----------
talk about or anything that i could help


---------01:30----------
you with i'm more than happy to does


---------01:32----------
that work for you


---------01:33----------
yeah brilliant cool so anything that you


---------01:36----------
want to talk about or anything i can


---------01:37----------
help you with


---------01:38----------
this is this is the one where it's


---------01:40----------
difficult because we are this


---------01:42----------
i think


---------01:43----------
you guys reached out to me


---------01:45----------
in july


---------01:47----------
and and every time it's been like yeah


---------01:49----------
i'll come on this week and then


---------01:50----------
something will come up and i've been


---------01:52----------
incredibly busy um and i think one thing


---------01:55----------
the kind of two things that came out uh


---------01:57----------
one thing that came out through that


---------01:58----------
process was i'm really bad at organizing


---------02:00----------
myself i'm i'm terribly if not busy


---------02:04----------
mentally busy which is a different thing


---------02:05----------
entirely um like a lot of the time when


---------02:07----------
people ask me to do things to be like oh


---------02:09----------
no i'm busy which isn't always the case


---------02:10----------
i actually don't have that many things


---------02:11----------
to do a lot of the time but i'm very


---------02:13----------
mentally busy i don't always know


---------02:15----------
how to wrap my head around all the


---------02:17----------
things that are going off at once so you


---------02:19----------
know that's one thing uh and then i


---------02:21----------
suppose uh another thing that i i


---------02:24----------
thought about


---------02:25----------
uh probably a couple of weeks ago but


---------02:26----------
i'm i'm a little bit like i've got a bit


---------02:28----------
of brain fog because i just moved and


---------02:31----------
i'm like in that process of


---------02:33----------
you know like still a bit sleep deprived


---------02:35----------
and stuff but um


---------02:36----------
i was thinking about um


---------02:38----------
kind of this like


---------02:40----------
sense of of of self and like who i am in


---------02:43----------
terms of i was it was it came from like


---------02:45----------
a work related thing where i was like


---------02:48----------
thinking about um how to move forward


---------02:49----------
with some content stuff and i'm like


---------02:51----------
well


---------02:52----------
a lot of people will argue that uh


---------02:54----------
content creation um depending on how you


---------02:56----------
do it um is very personality based and i


---------02:59----------
was like okay great what do people like


---------03:01----------
what do i bring well and then i just


---------03:02----------
kind of sat there and i was like i have


---------03:04----------
no idea what about me makes me i was


---------03:07----------
like i don't understand that in this


---------03:08----------
like beautiful um so that was also um i


---------03:12----------
thought maybe a discussion that could be


---------03:14----------
interesting i don't really know i don't


---------03:15----------
have much to add about it since that was


---------03:17----------
kind of my question it's i have no idea


---------03:20----------
how to approach that problem but jack


---------03:22----------
something i thought about i think both


---------03:23----------
of those are perfect


---------03:25----------
um so i would love to talk to you about


---------03:27----------
either of those two things


---------03:29----------
uh or both


---------03:31----------
so here's what i heard one is that like


---------03:34----------
the


---------03:35----------
subjective feeling of being busy


---------03:38----------
may be disconnected from what your


---------03:41----------
calendar looks like


---------03:43----------
yeah totally


---------03:44----------
so we can try to understand like how


---------03:46----------
does that work


---------03:47----------
you know like what's going on what makes


---------03:49----------
us feel busy


---------03:50----------
um can i just tell you a quick story


---------03:52----------
about that by the way of course yeah


---------03:54----------
yeah so we had uh so we had a pilot at


---------03:57----------
healthy gamer that was high performance


---------03:59----------
coaching so it was sort of like working


---------04:01----------
with people who were more successful and


---------04:03----------
so there was a really interesting kind


---------04:05----------
of theme that came out of that which is


---------04:07----------
you know some people came into the group


---------04:08----------
coaching process expecting like tips


---------04:11----------
and they were like oh like they would


---------04:13----------
come in they say i want to work on my


---------04:14----------
work-life balance and so what they were


---------04:16----------
really hoping for is like a few weeks in


---------04:18----------
they were kind of disappointed because


---------04:20----------
they were like i was hoping to be like


---------04:21----------
more efficient right i was hoping i


---------04:22----------
could learn from other people who were


---------04:24----------
like more efficient i'd get tips and


---------04:26----------
then i could be more efficient and then


---------04:27----------
i could improve my work-life balance but


---------04:29----------
then what we sort of realized after


---------04:31----------
talking with them is that you know if


---------04:33----------
you were 10 more efficient what would


---------04:35----------
you do with the extra time


---------04:37----------
and the answer inevitably was work more


---------04:41----------
and so


---------04:42----------
yeah yeah so i think a lot of this comes


---------04:44----------
from the sort of the idea of like


---------04:47----------
you know where does mentally busy come


---------04:49----------
from


---------04:50----------
um


---------04:51----------
so we could definitely talk about that


---------04:53----------
and i think the other thing that is very


---------04:54----------
important is your sense of self so like


---------04:57----------
who are you and when you make content


---------04:59----------
what is it that people resonate with


---------05:02----------
and um what do you you know how do you


---------05:04----------
make content that is aligned with who


---------05:06----------
you are


---------05:09----------
uh which one do you want to start with


---------05:11----------
um


---------05:13----------
or which one's possible


---------05:15----------
i think the one that i'd benefit more


---------05:17----------
from is is probably the mentally busy


---------05:18----------
part


---------05:19----------
um i think i think that's the one i i'd


---------05:21----------
rather wrap my head around


---------05:23----------
okay then absolutely so we can first


---------05:26----------
notice what's made what's driving your


---------05:28----------
decision


---------05:29----------
oh


---------05:30----------
being more efficient


---------05:35----------
i'm very


---------05:36----------
one thing i know about myself is that um


---------05:39----------
i'm very success driven like throughout


---------05:42----------
every all of life it's kind of generally


---------05:45----------
that's the thing i'm striving for um and


---------05:48----------
i get very upset with failure to the


---------05:50----------
point like very upset with it it's


---------05:52----------
something and it doesn't even have to be


---------05:54----------
very big failure very minute things kind


---------05:56----------
of i don't have a very good sense of


---------05:58----------
scale


---------05:59----------
um i'm very black and white like it's


---------06:01----------
like uh success or failure and that's


---------06:03----------
kind of like the binary sort of system


---------06:05----------
in which everything is one or the other


---------06:07----------
uh and i know that's not quite right and


---------06:09----------
i'm trying to not be like that but how


---------06:11----------
do you know i'm not quite right


---------06:13----------
well because certain things


---------06:16----------
it's not that it's not quite right i


---------06:17----------
suppose it's more that it is detrimental


---------06:19----------
to me to get so deeply upset by these


---------06:22----------
things that i categorize as failure and


---------06:23----------
they're not really that bad like i know


---------06:26----------
deep down that they're not that bad but


---------06:27----------
i know also that i'm upset by them and


---------06:30----------
i'd rather not be because i find that in


---------06:32----------
being upset by them all i do is i become


---------06:35----------
less motivated i work less and i stumble


---------06:37----------
into more failures


---------06:39----------
which i then


---------06:40----------
like


---------06:41----------
you you know what it's like this cycle


---------06:43----------
that perpetuates yeah let me see if i


---------06:45----------
heard the cycle correctly you kind of


---------06:47----------
screw up


---------06:48----------
yeah you tell yourself oh it's not that


---------06:51----------
big of a deal you can bounce back from


---------06:53----------
this don't stress about it don't worry


---------06:55----------
about it if you free yourself of


---------06:57----------
screwing up you can go back to


---------06:59----------
succeeding


---------07:00----------
but


---------07:01----------
the debuff


---------07:02----------
from screwing up


---------07:04----------
causes you to screw up more


---------07:07----------
yes and then maybe even you start


---------07:09----------
beating yourself up for like why can't i


---------07:10----------
cleanse this debuff


---------07:13----------
yeah yeah that's totally it yeah


---------07:16----------
yeah so that's interesting what do you


---------07:17----------
think about that


---------07:19----------
it's i i think it's my my biggest


---------07:23----------
like not my biggest flawness so that


---------07:25----------
might not be the right word but it's the


---------07:27----------
thing i would wish i could get over


---------07:29----------
because it's the thing that i find


---------07:31----------
causes me to to i find that a lot of the


---------07:34----------
time when i'm not doing something it's


---------07:36----------
like it's because i'm annoyed about the


---------07:38----------
last thing that went wrong and that's


---------07:39----------
why this thing's going wrong and it's


---------07:40----------
like if i could just move on from the


---------07:42----------
last thing maybe i could put my full


---------07:44----------
attention into this thing okay


---------07:47----------
hmm


---------07:49----------
sounds like quite a pickle jack


---------07:51----------
uh i'm glad you think so i'm glad you


---------07:53----------
think it's a pickle as well


---------07:55----------
yeah but did you think


---------07:58----------
how does it feel when i say it sounds


---------07:59----------
like quite a pickle


---------08:01----------
well at that point then it's like it's


---------08:03----------
like oh okay then no one else like


---------08:05----------
it's good that i don't sorry it's not


---------08:06----------
good i mean it's it's more


---------08:09----------
normal that i don't have the answers


---------08:10----------
like i've not been able to figure this


---------08:11----------
out yeah and all of a sudden if you're


---------08:13----------
sat there like wow i don't know what you


---------08:14----------
know it's like well okay that's that


---------08:16----------
makes me feel like i've not been


---------08:18----------
there's a certain level of frustration


---------08:19----------
if you were to turn around immediately


---------08:20----------
and go this is how you fix that i'd be


---------08:22----------
like wow if i'd known this for the past


---------08:23----------
five years then i would have been you


---------08:25----------
know what i mean if it was such a simple


---------08:26----------
answer but to know it's not i suppose it


---------08:29----------
would make you feel stupid


---------08:31----------
yeah of course yeah i feel like yeah


---------08:33----------
yeah i don't think you're stupid jack


---------08:35----------
no


---------08:36----------
thank you


---------08:38----------
um i think what you're dealing with is


---------08:39----------
very hard and i think the reason it's


---------08:41----------
very hard is because


---------08:44----------
being the way that you are let me know


---------08:46----------
how this feels to you it you know it's


---------08:49----------
kind of like if you weren't so


---------08:50----------
detail-oriented if you didn't beat


---------08:52----------
yourself up so much would you be where


---------08:54----------
you are today


---------08:57----------
it's that's the difficult question i


---------08:59----------
don't really know i part of me would


---------09:00----------
possibly argue no maybe i feel like if i


---------09:02----------
wasn't as


---------09:04----------
um detail-oriented like you say i feel


---------09:06----------
like i'd uh coast more and i possibly


---------09:08----------
wouldn't push myself um like i do


---------09:10----------
because i do push myself quite hard


---------09:12----------
um and i don't mind that i'm quite happy


---------09:14----------
to be the person that stays up till like


---------09:16----------
stupid hours in the morning working i'm


---------09:18----------
quite fulfilled by being a worker


---------09:21----------
that that i enjoy but it's it's when


---------09:23----------
um it's the consequences of when that


---------09:26----------
goes wrong


---------09:27----------
how


---------09:28----------
it then screws me up for so much longer


---------09:30----------
afterwards that that's the problem i


---------09:32----------
don't that's the part i don't like


---------09:34----------
how do you feel about coasting


---------09:36----------
oh yeah no i can't do it i that i'm very


---------09:40----------
i wish i party wishes i could but then


---------09:42----------
i'd feel lazy


---------09:44----------
um and um i feel lazy enough as it is


---------09:46----------
and that is and i i feel like i probably


---------09:48----------
do work when you look at it but a lot of


---------09:51----------
the time i'll be like i feel lazy like


---------09:52----------
i'm i'm this is to give you a detail


---------09:55----------
this is a then a week where i felt lazy


---------09:57----------
and i moved on monday


---------09:59----------
and then i went out filming on tuesday i


---------10:01----------
unpacked all my things on wednesday


---------10:02----------
which i didn't like so did nothing but


---------10:03----------
unpack all day and i'm like i haven't


---------10:04----------
worked today


---------10:06----------
and then i went out filming all day on


---------10:07----------
thursday


---------10:08----------
and then friday


---------10:10----------
i packed some more and then my parents


---------10:11----------
came to visit and now it's monday


---------10:14----------
and i've felt like


---------10:15----------
wow i didn't get much done that week


---------10:17----------
where really when i think about it where


---------10:19----------
was the time to do all the things but i


---------10:21----------
i sat there all week thinking wow i


---------10:22----------
really need to like knuckle down next


---------10:24----------
week because i didn't do much and that's


---------10:27----------
yeah i i feel like we're coming up on


---------10:29----------
mentally busy


---------10:30----------
what do you think yes that's yes


---------10:33----------
yeah help me understand how i feel yeah


---------10:37----------
i feel like a lot of the time i've just


---------10:38----------
got a lot of things to be working on


---------10:42----------
and when i feel it's like that sort of


---------10:44----------
like test paralysis thing you know when


---------10:45----------
you've got too many things you're like


---------10:46----------
whoa well i'm just gonna back off and do


---------10:48----------
nothing it's like because that's the


---------10:50----------
easy you know it's like


---------10:52----------
yeah there's this i know i've got to


---------10:54----------
like i've got a million one list of


---------10:56----------
things i have to do in my head and then


---------10:58----------
it's like right


---------10:59----------
how do i


---------11:00----------
sometimes i'll just sit there and i'm


---------11:02----------
not really doing anything i'm not busy


---------11:03----------
in that moment but i feel busy because


---------11:05----------
like well i don't want to be


---------11:07----------
doing anything else because if we're


---------11:08----------
doing anything else i'm gonna take my


---------11:11----------
focus away from trying to figure out


---------11:12----------
what i should be doing


---------11:14----------
if that makes sense i realize yeah


---------11:16----------
absolutely it's also quite a complicated


---------11:17----------
thought process to explain because it's


---------11:19----------
a lot of it's busyness and busyness is


---------11:21----------
difficult to kind of you know so jack i


---------11:23----------
think it's very complicated and


---------11:25----------
hopefully you and i can try to


---------11:27----------
untangle it how does that sound


---------11:30----------
okay so i'm gonna toss a couple things


---------11:31----------
out and you let me know what rings true


---------11:33----------
and what doesn't okay you're our compass


---------11:36----------
so i'm gonna point the compass in


---------11:37----------
different directions and you let me know


---------11:38----------
if it aligns


---------11:40----------
so


---------11:41----------
you have this list of things that you've


---------11:43----------
got to do right because you're a content


---------11:45----------
creator and you know like okay like i've


---------11:46----------
got to do this and i've got to do this


---------11:47----------
and this is going to be hype and this is


---------11:48----------
going to be great this is going to be


---------11:49----------
fun it also fulfills you right so it's


---------11:51----------
not like you're you're like


---------11:53----------
you know a task master in your mind it's


---------11:55----------
like oh this would you're genuinely


---------11:56----------
excited about doing these things


---------11:58----------
right


---------11:59----------
yeah then what happens is um


---------12:02----------
sometimes you can't really act on them


---------12:05----------
like let's say you've got a move for


---------12:06----------
example so in your mind you have a


---------12:08----------
thousand tasks and you've gotta move but


---------12:11----------
some for some reason


---------12:13----------
moving never really enters the task list


---------12:16----------
right it's not like one of your goals


---------12:18----------
like it's not something you're working


---------12:20----------
towards it's something that kind of gets


---------12:22----------
in the way and so as moving so at the


---------12:24----------
end of the day you have moved zero steps


---------12:26----------
forward on your task list but you have


---------12:29----------
moved


---------12:30----------
yeah and then what happens is you kind


---------12:31----------
of feel like oh my god like i haven't


---------12:33----------
progressed because this is my task list


---------12:35----------
of a thousand things and like instead i


---------12:37----------
had to waste a day moving


---------12:39----------
and then


---------12:40----------
that sort of feels like oh my god now i


---------12:42----------
like a day has gone by and i haven't


---------12:44----------
moved forward at all and then like the


---------12:46----------
next day rolls around and you're sort of


---------12:48----------
like oh man


---------12:50----------
you know i should have done stuff


---------12:51----------
yesterday and i don't know and like man


---------12:53----------
i could have squeezed something in and


---------12:54----------
then you start to maybe beat yourself up


---------12:56----------
a little bit


---------12:57----------
that in turn could like lead to a little


---------12:59----------
bit more paralysis because i think


---------13:00----------
beating yourself up is kind of like a


---------13:02----------
coin flip sometimes it drives you and


---------13:05----------
it's like man like totally yeah i'm


---------13:07----------
never gonna do this again never again


---------13:09----------
like let's do it yeah jack like let's go


---------13:12----------
and other times it's like oh man like i


---------13:14----------
wish i had done it


---------13:16----------
yeah and i i tend to fall on that ladder


---------13:18----------
i think more because i have friends who


---------13:21----------
who i went to advice for and he tried to


---------13:23----------
motivate me the way he motivates himself


---------13:24----------
which is harsh criticism which works


---------13:26----------
great for him because he feels like wow


---------13:28----------
i can be better that's how he sees it


---------13:30----------
where i go


---------13:32----------
i'm just like kind of sigh and don't


---------13:33----------
want to do anything um so i definitely


---------13:36----------
that that experience was like yeah no


---------13:37----------
that's definitely beating myself up


---------13:39----------
doesn't really motivate me much it can


---------13:41----------
do of course it can but like most of the


---------13:43----------
time it just makes me feel


---------13:46----------
you know like just a bit


---------13:51----------
can i think for a second of course yeah


---------13:53----------
different


---------14:00----------
if someone were to tell you that they


---------14:02----------
think you're doing great how would you


---------14:03----------
feel


---------14:05----------
i i i like that and people have and that


---------14:08----------
makes me feel good but ultimately


---------14:10----------
i i i think um


---------14:13----------
a lot of the time


---------14:15----------
i then go i'm glad that i'm doing well


---------14:17----------
by your standards


---------14:19----------
you know what i mean that's what i feel


---------14:21----------
like i then i go but by my standards


---------14:23----------
it's not quite enough like i feel like


---------14:24----------
it's my standards are different


---------14:26----------
and therefore that's really good and i


---------14:28----------
feel like thank god you said i'm doing


---------14:30----------
well but i'm still not quite satisfied


---------14:32----------
that's usually what it like boils down


---------14:34----------
to


---------14:38----------
i'm gonna go i'm gonna


---------14:40----------
enter slo-mo for a second okay oh yeah


---------14:43----------
that's all good


---------14:44----------
so


---------14:53----------
when people say they're that they think


---------14:55----------
you're doing great do you feel like they


---------14:57----------
don't understand


---------15:00----------
um


---------15:01----------
sometimes sometimes definitely depends


---------15:03----------
who says it there's certain people who


---------15:05----------
have more credibility in that claim than


---------15:06----------
others i would say because certain


---------15:08----------
people


---------15:09----------
are in a similar position to me


---------15:11----------
and if they say i'm doing great it's


---------15:13----------
like well you understand this world and


---------15:15----------
and what we do and blah blah blah and if


---------15:16----------
you think i'm doing well than that that


---------15:17----------
genuinely means something but like


---------15:20----------
in no way uh offends to them but like


---------15:22----------
it's saying my parents aren't going


---------15:23----------
you're doing great i'm like well you


---------15:25----------
don't you like i'm glad you think i'm


---------15:27----------
doing well and that's and that's really


---------15:28----------
nice and i'm it's lovely to hear your


---------15:30----------
parents are proud of my stuff i was like


---------15:31----------
you don't understand what i'm doing


---------15:34----------
fully you don't know this world quite


---------15:35----------
the way i do and


---------15:37----------
and


---------15:38----------
to me i don't feel like i'm doing great


---------15:39----------
still so what is it that they don't


---------15:41----------
understand about your world


---------15:43----------
i just i i mean just the the content


---------15:46----------
creation stuff i i mean i mean in quite


---------15:48----------
a literal sense of like it's just new to


---------15:50----------
them you know i mean they don't quite


---------15:51----------
understand


---------15:53----------
what makes it tick exactly and and what


---------15:56----------
might look good to them


---------15:57----------
it might not exactly be exactly what it


---------15:59----------
is you know it's it's it's expecting


---------16:01----------
them to understand something they've


---------16:02----------
only just kind of


---------16:04----------
tried to get their heads around purely


---------16:05----------
because that's their son's job you know


---------16:07----------
what i mean so what do you


---------16:09----------
what what makes it hard for you to feel


---------16:12----------
like you're doing good enough


---------16:15----------
like when would you be satisfied with


---------16:17----------
yourself


---------16:19----------
and that's what i don't know i've been


---------16:20----------
asked that a lot and that and someone


---------16:21----------
asked me to like kind of be like when


---------16:23----------
would and i'm like


---------16:25----------
i i think i know like a lot of the time


---------16:27----------
it's like oh well


---------16:29----------
let's say


---------16:30----------
i've done well enough when i know that i


---------16:33----------
could


---------16:34----------
retire for example like say i could turn


---------16:36----------
around and go i can retire right now and


---------16:37----------
that's it and like not necessarily that


---------16:39----------
i want to but i could and that's like me


---------16:40----------
going well i've i've fulfilled my goals


---------16:43----------
i've as


---------16:44----------
i think that's the goal right with


---------16:45----------
working i feel like that's that's kind


---------16:46----------
of the goal it's like you want to work


---------16:49----------
until you can retire and then even if


---------16:50----------
you want to work beyond that at least


---------16:51----------
you know at any time given point you can


---------16:52----------
go that's my fix i'm out um and i think


---------16:56----------
part of me always strives towards that


---------16:57----------
that's that's one thing in my head but


---------16:59----------
then what's when


---------17:01----------
when when is that i don't really know


---------17:04----------
where did you get that goal of being


---------17:06----------
able to retire


---------17:07----------
i don't know i just that in my head that


---------17:09----------
was always the goal of working i think


---------17:11----------
you


---------17:12----------
you work


---------17:12----------
you earn you earn your pay eventually


---------17:15----------
you have enough where you go yeah i


---------17:16----------
don't have to do this anymore and that's


---------17:17----------
not necessarily to say you stop because


---------17:19----------
i don't like being lazy but that's at a


---------17:21----------
point where i can go well it doesn't


---------17:22----------
really because at that point if i have


---------17:24----------
enough it doesn't matter if working


---------17:27----------
brings nothing and it doesn't matter if


---------17:29----------
it brings everything because i already


---------17:30----------
had enough so it doesn't really matter


---------17:32----------
at which point i feel like then maybe at


---------17:33----------
that point i think i can stop saying


---------17:35----------
this is a failure and this is


---------17:38----------
like a success because it doesn't really


---------17:39----------
matter as long as i'm


---------17:41----------
fulfilled and like i'm enjoying it um


---------17:44----------
right now i feel like i'd love to enjoy


---------17:46----------
it but also it's got to be


---------17:48----------
like


---------17:49----------
worthwhile that's that's the thing i i i


---------17:51----------
like to enjoy the things i'm doing but i


---------17:52----------
also want them to be worthwhile and at a


---------17:54----------
certain point you can go well


---------17:56----------
whether it's worthwhile or not stops


---------17:57----------
mattering because i have what i need


---------17:59----------
it's just whether it satisfies me


---------18:01----------
personally that's it


---------18:03----------
that's how i feel


---------18:05----------
fantastic so i think jack we


---------18:11----------
there's a lot


---------18:12----------
that i think we can learn here i just


---------18:14----------
don't know that um i have


---------18:17----------
the skill


---------18:19----------
to help you


---------18:21----------
so i'm gonna lean on you a lot okay and


---------18:23----------
we may have a lot of false starts


---------18:25----------
that's so


---------18:27----------
let me ask you something so let's say


---------18:28----------
that you hit your target and you can


---------18:30----------
retire okay


---------18:32----------
and then at that point you can work and


---------18:34----------
you can work will be free


---------18:36----------
because yeah it it could bring nothing


---------18:39----------
or it could bring everything and it


---------18:41----------
would be the same to you


---------18:44----------
right


---------18:44----------
that's what i like to think i i can't


---------18:47----------
say that i'll get there and i'll be like


---------18:48----------
but


---------18:49----------
let's say that's true because yeah so so


---------18:52----------
let's let's reverse it okay so let's


---------18:54----------
look at it this way


---------18:55----------
when you fail


---------18:57----------
why does the failure hurt so much


---------19:00----------
it's because it doesn't advance you


---------19:02----------
towards your goal does that sort of make


---------19:05----------
sense yeah it also to me i i'm i'm i get


---------19:08----------
like in these like this


---------19:11----------
what if this disappears like i'm very


---------19:12----------
attached to what i do right now i love


---------19:14----------
it right and it's like if


---------19:16----------
what if this is the beginning of the end


---------19:18----------
that's kind of how it always feels it's


---------19:19----------
like this weird like it's like the


---------19:21----------
beginning of the apocalypse scenario um


---------19:23----------
where i'm like right well this is the


---------19:24----------
beginning of the end you know i see like


---------19:26----------
i upload a youtube video it doesn't do


---------19:27----------
very well right well i'm falling off i'm


---------19:28----------
gone and it's like well that's a shame i


---------19:30----------
didn't get to do all the things i wanted


---------19:32----------
to you know and but it's like


---------19:35----------
if i reach the point where i have done


---------19:37----------
all those things or i am at that point


---------19:38----------
then all of a sudden doesn't matter if


---------19:39----------
it starts declining i'm i i did what i


---------19:41----------
needed


---------19:44----------
i'm with you so let me let me kind of


---------19:45----------
put it this way like


---------19:48----------
whether it brings nothing or brings


---------19:50----------
everything hurts right now


---------19:53----------
because there's a big difference between


---------19:55----------
those right


---------19:56----------
and so if you make a youtube video and


---------19:58----------
it doesn't do well then that falls into


---------20:00----------
the brings nothing camp and it has a


---------20:02----------
consequence


---------20:04----------
as a result does that make sense


---------20:06----------
yeah yeah but what we're sort of saying


---------20:08----------
is that once you check your boxes for


---------20:11----------
retirement then you can make something


---------20:14----------
and it can bring nothing and you can be


---------20:16----------
okay with that right


---------20:18----------
yeah okay


---------20:20----------
so then i know it sounds kind of weird


---------20:22----------
but let me give you a scenario let's say


---------20:24----------
that you've got a hundred million


---------20:26----------
dollars i don't know how much you need


---------20:27----------
to retire no 100 billion dollars or 100


---------20:30----------
million pounds or whatever it sounds


---------20:32----------
enough


---------20:33----------
in your bank account


---------20:35----------
and then you make content for a year and


---------20:37----------
you're making content and it has no


---------20:39----------
consequences because you've got your 100


---------20:41----------
million pounds in the bank account right


---------20:43----------
and so you're making content you're


---------20:44----------
making content for fun it's like some of


---------20:46----------
it's succeeding some of it's not


---------20:47----------
succeeding


---------20:48----------
and then you're okay with that because


---------20:50----------
it doesn't matter you've got your 100


---------20:51----------
million pounds


---------20:53----------
in the bank account right


---------20:55----------
so you can make content freely


---------20:58----------
you're free


---------20:59----------
and that's what i'm really hearing is


---------21:00----------
that for you the goal is freedom


---------21:02----------
freedom from needing to worry about the


---------21:05----------
consequences of your actions is that


---------21:08----------
fair yeah yeah i'd say that's it yeah so


---------21:10----------
you make content for another year


---------21:12----------
because you're like i don't know how old


---------21:13----------
you are but let's say like by that point


---------21:15----------
you're like 24 how old are you i'm 19.


---------21:18----------
okay great so let's say 20 million


---------21:20----------
dollars a year for the next five years


---------21:22----------
easy


---------21:23----------
and then you're retiring at the age of


---------21:24----------
24. and then for the night and then


---------21:26----------
you're like what am i gonna do with my


---------21:27----------
life you're like i don't know i'm gonna


---------21:28----------
just make content for fun you make


---------21:29----------
content for two years and it's lots of


---------21:31----------
lots of fun and you enjoy yourself and


---------21:33----------
you achieve what you're shooting for


---------21:35----------
okay these are your visions not mine


---------21:38----------
and then


---------21:39----------
at the on your 26th birthday you realize


---------21:41----------
that there's been some kind of financial


---------21:44----------
theft some identity fraud and someone


---------21:47----------
has stolen 95 million dollars from you


---------21:51----------
now


---------21:52----------
and not only did they steal it they


---------21:54----------
stole it two years ago so you've


---------21:55----------
actually never had it


---------21:57----------
right yeah


---------21:59----------
what do you think about like do you


---------22:00----------
think that


---------22:01----------
your enjoyment


---------22:03----------
like if you kind of look back in time


---------22:05----------
like you still enjoyed yourself even


---------22:07----------
though you really didn't have the money


---------22:08----------
you just sort of believed you had the


---------22:10----------
money what do you think about that


---------22:13----------
yeah no i i feel like if someone could


---------22:15----------
turn around now and promise me that


---------22:17----------
it'll be fine like it doesn't matter


---------22:19----------
there'll be ups and downs blah blah blah


---------22:20----------
but like at the end you will be fine


---------22:21----------
this will work then yeah i stopped


---------22:23----------
worrying again it's purely just the kind


---------22:25----------
of like


---------22:26----------
i find that worrying


---------22:29----------
is not only just unpleasant generally


---------22:30----------
but i find that it also inhibits me from


---------22:33----------
doing the things i enjoy because it


---------22:34----------
tends to to


---------22:36----------
cause i i don't know how to describe it


---------22:38----------
just you know let's do it just inhabits


---------22:41----------
um


---------22:42----------
and


---------22:43----------
i think i just


---------22:45----------
i always yeah i just strive to be free


---------22:47----------
of it i think that's all it is i think


---------22:48----------
that's that's kind of always been it


---------22:50----------
really


---------22:51----------
yeah so this is the terrifying thing


---------22:53----------
okay now this is going to be hard jack


---------22:55----------
because the first


---------22:57----------
is that


---------22:58----------
you being free of it has nothing to do


---------23:01----------
with the amount of money in your bank


---------23:02----------
account


---------23:03----------
no and i kind of know that as well like


---------23:06----------
i think yeah that was and it was an


---------23:08----------
abstraction


---------23:09----------
i'm with you there's more to it than


---------23:11----------
that but yes let's yeah right so i i


---------23:13----------
think that like like whether something


---------23:15----------
brings nothing or brings everything


---------23:18----------
has to do with your conception and the


---------23:21----------
standard at which you're trying to


---------23:22----------
fulfill


---------23:23----------
and i think the truly terrifying thing


---------23:25----------
is that if you really want to be free


---------23:27----------
from worry you have to learn how to


---------23:29----------
coast


---------23:32----------
i think yeah


---------23:34----------
right because once you have 100 million


---------23:36----------
dollars in the bank account what are you


---------23:37----------
going to be doing you're going to be


---------23:38----------
coasting


---------23:40----------
yeah and and i think that's that's the


---------23:42----------
thing i i think i deep down really would


---------23:44----------
like to coast oh yes but right now i


---------23:47----------
can't justify it like i can't justify


---------23:49----------
guessing and i've never been able to


---------23:51----------
there's never been a point in my life


---------23:52----------
where i feel like this is right now is


---------23:53----------
the time to come


---------23:54----------
that's never came and i would really


---------23:57----------
like for


---------23:58----------
myself to feel like now's the time


---------24:01----------
and


---------24:02----------
yeah so now i'm going to ask you is the


---------24:04----------
time to coast determined by something in


---------24:07----------
here or something out there


---------24:12----------
in my head it's out there but i want to


---------24:14----------
say that perhaps it really should be in


---------24:17----------
here like maybe i should make that


---------24:18----------
decision but i feel like it's out of my


---------24:20----------
hands to a degree sure so i'm really


---------24:22----------
glad you said that i'm really glad you


---------24:24----------
didn't say the quote-unquote right and


---------24:26----------
bs answer which is like oh like coasting


---------24:29----------
is like it's all about like yeah you're


---------24:30----------
in inner environment no no


---------24:33----------
right no


---------24:34----------
so there's a level at which you've like


---------24:36----------
kind of got to


---------24:37----------
be able to live sure absolutely so so


---------24:40----------
i'm really glad that you got an


---------24:42----------
authentic answer and i want to be


---------24:43----------
careful with that word should


---------24:45----------
because i think that you're correct that


---------24:46----------
honestly i hate to break this to you


---------24:48----------
jack but i think that retirement is


---------24:51----------
going to be a goal post that moves for


---------24:53----------
you


---------24:54----------
you're going to you're going to go a


---------24:55----------
certain distance and you're going to say


---------24:57----------
it's not enough


---------24:58----------
right and this is where like we can kind


---------25:00----------
of go back and think a little bit about


---------25:02----------
your 19 now how old were you when you


---------25:04----------
started streaming


---------25:06----------
17.


---------25:08----------
and what were your goals when you


---------25:09----------
started streaming


---------25:11----------
yeah


---------25:12----------
not this at all not even to do it as a


---------25:15----------
job it was it was just to do it for fun


---------25:16----------
and then it became a job and then it was


---------25:18----------
like oh well no i know what it was it


---------25:20----------
was doing it for fun and i was like wait


---------25:22----------
i can leave my


---------25:23----------
debt like my it job that would be great


---------25:25----------
this is so much better than doing it and


---------25:27----------
then all of a sudden when this became a


---------25:29----------
job it's like right now i've got to be


---------25:30----------
successful in this


---------25:32----------
you know because before it was be


---------25:33----------
successful in the i.t job but sure now


---------25:35----------
it's flipped


---------25:36----------
and so i think that this is i don't


---------25:38----------
think you need to you know detect like


---------25:40----------
become internally


---------25:42----------
enlightened right away


---------25:44----------
i think it's okay to be attached to like


---------25:46----------
external things but i think deep down


---------25:48----------
it's gonna be tricky because what you're


---------25:50----------
gonna have to do is things that


---------25:53----------
there's an overlap between


---------25:55----------
doing things that make you feel lazy


---------25:58----------
and being like internally satisfied with


---------26:00----------
what you do


---------26:01----------
does that make sense


---------26:02----------
i think we're gonna have to move i'm not


---------26:04----------
gonna suggest that you become lazy but i


---------26:06----------
think sometimes you beat yourself up for


---------26:08----------
things that are probably actually okay


---------26:11----------
yeah and and oddly enough it's almost


---------26:13----------
like if you want to


---------26:14----------
this is why it's hard i'm trying to


---------26:16----------
thread a lot of things together so


---------26:18----------
when you feel like you're not doing


---------26:20----------
enough


---------26:21----------
and that you beat yourself up and then


---------26:24----------
you fail again right you with me in that


---------26:26----------
mindset


---------26:28----------
the problem is in order to let go of


---------26:30----------
that second failure like the debuff


---------26:33----------
it has to be embracing the things that


---------26:35----------
make you feel lazy


---------26:37----------
does that make sense


---------26:39----------
yeah no i think i get what that means


---------26:40----------
yeah so like if you want to free


---------26:42----------
yourself from the mental burden of oh my


---------26:44----------
god i'm screwing up you have to move a


---------26:46----------
little bit more towards like accepting


---------26:48----------
like what you call feeling lazy i don't


---------26:50----------
think it's actually laziness


---------26:52----------
those two things are at the opposite


---------26:53----------
ends of the spectrum


---------26:55----------
and i think if i ask you to do that you


---------26:58----------
will


---------26:59----------
kick and scream you don't want to do


---------27:01----------
that


---------27:02----------
so


---------27:02----------
i think i possibly


---------27:04----------
no it's best for me but i don't think i


---------27:06----------
would naturally fall into it yeah it'd


---------27:08----------
be a real challenge


---------27:09----------
yes yeah that's what i mean so i think


---------27:11----------
you've already figured out that this is


---------27:13----------
like not ideal and at the same time


---------27:16----------
you're gonna fight it like that's just


---------27:17----------
that's how that's why it's hard jack


---------27:20----------
because it isn't a simple answer it's


---------27:22----------
not like you're doing something wrong


---------27:24----------
and you need to do something right it's


---------27:26----------
actually that you're doing something


---------27:28----------
right and if you want to move forward


---------27:30----------
you need to start doing things that are


---------27:31----------
wrong


---------27:33----------
sure that's why it's hard and very few


---------27:35----------
people figure it out and it's like a


---------27:37----------
struggle for humanity


---------27:42----------
um


---------27:43----------
what


---------27:44----------
no it's the struggle for humanity line


---------27:46----------
was like wow that really made my problem


---------27:49----------
big


---------27:50----------
what do you mean


---------27:51----------
oh it feels i don't know i feel like um


---------27:53----------
i'm also um very inclined to um


---------27:57----------
kind of see things as per i kind of


---------27:58----------
forget that other people struggle with


---------27:59----------
the same things


---------28:00----------
um a lot of the time like i i think i


---------28:03----------
have a very like


---------28:04----------
they look fine they're doing fine they


---------28:06----------
don't have this this worry that i have


---------28:07----------
most likely i don't it's unrealistic but


---------28:10----------
i feel like when you look at people


---------28:12----------
i don't often assume so when you say


---------28:14----------
humanity i'm like


---------28:16----------
this isn't this isn't just me


---------28:18----------
it's it's not just you what do you see


---------28:20----------
when you look at other people jack


---------28:23----------
um


---------28:24----------
it really depends i feel like i see


---------28:26----------
there's certain people so this is the


---------28:28----------
thing i i i think i do compare myself


---------28:30----------
quite a lot um


---------28:32----------
because um i was always they always this


---------28:35----------
is something that everyone always quotes


---------28:36----------
as being like the source of a problem


---------28:37----------
but i'm gonna bring up this cliche of


---------28:39----------
like being being the kid that did well


---------28:41----------
in school


---------28:42----------
and what happens is uh you leave


---------28:45----------
and all of a sudden especially in this


---------28:46----------
sphere with it it's huge and there's so


---------28:48----------
many people i'm not the best at it we're


---------28:51----------
in school i was the best in most like a


---------28:52----------
lot of the things i did at least


---------28:54----------
compared to my peers so all of a sudden


---------28:56----------
the comparison thing wasn't a problem


---------28:57----------
because if i compare myself to people


---------28:58----------
it's like yeah i'm i'm beyond that um


---------29:02----------
and it was like yeah i'm doing better


---------29:03----------
than that that's great no one can expect


---------29:05----------
anything more of you when you're doing


---------29:06----------
the best that's how i felt but now i'm


---------29:08----------
in a position where i'm not doing the


---------29:09----------
best there's also a part of me that is


---------29:11----------
striving to be the best and as much as i


---------29:13----------
know that isn't realistic because i'm in


---------29:14----------
a huge huge sphere of very very talented


---------29:16----------
people way more talented than myself um


---------29:19----------
but


---------29:21----------
there's a little part of my brain which


---------29:22----------
is like


---------29:23----------
let's try and be the best at this let's


---------29:25----------
be the absolute best of this


---------29:27----------
um


---------29:30----------
i lost where i was going with that


---------29:31----------
entire time i felt like that was going


---------29:32----------
to tie into something well no no you're


---------29:34----------
you're doing great man so i want to


---------29:36----------
point something out to you i've noticed


---------29:38----------
something so this is going to be kind of


---------29:39----------
a meandering conversation okay so like


---------29:41----------
what sorry but


---------29:43----------
have you noticed that you'll oftentimes


---------29:45----------
make statements about like deep down i


---------29:47----------
know this but this


---------29:50----------
or on some level i feel like this but


---------29:52----------
this have you kind of noticed that


---------29:54----------
within you there's like this war between


---------29:57----------
like there's not a conflict yeah yeah


---------30:00----------
i'm very conflicted a lot who are those


---------30:02----------
two people like you get the sense


---------30:03----------
there's two people


---------30:05----------
in there yeah no okay yeah i think so uh


---------30:07----------
and it's probably uh the part of me that


---------30:10----------
just wants to like enjoy things and


---------30:12----------
purely like purely just enjoy things


---------30:14----------
like that's it like that's all i want to


---------30:16----------
do if i'm doing something i want to do


---------30:18----------
it for maximum enjoyment whether that's


---------30:20----------
working whether that's anything it's


---------30:21----------
purely for me and there's a part of me


---------30:22----------
that's like


---------30:23----------
you you need to be able to live and you


---------30:26----------
need to do well and you need to succeed


---------30:27----------
and like it's trying to balance those


---------30:29----------
two but i find that the succeeding one


---------30:32----------
tends to trump the enjoyment one


---------30:34----------
and i don't know why but i've got this


---------30:36----------
weird idea in my head that the success


---------30:38----------
is more important than enjoyment


---------30:40----------
like i like as much as i i kind of know


---------30:42----------
that that shouldn't be true because i


---------30:44----------
also um


---------30:46----------
if i if i was to sit down and get really


---------30:48----------
like philosophical and discuss like


---------30:50----------
what i view life as it's like it's


---------30:52----------
ultimately all down to just making the


---------30:53----------
most of of whatever you whatever time


---------30:55----------
you have so you should enjoy it right


---------30:58----------
but like i also don't want to shorten


---------31:00----------
that time or whatever by um


---------31:03----------
you know being unsuccessful which in my


---------31:05----------
head is how it works which possibly is


---------31:08----------
is a very big leap


---------31:09----------
but


---------31:10----------
so i'm i'm gonna name the two parts of


---------31:12----------
you and you let me know if these fit


---------31:14----------
so one is the part of you that knows


---------31:17----------
what is true and the other one is the


---------31:19----------
part of you that knows what should be


---------31:20----------
true


---------31:23----------
oh wait hold on those that's a very like


---------31:26----------
subtle wording difference between the


---------31:27----------
two things right so what you know to be


---------31:29----------
true


---------31:30----------
and what should be true oh okay right


---------31:33----------
yes no totally okay yeah yeah is that


---------31:35----------
fit yeah love it yeah yeah


---------31:38----------
yeah hmm


---------31:39----------
so this kind of goes back to your sense


---------31:41----------
of self


---------31:42----------
right


---------31:43----------
because i i think you're not going to be


---------31:45----------
able to figure out who you are when


---------31:47----------
these two things are so like i mean


---------31:49----------
that's a huge gap man what you know is


---------31:51----------
actually true like what your actual


---------31:53----------
experience is what your mind tells you


---------31:54----------
hey man moving is a waste of time


---------31:57----------
yeah and then there's the other part of


---------31:58----------
you that's like like i have to move


---------32:00----------
though


---------32:01----------
yeah but but the other part is like [ __ ]


---------32:03----------
it


---------32:05----------
yeah no i don't have time this is taking


---------32:07----------
time and i don't i don't want to do it


---------32:08----------
like yeah yeah i mean


---------32:10----------
just i know that to be the case because


---------32:12----------
i i've had this house since the 24th of


---------32:14----------
september i've been paying for it since


---------32:16----------
then i moved this week because i've been


---------32:18----------
pushing it off because i've been busy


---------32:19----------
and i've been like i don't have time to


---------32:20----------
move yet and it's like it you know it


---------32:23----------
was so stupid eventually got to the


---------32:25----------
point where like okay i'm being dumb i'm


---------32:26----------
being like i i own a house that i'm not


---------32:28----------
using i should go and live in it um but


---------32:31----------
it was like it took me nearly two months


---------32:33----------
of like


---------32:34----------
and i i i said it was because i was busy


---------32:36----------
but i think it was ultimately just


---------32:37----------
because i i knew i'd do this but i'm


---------32:39----------
like this is a waste of time


---------32:42----------
yeah so i think um when you get caught


---------32:44----------
between what you know to be true and


---------32:46----------
what should be true you feel dumb


---------32:50----------
what do you think about that yeah maybe


---------32:52----------
yeah


---------32:52----------
dumb


---------32:54----------
let me think yeah wait i think that


---------32:56----------
might be the right that might be the


---------32:57----------
right one but i'm just trying to think


---------32:58----------
about it um


---------33:00----------
yeah


---------33:02----------
yeah dumb


---------33:04----------
yeah right because you said like this is


---------33:05----------
dumb i haven't moved in


---------33:07----------
yeah like i that felt stupid like like i


---------33:10----------
felt really dumb i'm like i i i could


---------33:12----------
move i mean i lived with my parents i


---------33:14----------
didn't have much stuff to move and it


---------33:16----------
was like just just pack it up and move


---------33:18----------
and i didn't pack it up till the very


---------33:19----------
day before because i booked my removal


---------33:20----------
van i'm like oh i have to do it now like


---------33:23----------
that was how i motivate myself to do it


---------33:24----------
it was like right well i put the van so


---------33:26----------
i have to get this stuff packed before


---------33:27----------
it arrives i wouldn't have done it


---------33:29----------
otherwise because that's what i tried to


---------33:30----------
do pack it and then book the van it just


---------33:31----------
never happened i just wouldn't do it


---------33:33----------
yeah


---------33:35----------
so i i'm also noticing so i'm just going


---------33:37----------
to kind of rephrase that again i think


---------33:39----------
when you get stuck between these two


---------33:41----------
things


---------33:42----------
is when you end up


---------33:44----------
it doesn't sort of matter because like


---------33:48----------
you're always letting one of them down


---------33:50----------
right if you're stuck between the two of


---------33:51----------
them


---------33:52----------
or you're paralyzed and not even moving


---------33:54----------
towards either one


---------33:56----------
which isn't the worst


---------33:58----------
right and that's when you beat yourself


---------34:00----------
up


---------34:02----------
so in terms of if we want to try to


---------34:05----------
understand like okay like now i almost


---------34:07----------
feel like i should pull out the ipad


---------34:09----------
here but


---------34:10----------
so here's on a high level i'm going to


---------34:11----------
try to summarize because i think we've


---------34:13----------
hit a lot of good things but i think


---------34:15----------
that it's kind of confusing would you


---------34:17----------
agree


---------34:18----------
sure yeah i'd say it's confusing so let


---------34:20----------
me try to let's just start from the top


---------34:21----------
okay


---------34:24----------
so


---------34:25----------
you're very mentally busy because


---------34:26----------
there's a lot of stuff you should be


---------34:28----------
doing


---------34:29----------
right and you're very success driven


---------34:32----------
you're very outcome oriented


---------34:34----------
so you know what you need to do your


---------34:36----------
to-do list is probably far beyond what


---------34:39----------
you're capable of but it's all important


---------34:41----------
stuff that could get done


---------34:43----------
and you drive towards it you also


---------34:45----------
acknowledge that


---------34:46----------
you know despite the fact that you are


---------34:48----------
sometimes hard on yourself and push


---------34:49----------
yourself that you probably wouldn't be


---------34:51----------
where you are unless you did those


---------34:53----------
things


---------34:55----------
right so even though there's a part of


---------34:57----------
you that wants to change and wants to


---------34:58----------
relax and wants to coast and wants to


---------35:01----------
enjoy being 19 years old which


---------35:03----------
theoretically should be the best time of


---------35:05----------
your life and i'm sure you were


---------35:06----------
genuinely having fun too i don't get the


---------35:08----------
sense that your life is all sad and all


---------35:10----------
like no no no i do have fun i then just


---------35:12----------
come away from it like oh wow i didn't


---------35:14----------
do anything but i do enjoy it in the


---------35:16----------
moment i'm having a great time a lot so


---------35:18----------
so that that's exactly beautifully said


---------35:20----------
right so like in the moment you're


---------35:22----------
enjoying so there's one thing over here


---------35:24----------
and you're like all right let's do that


---------35:26----------
thing and then the second you're done


---------35:28----------
there's that other voice


---------35:29----------
that's like hey


---------35:31----------
dumbass you could have been you didn't


---------35:32----------
do any of the things yeah right


---------35:35----------
and so it's almost like any time you


---------35:37----------
reach towards happiness like this voice


---------35:39----------
comes in and takes it away from you


---------35:42----------
and then like then what happens is you


---------35:44----------
like go towards that person right who's


---------35:46----------
like work jack work work son


---------35:49----------
grind boy


---------35:50----------
and then you do all those kinds of


---------35:52----------
things and then there's some like voice


---------35:53----------
inside you that's like hey like


---------35:55----------
you know like maybe this is not how i


---------35:57----------
should be living right now and then the


---------35:59----------
other voice is like no no it's okay you


---------36:01----------
can do that when you retire we're


---------36:03----------
grinding for a reason i'm doing this for


---------36:05----------
you bro


---------36:06----------
yeah grinding so that you can have fun


---------36:09----------
later


---------36:10----------
yeah


---------36:11----------
right and then like any time so if if


---------36:13----------
you go towards one side of the pole like


---------36:15----------
either if you pick one then later the


---------36:18----------
other will come to haunt you


---------36:20----------
and so sometimes you're stuck between


---------36:22----------
the two and then you're and then like


---------36:23----------
any time you're stuck either you don't


---------36:25----------
choose and then you really beat yourself


---------36:27----------
up then everyone's on the same page


---------36:30----------
then everyone's like hey you're not


---------36:31----------
having fun


---------36:33----------
and


---------36:34----------
you're not being productive like what's


---------36:35----------
wrong then both the sides of the polls


---------36:37----------
are like


---------36:38----------
we're unified we can align over one


---------36:40----------
thing which is that you're you should be


---------36:42----------
doing better


---------36:43----------
yeah


---------36:45----------
and then i think when you feel that way


---------36:46----------
you sort of feel done


---------36:48----------
totally yeah


---------36:51----------
how is that for a summary so far


---------36:53----------
good


---------36:54----------
very good yeah okay that's perfect


---------36:57----------
so now jack what do we do about that


---------37:02----------
any thoughts you don't i'm just curious


---------37:05----------
you don't have to have answers i think


---------37:07----------
it's really hard


---------37:09----------
you see


---------37:13----------
there's a realistic part of me


---------37:15----------
and there's like the department that


---------37:16----------
wants to go you know what go towards the


---------37:18----------
fun one because that's great and you're


---------37:20----------
going to enjoy your life i'm 19 years


---------37:22----------
old i got this great opportunity let's


---------37:23----------
just enjoy it the thing is if i carry on


---------37:26----------
if i keep just striving for enjoyment


---------37:28----------
i'll lose it i know i will like i know


---------37:30----------
what i'll do i'll go out and have fun


---------37:32----------
and then realize like i didn't do


---------37:34----------
anything and this is going to disappear


---------37:35----------
beneath my feet


---------37:36----------
um


---------37:38----------
but so the realistic part of me is like


---------37:40----------
find a balance finder balance is


---------37:42----------
probably the thing i should be doing but


---------37:43----------
i'm very


---------37:44----------
i can't i don't know i'm not very good


---------37:46----------
at that


---------37:48----------
yeah so what makes it hard for you to


---------37:49----------
find a balance


---------37:52----------
because


---------37:58----------
oh that's a hard one i don't


---------38:04----------
so i'm going to think about it or i'm


---------38:05----------
just going to say


---------38:06----------
for a few minutes um


---------38:14----------
i suppose it's kind of the idea of um


---------38:19----------
which feels more important than the


---------38:20----------
other


---------38:21----------
and in a moment i can never really


---------38:23----------
decide so it's very hard for me to


---------38:26----------
like to balance it i basically got the


---------38:28----------
way the thought process works in my head


---------38:30----------
of balancing it is i i have a dilemma


---------38:32----------
right over something i don't know say


---------38:34----------
say someone's inviting me out but i


---------38:36----------
could be getting on with one of the


---------38:37----------
million things i could be doing and it's


---------38:39----------
like right well i'm going to sit there


---------38:40----------
and i'm going to think i could go and do


---------38:42----------
that thing


---------38:43----------
or i could do this thing and in that


---------38:46----------
moment


---------38:47----------
i very i struggle a lot to go which one


---------38:50----------
of these is the most important route to


---------38:52----------
take for me right now


---------38:54----------
and sometimes i can sometimes i can go


---------38:56----------
you know what i've worked a lot recently


---------38:58----------
these are my friends tonight i should go


---------39:00----------
do something and sometimes like hey i'm


---------39:01----------
really behind


---------39:02----------
you know but when i'm not leaning to an


---------39:05----------
extreme where i'm either really behind


---------39:07----------
or i'm really ahead and i'm i'm doing


---------39:09----------
all right when i'm kind of in that


---------39:10----------
middle ground of


---------39:11----------
i could go one way or the other i


---------39:13----------
struggle to make the decision


---------39:15----------
okay


---------39:16----------
so oddly enough that doesn't sound like


---------39:19----------
balance to me that sounds kind of like


---------39:21----------
torture


---------39:24----------
right


---------39:27----------
what is that fair to say or is that


---------39:29----------
potentially i feel like it's it's uh is


---------39:32----------
that how it feels


---------39:34----------
i don't


---------39:36----------
that's i think that's where the


---------39:37----------
paralysis kicks in i don't know that's


---------39:39----------
where i go


---------39:40----------
freeze up yeah um so


---------39:43----------
i got an emotional reaction there i


---------39:44----------
wasn't sure if that emotional reaction


---------39:46----------
was absurdity because i'm completely off


---------39:48----------
base or that was striking a chord


---------39:51----------
i


---------39:53----------
i don't know


---------39:54----------
okay it's one of those things i don't


---------39:55----------
think i've ever sat back and reflected


---------39:56----------
on how i feel about that so i you said


---------39:59----------
it and i'm like god that's quite a harsh


---------40:01----------
word to use and i don't know whether


---------40:02----------
it's it's quite fitting or not it was


---------40:04----------
just a bit of like oh


---------40:06----------
i've not had a chance to think


---------40:08----------
so so what i'm kind of hearing is that


---------40:10----------
like


---------40:10----------
so let me put it this way which feels


---------40:13----------
more important in the moment doesn't


---------40:15----------
sound to me like balance it sounds like


---------40:17----------
a pendulum


---------40:21----------
yeah


---------40:23----------
so what i'm kind of hearing is if you if


---------40:25----------
you've like


---------40:27----------
sometimes if you're extreme ends of the


---------40:29----------
polls


---------40:30----------
it's very easy to make a decision


---------40:32----------
because you're like oh i've grinded way


---------40:33----------
too hard let me swing back this way yeah


---------40:35----------
it's so of that in that moment it's an


---------40:37----------
obvious decision it's it's the second it


---------40:39----------
becomes


---------40:41----------
not so obvious i've never been great at


---------40:42----------
making decisions full stops like that's


---------40:44----------
one thing i know about myself very


---------40:46----------
important it never is a short time for


---------40:47----------
you because you're 19. yeah oh no i know


---------40:50----------
but as as of yet i've not been great at


---------40:52----------
making decisions so i i didn't mean to


---------40:55----------
be condescending there but i think


---------40:57----------
you're you're doing good jack and i


---------40:59----------
think you got to cut yourself some slack


---------41:00----------
because okay you know


---------41:02----------
you're


---------41:03----------
i appreciate it but but what i what i'm


---------41:05----------
kind of noticing is like you know you


---------41:07----------
like it's easy when you're at an extreme


---------41:09----------
because then you can swing the pendulum


---------41:10----------
back the other way


---------41:12----------
but like balance is not a pendulum in


---------41:14----------
fact pendulum is the exact opposite of a


---------41:16----------
balance right it's like


---------41:17----------
swinging back and forth like balance is


---------41:19----------
this if i can do this it's not going to


---------41:21----------
bounce okay whatever


---------41:22----------
it's very hard but yeah okay right


---------41:25----------
and so i i think what what maybe you


---------41:27----------
should maybe what concerns you is that


---------41:29----------
i'm i'm concerned that if we think about


---------41:32----------
like balancing this pen for example


---------41:34----------
the tricky thing is that let's say like


---------41:36----------
this is this is the work end of the pen


---------41:38----------
and this is the leisure end of the pen


---------41:39----------
and you're actually like kind of okay


---------41:41----------
over here the problem is that if we like


---------41:43----------
are not careful


---------41:45----------
and you kind of go too far on the


---------41:47----------
leisure side i get the sense that you


---------41:49----------
may be afraid that you'll like fall off


---------41:50----------
a cliff


---------41:52----------
and so like you you're like oh i should


---------41:54----------
let myself coast a little bit more i


---------41:56----------
should let my coast a little bit more i


---------41:57----------
should let my coast


---------41:59----------
myself coast a little bit more but if i


---------42:00----------
coast too much it'll all come crumbling


---------42:03----------
down yeah and it is like


---------42:05----------
yeah i like spot like a minor slip like


---------42:07----------
i'll spot like the littlest thing that


---------42:08----------
isn't doing as well as it was like say a


---------42:10----------
week ago and it's like whoa


---------42:11----------
it's the beginning of the fall and i


---------42:13----------
like i'll you know like slide back over


---------42:16----------
the other way yeah so i think that the


---------42:18----------
reason it's hard because when you're


---------42:19----------
moving towards balance


---------42:21----------
i think you run away from balance


---------42:22----------
actually


---------42:24----------
and then you get burnt out or fed up


---------42:27----------
and then your pendulum swing towards


---------42:29----------
self care


---------42:31----------
and then you do that for a day or two


---------42:32----------
and you're like back to the grind like


---------42:34----------
i've taken a day or two off like like


---------42:36----------
gotta go back to it and so i get the


---------42:38----------
sense that it's a pendulum and


---------42:39----------
furthermore if you want balance you've


---------42:41----------
gotta like


---------42:42----------
i know it's going to be scary but you


---------42:44----------
got to like let yourself kind of coast


---------42:46----------
like


---------42:47----------
does that make sense


---------42:48----------
yeah


---------42:49----------
okay


---------42:51----------
um


---------42:52----------
so


---------42:53----------
i think the next thing jack that i kind


---------42:55----------
of want to ask you is like if we want to


---------42:56----------
understand so if this is the structure


---------42:58----------
you're torn between these two things


---------43:00----------
sometimes it's easy to make decisions


---------43:02----------
but in that middle space it's really


---------43:04----------
hard for you to make the decisions and


---------43:05----------
then furthermore in the middle space you


---------43:07----------
also engage in some amount of like


---------43:09----------
self-blame


---------43:11----------
feeling stupid


---------43:12----------
yeah yeah some yeah i'm not saying that


---------43:14----------
it's your head is like a toxic wasteland


---------43:16----------
of just like shame no no


---------43:19----------
i wouldn't i wouldn't say it wasn't


---------43:20----------
either that's fair but yeah yeah so i


---------43:23----------
just want to make it clear i'm not pl


---------43:24----------
implying that but in terms of when the


---------43:26----------
debuff happens that gives you task


---------43:28----------
paralysis and all these other like


---------43:30----------
negative manifestations i really think


---------43:31----------
it comes from


---------43:33----------
something about what we're talking about


---------43:35----------
is that fair


---------43:36----------
yeah okay so


---------43:38----------
so i think if we want to understand


---------43:39----------
where that comes from i'd like to ask


---------43:41----------
you about your past are you okay with


---------43:43----------
that


---------43:43----------
okay so can you tell me a little bit


---------43:45----------
about where you grew up or what growing


---------43:47----------
up was like for you


---------43:49----------
sure um well i i just moved away from


---------43:52----------
where i grew up i grew up um in in a


---------43:55----------
slightly uh it's actually quite a big uk


---------43:57----------
town it's not very well connected


---------43:58----------
there's not much going on there so um i


---------44:00----------
i


---------44:02----------
had not much going on where i was from


---------44:04----------
um parents are together um fine you know


---------44:08----------
i i wouldn't say


---------44:12----------
it doesn't feel like obviously of course


---------44:14----------
everyone's childhood has an impact but i


---------44:16----------
i couldn't say there's any big events


---------44:17----------
where i'd go trust is a really big deal


---------44:19----------
for me and this has changed me and this


---------44:20----------
is


---------44:21----------
i i'd say i i i grew up


---------44:24----------
with my parents and um i'd say possibly


---------44:27----------
i was uh


---------44:29----------
a bit sheltered uh


---------44:31----------
in fact no i'd say even now like i've


---------44:33----------
just moved and i realized i have no idea


---------44:36----------
how to do so many things and i'll figure


---------44:37----------
it out because i do i'm pretty confident


---------44:40----------
in myself but i i'm like i have no idea


---------44:43----------
what i'm doing um and i'll figure it out


---------44:45----------
i'm not worried about it but i i do


---------44:47----------
realize i'm


---------44:49----------
perhaps a little bit um


---------44:51----------
under prepared at times


---------44:53----------
uh and that just comes from yeah being a


---------44:55----------
little bit sheltered


---------44:56----------
um


---------44:58----------
but otherwise


---------45:00----------
that's i mean if you have any specific


---------45:02----------
questions you're trying to target and


---------45:04----------
i'm happy to answer them sure i don't


---------45:05----------
have anywhere to go so let's just


---------45:07----------
acknowledge one or two things so often


---------45:08----------
times people when we think about the


---------45:11----------
past we think like oh like are we


---------45:13----------
looking for a smoking gun


---------45:15----------
you know was there a time where like you


---------45:17----------
were supposed to be like lead singer and


---------45:19----------
you're like seventh standard play


---------45:22----------
and the teacher didn't like you so they


---------45:24----------
had some other kid do it and you like


---------45:26----------
right you were filled with the hatred


---------45:28----------
and resentment and you're gonna become a


---------45:30----------
super villain in a in a marvel movie at


---------45:32----------
some point yeah like an origin story


---------45:34----------
time yeah yeah like it's like you know


---------45:36----------
hitler didn't get accepted to art school


---------45:38----------
and so that's why we have yeah exactly


---------45:40----------
so so i think the first thing to


---------45:41----------
understand is that for most human beings


---------45:43----------
like that's not the case like so


---------45:45----------
sometimes people do have extreme like


---------45:47----------
you know trauma or whatever


---------45:49----------
but i still think that for example


---------45:53----------
the way that you look at yourself in the


---------45:56----------
way that you navigate your internal


---------45:58----------
environment


---------45:59----------
is likely to be shaped at least in part


---------46:02----------
by some experiences early in life things


---------46:04----------
like priorities your values what's okay


---------46:08----------
and what's not okay like you know even


---------46:11----------
if you think about coast versus grind


---------46:14----------
where you are on that spectrum


---------46:16----------
oftentimes is like conditioned


---------46:19----------
right right so i'm the the child of two


---------46:21----------
physicians


---------46:22----------
and so there are like certain basic


---------46:24----------
things that like were baked into me in


---------46:27----------
terms of how hard i should study what's


---------46:29----------
interesting what i should try to do that


---------46:31----------
like you know other human beings are


---------46:33----------
like more important than i am there are


---------46:35----------
all kinds of stuff that's like baked


---------46:36----------
into me based on my upbringing it


---------46:38----------
doesn't have to be like traumatic but


---------46:40----------
it's absolutely no no no of course not


---------46:42----------
it's yeah no of course no i i i moment


---------46:45----------
that when you ask about my childhood


---------46:46----------
there's not yeah unless you're you're


---------46:48----------
looking for something specific i don't


---------46:49----------
have anything so yeah i i've got one or


---------46:51----------
two things i'm really curious about any


---------46:52----------
siblings


---------46:54----------
yes one uh older younger


---------46:57----------
uh younger okay


---------46:59----------
um and then


---------47:00----------
well can you just tell me like what were


---------47:03----------
things like at home i'm not fishing for


---------47:05----------
anything negative and i'm not going to


---------47:06----------
make your parents no people or anything


---------47:08----------
just like


---------47:09----------
just tell me what what are your parents


---------47:11----------
like what's it like to


---------47:12----------
you know they they um


---------47:14----------
they're very supportive in this um but


---------47:16----------
um i find that um


---------47:19----------
they're they're very like


---------47:21----------
and not in a


---------47:24----------
this is where it's because i i've kind


---------47:26----------
of made an effort to understand their


---------47:28----------
motivation in it um it's not in a


---------47:31----------
sort of pushy sense but like they want


---------47:33----------
me to succeed and purely just so i'm


---------47:35----------
comfortable and happy the same way kind


---------47:37----------
of i want me to succeed the reason is


---------47:38----------
very similar but i i feel like they also


---------47:40----------
will be like like when i when i was at


---------47:42----------
home


---------47:43----------
um


---------47:44----------
i would


---------47:44----------
i i would be reminding myself of the


---------47:46----------
things i had to do and they would as


---------47:47----------
well like they would be like hey you


---------47:49----------
still have to do this thing like i i no


---------47:50----------
if i was trying to relax i often found


---------47:52----------
that someone would be like if i made


---------47:54----------
that conscious decision that i yeah i've


---------47:55----------
chosen like i'm just going to enjoy


---------47:57----------
myself for a bit


---------47:58----------
what it could it could be disrupted by


---------48:00----------
the hey you have this thing to do and


---------48:02----------
it's like yeah and often i'd get annoyed


---------48:03----------
and they couldn't really figure out why


---------48:04----------
it's like yeah it's the reason is


---------48:06----------
because i'm aware of that i know i have


---------48:08----------
that thing to do


---------48:09----------
i've already got i'm already fighting


---------48:10----------
off my own


---------48:12----------
hey you gotta do this thing to have you


---------48:14----------
come in and then go you gotta it's like


---------48:15----------
that like now it's too much and now i'm


---------48:18----------
annoyed um what what yeah go ahead


---------48:22----------
uh so that was i think that's something


---------48:23----------
that um


---------48:25----------
that's something that possibly


---------48:27----------
causes me to work a bit more as well


---------48:28----------
because it's like if i manage to finally


---------48:30----------
reconcile it with myself the second


---------48:32----------
someone else comes along especially


---------48:33----------
someone like i feel with like parents


---------48:35----------
this is me um probably most people as


---------48:37----------
well but i


---------48:39----------
i'm very


---------48:41----------
even if i know it's not true i will take


---------48:43----------
their word as almost gospel even if i


---------48:45----------
know that that shouldn't be done because


---------48:46----------
i know that they don't always know the


---------48:48----------
best in my head i i can't shake the i'm


---------48:52----------
just gonna listen to what they say


---------48:52----------
because they're my parents and and i've


---------48:54----------
got this relationship with trust um


---------48:57----------
so you know even though logically i'm


---------48:59----------
quite aware that that why would they


---------49:01----------
know


---------49:03----------
about that thing like why you know i'm


---------49:05----------
like yep they've told me to do that


---------49:07----------
thing that's that's the thing you know


---------49:09----------
um


---------49:10----------
so i just want to point out once again


---------49:11----------
that there there's that thing again


---------49:14----------
like there's the part of you that knows


---------49:15----------
that


---------49:17----------
you don't really need to listen to them


---------49:18----------
and then there's the con like like i'm


---------49:20----------
just hearing this like this is the big


---------49:22----------
thing jack every time i ask you a


---------49:24----------
question there's always an two sides to


---------49:26----------
the answer


---------49:29----------
yeah


---------49:31----------
yeah yeah and i suspect that much of


---------49:33----------
your lack of peace


---------49:36----------
comes from the moment that those two


---------49:38----------
sides become like uniform you will be at


---------49:40----------
peace


---------49:42----------
yeah that that would be if that ever


---------49:44----------
happens that would be great i can't i'm


---------49:46----------
trying to think of a time where they


---------49:47----------
have been and i'm like


---------49:48----------
i'm not sure it's happened but


---------49:50----------
yeah we'll get there so and i think that


---------49:52----------
like you know you'll know who you are


---------49:54----------
when that happens


---------49:56----------
because that's one thing i thought about


---------49:58----------
i that's another thing when i was


---------49:59----------
thinking about that i feel like a lot of


---------50:01----------
the time i've been following the


---------50:03----------
instruction of


---------50:05----------
in a way my parents because of what i


---------50:06----------
was saying and then also just kind of


---------50:07----------
this voice i've just been following what


---------50:09----------
it tells me to do in teachers and things


---------50:10----------
like that i very i


---------50:13----------
i'm very black and white i when people


---------50:15----------
tell me things i take them very


---------50:16----------
literally and i kind of fulfill them


---------50:19----------
to a very accurate degree and and i


---------50:23----------
found that that


---------50:24----------
means that


---------50:25----------
i'm


---------50:26----------
i i feel i feel like um


---------50:29----------
like someone who's really great at


---------50:31----------
taking instructions that's what i feel


---------50:32----------
like that's me i'm really good at if you


---------50:34----------
tell me to do something doing that thing


---------50:36----------
well but i gotta be told to do it like


---------50:38----------
even with content creation i've you know


---------50:40----------
i mean this is normal but still i've


---------50:42----------
sought advice from plenty of other


---------50:43----------
people and just kind of done what they


---------50:44----------
said and that's how i got here because i


---------50:46----------
did i i i'll give myself credit and say


---------50:47----------
i did what they told me well but


---------50:50----------
i only felt confident because other


---------50:51----------
people told me to do what i was doing


---------50:54----------
it's very rare that i will just kind of


---------50:56----------
sit down formulate a plan by myself and


---------50:59----------
you know it happens


---------51:00----------
how does it feel to do well at something


---------51:02----------
that someone tells you to do


---------51:07----------
i mean same as it does do well on


---------51:09----------
anything i feel like doing well is is


---------51:11----------
fulfilling i don't think because someone


---------51:12----------
else told me to do it it's i


---------51:14----------
someone else telling me to do it gives


---------51:16----------
me that layer of confidence that um it's


---------51:19----------
oh no no let me think about how to word


---------51:21----------
that um


---------51:22----------
this is the when i used to work a job


---------51:24----------
right when i used to work like a nine to


---------51:25----------
five um my only goal in that job


---------51:28----------
essentially is to


---------51:29----------
[Music]


---------51:30----------
like do what the boss tells me to do


---------51:33----------
to a level of satisfaction that they're


---------51:35----------
happy with that's it that's all i have


---------51:36----------
to do it's a very simple role


---------51:38----------
and all of a sudden now i'm my boss


---------51:42----------
and


---------51:43----------
i find it very hard to go jack what


---------51:44----------
should i do


---------51:46----------
and jack like like because the thing is


---------51:48----------
i'm biased towards my own enjoyment


---------51:51----------
uh i'm biased to go hey like hey jack


---------51:53----------
what should i do today hey jack go put


---------51:54----------
your feet up sit down watch tv like you


---------51:56----------
know where my boss wouldn't do that they


---------51:58----------
they would keep me at a level of


---------51:59----------
productivity that is necessary but when


---------52:02----------
i leave that nine to five job i go home


---------52:04----------
i do what i want


---------52:05----------
that like that was the structure that


---------52:06----------
kind of as much as i didn't enjoy the


---------52:08----------
job i didn't find like that fulfilling i


---------52:09----------
kind of liked the structure of i go in i


---------52:12----------
do what i'm told from nine to five and i


---------52:14----------
know i've done enough for that day i go


---------52:16----------
home i do what i want that kind of


---------52:17----------
distinction


---------52:18----------
worked for me because it wasn't in my


---------52:20----------
control


---------52:21----------
okay so jack this is where things are


---------52:23----------
gonna get weird because you've just told


---------52:25----------
me what your internal experience is like


---------52:27----------
and so theoretically the statement that


---------52:29----------
you just made is the one that i should


---------52:31----------
respect and listen to the most


---------52:33----------
and yet it is the one that i'm going to


---------52:34----------
disagree with you with ah


---------52:36----------
which one was that which one was that so


---------52:38----------
you said that you're biased towards your


---------52:40----------
own enjoyment so you don't know what to


---------52:41----------
do it was easy when you had some someone


---------52:44----------
telling you what to do because you could


---------52:46----------
just set aside your own enjoyment and


---------52:48----------
fulfill their expectations


---------52:50----------
if anything i think this is like the


---------52:52----------
thing i disagree with the most strongly


---------52:55----------
yes okay i get what you're saying i


---------52:57----------
think but the thing is this is where i i


---------53:00----------
know where you're coming from and i'm


---------53:01----------
going to explain how i think it works


---------53:02----------
sure and that is please i am biased


---------53:04----------
towards my own enjoyment therefore


---------53:06----------
knowing i'm biased towards my own


---------53:07----------
enjoyment i do the exact opposite where


---------53:09----------
i i kind of go no you're being biased


---------53:11----------
you shouldn't do that and then you do


---------53:13----------
you know what i mean like i know i was


---------53:14----------
found naturally yes yeah no naturally i


---------53:17----------
am biased


---------53:18----------
over compensate


---------53:20----------
but yes if we really think about it


---------53:22----------
that over compensation


---------53:24----------
is driven by the non-enjoyment side


---------53:28----------
yeah


---------53:30----------
so i would even argue that the master


---------53:31----------
controller up here is not your enjoyment


---------53:34----------
it is the fear


---------53:35----------
that you are biased towards your own


---------53:37----------
enjoyment that causes you to


---------53:39----------
overcompensate on the other side and


---------53:40----------
grind even twice as hard


---------53:43----------
sure


---------53:45----------
so what's in control there it's not the


---------53:47----------
enjoyment


---------53:48----------
no no no no it's it's no it's not it's


---------53:51----------
not


---------53:52----------
i i yeah i kind of know that i think


---------53:54----------
it's just i think jack because i'm


---------53:59----------
how do you feel about that


---------54:01----------
i mean


---------54:03----------
not all that shocked because i think i i


---------54:05----------
probably did know that um but i think


---------54:07----------
it's like


---------54:09----------
yeah you make a good point of because i


---------54:11----------
because i do feel like that it's like


---------54:12----------
well


---------54:14----------
i feel like i i would unchecked by


---------54:17----------
myself which is a very weird thing to


---------54:18----------
say but if i was unchecked by myself i


---------54:21----------
would go off the reins and and just do


---------54:23----------
what i want to enjoy so therefore


---------54:25----------
because i'm fit know that i'm like that


---------54:27----------
which i'm technically not because i


---------54:28----------
stopped myself but because i feel like


---------54:30----------
i'm like that somewhere


---------54:32----------
i do the exact opposite which is a very


---------54:34----------
i'm glad that you're nodding your head


---------54:36----------
because that feels like a complicated


---------54:37----------
system to explain but yeah you seem to


---------54:38----------
get it so it is the fear


---------54:41----------
of letting your unchecked degenerate


---------54:45----------
jack self


---------54:46----------
go completely wild that causes you to


---------54:49----------
actually tighten the reins


---------54:51----------
and i think this is why you actually


---------54:53----------
like you said it's easy when you've got


---------54:54----------
someone else to please because in a


---------54:56----------
bizarre way when you've got someone else


---------54:58----------
to please like if you have to please


---------54:59----------
your parents you know they're gonna


---------55:01----------
watch out for enjoyment jack


---------55:04----------
you know that they may come and remind


---------55:06----------
you a little bit


---------55:07----------
but like at the end of the day like it's


---------55:09----------
kind of out of your hands


---------55:11----------
whereas it's much more terrifying to


---------55:13----------
like hold that balance yourself


---------55:16----------
yeah i'm responsible i'm responsible for


---------55:18----------
if i don't do enough


---------55:20----------
where before like in schools and blah


---------55:22----------
blah blah it's like someone else was


---------55:24----------
telling me how much to do and i just


---------55:25----------
have to do that amount before enjoyment


---------55:27----------
me can go right we've done what we need


---------55:29----------
to do let's let's do that now it's like


---------55:31----------
i have no idea how much i'm supposed to


---------55:32----------
do i'm just


---------55:34----------
ah


---------55:35----------
that you know it's overwhelming yeah


---------55:37----------
cause because now like um so jack you


---------55:39----------
said you were a good student right


---------55:41----------
yeah yeah you got a's


---------55:43----------
uh yeah yeah are you getting a's now


---------55:47----------
uh


---------55:49----------
uh i mean


---------55:50----------
this is the thing with what we do right


---------55:52----------
it's really relative


---------55:53----------
so am i getting a's i don't really know


---------55:55----------
i mean i i can't categorize it i'm do it


---------55:57----------
i mean i've got numbers that say these


---------56:00----------
are good numbers but there's people with


---------56:01----------
better numbers there's also people with


---------56:02----------
worse numbers it's


---------56:03----------
nowadays it was as high as it went now


---------56:05----------
it's like


---------56:06----------
the sky's the limit with this


---------56:08----------
and that's almost worse how are you


---------56:10----------
supposed to know when you can relax if


---------56:12----------
you don't have a's


---------56:14----------
exactly that that's that's a lot of what


---------56:16----------
i feel like yeah


---------56:18----------
right it's terrifying


---------56:22----------
it sounds to me like an unsolvable


---------56:24----------
problem


---------56:25----------
because you can never


---------56:27----------
get an a


---------56:28----------
in twitch streaming there's no official


---------56:31----------
authority that says


---------56:33----------
good job jack you were at the top of


---------56:35----------
your class


---------56:36----------
yeah the the only thing that would be


---------56:38----------
that is if they ranked them all and i


---------56:40----------
was number one that's the only way i go


---------56:41----------
i've done enough and i know that like i


---------56:43----------
know deep that as much as that's so


---------56:44----------
unrealistic and it's not like it's not


---------56:46----------
some like sick like here's something i


---------56:48----------
know that's right here it is again no of


---------56:50----------
course um and it's not i'm not trying to


---------56:52----------
argue that i've got like some like weird


---------56:54----------
like ego like i must be the best because


---------56:56----------
i am the best it's not that it's it's


---------56:58----------
if i'm the best then i can't i i don't


---------57:00----------
have to work any harder because i've


---------57:02----------
worked


---------57:03----------
as hard as anyone else on earth no one


---------57:05----------
else is doing better than me i've done


---------57:06----------
enough no one can tell me i'm not doing


---------57:08----------
enough i'm i've


---------57:09----------
that i'm there but whenever i'm not at


---------57:12----------
the very very top then there's always in


---------57:13----------
my mind someone who's doing more than me


---------57:15----------
and and then i'm like well


---------57:18----------
yeah does that allow


---------57:19----------
i i i completely i so i want to just


---------57:21----------
echo that i don't think it's ego at all


---------57:23----------
and i don't think you're upset that


---------57:25----------
someone else is doing more than you what


---------57:27----------
i think it really is


---------57:28----------
is if someone else is doing more than


---------57:31----------
you then you know that you could be


---------57:33----------
doing more


---------57:34----------
yes


---------57:36----------
right so even like you just you and this


---------57:39----------
comes back to retirement it's like why


---------57:41----------
is retirement your target i think


---------57:42----------
retirement is like


---------57:44----------
cognitively or emotionally the same


---------57:46----------
thing as being at the top of your class


---------57:49----------
because then you've made it checkbox


---------57:50----------
i've done enough


---------57:52----------
it's always about have i done enough


---------57:54----------
have i done everything that can be done


---------57:56----------
yeah and it feels to me like these two


---------57:58----------
are the same yeah i i'd agree yeah those


---------58:00----------
those two things are kind of the the two


---------58:02----------
fulfillment criteria


---------58:05----------
and the reason i mentioned retirement is


---------58:06----------
because the more realistic of the two


---------58:08----------
you know i'm with you i'm with you


---------58:10----------
yeah i think they're both like so do you


---------58:12----------
see how there's like a


---------58:13----------
shared emotional need i'm gonna call it


---------58:16----------
emotional let's just step away from that


---------58:17----------
word actually there's a shared need


---------58:19----------
between those two goal goals that allows


---------58:22----------
you to relax it's like i'm not allowed


---------58:24----------
to relax until i have achieved certain


---------58:27----------
things


---------58:30----------
okay yeah so now i have to figure out


---------58:31----------
how am i going to help you with this


---------58:34----------
do you have any ideas ooh um i the the


---------58:38----------
the one thing that people have always


---------58:39----------
tried to tell me is is kind of be


---------58:41----------
satisfied in little goals like like set


---------58:43----------
little goals and be satisfied by


---------58:45----------
achieving those but it just it just


---------58:47----------
doesn't work


---------58:49----------
yeah it doesn't work because what


---------58:50----------
happens is


---------58:51----------
because i've done it and then what


---------58:52----------
happens is i i finished one going like


---------58:54----------
cool onto the next one like it's just a


---------58:56----------
checklist at that point it's it's all it


---------58:58----------
does is what you're you're providing me


---------58:59----------
with is steps between the final one but


---------59:01----------
ultimately i'm still striving for the


---------59:02----------
same thing i'm with you because i think


---------59:04----------
that the the issue here is you've got to


---------59:06----------
let go of your goal which i think you're


---------59:07----------
going to


---------59:08----------
so


---------59:09----------
i mean


---------59:10----------
i know i kind of know where you need to


---------59:12----------
go jack i just think it's going to be


---------59:13----------
tough


---------59:14----------
so


---------59:15----------
or i have an idea so let me ask you this


---------59:17----------
like um


---------59:18----------
let me just think is there some other


---------59:20----------
way that we can get to this


---------59:28----------
what was it like being in school


---------59:31----------
um


---------59:33----------
so it came easy to me for a long time


---------59:36----------
so it was actually really great because


---------59:38----------
what had happened was i could get to the


---------59:39----------
top with very little work and actually


---------59:41----------
have a lot of enjoyment time


---------59:43----------
was


---------59:44----------
most of school and then it got to like


---------59:46----------
the last


---------59:47----------
year or two and then it became oh i've


---------59:50----------
actually got to work to be at the top


---------59:52----------
because it's now like difficult i'm i'm


---------59:54----------
i'm in big boy school and uh all of a


---------59:56----------
sudden there's now less time to enjoy


---------59:57----------
myself


---------59:58----------
and


---------59:59----------
naturally i enjoy it less and i'm i'm


---------60:01----------
not having fun because i wouldn't let


---------60:02----------
myself slip from that top position to


---------60:04----------
compensate for not you know it's like


---------60:06----------
what i could have done is carried on


---------60:08----------
having the same level of fun and done


---------60:09----------
worse in school but like hey i enjoy my


---------60:11----------
my time and i still did fine or do i did


---------60:14----------
which is


---------60:15----------
well i want to carry on getting the the


---------60:17----------
a's that i was getting i'll work harder


---------60:20----------
but i hated it


---------60:22----------
i didn't enjoy it because i didn't find


---------60:24----------
it to be particularly fulfilling work it


---------60:26----------
was just


---------60:27----------
the goal was fulfilling but the actual


---------60:29----------
work itself was tedious


---------60:36----------
okay i'm gonna just toss out some words


---------60:38----------
connect some dots you let me know if it


---------60:40----------
resonates and i think we may have a way


---------60:42----------
forward here so first of all i think


---------60:43----------
you're mentally busy in your sense of


---------60:45----------
self this is all related and here's how


---------60:47----------
i understand it


---------60:49----------
so like


---------60:50----------
you've got two warning voices


---------60:53----------
right and in the past those voices have


---------60:56----------
been


---------60:57----------
you never had to resolve the conflict


---------60:59----------
between like


---------61:01----------
white and black


---------61:02----------
because


---------61:03----------
there was an external measure which


---------61:06----------
could satisfy both sides like once


---------61:08----------
you're at the top of your class you


---------61:10----------
don't like you were trying to figure out


---------61:11----------
okay do i need to study today or do i


---------61:12----------
not need to study today and you never


---------61:14----------
had to resolve the internal conflict


---------61:17----------
because you relied on an external thing


---------61:20----------
to tell you what to do


---------61:22----------
yes with me yeah so as you have


---------61:25----------
transitioned from i school to i.t to


---------61:28----------
twitch streaming


---------61:30----------
the external influences that can resolve


---------61:33----------
that external conflict for you are no


---------61:35----------
longer there


---------61:38----------
as a result you were left with the


---------61:39----------
internal conflict and you just simply


---------61:41----------
haven't learned because you haven't


---------61:42----------
needed to and this is the other thing


---------61:44----------
jack that's kind of surprising is a lot


---------61:46----------
of people sort of never need to right


---------61:48----------
because they they move into


---------61:51----------
work structures yeah without doing this


---------61:54----------
i would never have had to myself i would


---------61:55----------
have carried on doing what i was doing


---------61:57----------
you would have gone for promotion and


---------61:58----------
then you would have gone for promotion


---------62:00----------
and then you would have like there's


---------62:02----------
always a step ladder that some


---------62:04----------
corporation or school or something else


---------62:07----------
could objectively rank you at and you


---------62:09----------
would have been a very successful very


---------62:11----------
driven very content kind of person


---------62:15----------
like in a weird way is that yeah


---------62:17----------
understandable yeah no i i agree yeah so


---------62:20----------
now the tricky thing is that without


---------62:21----------
some kind of external grading system


---------62:25----------
to let you relax


---------62:27----------
you are struggling with this idea of


---------62:30----------
how do i relax when is it okay to relax


---------62:34----------
and that in turn becomes even more


---------62:36----------
problematic because like there's always


---------62:38----------
something you can do right like as a


---------62:40----------
streamer like you can always like check


---------62:42----------
your socials more you can always


---------62:44----------
micromanage your the thumbnails for your


---------62:46----------
youtube videos you can always be dming


---------62:48----------
people to set up potential collabs you


---------62:51----------
can always upgrade your hardware and


---------62:53----------
talk to someone else about a partnership


---------62:55----------
or


---------62:55----------
you know a merch launcher like there's


---------62:57----------
always something you could be doing


---------63:00----------
so given an endless pile of tasks to do


---------63:03----------
and given a


---------63:05----------
complete absence of a grading system to


---------63:08----------
tell you it's okay to relax


---------63:10----------
you don't know how to relax


---------63:13----------
and so you end up with this kind of


---------63:15----------
thing where you grind grind grind grind


---------63:17----------
grind and even like in your deepest


---------63:19----------
parts of yourself you're like this is


---------63:21----------
absurd this is enough i deserve to relax


---------63:24----------
and then you kind of swing that way but


---------63:26----------
then like what happens is you become


---------63:27----------
mentally busy as you're sitting there


---------63:30----------
hanging out by the beach with your


---------63:32----------
friends y'all are chilling


---------63:34----------
the first 24 hours you're like totally


---------63:36----------
fine


---------63:37----------
36 hours you're like hey maybe i should


---------63:40----------
let me check discord


---------63:42----------
and get back to one or two emails like


---------63:43----------
whatever you use twitter dms or


---------63:46----------
instagram whatever i don't know and the


---------63:48----------
thoughts start creeping in creeping in


---------63:49----------
creeping and creeping and creeping in


---------63:51----------
and then you're like oh i've relaxed too


---------63:53----------
much like let me start


---------63:55----------
working again or even somewhere in the


---------63:57----------
middle there it's like two days in you


---------63:59----------
start to get conflicted because you're


---------64:00----------
like oh like i was gonna take a long


---------64:02----------
weekend with my friends but then you're


---------64:04----------
like that not paralysis but almost your


---------64:07----------
parents come into the room and be like


---------64:08----------
hey


---------64:09----------
you should be studying


---------64:11----------
and you're like no i set aside these 72


---------64:13----------
hours for me to relax and i'm going to


---------64:14----------
take care of it on monday but then like


---------64:16----------
that voice kind of creeps in it's like


---------64:17----------
hey


---------64:18----------
did you forget you're like no no i


---------64:20----------
didn't forget like it's accounted for


---------64:22----------
and over time like this it's almost like


---------64:23----------
an anxiety kind of builds up and then


---------64:25----------
other things start to pile on it's like


---------64:27----------
oh my god like if i i know i took 72


---------64:29----------
hours for a vacation but like i'm gonna


---------64:31----------
miss out on this opportunity and then


---------64:33----------
like this thing could happen and then


---------64:34----------
like i should be doing this and like the


---------64:36----------
anxieties kind of grow and eventually i


---------64:38----------
think a fear sets in


---------64:40----------
that since i don't know when to relax i


---------64:43----------
have to grind and grind and grind


---------64:44----------
because if i don't do it now


---------64:47----------
it could come falling apart


---------64:49----------
and i don't know where i'm going to be i


---------64:51----------
don't know that i'll be able to retire


---------64:53----------
i'll be able to relax once i'm dead


---------64:56----------
right it's kind of like this i like this


---------64:58----------
kind of pressure of like okay like once


---------64:59----------
i hit that point then i can sort of


---------65:01----------
relax


---------65:02----------
and what i'm i'm sort of hearing is that


---------65:03----------
fear sets in at some point


---------65:05----------
fear of consequences fear of missed


---------65:07----------
opportunities fear of not doing enough


---------65:10----------
and then like also social media and


---------65:11----------
stuff is kind of


---------65:13----------
kind of adding on kind of saying oh like


---------65:14----------
did you see what that person is doing


---------65:16----------
maybe i should be doing that too yeah


---------65:18----------
yeah


---------65:18----------
right so all those kind of thoughts set


---------65:20----------
in and at the end of the day like you're


---------65:21----------
kind of where you are which is like very


---------65:23----------
successful


---------65:25----------
very grateful i i get a lot of genuine


---------65:27----------
gratitude i don't get the sense that you


---------65:28----------
blame anyone i don't get the sense that


---------65:30----------
you're egotistical but internally i do


---------65:34----------
get the sense of some amount of like you


---------65:36----------
don't really know who you are


---------65:38----------
and you don't know exactly


---------65:40----------
how long this is there's just a lot of


---------65:42----------
unknowns and uncertainty


---------65:44----------
yeah no yeah exactly yeah


---------65:46----------
and so


---------65:49----------
yeah


---------65:51----------
anything that i got wrong or anything


---------65:53----------
that you want to add or anything you


---------65:54----------
think we're missing is that you no i i


---------65:56----------
feel like yeah that's a there's a pretty


---------65:58----------
good summary there's one thing i suppose


---------66:00----------
that i might add just there's always


---------66:01----------
this part of me as well that as i'm


---------66:03----------
telling you this is like i hope i'm not


---------66:05----------
telling you


---------66:07----------
who i think i am and not why why i'm not


---------66:10----------
sorry


---------66:10----------
and not what i


---------66:12----------
like


---------66:13----------
my words i'm just stumbling a bit yeah


---------66:15----------
um


---------66:16----------
i like i don't want to be telling you


---------66:18----------
all this because there's also a part of


---------66:19----------
me that is when i'm telling you all this


---------66:21----------
is like is this who i am or is this who


---------66:23----------
i think i am and actually i'm there's


---------66:25----------
little parts of me that are just just


---------66:27----------
altering things like


---------66:29----------
am i really conflicted or am i really


---------66:31----------
just lazy there's that little voice


---------66:32----------
that's like you know what i mean like


---------66:34----------
like there's that part of me that's like


---------66:35----------
i'm telling you all this and that's


---------66:36----------
great and if this is the case then like


---------66:38----------
you know i feel less lazy because this


---------66:40----------
doesn't sound like a lazy person what


---------66:42----------
you're describing i'm like but am i


---------66:45----------
picking my words carefully to deceit to


---------66:47----------
deceive you


---------66:48----------
because then you won't look at me as


---------66:49----------
lazy because that's also a thing i would


---------66:51----------
hate that jack so here's the key thing


---------66:54----------
this is gonna be hard okay so by the way


---------66:56----------
you're doing fantastic


---------66:58----------
we are sort of at the barrier of like


---------67:00----------
some very abstract weird mental stuff


---------67:03----------
that's hard to pin down


---------67:04----------
cool so i want you to think about your


---------67:07----------
thought just now


---------67:09----------
i'm gonna ask you a question that i'm 99


---------67:11----------
sure you're not going to be able to


---------67:12----------
answer but i want you to just try anyway


---------67:14----------
where does that thought come from


---------67:16----------
where's the origin of that


---------67:19----------
oh this sounds real but


---------67:21----------
what if i'm just lazy and i'm just


---------67:23----------
making i'm tricking this guy


---------67:25----------
to seem like it's okay that i'm doing


---------67:27----------
this


---------67:30----------
but


---------67:31----------
i'm just lazy like where is that thought


---------67:32----------
coming from


---------67:34----------
uh


---------67:35----------
so


---------67:37----------
i


---------67:38----------
it's so one thing that makes me feel


---------67:40----------
better is like you said earlier when


---------67:42----------
people tell me


---------67:43----------
like like that ex you right now almost


---------67:45----------
an external factor that's telling me i'm


---------67:47----------
doing enough almost like right now


---------67:48----------
that's what you're kind of fulfilling


---------67:49----------
and


---------67:51----------
that makes me feel better


---------67:52----------
but what i can do as a person who can


---------67:55----------
because ultimately you only know what i


---------67:57----------
tell you so what i can do is manipulate


---------67:59----------
my words cleverly enough to make you


---------68:01----------
believe i'm doing enough because then


---------68:04----------
you tell me i'm doing enough and i can


---------68:05----------
relax it's like in school right i i did


---------68:08----------
this couple of times in school where i


---------68:09----------
genuinely was


---------68:11----------
like it's like hey did you do that


---------68:12----------
homework no i i i didn't get time i'll


---------68:15----------
do it tomorrow really i just forgot but


---------68:17----------
i'm making them look like i wasn't being


---------68:19----------
lazy about it and making them feel like


---------68:21----------
i'm giving them some excuse that seems a


---------68:22----------
bit more reasonable um and it just it


---------68:25----------
just it people pass less judgment


---------68:27----------
you know you don't whatever


---------68:29----------
and


---------68:31----------
i think i'm losing my train of thought


---------68:33----------
here so i'm going to try and get myself


---------68:35----------
just keep going it's like


---------68:37----------
it's that comes from the part of me that


---------68:39----------
is like


---------68:41----------
scared that


---------68:42----------
what i'm doing is i'm


---------68:45----------
so when you turn around and it's like


---------68:46----------
you're not lazy blah blah


---------68:48----------
there's a part of me that's like


---------68:50----------
doubting that and going no he's not


---------68:53----------
lying to you like i don't think you're


---------68:54----------
lying to me but what i think is that i


---------68:56----------
have manipulated what i've said in a way


---------68:58----------
to make you say that because that's what


---------68:59----------
i wanted to hear and therefore


---------69:01----------
i'm still actually lazy i've just made


---------69:04----------
you affirm me so i feel better


---------69:06----------
and that there's a fear of that


---------69:08----------
happening and that's i think where i


---------69:09----------
don't know if necessary that answers the


---------69:10----------
questions where does that thought come


---------69:11----------
from but that explains the process very


---------69:13----------
good so


---------69:16----------
i don't know if you've noticed this jack


---------69:17----------
but i've not told you that i think


---------69:19----------
you're doing enough


---------69:20----------
have you noticed that no you've not said


---------69:23----------
those words exactly yeah why don't you


---------69:24----------
think i've said this i i know i know


---------69:27----------
uh


---------69:29----------
i don't know i can tell you why you


---------69:31----------
haven't what would you feel if i told


---------69:32----------
you jack i think you're doing a


---------69:34----------
fantastic job i think you are doing


---------69:35----------
enough what would happen that's great


---------69:37----------
that's great that's great and then


---------69:39----------
there's a little part of me that goes


---------69:41----------
we're having this discussion naturally


---------69:42----------
of course so this is this is what's


---------69:44----------
happening right so if i say jack i think


---------69:46----------
you're bro you're young give yourself


---------69:49----------
time


---------69:50----------
you'll get there


---------69:52----------
have some faith in yourself how would


---------69:53----------
you respond to that forgive my sarcastic


---------69:55----------
tone


---------69:59----------
but like i i'd be like


---------70:02----------
it's nice and and it would allow me for


---------70:05----------
for a period to go


---------70:06----------
yeah maybe i should


---------70:08----------
but then what would happen is that but


---------70:10----------
the thing that so you've you're


---------70:12----------
affirming me that i should relax and


---------70:14----------
what happened is are there a stream that


---------70:16----------
doesn't do great or but i'll sit down or


---------70:18----------
something just like something is down


---------70:20----------
and then that affirms me in the opposite


---------70:21----------
direction


---------70:23----------
dr k was wrong you aren't doing enough


---------70:24----------
because here's a number that says so


---------70:26----------
beautiful right so here's the thing it


---------70:28----------
comes back to the war between the two


---------70:30----------
there's the


---------70:31----------
there's the content you


---------70:33----------
and the grind you and there's a way of


---------70:35----------
affirming both and that's awesome and so


---------70:37----------
if i say that you're gonna do enough if


---------70:40----------
i say


---------70:41----------
jack you're so like you've come so far


---------70:43----------
for your age man


---------70:45----------
you're such an awesome like you've come


---------70:46----------
so far like so much to be grateful for


---------70:48----------
you deserve to relax bro you're 19. have


---------70:51----------
have the time of your life dude


---------70:53----------
go out you shouldn't be grinding you can


---------70:56----------
grind when you're 29. i could say all


---------70:58----------
those things and there'd be a part of


---------70:59----------
you that would listen right because


---------71:00----------
remember there's two parts of you and


---------71:02----------
then that other part of you would be


---------71:04----------
like no it's not enough


---------71:06----------
right this guy doesn't understand


---------71:08----------
it'll start saying these kinds of things


---------71:11----------
right because he's not like i'm not


---------71:12----------
actually like a streamer your mind will


---------71:14----------
generate all kinds of ideas


---------71:16----------
to devalue what i say so i've tried


---------71:19----------
really hard to not engage with that part


---------71:23----------
and despite the fact that i've never


---------71:24----------
told you i think you're doing enough


---------71:26----------
i've never told you i think you're doing


---------71:27----------
a good job


---------71:29----------
somehow you are feeling more relaxed you


---------71:32----------
are feeling like oh i am actually doing


---------71:34----------
a good job this is okay this is okay


---------71:37----------
this is the signal that i'm sending you


---------71:39----------
subconsciously and you are receiving it


---------71:42----------
and the moment that i send you that


---------71:43----------
signal and you start to really receive


---------71:45----------
it


---------71:46----------
that little thing is like i'm tricking


---------71:48----------
him


---------71:49----------
because if your mind convinces you that


---------71:52----------
you're tricking me then it invalidates


---------71:54----------
everything that i've tried to say so


---------71:56----------
i've tried to be a subtle [ __ ] because


---------71:58----------
i'm talking to you


---------71:59----------
and i'm talking to that other part of


---------72:01----------
you and i'm trying to trick it


---------72:03----------
and now i've tricked you


---------72:06----------
but it is not buying my bs it detects


---------72:09----------
what i'm doing and starts to doubt and


---------72:12----------
starts to warn you it's a warning


---------72:14----------
because oh my god jack what would happen


---------72:17----------
if i made you feel like you're doing


---------72:19----------
okay


---------72:20----------
yeah i i i could stop doing as much


---------72:23----------
and then and then all this will


---------72:24----------
disappear yeah exactly right and that's


---------72:27----------
that part of you


---------72:28----------
so here's the thing jack why do you


---------72:30----------
believe that at the core of it


---------72:33----------
what i'm getting is that there's a part


---------72:34----------
of you that believes very strong i know


---------72:36----------
this may be a stretch


---------72:38----------
but if you are tr


---------72:40----------
let me


---------72:42----------
this is gonna be hard for me but let me


---------72:43----------
try so if there's a part of you that


---------72:46----------
tricks p so


---------72:48----------
two options right one is you're being


---------72:49----------
authentic right now and you're not


---------72:51----------
actually lazy and i'm sort of like


---------72:54----------
you're i'm i'm authentically reading you


---------72:57----------
and i'm authentically responding to you


---------72:59----------
and this is truth you with it yeah


---------73:02----------
sure


---------73:03----------
and then there's another part of you


---------73:04----------
that's like you're tricking me


---------73:07----------
and that invalidates my support of you


---------73:09----------
because i'm being tricked


---------73:11----------
but


---------73:12----------
if you're tricking me


---------73:15----------
that means


---------73:16----------
that there's a part of you that


---------73:19----------
genuinely believes like you're lazy does


---------73:22----------
that make sense


---------73:23----------
because the only way you could trick me


---------73:24----------
into believing you're not lazy


---------73:26----------
is like


---------73:27----------
it


---------73:28----------
does that make sense it's like it has to


---------73:29----------
come from a belief


---------73:32----------
yes it does


---------73:33----------
yeah so where does that come from


---------73:35----------
like why do you believe you're lazy


---------73:37----------
why are you afraid you're lazy maybe


---------73:39----------
that's a better question


---------73:43----------
afraid i'm afraid of it because i


---------73:47----------
i don't know i i feel like


---------73:49----------
and that's maybe one thing that's been


---------73:50----------
instilled in me through school parents


---------73:53----------
everyone has kind of instilled in me


---------73:54----------
that i shouldn't be so i think that's


---------73:55----------
maybe just like kind of it's one of


---------73:56----------
those like seven deadly stints that's


---------73:58----------
like like in my brain it's like


---------74:00----------
you know that should not be lazy it's


---------74:02----------
just in my head you know what i mean


---------74:03----------
yeah sure so i'm gonna ask you a


---------74:05----------
question jack


---------74:06----------
when did you when did the installation


---------74:09----------
of the fear that you were lazy like when


---------74:12----------
was the how is there how old were you


---------74:15----------
when you started being worried that you


---------74:17----------
might be lazy


---------74:20----------
[Music]


---------74:23----------
probably at the point where it began to


---------74:24----------
matter so that would be when i felt like


---------74:26----------
i had to start working which was towards


---------74:28----------
the end of school like the the point at


---------74:30----------
which i felt that like doing well


---------74:32----------
required work


---------74:34----------
because what happened was um i wasn't


---------74:36----------
particularly used to working on things


---------74:37----------
and i hated it i was like whoa i'm


---------74:39----------
having to work way more this sucks and


---------74:41----------
that made me go god i'm a lazy person


---------74:42----------
because i hate work and i don't think it


---------74:44----------
necessarily is that it was more that


---------74:48----------
you know i'm enjoying myself less


---------74:49----------
naturally i'm not gonna and of course


---------74:50----------
i'm not gonna like enjoy myself


---------74:52----------
how humans are um


---------74:55----------
you know does a story come to mind like


---------74:57----------
a particular moment or time when you


---------75:00----------
realize that you're gonna have to start


---------75:01----------
working


---------75:04----------
not exactly just just


---------75:05----------
when i started um


---------75:08----------
sixth form which i don't uk schooling


---------75:10----------
it's like the last sort of how is the


---------75:12----------
last oh uni i would oh how old would i


---------75:15----------
be 16


---------75:16----------
i'd be like 16 or 17 at that point


---------75:18----------
probably 16. is there anything you can


---------75:20----------
share with me in terms of like concrete


---------75:22----------
stuff about moments or like just what it


---------75:24----------
was like being 16 and sort of realizing


---------75:26----------
you can't afford to be lazy anymore


---------75:29----------
uh


---------75:31----------
this sixth form is one of these ones


---------75:33----------
where like


---------75:34----------
i didn't realize how much i hated it


---------75:36----------
until i left and i think i genuinely


---------75:38----------
have suppressed a lot of it because i


---------75:39----------
don't remember it very well which is


---------75:41----------
strange for how recent it is but i it's


---------75:43----------
all one big blur of just not enjoying


---------75:45----------
myself and hoping to get through it um


---------75:48----------
and i don't remember there's moments


---------75:48----------
where i did enjoy myself but like


---------75:50----------
overall just the whole experience i


---------75:52----------
found stressful um but


---------75:55----------
can you just tell me about that


---------75:57----------
experience what comes to mind


---------75:59----------
i just i remember just


---------76:01----------
being unhappy with it like just being


---------76:02----------
like i hate this i can't wait to leave


---------76:05----------
and don't get me wrong i had good


---------76:06----------
friends and the social elements were


---------76:08----------
great


---------76:09----------
when they were


---------76:10----------
things i could focus on but half of the


---------76:12----------
time i couldn't so i just felt like


---------76:15----------
wow this i don't enjoy this i


---------76:17----------
this isn't great you know it was just a


---------76:20----------
period that but and i considered leaving


---------76:23----------
a lot


---------76:24----------
um


---------76:25----------
i never did


---------76:26----------
um


---------76:27----------
i i'm not even 100 convinced that i


---------76:29----------
wouldn't have done covid kicked us out


---------76:30----------
early and i'm not convinced that i would


---------76:32----------
have made it to the very very end i was


---------76:34----------
getting really getting the end of my


---------76:35----------
tether by the end of it


---------76:36----------
um but but they kicked us out early and


---------76:39----------
and that and


---------76:40----------
they kind of


---------76:42----------
we didn't take exams i don't know if you


---------76:43----------
heard much about like what happened in


---------76:44----------
the uk with that but they just kind of


---------76:45----------
went hey you know it's not safe to get


---------76:48----------
all these kids in exam rooms we're just


---------76:49----------
going to work out your grades from the


---------76:50----------
work you've done over the past two years


---------76:52----------
and


---------76:53----------
you're done have fun


---------76:54----------
like you've done what you can we're just


---------76:56----------
going to use everything we've got up


---------76:56----------
until now um so they kicked us out early


---------76:59----------
um


---------77:00----------
and i was like oh wow okay


---------77:03----------
guess i'm guess i'm done


---------77:05----------
how did you feel about that


---------77:07----------
uh a little bit worried because


---------77:09----------
obviously i hadn't treated


---------77:12----------
so


---------77:12----------
there's two parts of me there's like a


---------77:14----------
little part of you that's worried


---------77:15----------
because there was no warning to that


---------77:17----------
there was no like hey


---------77:19----------
i mean they say this throughout school


---------77:20----------
but you never really believe it because


---------77:21----------
it's like hey in the scenario that on


---------77:23----------
the way to an exam you get run over by


---------77:24----------
car and break your legs or use your


---------77:26----------
previous work but like what's the


---------77:27----------
chances right and then all of a sudden


---------77:29----------
that thing actually happens was like hey


---------77:30----------
we're actually using your stuff and


---------77:31----------
you're like


---------77:32----------
well i didn't treat this like it was


---------77:33----------
going to be the thing that design


---------77:34----------
decides what grades i get in the end


---------77:36----------
like that's a little bit stressful but i


---------77:38----------
also knew that these things have been


---------77:39----------
graded throughout school and i was doing


---------77:40----------
well so i was like ultimately


---------77:43----------
i should be fine there's no reason i


---------77:44----------
shouldn't get a's i've been getting a's


---------77:46----------
pretty much throughout this i i should


---------77:48----------
be fine uh at which point i went okay


---------77:51----------
guess i gotta wait till august it's


---------77:52----------
march


---------77:54----------
like and that was it i was done like and


---------77:56----------
i didn't go get a job i'm like well i


---------77:58----------
was like well i had you know i worked um


---------78:01----------
through my summers uh so i was like ah i


---------78:03----------
i got money i don't need a job i'm just


---------78:05----------
gonna


---------78:06----------
enjoy it because


---------78:09----------
i mean i you know when's the world gonna


---------78:12----------
be like this again


---------78:14----------
yes


---------78:15----------
so you were um


---------78:17----------
in school and you were hating it right


---------78:19----------
is that right you were in school and you


---------78:21----------
were hating it right towards that end


---------78:22----------
part yeah definitely


---------78:27----------
there was a chance that if covert didn't


---------78:29----------
happen you wouldn't have finished school


---------78:32----------
so


---------78:33----------
that's the thing would i have probably


---------78:34----------
probably not i i really felt like i was


---------78:36----------
getting to that point and a friend of


---------78:38----------
mine dropped and then i was like whoa


---------78:40----------
okay that kind of


---------78:41----------
because i constantly thought about it


---------78:43----------
constantly


---------78:44----------
and i but i cannot say i would have ever


---------78:47----------
done it


---------78:48----------
because i would you i don't


---------78:50----------
how would you have felt about yourself


---------78:52----------
if you did do it


---------78:54----------
i don't know uh depends what i went on


---------78:56----------
to do afterwards i think


---------78:58----------
it would i think i would have had to


---------78:59----------
wait till the consequence


---------79:00----------
if it was a if there was an extra if or


---------79:03----------
i say extremely negative consequence if


---------79:05----------
i perceived it to be an extremely


---------79:07----------
negative consequence uh then i would


---------79:08----------
have beat myself up about it uh and if i


---------79:11----------
got on fine


---------79:13----------
i wouldn't i suppose i wouldn't have


---------79:14----------
cared um


---------79:16----------
yeah it's like i dropped out of uni to


---------79:17----------
do this right but that made sense i was


---------79:20----------
doing well in this and like so the


---------79:21----------
consequences are good so all of a sudden


---------79:24----------
it's like great you know like i made the


---------79:26----------
right decision and i i never think back


---------79:28----------
on that like that is not something i


---------79:30----------
think back on and if a scenario like


---------79:31----------
that would have happened where i found


---------79:32----------
something that was amazing then great


---------79:35----------
but if it didn't then yeah i would have


---------79:36----------
been pretty annoyed


---------79:39----------
so this is where um


---------79:41----------
i'm gonna say something that


---------79:45----------
may be a bit judgmental and is


---------79:47----------
it's more of a hypothesis than a


---------79:49----------
conclusion


---------79:50----------
but


---------79:51----------
i get the sense like something just


---------79:53----------
clicked for me so like i think that


---------79:55----------
what's really confused me this entire


---------79:57----------
time jack is like where you get the idea


---------80:00----------
that you're lazy


---------80:01----------
essentially why don't you have faith in


---------80:04----------
yourself


---------80:05----------
because the tricky thing is why do you


---------80:07----------
need like external things to reassure


---------80:09----------
you you need external things


---------80:11----------
fundamentally if anyone out there is


---------80:12----------
like listening


---------80:14----------
we need external things when we don't


---------80:15----------
believe in ourselves right if i doubt my


---------80:18----------
intelligence and i get an a i feel


---------80:20----------
reassurance from the external world


---------80:22----------
so reassurance from the external world


---------80:25----------
really only like exists when i have


---------80:27----------
insecurity


---------80:28----------
does that make sense


---------80:30----------
so the thing that's been really


---------80:31----------
confusing about this whole conversation


---------80:33----------
is i've been trying to understand like


---------80:34----------
i've thought from kind of early on that


---------80:36----------
there's something you know why are you


---------80:38----------
afraid of coasting why are you afraid of


---------80:40----------
being lazy you know it sounds like you


---------80:42----------
can really enjoy things and logically


---------80:44----------
you understand that like you're still


---------80:45----------
doing well and stuff like that but at


---------80:47----------
the root of this i'm getting i'm getting


---------80:49----------
this sense like even when we talked


---------80:51----------
about the conflict i'm being dumb


---------80:54----------
that's like that sort of thought that


---------80:55----------
you have where does that come from where


---------80:57----------
did your mind learn


---------80:59----------
that you're dumb because it sounds like


---------81:00----------
you did well in school sounds like


---------81:02----------
you're pretty successful sounds like


---------81:03----------
you're pretty driven i was really


---------81:04----------
confused about there's some like there's


---------81:06----------
this like nugget of something which


---------81:09----------
feels incompetent to me within you


---------81:11----------
that you believe about yourself and so


---------81:14----------
you look for these big external things


---------81:16----------
like if i'm the number one twitch


---------81:17----------
streamer i retire or things like that


---------81:19----------
then you'll have such a blanket


---------81:21----------
reassurance that that thing won't have a


---------81:24----------
leg to stand on


---------81:26----------
and i've seen that thing manifest in


---------81:29----------
your words like over and over and over


---------81:31----------
again it manifests i want you to go back


---------81:33----------
and watch this and just listen to the


---------81:34----------
number of times you say but


---------81:36----------
you'll say something that's like really


---------81:38----------
logical and then you'll be like but and


---------81:40----------
even the most extreme manifestation


---------81:41----------
which like i've tried really hard to not


---------81:44----------
be encouraging or reassuring to you


---------81:46----------
because i had a feeling that the second


---------81:48----------
i say jack i think you're doing a great


---------81:50----------
job that thing would have popped up


---------81:52----------
and even despite the fact that like i


---------81:54----------
didn't say it to you a single time i've


---------81:55----------
been sending you like positive


---------81:57----------
reassuring vibes it still


---------81:59----------
popped up and it said


---------82:01----------
yeah hey


---------82:02----------
you're tricking him


---------82:04----------
he doesn't really know who you are


---------82:06----------
and then it's like wait but what does


---------82:07----------
that part of you believe about you right


---------82:09----------
why does it think if if you're if you're


---------82:12----------
tricking me into believing that you're a


---------82:13----------
decent good hard-working human being


---------82:16----------
the only reason your mind would think


---------82:17----------
that that's a trick is if it believed


---------82:18----------
the opposite does that make sense


---------82:20----------
so that word trick is very important


---------82:22----------
because it gives us a clue


---------82:24----------
to what you believe about yourself and


---------82:27----------
this also is not it's not like all of


---------82:29----------
you believes this it's just like a doubt


---------82:30----------
that's lingering it's a yeah yeah it's


---------82:32----------
there yeah totally yeah yeah and and i i


---------82:34----------
think that for me what just clicked is


---------82:36----------
like i believe that despite all your


---------82:38----------
success


---------82:39----------
despite how good you are at grinding


---------82:41----------
despite all of your parental support


---------82:43----------
despite all of the faith that you do


---------82:45----------
have in yourself you know that you're


---------82:47----------
capable


---------82:49----------
you could have dropped out of school


---------82:52----------
yeah


---------82:53----------
and there's this part of like the and i


---------82:55----------
wonder if this is sort of it and this


---------82:56----------
something i leave you with a hypothesis


---------82:58----------
as opposed to a conclusion because i


---------82:59----------
don't really know we'd have to have


---------83:00----------
another two hour conversation but


---------83:02----------
what i'm really hearing is like despite


---------83:04----------
everything that you have be proud of


---------83:06----------
just think about how terrifying that is


---------83:08----------
for you to like be so smart and be so


---------83:10----------
hardworking and be able to grind and


---------83:12----------
still essentially wash out


---------83:15----------
like that would be such a blow to like


---------83:17----------
what you're capable of in this life does


---------83:20----------
that make sense


---------83:21----------
it's like if you can wash out a school


---------83:24----------
despite all the stuff that you're good


---------83:25----------
at like


---------83:27----------
you know if the tedium gets too much for


---------83:29----------
you to handle i don't think it's about


---------83:30----------
intelligence i think it's about laziness


---------83:33----------
because what would you tell yourself if


---------83:35----------
you dropped out of school


---------83:37----------
like


---------83:37----------
you're [ __ ] lazy


---------83:40----------
you could have done it you just couldn't


---------83:42----------
cut it


---------83:44----------
and i may be like making things a little


---------83:46----------
bit extreme and i'm kind of doing that


---------83:47----------
on purpose because i don't really know


---------83:49----------
if this is connected for you it may not


---------83:51----------
connect it may just i just may be wrong


---------83:53----------
here yeah


---------83:54----------
yeah


---------83:55----------
but this whole time like of all of the


---------83:57----------
things that really surprised me jack out


---------83:59----------
of everything you've said it's the idea


---------84:01----------
that you could have dropped out of


---------84:02----------
school


---------84:04----------
right you describe yourself as a good


---------84:06----------
student you're a hard worker you try


---------84:08----------
really hard like you're like easy to set


---------84:10----------
targets just like if this person says do


---------84:12----------
this i'm gonna be like the best employee


---------84:14----------
i can it's simple there's one thing that


---------84:17----------
has happened which is run contrary to


---------84:19----------
everything that you've said and that's


---------84:21----------
you could have failed out dropped out or


---------84:23----------
been unable to do school


---------84:26----------
and so something tells me i wonder if


---------84:28----------
like sort of that core of doubt this


---------84:30----------
sort of idea that i am lazy this fear


---------84:32----------
that you could wind up lazy because now


---------84:35----------
what's happening is you got saved do you


---------84:37----------
get that


---------84:38----------
it was like you were losing this game


---------84:40----------
and then like your your opponent in the


---------84:42----------
grand finals dc'd


---------84:44----------
right because covid happened


---------84:46----------
and so like you dodged a bullet you


---------84:48----------
never got tested


---------84:50----------
you didn't know


---------84:51----------
like sure like logically you're like oh


---------84:53----------
yeah like i may have i probably would


---------84:55----------
have been fine but there's some part of


---------84:57----------
you that i wonder if you like you got


---------84:58----------
saved like do you feel that way


---------85:02----------
i don't know i i really i struggled


---------85:04----------
because i honestly i've there's plenty


---------85:05----------
of times where i feel like quitting a


---------85:07----------
lot of things and i never do it


---------85:09----------
so


---------85:10----------
you know but that was like i used to say


---------85:12----------
that


---------85:13----------
basically every week i'm like i'm not


---------85:15----------
sure if i can do this i i really hated


---------85:16----------
it i'm not quite sure what about it i


---------85:18----------
really really hated um there i think


---------85:21----------
there's a few elements and i think per


---------85:22----------
there's just a part of me that there's i


---------85:24----------
don't think i was in my mentally


---------85:26----------
soundest place at that point and that


---------85:28----------
was there was a lot of added stress


---------85:30----------
anyway um so i feel like


---------85:32----------
it was more of a mental sort of like i


---------85:34----------
don't know if i can deal with the stress


---------85:36----------
of this


---------85:37----------
sort of thing um and so what is someone


---------85:39----------
who can't deal with the mental stress of


---------85:41----------
it what would you call that person


---------85:43----------
uh


---------85:46----------
you see my brain's saying weak but that


---------85:47----------
feels harsh um i i feel like that's not


---------85:49----------
necessarily like i feel like there it is


---------85:51----------
again that's harsh but you see that you


---------85:53----------
see the two sides yeah your brain comes


---------85:56----------
up with an answer and i think that's how


---------85:57----------
you would have felt


---------85:58----------
right


---------86:00----------
and i don't think you could convince me


---------86:01----------
otherwise that like if you would have


---------86:03----------
felt weak


---------86:04----------
like sure there's constantly told myself


---------86:06----------
that i wasn't i would have been like no


---------86:07----------
it's reasonable that you did i would


---------86:08----------
have done the logic thing but then deep


---------86:10----------
down no i think exactly right that's the


---------86:13----------
thing because i think logically you're


---------86:14----------
doing a good job


---------86:15----------
but i think deep down and that's where


---------86:18----------
like so i think going forward you know


---------86:19----------
here's my advice for you for lack of a


---------86:21----------
better term the first is to like notice


---------86:24----------
the butts


---------86:26----------
so like just notice that sometimes


---------86:28----------
you're conflicted second thing is notice


---------86:30----------
that like neither side is stupid


---------86:33----------
i think like you don't need don't force


---------86:35----------
yourself to change yet i just want you


---------86:37----------
to like


---------86:38----------
like digest this conversation and just


---------86:40----------
like think about what we've talked about


---------86:43----------
and notice the manifestations of these


---------86:45----------
things is there a part of you that


---------86:47----------
really feels like you know unless you do


---------86:49----------
this like it is all going to come


---------86:50----------
crumbling apart


---------86:52----------
are you basically like


---------86:54----------
the grind is the grind to overcome like


---------86:57----------
and this is going to sound harsh the


---------86:58----------
fundamental weakness that exists within


---------87:01----------
you


---------87:04----------
yeah probably like that that sounds


---------87:06----------
about right i'd say yeah i mean like


---------87:08----------
yeah i'm very


---------87:10----------
i'm really afraid of like this falling


---------87:12----------
apart because i don't know what i'd do


---------87:14----------
without it i don't know if i could pick


---------87:15----------
myself back up and just


---------87:17----------
get on i i i don't know what i do like i


---------87:19----------
really don't and that's terrifying deep


---------87:21----------
down jack what are you


---------87:25----------
i i i i don't want to say it and that's


---------87:27----------
interesting but


---------87:29----------
you're you're fishing for week and i'm


---------87:31----------
and i know that but i don't want to say


---------87:33----------
it um because i'm like no i'm not weak


---------87:35----------
i'm i'm offended at the fact that you'd


---------87:36----------
even suggest it but


---------87:38----------
i know that's not your suggestion yep


---------87:40----------
but i i am bringing it out because i


---------87:42----------
want that reaction right so i i know


---------87:45----------
you're not gonna say it


---------87:46----------
because


---------87:47----------
because even if you if you felt


---------87:49----------
confident in yourself you could say it


---------87:52----------
do you get that


---------87:54----------
right


---------87:55----------
okay that that's funny yeah yeah right


---------87:57----------
yeah because like like like jack are you


---------87:59----------
stupid you could say yes


---------88:02----------
like you have no problem saying yes


---------88:04----------
i think yeah i know i could say that


---------88:05----------
yeah no no no no i feel stupid


---------88:07----------
i'm dumb


---------88:08----------
yeah exactly exactly right so that's


---------88:10----------
confidence


---------88:12----------
so it's okay like i don't need you to


---------88:14----------
say it i'm but i'm just bringing it up


---------88:15----------
and i'm glad so you know it was a good


---------88:17----------
point it was a good point right and


---------88:18----------
you're like i'm not going to say it


---------88:20----------
uh-uh


---------88:21----------
good


---------88:23----------
right so that's the problem


---------88:25----------
is like and it's like here's the wildest


---------88:27----------
thing which i don't know if you're gonna


---------88:29----------
be able to accept yet i think it's okay


---------88:31----------
for you to be weak


---------88:33----------
i think it's okay for you to be not


---------88:35----------
enough


---------88:35----------
i think whatsoever you are i know it


---------88:38----------
sounds kind of weird like is enough and


---------88:40----------
i'm not just saying that because i'm not


---------88:42----------
saying that because like everyone is


---------88:44----------
enough i don't think that i think some


---------88:46----------
people genuinely do need to be doing


---------88:48----------
more in life


---------88:49----------
i think in your case


---------88:51----------
i do think you're doing a fantastic job


---------88:53----------
and i think it's okay


---------88:55----------
for you to have parts of weakness within


---------88:57----------
you because i know this sounds kind of


---------88:59----------
weird i have faith in all of the parts


---------89:02----------
of you that have overcome that part of


---------89:04----------
weakness i don't think you need to be


---------89:06----------
perfect


---------89:07----------
you can be flawed you don't have to be a


---------89:09----------
hundred percent and we can still


---------89:11----------
bet on you


---------89:13----------
right i would bet on you any day of the


---------89:14----------
week i don't need you to get an a


---------89:17----------
i don't need to have an external


---------89:19----------
assurance that like you're gonna do


---------89:21----------
great


---------89:22----------
i can put faith in the part of you that


---------89:24----------
works hard i can put faith in the part


---------89:26----------
of you that like you know tries to make


---------89:27----------
people happy i can put faith in those


---------89:29----------
parts and i don't need assurances but i


---------89:32----------
suspect that's going to be quite foreign


---------89:34----------
to you


---------89:37----------
yeah no yeah i don't think i'd be able


---------89:39----------
to i'm very i'm very difficult to


---------89:41----------
convince without evidence


---------89:43----------
and it's simple


---------89:46----------
but that hold on a second i'm not trying


---------89:48----------
to give you evidence what word am i


---------89:49----------
using no you're not no what do i have


---------89:51----------
for you


---------89:52----------
faith yeah so what is faith


---------89:56----------
uh i suppose


---------89:59----------
for one of a better term blind belief


---------90:02----------
absolutely right it's about the absence


---------90:04----------
of evidence


---------90:06----------
so that's my point that's what's going


---------90:08----------
to be hard for you this is just one


---------90:09----------
conversation so you've got time you


---------90:11----------
don't have to figure it out tomorrow


---------90:13----------
but i think essentially what you need is


---------90:14----------
like you're trying so hard to fix


---------90:16----------
everything to reassure yourself because


---------90:18----------
once you have that thing in the bank


---------90:19----------
account you don't need faith anymore


---------90:21----------
because you've got certainty does that


---------90:23----------
make sense


---------90:25----------
what you need to learn is how to have


---------90:27----------
faith in yourself that it's okay that


---------90:29----------
you don't need to be perfect you don't


---------90:30----------
have to be number one on twitch you


---------90:32----------
don't need 100 million dollars in the


---------90:33----------
bank account that you will actually be


---------90:35----------
okay like just because of who you are


---------90:40----------
but i recognize that's foreign so


---------90:42----------
no but but it's a very


---------90:45----------
it was very comforting to hear that you


---------90:47----------
know that was a very comforting sort of


---------90:49----------
like monologue which i was like yeah you


---------90:50----------
know if i could really subscribe to that


---------90:53----------
then and that's not to say i ignored it


---------90:55----------
either that it did sync but not and it


---------90:57----------
obviously doesn't change overnight does


---------90:59----------
it but no no so so i i like that that's


---------91:01----------
actually progress you know why that's


---------91:03----------
wholesale progress


---------91:05----------
because you said if i could subscribe to


---------91:07----------
that instead of i should subscribe to


---------91:10----------
that butt


---------91:11----------
it's very subtle


---------91:12----------
but that's exactly where you need to be


---------91:15----------
if i could you need to play around with


---------91:17----------
these things jack explore them like


---------91:19----------
navigate them you stop telling yourself


---------91:22----------
what you should do and start exploring i


---------91:24----------
know it sounds kind of small but for me


---------91:26----------
that's like that's a big win


---------91:28----------
that does sound quite big yeah


---------91:30----------
right it's different from the way that


---------91:32----------
you've been talking things yeah like


---------91:34----------
you just need to figure things out it's


---------91:36----------
because so far this entire conversation


---------91:38----------
it's been i know the right answer but


---------91:41----------
or this is how i feel but it's always


---------91:43----------
been torn between black and white right


---------91:45----------
this is the first time that i've heard


---------91:47----------
you say something that like oh like i


---------91:48----------
wonder if i can do this it's curiosity


---------91:51----------
it's exploration as opposed to choice


---------91:55----------
and very practically i think just give


---------91:57----------
yourself a chance to you know if you're


---------91:58----------
feeling paralyzed you know start to like


---------92:00----------
look in yourself and try to ask yourself


---------92:02----------
like okay like is this me like feeling


---------92:04----------
weak is this me afraid of being weak is


---------92:06----------
this me afraid like do i have that fear


---------92:08----------
just notice the fear within yourself


---------92:10----------
and ask yourself what is this fear


---------92:12----------
driving me to do


---------92:13----------
and can i set aside the fear for a


---------92:16----------
little time a while can i be reassuring


---------92:19----------
right can i be like almost an older


---------92:21----------
brother to like 17 year old me who is


---------92:23----------
afraid that i may actually like quit


---------92:25----------
school and be like hey man like even if


---------92:27----------
you have to quit that's okay


---------92:30----------
i have faith that you'll land on your


---------92:32----------
feet


---------92:36----------
questions


---------92:38----------
thoughts


---------92:40----------
no i


---------92:41----------
i think it's a good i think yeah


---------92:43----------
it's a very


---------92:44----------
i think one you understood it well which


---------92:46----------
is always very nice because i think it


---------92:48----------
to me i think seeing it mapped out like


---------92:50----------
that's great because it's also just a


---------92:51----------
very confusing


---------92:53----------
conflicts inherently confusing and and


---------92:55----------
so to see it mapped out in a way that


---------92:57----------
like makes sense is great uh and then uh


---------93:00----------
i think yeah no i think it's a good idea


---------93:02----------
just kind of


---------93:03----------
having a bit more blind faith in in


---------93:06----------
things generally i think i think we've


---------93:08----------
really focused this inwards but but me


---------93:10----------
as a person i i probably benefit from


---------93:12----------
just


---------93:13----------
believing


---------93:14----------
things more i'm horribly skeptical um


---------93:18----------
and


---------93:20----------
don't believe things more explore


---------93:22----------
yeah okay sorry yes yes


---------93:25----------
all right so


---------93:27----------
yeah don't change who you are jack


---------93:29----------
you're great bro okay


---------93:31----------
okay but


---------93:32----------
you know i think faith sometimes has to


---------93:34----------
be like found right like i because you


---------93:38----------
got to be careful because there may be a


---------93:39----------
part of your mind that hijacks that and


---------93:41----------
says oh like jack you should believe


---------93:43----------
more you should have more faith


---------93:46----------
right right right yeah which is which is


---------93:48----------
okay that is what you see what i mean


---------93:50----------
like it'll it'll be it'll be sneaky


---------93:52----------
and then you'll start beating yourself


---------93:53----------
up for not having enough balloons


---------93:56----------
right like logically like people who


---------93:58----------
have more faith tend to do better in


---------94:00----------
life so i should have more faith


---------94:01----------
so


---------94:03----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------94:04----------
yeah that's a good that's a good way


---------94:06----------
yeah right so so anyway i i kind of


---------94:08----------
torpedoed what you were saying i'm sorry


---------94:10----------
i don't know but i'm glad you did


---------94:11----------
because i would have left this having


---------94:13----------
like seen it like that so yeah


---------94:15----------
so but do you see like in the big


---------94:16----------
takeaway i want you to have jack is


---------94:18----------
notice that there's this thing in your


---------94:19----------
mind which is going to be like


---------94:21----------
it's like malware almost that'll like


---------94:24----------
it'll pop up no matter like what like


---------94:26----------
even with this discussion of faith and


---------94:28----------
belief it'll insert itself into that


---------94:31----------
yes so as best as you can what you


---------94:33----------
really need to do more than anything


---------94:35----------
else is just notice that it's activity


---------94:37----------
don't try to stop it don't try to


---------94:39----------
control it just see like okay the next


---------94:41----------
time i'm torn and the next time i'm busy


---------94:43----------
ask yourself where is this coming from


---------94:45----------
when you're mentally busy oh god i can't


---------94:47----------
afford to move


---------94:48----------
it's gonna come from this place look


---------94:50----------
look at okay what where why do i feel


---------94:53----------
like i'm too busy why do i feel like i


---------94:54----------
have no much no time where is this


---------94:56----------
coming from and then there's gonna be a


---------94:58----------
bunch of logic that's gonna be like


---------95:00----------
layers one two and three and then


---------95:02----------
subsurface there's gonna be something


---------95:04----------
else


---------95:05----------
there's gonna be either a fear that like


---------95:07----------
oh my god what if this falls apart


---------95:09----------
some kind of uncertainty some kind of


---------95:11----------
lack of faith and like even though you


---------95:13----------
don't have to change it just be like oh


---------95:14----------
wow there's a part of me that's really


---------95:16----------
afraid acknowledge it


---------95:18----------
bring it to the surface instead of


---------95:20----------
fighting with the logic


---------95:23----------
and i think the more you're able to do


---------95:24----------
that the better you'll


---------95:27----------
all right be


---------95:28----------
you


---------95:29----------
thoughts questions i feel like we're at


---------95:31----------
a good stopping point how do you feel no


---------95:33----------
yeah that that feels quite conclusive


---------95:36----------
okay that feels like good advice yeah


---------95:38----------
that's great thank you i appreciate it


---------95:39----------
do you like meditating do you want to


---------95:41----------
learn how to meditate that'd be great uh


---------95:43----------
yeah i i i find it very interesting okay


---------95:46----------
have you ever meditated before


---------95:50----------
it's little bits nothing crazy just this


---------95:52----------
little dabbling i think um


---------95:55----------
i i think it's something i was like yeah


---------95:56----------
i could benefit from that so i played


---------95:57----------
around with it a little bit yeah okay so


---------96:00----------
i'm gonna


---------96:01----------
let me just think for a second


---------96:09----------
okay i'm gonna give you a choice


---------96:14----------
do you want to so there's a part i'm


---------96:17----------
gonna hypothesize for a moment there's a


---------96:19----------
part of your psyche


---------96:21----------
that is afraid that you're weak okay


---------96:24----------
sure just i'm just gonna assume that


---------96:26----------
okay it may not be true


---------96:28----------
if i were to give you a choice if you


---------96:30----------
wanted to understand that part


---------96:33----------
or digest that part and make it go away


---------96:36----------
like basically fix it or understand it


---------96:38----------
which one would you pick


---------96:42----------
oh


---------96:43----------
oh that's difficult because like in my


---------96:46----------
head if i understood it maybe i could


---------96:47----------
defeat it but then then that would


---------96:49----------
that's what i thought i'm like oh


---------96:50----------
understanding it'd be great but then


---------96:51----------
it's so i could fix it so ultimately


---------96:53----------
would i prefer to fix it or


---------96:55----------
understand it that's all neither one is


---------96:58----------
better from my perspective no it's no no


---------97:02----------
what instinctively appeals to you


---------97:06----------
uh no i think i'd like to understand it


---------97:08----------
okay so we're gonna do a technique that


---------97:10----------
we do from time to time it's gonna be


---------97:11----------
called


---------97:12----------
i call it charging the laser beam okay


---------97:15----------
okay it's gonna be kind of weird so what


---------97:17----------
i'm gonna ask you to do is sit up


---------97:19----------
straight


---------97:20----------
and then


---------97:21----------
i'm going to kind of demonstrate we're


---------97:22----------
going to take our i i don't want i never


---------97:24----------
realized how unstraight i was sat my god


---------97:29----------
if you're or how tall are you


---------97:31----------
uh like five nine okay are you is your


---------97:34----------
back straight when you sit in that chair


---------97:37----------
yeah


---------97:39----------
like straight straight


---------97:40----------
uh oh hold on maybe it's not actually


---------97:43----------
now you've acknowledged it hold on


---------97:45----------
okay i'm now not leading against the


---------97:47----------
chair i'm just sat straight that's okay


---------97:49----------
and are you comfortable like this


---------97:51----------
yeah okay


---------97:52----------
so this technique is going to have two


---------97:55----------
parts do you want theory or you want to


---------97:56----------
just jump into the practice well yeah no


---------97:58----------
i love theory that'd be great okay so


---------98:01----------
kind of taking a step back there are


---------98:02----------
these seven things called chakras or


---------98:05----------
chakras


---------98:07----------
and each one is supposed to govern a


---------98:09----------
particular kind of um


---------98:11----------
like


---------98:12----------
part of our being so for example there's


---------98:15----------
a chakra that governs desire there's a


---------98:17----------
chakra that governs digestion


---------98:19----------
so there's some


---------98:21----------
there actually there's very little


---------98:22----------
evidence to support any of this chakra


---------98:24----------
theory


---------98:26----------
uh there


---------98:27----------
there is some evidence that their heart


---------98:29----------
chakra meditations are specifically


---------98:32----------
useful for treating depression and


---------98:34----------
compassion but the studies are very very


---------98:36----------
small we haven't really looked at the


---------98:37----------
other chakras


---------98:39----------
so people think i'm a good psychiatrist


---------98:41----------
which in a sense i am but i think a lot


---------98:44----------
of the reason that i'm able to do what i


---------98:46----------
do is because i do a particular set of


---------98:48----------
third eye practices which govern my


---------98:51----------
ability to understand and like


---------98:54----------
give me intuition it's sort of like


---------98:55----------
leveling up my intuition skill yeah as a


---------98:58----------
scientist i bel i wonder if what the


---------99:00----------
yogis kind of figured out is that there


---------99:02----------
are different parts of the brain that


---------99:04----------
somehow get like activated or


---------99:06----------
strengthened by doing particular


---------99:07----------
meditation practices


---------99:09----------
and maybe it's not like some sort of


---------99:10----------
mystical like third eye sight but just


---------99:14----------
like doing these kinds of practices


---------99:16----------
somehow enhance our ability to like pay


---------99:18----------
attention or something like that like i


---------99:20----------
don't yeah that makes sense yeah yeah


---------99:21----------
that makes sense to me so i'm gonna


---------99:23----------
teach you a third eye practice that is


---------99:26----------
theoretically designed to


---------99:30----------
give you a sense of intuition or


---------99:31----------
understanding


---------99:33----------
right okay


---------99:35----------
what i can be pretty sure about is that


---------99:37----------
numerous studies of meditation suggest


---------99:39----------
that what you do is not actually that


---------99:41----------
important but there's a set of


---------99:43----------
scientific highly provable benefits


---------99:46----------
which you will get from this practice


---------99:48----------
this includes improvements in focus


---------99:51----------
attention memory reductions in stress


---------99:54----------
and cortisol so like those kinds of


---------99:56----------
things you're gonna get no matter what i


---------99:57----------
teach you okay so right at the least


---------100:00----------
you'll get that stuff hopefully it'll


---------100:01----------
help you with things like decision


---------100:02----------
making and on the top end if we're


---------100:04----------
really lucky and all that weird mystical


---------100:06----------
stuff turns out to be true


---------100:08----------
then or even some of it turns to be true


---------100:10----------
then maybe you'll get some kind of weird


---------100:11----------
like insight into yourself


---------100:14----------
yes it'd be excellent okay


---------100:16----------
so this this practice is gonna have two


---------100:19----------
phases one i'm gonna take my middle


---------100:21----------
finger and i'm going to hover it above


---------100:24----------
the space between my eyebrows so i don't


---------100:26----------
want to touch okay and i'm going to do


---------100:28----------
this with my eyes closed yeah i'll i'll


---------100:30----------
walk you through it so i'm just going to


---------100:32----------
demonstrate okay and then what i'm going


---------100:33----------
to really pay attention to is the


---------100:36----------
sensation in my forehead


---------100:39----------
over where my middle finger is hovering


---------100:42----------
okay so it's going to sound kind of


---------100:43----------
weird but you'll feel maybe feel


---------100:45----------
something so you just want to focus on


---------100:47----------
your forehead where the finger is


---------100:48----------
pointing that's going to be phase one of


---------100:50----------
the practice we're going to do that with


---------100:51----------
our eyes closed


---------100:53----------
okay if you happen to get some kind of


---------100:56----------
sensation there then we've got two


---------100:58----------
additional steps to the practice


---------101:01----------
one is to then relax the hand and just


---------101:03----------
focus on the sensation on your forehead


---------101:06----------
the second is when you breathe in


---------101:09----------
imagine


---------101:10----------
you're going to feel the breath


---------101:12----------
in your nostrils but imagine that that


---------101:14----------
breath is going up


---------101:15----------
and into that point and as you breathe


---------101:18----------
out imagine that it's coming out of that


---------101:19----------
point too so we're gonna go


---------101:22----------
okay kind of thing okay


---------101:24----------
so i'm gonna sort of walk you through it


---------101:25----------
i may ask you one or two questions


---------101:28----------
um just to kind of see where you are


---------101:30----------
there isn't a right way or a wrong way


---------101:31----------
to do the practice people have different


---------101:33----------
experiences okay


---------101:34----------
so sit up straight


---------101:37----------
close your eyes


---------101:39----------
and start by just noticing your


---------101:41----------
breathing


---------101:48----------
so go ahead and breathe let's say take


---------101:50----------
so you're on breath number two


---------101:54----------
good


---------101:56----------
give me one more


---------102:00----------
beautiful


---------102:02----------
nice slow exhalation


---------102:06----------
and now go ahead and take you can


---------102:08----------
continue breathing take the right uh


---------102:11----------
your right hand middle finger go ahead


---------102:14----------
and place it


---------102:16----------
kind of


---------102:17----------
yeah like don't touch your forehead


---------102:21----------
but try to bring it really really close


---------102:24----------
and what i want you to do is like


---------102:27----------
notice the sensation of your finger


---------102:32----------
do you feel anything on your forehead


---------102:35----------
just like


---------102:37----------
like pressure i guess is it almost if


---------102:40----------
that makes any sense is it like almost


---------102:42----------
as if it's being touched but not quite


---------102:43----------
it's like it's conscious of the fact


---------102:44----------
that there's something there yep so i


---------102:46----------
want you to just focus on that you can


---------102:47----------
try to bring your finger a little bit


---------102:48----------
closer


---------102:50----------
oh yeah i moved it quite a lot


---------102:52----------
yep there you go so now focus on that


---------102:54----------
you feel that pressure


---------102:57----------
okay


---------102:59----------
now you can go ahead and relax for a


---------103:00----------
little bit


---------103:02----------
you can let your hand come down and just


---------103:04----------
focus on the sensation do you still feel


---------103:06----------
the pressure


---------103:08----------
okay so we're gonna focus on that for


---------103:10----------
about 15 seconds


---------103:26----------
and now i want you to bring your finger


---------103:28----------
back we're going to do this a second and


---------103:30----------
a third time


---------103:32----------
where you kind of bring it over and sort


---------103:33----------
of feel that pressure let the finger


---------103:35----------
kind of


---------103:37----------
strengthen the pressure if you will


---------104:04----------
and now let your hand come down


---------104:07----------
focus on the sensation in your forehead


---------104:24----------
we're gonna go for another 15 seconds or


---------104:26----------
so


---------104:37----------
and now for the third round we're going


---------104:38----------
to hold it there for about a minute now


---------104:40----------
so really try to point your finger


---------104:43----------
towards your forehead


---------105:12----------
for lack of a better term feel the


---------105:13----------
energy


---------105:18----------
in that spot


---------105:28----------
now bring your hand down


---------105:32----------
so now i want you to breathe into it


---------105:36----------
so feel that point on your forehead and


---------105:38----------
as you breathe in you'll feel the


---------105:39----------
inhalation the cool air enter your


---------105:41----------
nostrils


---------105:43----------
go up into your forehead


---------105:45----------
then as you exhale


---------105:48----------
feel the warmth come out


---------105:53----------
and go ahead and do about five breaths


---------106:19----------
and now what i'm going to do is just


---------106:21----------
give you a choice


---------106:23----------
so if you


---------106:24----------
felt the sensation and kind of enjoyed


---------106:26----------
that


---------106:28----------
you can drive your attention into the


---------106:30----------
spot on your forehead it's almost like


---------106:33----------
imagine that your mind


---------106:35----------
is behind your forehead


---------106:37----------
and that you can focus and concentrate


---------106:39----------
your mind into that spot


---------106:44----------
and if you prefer the breath you can


---------106:46----------
breathe into it


---------106:47----------
whichever one just feels better for you


---------106:50----------
we'll practice for a period of about


---------106:52----------
three minutes


---------106:54----------
if you get bored of one you can do the


---------106:56----------
other


---------107:21----------
you


---------107:49----------
you


---------108:33----------
and now go ahead and take a deep breath


---------108:35----------
in and out


---------108:39----------
let yourself start to return to


---------108:42----------
the world


---------108:44----------
you're sitting in your chair


---------108:49----------
in your new place


---------108:53----------
you're jack


---------108:55----------
you're 19 years old


---------108:57----------
notice the facets of your reality start


---------108:59----------
to come back who you are where you are


---------109:02----------
you may be hungry you may be thirsty you


---------109:05----------
may have errands to run


---------109:08----------
and notice that for a time you stepped


---------109:10----------
outside of your life and just


---------109:12----------
existed you are neither success nor


---------109:15----------
failure


---------109:17----------
you are neither an a student or an f


---------109:19----------
student


---------109:21----------
you may have even lost track of your


---------109:23----------
name your gender


---------109:25----------
your job


---------109:27----------
that these are all parts of life


---------109:30----------
but there's almost a time out space that


---------109:32----------
you stepped into


---------109:36----------
and now put your palms together in front


---------109:38----------
of you


---------109:39----------
kind of like in namaste position if you


---------109:41----------
know what that is so touch your palms


---------109:43----------
together


---------109:46----------
and then rub them together rub rub rub


---------109:47----------
rub rub so you feel heat tension energy


---------109:50----------
and then cuff them over your eyes cup


---------109:52----------
your palms over your eyes


---------109:55----------
take a deep breath in and slowly exhale


---------109:57----------
and open your eyes while covered by your


---------110:00----------
hands


---------110:01----------
and then when you're ready put your


---------110:02----------
hands down


---------110:08----------
hi


---------110:09----------
hi


---------110:10----------
how do you feel


---------110:12----------
good


---------110:14----------
that was good that was yeah no it's very


---------110:17----------
like


---------110:19----------
yeah


---------110:21----------
i don't know what that means but i think


---------110:23----------
that that's dude no yeah no it was good


---------110:24----------
it was good yeah yeah yeah


---------110:26----------
i think the whole point of it feels like


---------110:28----------
i shouldn't really come out with many


---------110:29----------
thoughts about it i feel like it was


---------110:30----------
just like yeah that's yeah right no


---------110:32----------
that's what i think you did really well


---------110:34----------
like you're like it was the whole thing


---------110:35----------
was like


---------110:36----------
that's the whole yeah that means you're


---------110:37----------
doing it right so i think that's the


---------110:39----------
tricky thing about meditation is the


---------110:40----------
more you describe it the more


---------110:43----------
it actually confuses people


---------110:45----------
because if you say oh it was like so


---------110:47----------
peaceful like oh my god i saw so someone


---------110:49----------
in our chat said that this felt like


---------110:51----------
charging a laser beam i think that made


---------110:53----------
a lot of sense to me


---------110:55----------
but


---------110:56----------
sure okay yeah no i get that yeah yeah


---------110:58----------
no no no you said it yeah i feel that


---------111:00----------
yeah right it's it's but it's like if i


---------111:02----------
told you like hey this is a charging the


---------111:04----------
laser beam practice people are like what


---------111:06----------
yeah no that's no now i've done it i go


---------111:08----------
you mean beforehand yeah so overall um


---------111:12----------
you know if if it worked for you it


---------111:14----------
worked for you


---------111:16----------
um and i would say that you can do this


---------111:17----------
practice for like 15 minutes a day


---------111:20----------
uh ideally three days a week


---------111:23----------
i mean yeah three days a week if you


---------111:25----------
bump it up to about five days a week


---------111:27----------
you'll get a little bit more benefit


---------111:30----------
but i think you can do like you know


---------111:32----------
whatever variation felt right you can


---------111:33----------
start off


---------111:35----------
with some deep breathing


---------111:37----------
you can use the finger to charge the


---------111:39----------
laser beam but if you feel that


---------111:41----------
sensation that's really what you're


---------111:42----------
focusing on and so the thing that can be


---------111:44----------
used to trigger the sensation or make


---------111:46----------
you aware of the sensation but once


---------111:49----------
you've felt enough or your ugna chakra


---------111:51----------
starts to activate and energy starts to


---------111:54----------
flow through it you may no longer need


---------111:55----------
the finger


---------111:57----------
right um and then you're that sorry your


---------111:59----------
third eye chakra and then


---------112:01----------
in terms of you you can decide like if


---------112:03----------
you want to just focus on it and you you


---------112:05----------
can hold your attention on it long


---------112:06----------
enough that's totally fine if your mind


---------112:08----------
starts to wander you can go to the


---------112:10----------
breath and kind of imagine like a v


---------112:12----------
going up into your forehead and exhaling


---------112:14----------
you can do a combination of both you can


---------112:16----------
do like you know basic breathing for


---------112:18----------
five minutes centering yourself finger


---------112:20----------
five minutes of uh breath and then five


---------112:23----------
minutes of just concentrating on that


---------112:25----------
spot and driving your energy into it


---------112:28----------
and then kind of wrap up


---------112:31----------
cool


---------112:31----------
cool


---------112:33----------
oh by the way i you know i didn't ask


---------112:34----------
