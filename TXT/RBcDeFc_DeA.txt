---------00:53----------
going to talk with the two of you


---------00:54----------
together


---------00:55----------
does that sound good yep any questions


---------01:01----------
okay cool let's get started so zack


---------01:04----------
let's get started with you man so i'll


---------01:05----------
ask your parents to step out of the room


---------01:10----------
get


---------01:13----------
yeah so zach didn't we talk about um


---------01:16----------
your family dynamics when you came on


---------01:18----------
stream like back in march


---------01:20----------
a little bit not a whole lot but okay


---------01:22----------
briefly


---------01:23----------
okay yeah so tell me what's um oh


---------01:26----------
yeah there we go so tell me uh your


---------01:31----------
phd student uh dropped out


---------01:35----------
dropped out that's right so that's what


---------01:36----------
we talked about right


---------01:38----------
yeah i remember how are you doing man uh


---------01:42----------
doing okay i took your advice and went


---------01:44----------
and got a therapist and have been


---------01:46----------
talking with her for a couple months


---------01:47----------
uh i joined the group coaching


---------01:51----------
um awesome still some like


---------01:54----------
stuff mentally that i have to work out


---------01:56----------
with myself but i'm kind of making a


---------01:58----------
little bit of progress


---------01:59----------
okay great so you say you're making a


---------02:01----------
little bit of progress


---------02:03----------
yeah so i'm starting to find that


---------02:04----------
there's a lot of


---------02:06----------
things right yeah it gets more


---------02:08----------
complicated than i thought it was


---------02:10----------
so zach the first thing i'm going to say


---------02:12----------
is that i i think


---------02:13----------
this is very common where people


---------02:16----------
i think you pro my guess or my hope is


---------02:18----------
that you've made a lot of progress but


---------02:20----------
it's hard to see that right now


---------02:22----------
if you are if you have been working with


---------02:24----------
a therapist and if you're beginning to


---------02:26----------
see


---------02:26----------
what the road ahead is then chances are


---------02:29----------
you've actually gained a lot of insight


---------02:32----------
um but you'll i mean hopefully that'll


---------02:34----------
become clear in a year or two


---------02:36----------
when you see how far you've come you


---------02:37----------
know it's sometimes hard to see like


---------02:39----------
your progress like day to day but you


---------02:42----------
look back at yourself like two or three


---------02:44----------
years ago and you'll be like wow i was


---------02:45----------
in a really bad spot and i'm like


---------02:47----------
actually okay now


---------02:48----------
that's my hope for you okay cool so tell


---------02:51----------
me a little bit about what's


---------02:52----------
um what's going on with uh your dad


---------02:56----------
or you and i'm gonna just grab my


---------02:57----------
notebook hold on


---------02:59----------
okay um so


---------03:02----------
this is it's kind of hard to like


---------03:05----------
specifically say it's with my dad right


---------03:07----------
because this is


---------03:07----------
sort of my whole family we have a


---------03:10----------
complicated stuff going on


---------03:11----------
okay so tell us about that so i'll start


---------03:14----------
with


---------03:15----------
about a week ago on like thursday or


---------03:17----------
friday my mom came into my room


---------03:19----------
like hey we need to talk about some


---------03:21----------
stuff and she just sort of like spilled


---------03:24----------
out to me


---------03:25----------
um her thoughts of how our family was


---------03:27----------
doing and i agreed


---------03:30----------
um which is that


---------03:35----------
oh man it's so complicated okay


---------03:38----------
what did you say to you


---------03:41----------
this is like a couple hour long


---------03:43----------
conversation but she was telling me that


---------03:47----------
she started with with it's difficult


---------03:50----------
with my brother


---------03:51----------
so my brother my younger brother has


---------03:53----------
autism he's like four years younger than


---------03:54----------
me


---------03:56----------
and because of kovid and other things


---------03:59----------
that has caused complications for him


---------04:01----------
and has caused him to get a little bit


---------04:02----------
more crazy than he usually is


---------04:04----------
okay and it's been getting worse and


---------04:06----------
worse and worse to the point that


---------04:09----------
uh his therapist has told my mom this


---------04:12----------
needs to be fixed soon because he's


---------04:13----------
bordering on manic


---------04:16----------
which is like pretty serious


---------04:19----------
that's very terrifying um


---------04:23----------
so there's how does it how does it feel


---------04:26----------
when


---------04:27----------
when a therapist tells you this needs to


---------04:29----------
be fixed


---------04:30----------
soon oh that's that's really bad right


---------04:34----------
like that feels it's scary it's


---------04:37----------
um anxiety inducing like


---------04:41----------
i've always known that he's got his


---------04:43----------
issues


---------04:44----------
and that we want to fix them but it's


---------04:46----------
really terrifying to hear that like


---------04:48----------
he could be put in a mental hospital if


---------04:49----------
we don't get this dealt with


---------04:52----------
okay that's just scary yeah and who's


---------04:55----------
who takes


---------04:55----------
like who who is responsible for dealing


---------04:58----------
with it


---------05:02----------
kind of my mom i mean my parents


---------05:04----------
together but i feel like a lot of the


---------05:06----------
pressure's on my mom


---------05:07----------
okay that's kind of interesting because


---------05:10----------
you know i


---------05:11----------
and i'm not blaming anyone but i kind of


---------05:13----------
think about you know


---------05:14----------
if someone is bordering on manic and


---------05:16----------
you're their provider


---------05:19----------
if you're the therapist like i don't


---------05:20----------
know exactly what the situation is and i


---------05:22----------
know a lot especially with autism has to


---------05:24----------
do with the home environment but like


---------05:25----------
generally speaking i i would think that


---------05:27----------
that's you know if i had a patient who


---------05:29----------
was bordering on manic


---------05:31----------
like i think i'm kind of responsible for


---------05:33----------
that no


---------05:35----------
is the doctor yeah it's


---------05:39----------
my personal take on this is kind of all


---------05:41----------
over the place i


---------05:42----------
think that he doesn't have the best


---------05:44----------
therapists um


---------05:46----------
okay but then so this is where i sort of


---------05:49----------
link a little bit back to


---------05:51----------
my dad's is i think


---------05:54----------
he's part of the problem okay i don't


---------05:56----------
think the only part


---------05:58----------
i think there's a lot of elements again


---------05:59----------
kobe but i think that he's part of it


---------06:01----------
because


---------06:03----------
he's a very type a personality he's


---------06:06----------
about rules


---------06:07----------
he's about um strictness and schedules


---------06:10----------
and hitting things to the letter and


---------06:13----------
autism does not fit well


---------06:15----------
into that structure and so


---------06:18----------
if you know we plan something and


---------06:21----------
we don't warn my brother adequately


---------06:23----------
enough he'll freak out about it


---------06:25----------
that's just what he does and then my dad


---------06:27----------
will get mad at him


---------06:28----------
and try to force rules on him and try to


---------06:30----------
force the structure onto him and say we


---------06:32----------
have to do this you can't follow your


---------06:34----------
patterns you have to go do this


---------06:37----------
and like


---------06:41----------
i can see kind of where he's coming from


---------06:43----------
that it's very hard to work with a child


---------06:44----------
like this


---------06:45----------
who will like half the time not care


---------06:48----------
what you say and not do what you say and


---------06:49----------
they like to fight a lot


---------06:50----------
um but as the parent it's on you


---------06:54----------
to work around that you have child


---------06:56----------
you're supposed to raise them


---------06:59----------
if they're gonna be troublesome then you


---------07:01----------
have to be accepting of that


---------07:03----------
not fight with them and yell at them and


---------07:04----------
make it worse


---------07:06----------
okay


---------07:09----------
okay so zach can i just share some


---------07:13----------
like thoughts i know i should ask you


---------07:14----------
more questions


---------07:16----------
um but the first thing is that like all


---------07:19----------
that


---------07:19----------
like i agree with you 100 but bluntly


---------07:22----------
all that [ __ ] goes out the window when


---------07:24----------
you have a kid with autism


---------07:25----------
because it's just so hard yeah and


---------07:29----------
and it's just like


---------07:32----------
yeah so so i i don't disagree with what


---------07:36----------
you say


---------07:37----------
and at the same time having worked with


---------07:39----------
parents who have


---------07:40----------
autistic kids it's tough


---------07:45----------
like they it tests yeah it i mean it's


---------07:49----------
it's just hard


---------07:50----------
i lived with him for 18 years so yeah


---------07:53----------
so you know what's it like to live with


---------07:55----------
him


---------07:57----------
uh it's been different at different


---------08:00----------
points


---------08:02----------
uh so when i was younger so like before


---------08:05----------
i left for college and everything


---------08:06----------
um it was it was really hard because


---------08:11----------
he was going through puberty and so


---------08:12----------
hormones start to mess with him


---------08:14----------
and he just gets like kind of all over


---------08:16----------
the place and like


---------08:17----------
unpredictable as heck um


---------08:22----------
i mostly just like tried to not interact


---------08:24----------
with them because it was really hard to


---------08:26----------
know when it would be a positive or when


---------08:27----------
it would be a negative interaction and


---------08:28----------
usually it was a negative interaction


---------08:31----------
um what does that mean


---------08:36----------
it would it would usually lead to


---------08:39----------
fighting


---------08:40----------
of some kind like it was really hard to


---------08:44----------
be able to relate to him in any way to


---------08:45----------
have a conversation and


---------08:47----------
again he has autism so like he doesn't


---------08:49----------
think normally and so like having a


---------08:50----------
conversation


---------08:51----------
he's just like following formulas he's


---------08:53----------
not like trying to communicate with you


---------08:56----------
um and so like it wasn't really there


---------08:59----------
wasn't really much of a point to it


---------09:01----------
and it would mostly just always devolve


---------09:03----------
to him saying something


---------09:05----------
i don't i don't even know why this has


---------09:06----------
been so many years i've lost jack what


---------09:08----------
it was like but


---------09:09----------
it would just like result in fighting of


---------09:11----------
some kind so you like rolled your eyes


---------09:13----------
there


---------09:14----------
do you know what do you know what the


---------09:15----------
emotion there is


---------09:17----------
no how'd you feel as you were


---------09:22----------
as you were thinking about what it was


---------09:24----------
like to try to communicate with your


---------09:26----------
brother


---------09:28----------
um


---------09:31----------
i don't know it was just really hard and


---------09:33----------
like can i toss out a couple of words


---------09:36----------
yeah exhausted yeah


---------09:40----------
defeated yes it's


---------09:43----------
defeated yes that's if you guys were


---------09:46----------
watching


---------09:47----------
that facial expression that's acted that


---------09:49----------
is the facial expression of defeat


---------09:51----------
it's it's and and we can kind of see


---------09:53----------
that i'm sorry back if i'm kind of


---------09:55----------
diving right in but like you know i can


---------09:57----------
i can see kind of where you're coming


---------09:58----------
from because what we're hearing from you


---------10:00----------
is that like you tried to interact with


---------10:01----------
your brother


---------10:03----------
but part of the problem with autism is


---------10:04----------
that he like literally doesn't


---------10:06----------
know how to communicate yeah


---------10:09----------
and so like you can try but like


---------10:13----------
it's just gonna kind of bounce off and


---------10:15----------
in a sense it can feel like no matter


---------10:18----------
how hard you try you end up fighting


---------10:20----------
anyway


---------10:22----------
and then you're kind of defeated yeah


---------10:26----------
so sorry for kind of going down all


---------10:28----------
these different roads but


---------10:30----------
it sounds tough dude like it sounds


---------10:31----------
actually really really hard


---------10:33----------
yeah so it was it was really hard uh at


---------10:36----------
that age i mean there was some like made


---------10:39----------
like big specific most like remember


---------10:40----------
there was one point where i don't


---------10:42----------
remember what


---------10:42----------
happened but somehow he got really angry


---------10:45----------
at me and he grabbed


---------10:46----------
one of the kitchen knives and started


---------10:47----------
chasing me around the house i was like


---------10:49----------
12 years old being chased by an


---------10:51----------
eight-year-old with the knife i was


---------10:52----------
freaking out


---------10:54----------
uh there was one time we got an argument


---------10:56----------
and he shoved me and i fell through a


---------10:58----------
glass table


---------10:59----------
and got caught up on my arms and


---------11:00----------
everything i mean


---------11:02----------
this is like there was there was crazy


---------11:05----------
things that happened


---------11:06----------
but i went to college i got away from


---------11:10----------
the family for


---------11:10----------
however many years four five six years


---------11:13----------
um


---------11:15----------
and then when i came back and i was


---------11:18----------
watching your streams and stuff i


---------11:19----------
decided to like try and interact with


---------11:21----------
him as if he's a human


---------11:22----------
rather than as if he's this disabled


---------11:24----------
person


---------11:25----------
and it went from before i was the person


---------11:28----------
that absolutely couldn't interact with


---------11:30----------
him


---------11:30----------
and he like pretty much hated me and i


---------11:33----------
pretty much hated him to where now


---------11:35----------
i'm the only person in the family who


---------11:36----------
can like pretty much talk to him


---------11:38----------
normally and he will kind of do what i


---------11:39----------
say he doesn't


---------11:40----------
care at all what my parents say anymore


---------11:42----------
so it's almost like the rules have been


---------11:44----------
reversed


---------11:50----------
hold on


---------11:53----------
so much confusion there okay so yeah


---------11:57----------
first thing


---------12:01----------
is how the [ __ ] is that a little bit of


---------12:03----------
progress


---------12:04----------
on your part


---------12:10----------
number one okay so we don't have to go


---------12:13----------
down that road but like can we just


---------12:15----------
appreciate for a moment that


---------12:17----------
also like what the [ __ ] does that have


---------12:18----------
to do with watching our streams


---------12:20----------
because i don't anyway that's another


---------12:23----------
question which we can answer on a


---------12:24----------
different day i don't know if that's


---------12:25----------
relevant


---------12:26----------
um i mean i'm happy in the mindset and


---------12:29----------
it was


---------12:30----------
and and the third thing and this is i


---------12:32----------
think what is important


---------12:33----------
is like how do you feel about that


---------12:37----------
there's some mixed emotions to that part


---------12:39----------
of it is


---------12:40----------
happiness that like i was able to


---------12:44----------
connect with him um


---------12:48----------
and and it's like it's like i was being


---------12:51----------
an [ __ ] to him before


---------12:52----------
now i'm not right like he really


---------12:54----------
struggles to communicate and i'm able to


---------12:56----------
like at least to


---------12:57----------
a small degree help him with that


---------13:02----------
so this is important zach why do you


---------13:04----------
think i'm not judging you for it because


---------13:06----------
this is important


---------13:08----------
why do you think you were an [ __ ] to


---------13:09----------
him before


---------13:13----------
where does assholery come from i was


---------13:15----------
just i was really


---------13:16----------
impatient with a lot i was like trying


---------13:19----------
to do as high school kids do and


---------13:21----------
deal with high school dumb stupid things


---------13:23----------
and i didn't


---------13:24----------
at least in my mind i didn't have the


---------13:26----------
time to deal with this


---------13:27----------
crazy child who was being a nuisance and


---------13:30----------
bothered all the time


---------13:31----------
and so i would just be very rude to him


---------13:34----------
and put off things


---------13:35----------
um i don't know i just


---------13:39----------
it's really hard to like give specific


---------13:41----------
details but in general just kind of a


---------13:42----------
day


---------13:43----------
yeah so i think that's an important


---------13:45----------
discussion also one that we don't have


---------13:47----------
to dig into today


---------13:48----------
but i think a lot of people who are are


---------13:52----------
[ __ ] kind of behavior there's some


---------13:54----------
reason like that you don't even


---------13:56----------
understand


---------13:57----------
about why you treated him that way but


---------13:59----------
something has changed in you where


---------14:01----------
you're treating him a different way


---------14:03----------
and and i don't know what that is it


---------14:05----------
sounds like that's awesome and it sounds


---------14:07----------
like he's lucky


---------14:08----------
to have a brother who is thoughtful


---------14:12----------
about the way that like you choose to


---------14:14----------
interact with him and that you make


---------14:15----------
effort to treat him not


---------14:18----------
as a disabled person but also not as


---------14:21----------
a normal human being but you treat him


---------14:24----------
as him


---------14:26----------
and and your brother is incredibly lucky


---------14:28----------
to have someone like that in their


---------14:30----------
in their life i cannot impress that upon


---------14:33----------
you enough


---------14:35----------
um but let's keep going am i jumping in


---------14:38----------
too much


---------14:40----------
uh no okay so you were mean to him so


---------14:43----------
now he communicates only with you


---------14:45----------
you have happiness because you used to


---------14:46----------
be an [ __ ] to him and


---------14:48----------
what other emotions do you have um


---------14:52----------
i also feel a little bit upset because


---------14:59----------
yeah i feel a little bit upset about


---------15:00----------
like how


---------15:02----------
my parents can't do the same thing at


---------15:04----------
least not right now


---------15:05----------
okay so let's unpack that a little bit


---------15:08----------
what does upset mean


---------15:13----------
frustrated uh angry


---------15:16----------
angry at what


---------15:20----------
those are all umbrella emotions which


---------15:22----------
means they're hiding other emotions


---------15:24----------
i'm disappointed i guess there we go


---------15:27----------
disappointed in what


---------15:30----------
that i'm some stupid kid


---------15:34----------
he was able to come to this realization


---------15:36----------
that i was making mistakes and i was


---------15:37----------
able to adjust that and fix that


---------15:41----------
and that happens despite the fact that


---------15:43----------
they're supposed to be like


---------15:44----------
the knowledgeable parents there we go


---------15:46----------
there's a key word there they're


---------15:48----------
supposed to


---------15:50----------
okay i'm a stupid kid okay zach there's


---------15:53----------
a ton there can we analyze as we go


---------15:55----------
or do you want like you want me to hear


---------15:57----------
your story first


---------15:59----------
um think about that


---------16:02----------
i guess i'm kind of curious how we'll be


---------16:03----------
able to get through everything if we're


---------16:05----------
analyzing along


---------16:06----------
that's that's the concern so


---------16:10----------
then let's just okay i'm gonna do one


---------16:12----------
more


---------16:13----------
analytical piece and then we'll get


---------16:14----------
through everything okay so the first


---------16:16----------
thing is that


---------16:17----------
your disappointment so i think you blame


---------16:19----------
your parents what do you think


---------16:21----------
yeah right so there's disappointment and


---------16:24----------
that also is like a little bit more


---------16:25----------
politically correct than blame


---------16:27----------
but what i'm hearing from you is that


---------16:29----------
you blame your parents for


---------16:31----------
not figuring out what you figured out


---------16:35----------
so there's there's something also there


---------16:36----------
where you say i'm a stupid kid


---------16:38----------
i don't think you're a stupid kid i


---------16:39----------
think you grossly underestimate


---------16:41----------
the value of what you've accomplished


---------16:43----------
because some autistic people go their


---------16:46----------
entire life


---------16:47----------
without having someone in their life who


---------16:50----------
does what you did


---------16:51----------
because what you did is not easy it's


---------16:54----------
[ __ ] hard


---------16:56----------
um and


---------16:59----------
yeah and i think that you have to be


---------17:01----------
careful because


---------17:03----------
as long as you see what you do is easy


---------17:06----------
you're going to resent your parents more


---------17:11----------
okay what do you think about that


---------17:15----------
that's interesting because you were


---------17:17----------
saying that it's really hard and i was


---------17:18----------
thinking to myself


---------17:19----------
it doesn't feel that hard it feels


---------17:20----------
pretty easy but if you when you


---------17:22----------
reframe it that way that's interesting


---------17:26----------
yep so we can continue thinking about


---------17:29----------
that and and i would just really ask you


---------17:30----------
to


---------17:31----------
i know it feels easy to you but


---------17:34----------
just stop and think for a second about


---------17:36----------
how easy it is to


---------17:38----------
effectively communicate with an autistic


---------17:40----------
adult


---------17:42----------
yeah right


---------17:45----------
so so don't confuse you being really


---------17:48----------
good at something


---------17:49----------
with the fact that it's easy okay


---------17:53----------
um but we'll we'll get to that anyway i


---------17:54----------
promise i'll shut up now and and


---------17:57----------
i'll hear the rest of your story uh okay


---------18:00----------
so you feel blame


---------18:02----------
you feel happiness what else


---------18:05----------
um those are kind of the main things i


---------18:08----------
would think


---------18:10----------
i i also kind of feel bad for him right


---------18:12----------
because


---------18:13----------
i almost imagine having autism i don't


---------18:16----------
know i mean we don't know a whole lot


---------18:17----------
about it right so it's difficult to


---------18:18----------
say but i must imagine as you are a


---------18:20----------
normal person trapped


---------18:22----------
in this strange mind that you can't


---------18:24----------
control


---------18:25----------
um and so he's trying to find


---------18:29----------
outlets and trying to help himself in


---------18:31----------
that way i think


---------18:32----------
yeah i don't really know but i think um


---------18:36----------
and he's just trying to i mean he's just


---------18:38----------
trying to be normal right


---------18:40----------
she wants to experience what other


---------18:42----------
people experience and


---------18:44----------
i mean for one it's really it's


---------18:46----------
frustrating to not be able to do that


---------18:48----------
because of your own limitations but i


---------18:49----------
also feel it's very frustrating to not


---------18:51----------
be able to do that because of other


---------18:52----------
people around you not understanding


---------18:53----------
like one of the things that i hate the


---------18:55----------
most is when someone misunderstands me


---------18:57----------
and to have that


---------18:58----------
always happening constantly like that'd


---------19:00----------
be awful


---------19:02----------
yeah so you feel kind of sad for him


---------19:06----------
yeah um


---------19:09----------
do you feel burdened at all that like


---------19:12----------
you kind of become


---------19:14----------
the last best hope


---------19:17----------
for him i don't know


---------19:23----------
i mean a little bit because i'm actually


---------19:27----------
planning to


---------19:28----------
go to leave once covet goes down i want


---------19:31----------
to like move to japan


---------19:32----------
and so i'll be like see ya okay right


---------19:34----------
like i feel a little bad about it but


---------19:37----------
i don't know i i also kind of don't


---------19:39----------
really


---------19:40----------
feel that burdened by it it's just like


---------19:42----------
i'm being here for him while i can be


---------19:44----------
and hopefully i can get my parents to


---------19:46----------
realize the same thing


---------19:48----------
and then realize what well sir like


---------19:51----------
realize the same things that i have


---------19:52----------
about okay about how to enter yeah how


---------19:55----------
to interact with them i guess


---------19:57----------
how do your parents feel about you


---------19:58----------
peacing out after


---------20:00----------
i haven't told them okay because i came


---------20:04----------
to this realization like a week or two


---------20:05----------
ago


---------20:06----------
and it's so sort of like a plan in my


---------20:08----------
head that i haven't really


---------20:10----------
like done anything about yet but the


---------20:12----------
more and more i sit on it the more and


---------20:13----------
more i'm like


---------20:14----------
set on it and i really want to do it so


---------20:17----------
okay


---------20:18----------
sounds like you've made a lot of


---------20:19----------
progress man i know right


---------20:22----------
i i feel like now i was exaggerating


---------20:24----------
when i said a little but


---------20:25----------
yep so that has something to do with


---------20:27----------
your your perception of your own


---------20:29----------
confidence but


---------20:30----------
oh yeah yes when i was saying earlier


---------20:32----------
about there's a lot of things that you'd


---------20:33----------
focus on so that's sort of what i mean


---------20:35----------
okay so now we sort of get your


---------20:38----------
perspective so what's going on in the


---------20:39----------
family


---------20:40----------
or what was the conversation when


---------20:43----------
yeah so fill me in a little bit about


---------20:44----------
the conversation that you and your mom


---------20:46----------
had


---------20:48----------
tell me about your dad or tell me about


---------20:50----------
the therapist


---------20:51----------
saying he's bordering on manic whichever


---------20:53----------
one you think is better


---------20:55----------
um i just can try and continue this


---------20:57----------
conversation i can remember


---------20:59----------
a lot of the conversation was her


---------21:01----------
explaining to me


---------21:02----------
her perspective on a situation that had


---------21:04----------
happened earlier


---------21:05----------
so we had some my parents had hired


---------21:09----------
window cleaners to come to our house and


---------21:10----------
clean the windows


---------21:12----------
um my they were


---------21:15----------
burdened with whatever was going on they


---------21:17----------
were thinking about some crazy stuff so


---------21:18----------
they didn't get to tell me or my brother


---------21:20----------
until the night before that hey the


---------21:23----------
window


---------21:23----------
actually they told me but they didn't


---------21:25----------
tell my brother i think


---------21:27----------
and so i had i knew that i was gonna


---------21:29----------
wake up in the morning and there's gonna


---------21:30----------
be windows cleaners there


---------21:32----------
there could be some crazy stuff going on


---------21:33----------
in the house my brother didn't


---------21:35----------
um and so i'm sleeping in until like 11


---------21:38----------
or whatever as i usually do


---------21:39----------
the window cleaners are here my mom was


---------21:41----------
telling me that


---------21:43----------
my dad since he's about like timing and


---------21:45----------
rules and all this stuff starting to get


---------21:46----------
anxious because we need to move stuff


---------21:48----------
away from the windows


---------21:49----------
so that they could clean it okay just


---------21:52----------
being nice to them


---------21:53----------
they were going to probably move things


---------21:54----------
anyways but he wanted to make sure that


---------21:56----------
everything was out of the way for them


---------21:57----------
so he was getting anxious about that


---------21:59----------
and he was putting that anxiety on her


---------22:02----------
because she tends to be receptive to


---------22:04----------
other people's feelings and he tends to


---------22:05----------
put his feelings on to other people


---------22:08----------
okay um and so she was getting anxiety


---------22:10----------
from him


---------22:11----------
so she came into my room to wake me up


---------22:13----------
to move some stuff around to get me to


---------22:14----------
help


---------22:15----------
and then she went to tell my brother who


---------22:17----------
didn't know and


---------22:19----------
as an autistic person that's gonna upset


---------22:21----------
him and so she started moving things in


---------22:23----------
his room he started freaking out and


---------22:25----------
then he started to mount them


---------22:26----------
which eventually later in the day


---------22:28----------
resulted him screaming [ __ ] you to the


---------22:30----------
painters and my parents were worried


---------22:32----------
that he was actually going to go out and


---------22:34----------
push one of them off the ladder or


---------22:35----------
something


---------22:36----------
because like he was going crazy um


---------22:39----------
and in all of this my dad was again


---------22:43----------
trying to enforce rules on him so we


---------22:45----------
have this


---------22:45----------
screaming 20 year old 300 pound guy who


---------22:48----------
has autism


---------22:50----------
you have my dad's trying to say you


---------22:51----------
can't do that


---------22:53----------
you just need to calm down and let them


---------22:54----------
clean your windows you have


---------22:56----------
my mom in the middle like freaking out


---------22:58----------
not knowing to do trying to get everyone


---------22:59----------
to calm down and then you have me


---------23:01----------
downstairs in the basement playing video


---------23:02----------
games trying to shout out all the noise


---------23:06----------
uh and so she was conveying all this to


---------23:08----------
me from her perspective


---------23:11----------
um and that was like a lot of what she


---------23:14----------
was talking about and then she


---------23:15----------
started laying more of her other stuff


---------23:17----------
problems on about how like her parents


---------23:19----------
were coming over


---------23:20----------
the next day um and her parents are


---------23:23----------
alcoholics and she struggles with that


---------23:25----------
and then we


---------23:29----------
sounds like she depends on you for a lot


---------23:34----------
i i don't know because this was like


---------23:37----------
she doesn't usually talk to me about


---------23:39----------
these kind of things i see


---------23:41----------
yeah she this was like the first time


---------23:42----------
that i had had any sort of conversation


---------23:44----------
like this with her and


---------23:46----------
since i had depression like she came out


---------23:48----------
to visit me while i was in utah and that


---------23:50----------
was the last time we had a conversation


---------23:52----------
like this


---------23:53----------
so actually then then i would i mean do


---------23:56----------
you think she


---------23:58----------
hm okay so that's not a regular


---------24:00----------
occurrence so it sounds like she doesn't


---------24:02----------
depend on you much


---------24:03----------
i don't think she does well i mean it's


---------24:05----------
kind of weird right because


---------24:07----------
we talk to each other very familiarly


---------24:10----------
familiarly and we will have


---------24:12----------
conversations where we try not to like


---------24:14----------
let my dad or my brother over here


---------24:15----------
i don't have those kind of conversations


---------24:17----------
with my dad or my brother i only have


---------24:19----------
those conversations with my mom


---------24:21----------
just like the very close interpersonal


---------24:24----------
stuff


---------24:26----------
so like what makes her


---------24:30----------
to a degree i think she kind of does


---------24:31----------
depend on me for that connection but i


---------24:33----------
wouldn't say that she


---------24:34----------
don't like spilling everything sure it's


---------24:36----------
really so it sounds like you guys are


---------24:38----------
just


---------24:38----------
like just close family yeah yeah


---------24:42----------
um and and what makes it hard for you to


---------24:46----------
have those kinds of conversations with


---------24:47----------
your dad


---------24:50----------
he is like virtually impossible to talk


---------24:54----------
to about any of that


---------24:55----------
because again type like very hyper type


---------24:58----------
a personality


---------24:59----------
he's an engineer to his core


---------25:03----------
um so feelings do not compute


---------25:06----------
right okay um and


---------25:10----------
part of what came up in like this


---------25:11----------
conversation my mom is she was talking


---------25:13----------
about how


---------25:14----------
he's sort of always been this way he was


---------25:16----------
raised this way


---------25:18----------
i don't know i actually know very little


---------25:20----------
about him or what happened in his


---------25:21----------
childhood but the way that she conveyed


---------25:23----------
to me is


---------25:25----------
that his family was like this they


---------25:27----------
weren't very connected to each other


---------25:29----------
um it was the difficult households and


---------25:32----------
then


---------25:32----------
i mean once he hit college he joined


---------25:34----------
rotc so he was military for like 30


---------25:37----------
years which again instills this like you


---------25:39----------
follow the rules of the leader


---------25:41----------
you don't disobey who's in command and


---------25:43----------
now he's in command


---------25:46----------
and so he's very much in this way of


---------25:49----------
yeah would you say that your dad is


---------25:54----------
oppressive


---------25:57----------
in ways yeah it's that's it's really


---------26:01----------
hard to say because it's very


---------26:03----------
complicated right but


---------26:04----------
sure i'm just asking if that's how it


---------26:08----------
feels


---------26:10----------
what i'm basically getting is not really


---------26:14----------
yes and no again it's i it's hard to say


---------26:17----------
how it feels


---------26:19----------
because on i guess i'll give you an


---------26:21----------
example so


---------26:22----------
last night i was scrolling through


---------26:25----------
discord and saw


---------26:27----------
somebody type the command for when does


---------26:28----------
the live stream go up


---------26:30----------
and it was midnight and i saw 11 hours


---------26:32----------
and i thought i thought it was at one


---------26:34----------
o'clock


---------26:34----------
and then i realized no i got the time


---------26:36----------
conversion wrong it was at 11 o'clock


---------26:38----------
and so i had to go


---------26:39----------
into my parents room to tell them as


---------26:41----------
they were trying to go to sleep


---------26:42----------
that i messed it up and it was actually


---------26:44----------
at the wrong time


---------26:46----------
and i felt anxious about having to


---------26:49----------
explain that to my dad


---------26:51----------
i felt like he was either going to be


---------26:53----------
upset or he was going to try to cancel


---------26:55----------
or something like that


---------26:56----------
not at all what happened he took it


---------26:58----------
totally fine and everything was okay but


---------27:00----------
i felt like that


---------27:02----------
so if that helps communicate to you how


---------27:04----------
i feel around him


---------27:07----------
in any way it it i mean that scenario


---------27:09----------
sounds to me


---------27:10----------
like it's almost like the same way that


---------27:14----------
you interact with your brother which is


---------27:16----------
like


---------27:16----------
like you you've learned the lesson that


---------27:19----------
telling your dad that things are


---------27:20----------
changing


---------27:22----------
leads to madness


---------27:25----------
yeah so i think oppressive isn't the


---------27:29----------
right word i mean it sounds like


---------27:36----------
it sounds like you're playing with fire


---------27:38----------
sorry what


---------27:39----------
it's not it feels to me like you're


---------27:40----------
playing with fire


---------27:42----------
you know like you don't know when it's


---------27:44----------
gonna blow


---------27:46----------
the way my mom has described it is like


---------27:47----------
walking on eggshells


---------27:51----------
your dad gets angry yes


---------27:55----------
what do what does he do when he gets


---------27:56----------
angry


---------28:00----------
uh he does this like very cold


---------28:04----------
not talk to anybody um he has this like


---------28:07----------
angry look at his face as he just like


---------28:08----------
does whatever he does and he's usually


---------28:10----------
like kind of so aggressive with it so


---------28:11----------
like if he's


---------28:12----------
eating food he'll like aggressively cut


---------28:15----------
with the knife or whatever


---------28:17----------
um and then if anybody like talks too


---------28:19----------
loudly


---------28:20----------
or addresses him incorrectly then he'll


---------28:22----------
like


---------28:24----------
instead of responding i don't know in a


---------28:25----------
nice way he responds in an angry way


---------28:27----------
whether that's like


---------28:28----------
very agitated or yelling or anything


---------28:32----------
like that when he


---------28:33----------
yeah what's it like to live with someone


---------28:35----------
like that


---------28:37----------
yeah it's really hard dude um


---------28:42----------
for a while there was it was like every


---------28:44----------
other day when we would eat dinner my


---------28:45----------
brother would say something or have a


---------28:47----------
pattern or something my dad would get


---------28:49----------
mad at him he would get mad at my dad


---------28:50----------
and then they would yell at each other


---------28:52----------
and i'm just trying to sit there and eat


---------28:53----------
food like


---------29:04----------
zach do you think of yourself as


---------29:06----------
resilient


---------29:10----------
no okay


---------29:13----------
i understand that that makes perfect


---------29:15----------
sense to me


---------29:17----------
and yet i'm gonna ask you


---------29:20----------
how would you describe someone who sits


---------29:22----------
there and tries to eat their food


---------29:24----------
is on a daily basis two members of their


---------29:27----------
family are constantly exploding


---------29:28----------
at each other


---------29:32----------
it probably is resilient right it's


---------29:34----------
weird


---------29:35----------
it's [ __ ] weird


---------29:40----------
and okay


---------29:44----------
yeah that sounds that sounds like i mean


---------29:47----------
really hard is like the understatement


---------29:49----------
of the year


---------29:52----------
honestly it feels to me i would feel


---------29:57----------
like i it would be impossible


---------30:00----------
for me to do what you do


---------30:04----------
like it feels impossible to me


---------30:10----------
yeah i mean it's kind of hard because i


---------30:12----------
don't know what


---------30:13----------
to do right like if i don't like okay


---------30:16----------
if i don't want to do it if i don't want


---------30:18----------
to be resilient what do i do like


---------30:20----------
i don't have any option because i kind


---------30:21----------
of have to deal with it yeah


---------30:23----------
but yeah i can kind of see where you're


---------30:24----------
coming from yeah i like i don't know


---------30:26----------
what you


---------30:27----------
like it sounds it sounds like an


---------30:29----------
impossible situation


---------30:31----------
feels like an impossible situation yeah


---------30:33----------
what do you do about that i have no


---------30:34----------
[ __ ] idea sit downstairs and play


---------30:36----------
video games that's fun


---------30:38----------
right on that's the right answer


---------30:42----------
um yeah man


---------30:46----------
by the way the examples that you offer


---------30:47----------
are really really helpful


---------30:49----------
really okay good yeah i think i think


---------30:51----------
they capture


---------30:52----------
a lot you know you're like painting a


---------30:55----------
picture


---------30:56----------
and like sort of a picture's worth a


---------30:57----------
thousand words so a lot of these


---------30:59----------
dynamics i think are very helpful


---------31:01----------
um do you feel like you've given us kind


---------31:04----------
of like a sufficient picture


---------31:06----------
are there other things that you want to


---------31:08----------
add i


---------31:10----------
there's nothing that i can like


---------31:11----------
specifically add i don't think it


---------31:13----------
really encompasses everything but it


---------31:15----------
would be really hard to because it's a


---------31:17----------
whole lot of you know


---------31:18----------
more examples of similar situations that


---------31:20----------
i just can't remember


---------31:22----------
or like small things here and there that


---------31:24----------
again are just like


---------31:25----------
it's it's too difficult to like really


---------31:27----------
explain the whole the whole of it but


---------31:28----------
that's about as good of a picture as i


---------31:30----------
can give


---------31:31----------
okay um can i


---------31:35----------
try to sum up what i heard and then


---------31:38----------
maybe we can fill in gaps okay sure um


---------31:41----------
and then maybe we can talk about your


---------31:43----------
dad a little bit more but


---------31:44----------
okay so your parents have two sons


---------31:49----------
you're the older son you're


---------31:54----------
i understand that you don't view


---------31:56----------
yourself as very competent


---------31:58----------
but we know that there's con there's


---------32:01----------
evidence to the contrary let's put it


---------32:02----------
that way


---------32:03----------
right so like you were in a pretty


---------32:05----------
competitive phd program


---------32:07----------
you ended up dropping out slash getting


---------32:10----------
kicked out


---------32:10----------
at a toxic advisor things like that you


---------32:13----------
thought that your toxic advisor and for


---------32:15----------
people who


---------32:16----------
i guess i'm surprised i remember but you


---------32:18----------
know you thought


---------32:19----------
that everything that your advisor was


---------32:21----------
doing to you


---------32:22----------
i think towards the end you really


---------32:24----------
realize that it's not really your fault


---------32:26----------
that your advisor was actually pretty


---------32:27----------
bad


---------32:28----------
but i can imagine that that would be a


---------32:29----------
pretty severe blow to your confidence


---------32:32----------
so you kind of come home you have a


---------32:34----------
younger brother who's autistic


---------32:36----------
um it sounds like early on maybe things


---------32:39----------
were sort of okay


---------32:40----------
but then as he start started to grow and


---------32:43----------
you started to grow it became very very


---------32:44----------
difficult to interact with him


---------32:47----------
um it sounds to me like your parents


---------32:49----------
sort of did the best that they could but


---------32:51----------
when your dad kind of is in crisis mode


---------32:55----------
he goes back to what he knows


---------32:58----------
which is control structure right when


---------33:01----------
there's a problem like you you rely on


---------33:03----------
systems


---------33:04----------
resources and rules to kind of deal with


---------33:07----------
it


---------33:07----------
there's not a whole lot of fluidity so


---------33:11----------
it also sounds like he gets


---------33:13----------
anxious actually pretty easily


---------33:16----------
and the way that he responds to his own


---------33:19----------
anxiety is control


---------33:20----------
so when he gets anxious he tries to


---------33:22----------
control [ __ ] yes


---------33:24----------
and it sounds like he also


---------33:28----------
recruits your mom to be one of his tools


---------33:31----------
to leverage control


---------33:32----------
in the household yes and because


---------33:36----------
she is somewhat conflict avoidant


---------33:40----------
she kind of gives in


---------33:43----------
because she's walking on eggshells and


---------33:45----------
doesn't want to you know doesn't want to


---------33:46----------
step on any eggs and


---------33:48----------
want to end up with yolk on the floor so


---------33:50----------
everyone sort of listens to your dad


---------33:52----------
because he kind of like he sort of runs


---------33:54----------
the show is pretty controlling if you


---------33:56----------
don't listen to


---------33:57----------
your dad maybe there's not a whole lot


---------33:58----------
of like dialogue there's not a whole lot


---------34:00----------
of like opinions or like


---------34:02----------
hey dad they can move the stuff


---------34:03----------
themselves like he's not really in the


---------34:05----------
space to sort of hear that kind of thing


---------34:07----------
yeah um and then we kind of come to your


---------34:10----------
so it sounds like you and your mom are


---------34:12----------
close


---------34:12----------
right so you guys can connect with each


---------34:14----------
other because both y'all are sort of


---------34:15----------
like


---------34:16----------
talkers or feelers and it


---------34:19----------
it it seems like your dad and your


---------34:22----------
brother have difficulty engaging


---------34:26----------
on that wavelength yeah so i'm not


---------34:29----------
really detecting


---------34:30----------
any amount of kind of like reverse


---------34:33----------
parenting


---------34:34----------
so sometimes we get into situations


---------34:36----------
where parents


---------34:38----------
become the children and children become


---------34:40----------
the parents


---------34:42----------
yeah that's i'm not getting any of that


---------34:44----------
so it doesn't sound like your mom


---------34:46----------
leans on you for her emotional needs it


---------34:48----------
sounds like you guys like you're an


---------34:50----------
adult and she's an adult


---------34:51----------
and you all are close family members you


---------34:52----------
all understand each other you all love


---------34:54----------
each other and you all just have a


---------34:55----------
strong relationship


---------34:56----------
where there's pretty even flow of


---------34:57----------
communication yeah


---------35:00----------
um then we come to your brother so your


---------35:04----------
brother is autistic


---------35:05----------
it's unclear to me exactly where he is


---------35:07----------
in terms of function but it sounds like


---------35:08----------
he's like kind of functional but


---------35:10----------
has a lot of difficulty managing his own


---------35:13----------
emotions


---------35:15----------
and and can kind of be okay if he's got


---------35:18----------
a routine


---------35:19----------
but i'm not hearing that he's like


---------35:21----------
non-verbal


---------35:23----------
or or things like that that like you


---------35:25----------
know his emotions escalate


---------35:28----------
pretty easily he doesn't respond well to


---------35:30----------
routine but you can communicate with him


---------35:32----------
he does to a certain degree appreciate


---------35:34----------
communication


---------35:36----------
yeah i mean we used to joke because the


---------35:38----------
when


---------35:39----------
he was first diagnosed they said that he


---------35:41----------
would be non-verbal and now we joke that


---------35:43----------
he's overly verbal


---------35:45----------
yeah that's great i mean that's actually


---------35:49----------
a huge


---------35:51----------
that's a huge win whether y'all realize


---------35:54----------
it or not which i think it's hard for


---------35:55----------
you guys to realize but um


---------35:58----------
you know having a autistic kid who


---------36:00----------
becomes verbal


---------36:01----------
is like really amazing


---------36:04----------
and it's a testament to what your family


---------36:06----------
has accomplished which it may not seem


---------36:08----------
like that right now but


---------36:09----------
you know i've seen other cases where


---------36:11----------
non-verbal kids end up non-verbal


---------36:15----------
and that also doesn't mean that their


---------36:16----------
families didn't try hard enough which is


---------36:18----------
what's really hard about autism


---------36:20----------
but i think you guys really deserve a


---------36:23----------
pat on the back for


---------36:25----------
um you know what y'all have done for him


---------36:28----------
so then the other thing that i'm going


---------36:30----------
to kind of hypothesize a little bit is


---------36:32----------
is you know it sounds like your


---------36:34----------
brother's autism


---------36:36----------
and your dad's desire for control are


---------36:39----------
sort of like


---------36:41----------
oil and water like that just sounds bad


---------36:44----------
yeah


---------36:46----------
i i sort of liken it to


---------36:49----------
two autistic people with very different


---------36:52----------
patterns trying to mesh those patterns


---------36:55----------
together


---------36:55----------
like that just will not happen at all so


---------36:58----------
tell me a little bit about


---------37:00----------
you know how they don't measure why they


---------37:02----------
don't mesh and i'm guessing


---------37:04----------
i can phrase the question slightly


---------37:06----------
differently what's the cycle


---------37:08----------
because it sounds like there's a cycle


---------37:09----------
in there but


---------37:12----------
tell me about their interactions so my


---------37:14----------
brother has


---------37:15----------
like eight billion different little


---------37:17----------
patterns he goes through on a regular


---------37:18----------
basis


---------37:20----------
um and my dad will come up with


---------37:23----------
something


---------37:24----------
whether it's dinner time or we'd go


---------37:27----------
somewhere or there's work that needs to


---------37:29----------
be done


---------37:30----------
or someone's coming to fix the house in


---------37:31----------
some way whatever something needs to


---------37:33----------
happen


---------37:33----------
and then that does not agree with the


---------37:36----------
pattern of my brother


---------37:39----------
so like often what happens is my dad


---------37:42----------
will get frustrated that it's dinner


---------37:43----------
time but my brother has to go walk the


---------37:45----------
dog right now because that's his pattern


---------37:47----------
and so there's conflict there um


---------37:50----------
and so my dad will say like well why


---------37:52----------
didn't you do it earlier or why don't


---------37:54----------
you do


---------37:54----------
after and my brother would say because i


---------37:57----------
want to do it now


---------37:59----------
and then my dad will um either roll his


---------38:02----------
eyes and go


---------38:03----------
and then be like whatever or he'll fight


---------38:05----------
with him


---------38:06----------
um and he'll say like no you have to do


---------38:09----------
x now you need to do it now


---------38:11----------
this needs to happen and then my brother


---------38:12----------
will yell and scream and then start


---------38:14----------
fighting and then


---------38:15----------
at that point communication breaks down


---------38:16----------
and it's just and


---------38:18----------
arguing people not even like aiming at


---------38:20----------
each other it's just like


---------38:22----------
craziness yeah so the cycle is like


---------38:25----------
the my brother is always in his constant


---------38:27----------
state of like existing in his patterns


---------38:29----------
and if my dad has something that


---------38:30----------
needs to happen they both have this


---------38:33----------
thing that needs to happen but they


---------38:34----------
can't happen together like they just


---------38:35----------
can't


---------38:36----------
coexist and so then disagreement comes


---------38:38----------
from there okay


---------38:41----------
and so so is would it be fair for me to


---------38:43----------
assume that the more


---------38:46----------
conflict arises the more your dad


---------38:48----------
doubles down on control


---------38:51----------
and the more he doubles down on control


---------38:53----------
the more conflict arises


---------38:56----------
yes do so if your dad your dad sometimes


---------38:58----------
gives up and accepts defeat


---------39:00----------
does your brother do that does your dad


---------39:03----------
ever win no no he doesn't


---------39:09----------
okay


---------39:12----------
okay so i mean do you feel like we have


---------39:16----------
a pretty good picture


---------39:18----------
of what these dynamics are like yeah uh


---------39:21----------
when you were laying it out it was


---------39:22----------
i felt like it was better than the way i


---------39:24----------
tried to lay it out like you really hit


---------39:26----------
the nail


---------39:27----------
no buddy you laid it out i'm just


---------39:29----------
telling you what i heard


---------39:31----------
okay um i think you like i said you gave


---------39:34----------
a lot of very very


---------39:35----------
illustrated illustrative actual examples


---------39:39----------
that captured a lot of that essence


---------39:42----------
very well um so


---------39:46----------
what helped me understand a little bit


---------39:47----------
about like you know why are


---------39:49----------
we here today so like what's what's the


---------39:51----------
goal of like having you and your dad


---------39:53----------
come on


---------39:54----------
because i'm not hearing any


---------39:55----------
communication issues between you and


---------39:56----------
your dad


---------39:58----------
yeah uh i'm not fully sure uh


---------40:02----------
to be honest because okay so my mom came


---------40:05----------
in and had this conversation with me


---------40:06----------
that's when i


---------40:08----------
remembered that you guys were looking


---------40:09----------
for families to come on and that's when


---------40:11----------
i


---------40:12----------
messaged french hey i got a family that


---------40:14----------
needs to come on


---------40:16----------
okay and after going back and forth he


---------40:18----------
said that you wanted to have


---------40:20----------
only like two people come on to more


---------40:23----------
direct


---------40:24----------
let's have you and your dad tomorrow's


---------40:25----------
like all right cool


---------40:27----------
okay um so


---------40:30----------
so what do you what what do you what


---------40:32----------
would you like to change about your


---------40:34----------
family dynamic


---------40:39----------
oh that's a good question ah


---------40:43----------
i mean there's a couple things for one i


---------40:45----------
would like


---------40:47----------
my parents to have a better


---------40:48----------
understanding of


---------40:50----------
my brother and be


---------40:56----------
how do i put this


---------41:02----------
i want them to be less likely to


---------41:05----------
conflict with him right like i this


---------41:07----------
whole thing with my dad dumbling down of


---------41:09----------
control and him getting more angry and


---------41:10----------
my dad doubling down again and then him


---------41:12----------
getting more angry like


---------41:13----------
that's obvious to me i want that to be


---------41:15----------
obvious to him


---------41:17----------
so that he doesn't do that anymore a's


---------41:20----------
for me


---------41:20----------
because i can't have constant yelling in


---------41:23----------
my life


---------41:24----------
b for my mom because she also needs


---------41:26----------
peace


---------41:27----------
c for my brother so that he doesn't have


---------41:29----------
this conflict and d for my dad because


---------41:32----------
i mean like i said my dad was raised in


---------41:34----------
this very like rules way and i don't


---------41:37----------
think that's good for him


---------41:38----------
or for anybody in the family okay


---------41:42----------
um and i think that's actually i think


---------41:46----------
that'd be such a


---------41:48----------
to somehow find a way to slowly break


---------41:50----------
him out of that because that would solve


---------41:51----------
so many different things


---------41:53----------
breaking bad this this


---------41:56----------
uh rules-based very strict style that he


---------42:00----------
has always been


---------42:02----------
okay so what we want to do is change him


---------42:06----------
as a human being


---------42:06----------
well yeah like no no but hey i asked you


---------42:10----------
i asked you what do you want to change


---------42:11----------
that's cool


---------42:13----------
because it's real like i have


---------42:16----------
no connection with my dad whatsoever i


---------42:19----------
don't know if i've ever really like


---------42:20----------
wanted one because i


---------42:22----------
have never really like experienced that


---------42:23----------
in any way we just have never connected


---------42:25----------
with each other really hardly at all


---------42:28----------
um whereas i have been able to connect


---------42:31----------
and


---------42:31----------
be pretty friendly with my mom and i


---------42:33----------
like that connection so if there were


---------42:34----------
some way to have that with my dad i


---------42:36----------
don't know if that's practical or


---------42:37----------
possible or if that's even something


---------42:38----------
that i really want but


---------42:40----------
okay um has your dad ever seen a


---------42:44----------
therapist


---------42:45----------
no nope he has always looked at it his


---------42:48----------
psychological mumbo-jumbo ignored that


---------42:50----------
crap


---------42:51----------
it was hard to get him into this


---------42:54----------
well hey so like strong work with


---------42:55----------
getting him here right like that's


---------42:57----------
that's


---------42:58----------
he deserves he deserves some props for


---------43:00----------
showing up


---------43:02----------
yeah oh i forgot to mention when i was


---------43:03----------
talking to my mom in here


---------43:05----------
um she had mentioned to me that she


---------43:07----------
brought up family counseling with my dad


---------43:08----------
and it was the first time that he had


---------43:10----------
agreed that this is maybe


---------43:11----------
something we should do so he's like kind


---------43:13----------
of starting to go a little bit in that


---------43:14----------
direction


---------43:15----------
okay any questions for me zach


---------43:22----------
i don't know i don't have anything come


---------43:24----------
to mind right now i mean i feel like we


---------43:26----------
got to talk to your dad bro


---------43:27----------
yeah like i think you've laid out a


---------43:30----------
pretty good picture


---------43:31----------
uh thankfully since we've talked before


---------43:33----------
i know a little bit about you


---------43:34----------
oh are we lagging okay um but i think a


---------43:38----------
lot of this has to come


---------43:40----------
from your dad's perspective and then


---------43:41----------
we'll get both you all in together does


---------43:43----------
that sound good to you


---------43:44----------
yeah let's swap and no watching okay


---------43:48----------
okay let me find them


---------43:52----------
all right


---------44:00----------
all right twitch how you guys is this


---------44:02----------
sound like a good use of our time


---------44:04----------
on stream


---------44:20----------
okay


---------44:34----------
hey dr gay hey dave how are you good are


---------44:37----------
you


---------44:38----------
uh i'm doing well man um how do you feel


---------44:40----------
about doing this


---------44:43----------
um i've never done it before uh


---------44:46----------
a little uncomfortable just a little


---------44:51----------
okay quite a bit i can imagine right


---------44:54----------
let's


---------44:55----------
let's just call it what it is you know


---------44:56----------
yeah i won't hide it yeah


---------44:58----------
um you know i've i've had experiences


---------45:01----------
and standing up and briefing


---------45:03----------
uh small and large groups of people


---------45:06----------
so it's kind of in the same realm i


---------45:08----------
haven't done that for a long time


---------45:10----------
but it's one of those things uh the more


---------45:12----------
you do it


---------45:14----------
the more you become comfortable with it


---------45:16----------
particularly if you fully understand the


---------45:17----------
subject


---------45:18----------
matter and here i don't because i don't


---------45:19----------
know where you're coming from


---------45:21----------
sure so so maybe i can help you there


---------45:23----------
would you like


---------45:24----------
to hear where i'm coming from sure okay


---------45:28----------
so i'm gonna kind of zoom


---------45:32----------
out a little bit okay and tell you a


---------45:33----------
little bit about what we do here


---------45:35----------
so i'm uh we tend to just talk to people


---------45:38----------
on the internet because it's been my


---------45:40----------
experience that like


---------45:42----------
people share a lot of the same


---------45:44----------
challenges in life


---------45:46----------
and that by talking to one person like i


---------45:48----------
basically have the same conversations


---------45:49----------
with a lot of different people


---------45:51----------
and so what we do here is we have


---------45:52----------
conversations with people that other


---------45:54----------
people watch


---------45:55----------
because i can imagine that you have


---------45:58----------
or y'all's family has some amount of


---------46:00----------
conflict


---------46:01----------
or maybe some kind of difficulty


---------46:03----------
communication in communicating


---------46:05----------
and that is also true of every other


---------46:07----------
family in the history of human existence


---------46:09----------
and so the reason that we're here today


---------46:11----------
is to see if that there's something we


---------46:13----------
can help


---------46:14----------
you guys do to maybe communicate a


---------46:16----------
little bit better


---------46:17----------
maybe to be to understand each other a


---------46:20----------
little bit better


---------46:21----------
um understand how the the dynamics of


---------46:24----------
the family unit


---------46:25----------
works right so like it's a big i have a


---------46:27----------
big belief that


---------46:28----------
in order to change something you have to


---------46:30----------
understand how it works


---------46:33----------
so what we're really here to do today is


---------46:34----------
to try to understand a little bit about


---------46:36----------
what's going


---------46:37----------
on um in you in your family


---------46:40----------
and in the interface between those two


---------46:43----------
things


---------46:46----------
how does that sound good sounds good so


---------46:48----------
can you tell me a little bit about


---------46:50----------
um so zach had mentioned that there's


---------46:52----------
been like you know tensions have been


---------46:53----------
running high in the house


---------46:55----------
recently um would you agree with that


---------47:00----------
yes can you help me understand a little


---------47:03----------
bit about what your perception of that


---------47:05----------
is


---------47:07----------
um part of it i'll say there's been a


---------47:10----------
change in the family dynamics


---------47:12----------
in the recent months partially due


---------47:16----------
to covid absolutely in the fact that


---------47:20----------
um in a normal day pre-coveted


---------47:24----------
i was at work my wife works from home


---------47:28----------
and our son was in school


---------47:32----------
and he would normally get home about 2


---------47:34----------
30.


---------47:36----------
since covid um


---------47:40----------
i'm working from home for the past four


---------47:41----------
months


---------47:43----------
uh our other child


---------47:47----------
the one that zach had mentioned was


---------47:49----------
autistic


---------47:50----------
uh he's home now full-time and


---------47:54----------
and zach's been home full-time so


---------47:58----------
everybody's home 24-7


---------48:01----------
and it's been a drastic change for the


---------48:04----------
autistic


---------48:04----------
son and that his normal


---------48:08----------
daily routine has been disturbed


---------48:11----------
and he's trying to find himself with new


---------48:14----------
routines


---------48:16----------
and he really he's he's a little unique


---------48:20----------
autistic kid in the way that he is


---------48:22----------
social


---------48:24----------
where most are not social and he misses


---------48:28----------
that social interaction that he gets


---------48:30----------
riding the bus


---------48:31----------
and with his teachers and peers in his


---------48:33----------
school he's in a


---------48:35----------
transition program he graduated from


---------48:39----------
high school but they hold the diploma


---------48:41----------
until he completes a two-year transition


---------48:43----------
program to help set him up


---------48:45----------
for employment or some other opportunity


---------48:48----------
okay so offers that and it's a real good


---------48:50----------
program so he will come to uh


---------48:52----------
to the end of that program here in


---------48:54----------
december but any case


---------48:56----------
his normal routine and social


---------48:57----------
interaction


---------48:59----------
is has not been happening the last four


---------49:01----------
months


---------49:02----------
and so that's caused a drastic behavior


---------49:04----------
change in him


---------49:05----------
okay that's added added stress yeah so i


---------49:08----------
was just going to say that sounds like a


---------49:10----------
pretty hefty stressor


---------49:12----------
on the system of your family yes


---------49:15----------
how does that stress manifest


---------49:18----------
uh with the


---------49:22----------
the autistic center his name is carson


---------49:24----------
he uh


---------49:26----------
has become had more meltdowns become


---------49:29----------
more


---------49:30----------
difficult to manage his behavior


---------49:34----------
he's very obsessed with patterns


---------49:37----------
and if he can't do his patterns the way


---------49:39----------
he wants to


---------49:41----------
for various reasons whether the weather


---------49:44----------
interferes with him going outside and


---------49:45----------
walking the dog


---------49:47----------
or some other


---------49:50----------
interference as a result of family


---------49:53----------
activities perhaps


---------49:54----------
he'll have a meltdown and that disturbs


---------49:56----------
the family


---------49:58----------
it can evolve into shouting


---------50:01----------
and yelling and it takes us 30 to 40


---------50:05----------
minutes to calm him down


---------50:07----------
to where he can reason through the


---------50:09----------
situation at hand


---------50:10----------
okay so tell me what a meltdown you kind


---------50:13----------
of mention this a little bit


---------50:14----------
when you say he has more meltdowns like


---------50:16----------
tell us tell me or


---------50:18----------
us what a meltdown looks like it becomes


---------50:21----------
uh


---------50:21----------
uncontrollable verbally and emotionally


---------50:25----------
he'll start yelling he


---------50:27----------
will make statements that are


---------50:31----------
unclear and don't make any sense and


---------50:34----------
he can become very physical


---------50:38----------
and um he is 6'3 240


---------50:41----------
so he's bigger than mom and dad so that


---------50:43----------
becomes a


---------50:44----------
turn and so the key here is


---------50:48----------
de-escalation


---------50:49----------
and to talk him down and to get him calm


---------50:52----------
that you can reason through the


---------50:54----------
situation


---------50:55----------
and um it can be very very challenging


---------50:59----------
and draining


---------51:00----------
for both mom and dad and and obviously


---------51:02----------
zach as well too


---------51:05----------
how do you de-escalate him


---------51:09----------
talking continually


---------51:12----------
talking and talk him down


---------51:16----------
help me understand what that looked like


---------51:20----------
um patience we have to stay


---------51:24----------
calm even though we may be exhausted and


---------51:26----------
stressed


---------51:28----------
sounds like it's an exhausting situation


---------51:30----------
it is mentally


---------51:32----------
and it can't be physically because uh


---------51:34----------
this can happen late at night


---------51:36----------
you know when we're ready to go to bed


---------51:37----------
he can have a meltdown 11 30 at night


---------51:39----------
and it'll take us


---------51:41----------
you know an hour and a half to get him


---------51:42----------
situated and ready for bed for example


---------51:45----------
and um it's it's uh


---------51:48----------
being patient and us remaining calm


---------51:52----------
and talking him down in


---------51:56----------
from the situation and trying to reason


---------51:57----------
through it what are the words that you


---------52:00----------
use


---------52:00----------
to talk him down or reason through the


---------52:02----------
situation can you give us an example


---------52:05----------
one is breathing get him


---------52:09----------
to take deep breaths and try to calm


---------52:12----------
himself down


---------52:13----------
physically and hopefully and then


---------52:16----------
eventually


---------52:17----------
mentally as well so he can think


---------52:20----------
rationally and uh you know the


---------52:23----------
adrenaline kicks in


---------52:26----------
and um he can get spun up


---------52:29----------
physically in in mentally pretty rapid


---------52:33----------
and what do you say


---------52:38----------
is that we have uh you know he has


---------52:40----------
counselors and therapists


---------52:43----------
it we're uh wanting to get family


---------52:46----------
training to know how to work with him


---------52:49----------
and


---------52:50----------
understand what his triggers are that


---------52:51----------
sounds like a great idea


---------52:54----------
um so what what do you say when when he


---------52:56----------
gets wound up


---------53:00----------
whatever the situation is


---------53:05----------
is is to talk through that situation


---------53:09----------
and very elementary terms


---------53:13----------
and let him try to understand there's


---------53:15----------
not any consequence


---------53:18----------
in not doing one of his patterns


---------53:21----------
and for example it may be


---------53:25----------
he has patterns that he does during the


---------53:27----------
day and it delays him to take the dog


---------53:29----------
out for a walk that's one of his


---------53:31----------
uh things he loves to do it's one of his


---------53:34----------
patterns


---------53:36----------
and if the weather rolls in and it


---------53:39----------
starts raining


---------53:40----------
then he's in conflict that he can't do


---------53:42----------
his pattern he


---------53:44----------
he wants to do it but he can't because


---------53:46----------
it's raining and so he's in a do loop


---------53:49----------
and he can't get out of it and so we try


---------53:51----------
to come up with alternatives to say


---------53:53----------
let's wait till the rain passes or two


---------53:55----------
tomorrow knowing that a storm is coming


---------53:57----------
in the afternoon let's change your


---------53:59----------
pattern and walk the dog in the morning


---------54:01----------
and so we try to reason through


---------54:02----------
alternatives


---------54:04----------
to permit him to complete his pattern


---------54:08----------
okay okay and


---------54:11----------
and how does it how do you manage


---------54:14----------
all of this stress or


---------54:19----------
yeah how how do you manage that i mean


---------54:20----------
it sounds


---------54:22----------
so sort of deep i mean just


---------54:26----------
sure decompress but also like how do you


---------54:27----------
manage things in the moment


---------54:30----------
you know how do you feel when it's 11 30


---------54:32----------
at night


---------54:34----------
and


---------54:37----------
that that scenario is very difficult at


---------54:39----------
night because uh


---------54:42----------
i i get it you know about nine o'clock


---------54:44----------
i'm starting to get tired


---------54:45----------
and if we're watching something on tv


---------54:47----------
and uh


---------54:48----------
he starts to have a meltdown you know 10


---------54:50----------
11 o'clock at night


---------54:52----------
um you have to regain your composure


---------54:55----------
in uh what does that mean regain your


---------54:58----------
composure what is


---------55:00----------
what is losing computer look and feel


---------55:02----------
regaining


---------55:03----------
it should say regain some strength you


---------55:05----------
get some endurance that you may be out


---------55:07----------
of gas


---------55:07----------
by the end of the day but need to


---------55:10----------
[Music]


---------55:11----------
dig deep and and get the strength


---------55:15----------
to get you through the period it takes


---------55:18----------
to get


---------55:19----------
to calm him down from from a potential


---------55:21----------
meltdown


---------55:22----------
okay what happens if you dig deep and


---------55:26----------
there's nothing there


---------55:28----------
nothing left then


---------55:31----------
at some point i've lost it


---------55:34----------
as well as my wife and there's you know


---------55:36----------
there's a threshold that we all have


---------55:38----------
absolutely and we've learned that


---------55:42----------
uh both parents or one parent


---------55:45----------
and and and carson um


---------55:49----------
shouting and yelling and and getting


---------55:51----------
into an escalation


---------55:52----------
is of no value to anybody we've learned


---------55:55----------
that so


---------55:56----------
again the key is is you gotta gain


---------55:59----------
composure get your mind together and


---------56:01----------
realize we got to de-escalate


---------56:03----------
and think through quickly how you can


---------56:06----------
provide alternatives and rationalize


---------56:09----------
with them to calm them down


---------56:12----------
can i think for a second dave sure


---------56:29----------
it's gonna take me a minute okay sure


---------56:33----------
i'm just gonna i'm trying to process


---------56:34----------
everything that you've said really kind


---------56:36----------
of pay attention to it


---------56:38----------
really try to understand you know the


---------56:40----------
inputs that you're offering us


---------56:43----------
and integrating it a little bit with


---------56:44----------
some of what your son has said


---------56:50----------
so the first thing that i want to point


---------56:52----------
out is that a lot of what you're saying


---------56:53----------
like you use a lot of like language of


---------56:55----------
necessity


---------56:57----------
so you say you gotta you need to you


---------57:00----------
have to


---------57:01----------
you gotta dig deep you gotta find


---------57:03----------
strength


---------57:05----------
does that make sense


---------57:09----------
yeah and


---------57:14----------
and i know this may sound kind of weird


---------57:15----------
but like


---------57:17----------
what needs to be done is like quite


---------57:19----------
different from


---------57:23----------
how it feels in the moment right it's


---------57:26----------
sort of like looking forward


---------57:27----------
does that make sense the end state


---------57:32----------
yes so you're focusing on the end state


---------57:35----------
you're focusing on the goal


---------57:37----------
right do you think there's value


---------57:40----------
to focusing on things besides the goal


---------57:43----------
like how you feel in the moment


---------57:47----------
sure what's the value in that


---------57:52----------
short-term results what does that mean


---------57:58----------
small steps to get to your goal take one


---------58:01----------
step at a time


---------58:02----------
and it could be calm yourself down first


---------58:06----------
before you can help someone else okay so


---------58:09----------
it seems like the value


---------58:11----------
of like your emotions understanding your


---------58:14----------
emotions


---------58:14----------
is so that you can master them so that


---------58:17----------
you can get to your end goal


---------58:19----------
yes so the only value that i'm really


---------58:22----------
hearing from you about


---------58:23----------
understanding let's say the way that you


---------58:25----------
feel in the moment


---------58:26----------
is because that's going to help you get


---------58:28----------
to your end goal is that fair


---------58:32----------
yeah okay


---------58:35----------
so i don't know how exactly to explain


---------58:38----------
this so i'm going to


---------58:39----------
think about it for a little while and


---------58:40----------
i'm going to ask you some more questions


---------58:43----------
but in my experience there's value to


---------58:46----------
knowing what you feel


---------58:49----------
independent of it getting you to your


---------58:51----------
goal


---------58:53----------
what do you think about that


---------58:59----------
yeah that


---------59:03----------
how you feeling what how you feel in the


---------59:06----------
moment is important


---------59:09----------
and that can


---------59:12----------
influence i guess the outcome sure


---------59:16----------
your goal so


---------59:19----------
so what i'm wondering is is there


---------59:20----------
importance if it doesn't influence your


---------59:23----------
outcome


---------59:27----------
no no i haven't thought about that


---------59:32----------
what do you think


---------59:36----------
so explain that a little bit more so let


---------59:39----------
me think about that


---------59:47----------
let me just try to come up with an


---------59:48----------
example


---------59:54----------
so i'm going to use a slightly dire


---------59:56----------
example


---------59:58----------
so and and maybe there's i'm sure


---------60:01----------
there's an outcome somewhere here so


---------60:02----------
let's say that i have someone who


---------60:04----------
has cancer and that the cancer is


---------60:07----------
terminal


---------60:09----------
like understanding that the cancer is


---------60:11----------
terminal changes nothing about the fact


---------60:13----------
that the person is going to die


---------60:15----------
and yet just understanding that you have


---------60:19----------
terminal cancer can change something


---------60:22----------
within you


---------60:23----------
like it has value


---------60:26----------
right and so you could say that there's


---------60:27----------
an outcome there too which is that you


---------60:29----------
spend your the rest of your life in a


---------60:31----------
slightly different way


---------60:32----------
so i'm sort of always seeing an outcome


---------60:35----------
but oddly enough


---------60:37----------
as someone who's worked with terminal


---------60:39----------
cancer patients


---------60:40----------
i've observed that even if it doesn't


---------60:42----------
change something about their life or it


---------60:45----------
doesn't lead to a goal


---------60:47----------
that understanding how you feel and


---------60:49----------
understanding what the situation is


---------60:51----------
in and of itself has value


---------60:56----------
does that make sense yes here you go


---------60:59----------
so another example is like when i think


---------61:01----------
about a flower


---------61:03----------
like and i look at a flower and i think


---------61:05----------
oh that flower is beautiful


---------61:07----------
there's no goal there


---------61:10----------
there's no like there's no outcome


---------61:13----------
and understanding that i appreciate


---------61:15----------
flowers and like just watching a flower


---------61:17----------
and appreciating it for what it is


---------61:20----------
can have value but there's not really a


---------61:22----------
goal does that make sense


---------61:24----------
yeah as you're saying and so


---------61:27----------
when you say you see what i'm saying


---------61:29----------
what what do you think i'm saying


---------61:30----------
what do you see because i i don't even


---------61:32----------
know what i'm saying


---------61:35----------
so help us out not everything has to


---------61:37----------
contribute to a goal


---------61:39----------
and you can enjoy the moment for


---------61:42----------
whatever value it provides you


---------61:45----------
okay if it's entertainment


---------61:49----------
fulfillment happiness


---------61:53----------
sure so uh so that's that's a really um


---------61:56----------
great way to put it dave so let me ask


---------61:58----------
you actually another question


---------62:00----------
it sounds like appreciating the moment


---------62:03----------
without a goal


---------62:04----------
is important if it has a positive


---------62:06----------
direction


---------62:07----------
so happiness joy beauty


---------62:10----------
what about negative things


---------62:18----------
i guess just be undesirable unless


---------62:22----------
unless there is some value in it i can't


---------62:24----------
think of an example now where


---------62:26----------
okay a negative negative uh outcome in


---------62:29----------
the in a moment


---------62:30----------
like that would have value except that


---------62:33----------
if it was negative


---------62:35----------
maybe you learn from it sure yeah okay


---------62:38----------
the learning experience


---------62:39----------
yeah so um


---------62:43----------
the best thing that i can kind of think


---------62:45----------
of is in terms of a negative thing is


---------62:46----------
like what i think of is like the


---------62:48----------
grieving process right so like grieving


---------62:51----------
is sort of this weird thing where sure


---------62:52----------
you can also see outcomes because after


---------62:54----------
grieving you're not maybe


---------62:56----------
less sad or no longer sad or something


---------62:57----------
like that but i i think that there's


---------62:59----------
just


---------63:00----------
value in people like grieving together


---------63:03----------
and just acknowledging that there's been


---------63:05----------
some kind of loss


---------63:07----------
and sure that leads to like peace down


---------63:09----------
the road so you could say that's an


---------63:10----------
outcome


---------63:11----------
but sitting with grief i think sometimes


---------63:13----------
is not always a bad thing


---------63:15----------
what do you think i agree grieving is


---------63:18----------
part of the healing process


---------63:19----------
okay how are you feeling right now by


---------63:22----------
the way


---------63:25----------
a little more comfortable than when it


---------63:26----------
started okay or do you feel like we're


---------63:29----------
walking on shaky ice


---------63:32----------
no um i'm


---------63:36----------
struggling for the words to try to


---------63:40----------
articulate our son's behavior


---------63:45----------
uh in in answering your question on how


---------63:48----------
we de-escalate


---------63:50----------
and it's it's kind of one of those


---------63:51----------
things it's a little difficult


---------63:53----------
to describe but


---------63:56----------
um it's it's a tactic or technique


---------64:00----------
in trying to de-escalate and it's a


---------64:02----------
little difficult to describe


---------64:04----------
and it is and it depends on the


---------64:05----------
situation at hand because


---------64:07----------
his meltdowns quite often aren't


---------64:10----------
consistent they're they're different


---------64:12----------
things that would uh


---------64:14----------
bring on a meltdown sometimes they're


---------64:17----------
unpredictable


---------64:18----------
sometimes we can predict them okay


---------64:21----------
um okay that makes sense because it it


---------64:25----------
sounds like


---------64:26----------
you know you're doing a lot of stuff up


---------64:28----------
here you're making a lot of calculations


---------64:32----------
and that's like a pretty complex


---------64:34----------
equation and then like


---------64:35----------
words come out of your mouth but it's


---------64:37----------
hard to really explain to us


---------64:39----------
how that process works right


---------64:43----------
that makes a lot of sense i mean i can


---------64:44----------
imagine it would be hard to to explain


---------64:47----------
it you know to amplify on that our


---------64:50----------
friends


---------64:51----------
and family who see him occasionally


---------64:55----------
think he's the sweetest kid but they


---------64:58----------
don't


---------64:59----------
know what he's like at home


---------65:02----------
so how does that feel


---------65:06----------
for them to see him as the sweetest kid


---------65:08----------
but not know what he's like at home


---------65:12----------
it's it's difficult because they


---------65:15----------
they don't understand how he could


---------65:17----------
behave and have meltdowns


---------65:19----------
like we described and


---------65:22----------
until they witness it themselves


---------65:25----------
what's difficult about that


---------65:29----------
some people don't believe us


---------65:32----------
so what is it like to be not believed by


---------65:34----------
some people


---------65:36----------
what is it like to have them not


---------65:38----------
understand


---------65:42----------
um it is difficult to relate


---------65:48----------
okay so


---------65:51----------
i think dave that there's an emotion


---------65:53----------
there


---------65:54----------
difficult to relate is what we see on


---------65:57----------
the outside


---------65:58----------
right that's a result like it's hard for


---------66:01----------
these two people to relate


---------66:02----------
how do do you have a sense of if there's


---------66:05----------
like an emotion that you feel


---------66:07----------
when other people don't understand what


---------66:09----------
you're saying


---------66:12----------
no it's just um


---------66:15----------
it's just one of those things you can


---------66:16----------
try to articulate it and ex


---------66:18----------
and describe what a meltdown is what


---------66:21----------
causes it


---------66:22----------
but until they they witness it firsthand


---------66:27----------
i don't think they they have a full


---------66:28----------
understanding of it right so what's it


---------66:31----------
like for you


---------66:33----------
to talk to someone who doesn't have a


---------66:34----------
full understanding and sort of like


---------66:36----------
thinks that he's just this


---------66:37----------
happy-go-lucky kid


---------66:41----------
it it's um


---------66:46----------
it doesn't bother me or it isn't um


---------66:51----------
any in difficult at all it's just you


---------66:54----------
try to articulate it and if they don't


---------66:56----------
understand or comprehend it that's okay


---------67:00----------
it doesn't affect me at all


---------67:04----------
sure but


---------67:08----------
they don't know what our life is really


---------67:11----------
like


---------67:11----------
at home so what do you think it's like


---------67:14----------
for a human being


---------67:16----------
to interact with other human beings who


---------67:18----------
don't know


---------67:19----------
what their life is like


---------67:23----------
uh misunderstanding don't understand


---------67:26----------
what makes him tick so i'm going to toss


---------67:29----------
out a word which is what i'm digging for


---------67:31----------
okay but i think that this is a


---------67:33----------
vocabulary that


---------67:34----------
that you may be unfamiliar with we're


---------67:37----------
playing with a system


---------67:38----------
that you may be kind of unfamiliar with


---------67:40----------
so when i


---------67:42----------
when i hear that what i imagine you may


---------67:44----------
be feeling on some level


---------67:46----------
is actually kind of like isolated


---------67:50----------
when i think about human connection i


---------67:52----------
think about people who can relate to


---------67:54----------
each other


---------67:56----------
and relationships are based on like


---------67:58----------
shared experiences


---------68:01----------
and when i think about someone who


---------68:04----------
doesn't share like who has an experience


---------68:07----------
of child


---------68:08----------
rearing and and has a sun that other


---------68:11----------
people haven't seen what that sun is


---------68:13----------
like


---------68:13----------
i can imagine that it's difficult for


---------68:15----------
you all to have


---------68:17----------
a shared experience of what it's like


---------68:19----------
what what carson is like


---------68:21----------
and when i think about a lack of shared


---------68:23----------
experience then i think about isolation


---------68:25----------
because shared is experience is what


---------68:27----------
connects us


---------68:30----------
what do you think yeah i see what you're


---------68:33----------
saying


---------68:34----------
um i guess to expand on that is you're


---------68:38----------
right uh we we don't have a common


---------68:41----------
experience with other


---------68:43----------
family friends in in that relationship


---------68:45----------
of a child


---------68:47----------
with special needs um


---------68:51----------
but yet on the other hand those family


---------68:53----------
friends that we do have


---------68:54----------
we do have a lot of other things in


---------68:56----------
common sure


---------68:58----------
and uh socialize together of course


---------69:02----------
uh weekend ski trips together for


---------69:03----------
example in which carson participates


---------69:06----------
but on that one realm of


---------69:09----------
special needs here or a child behavior


---------69:12----------
they can't fully relate to it


---------69:16----------
and how do you feel if they


---------69:19----------
do understand if they see it


---------69:25----------
it's a good feeling that there is a


---------69:28----------
common understanding


---------69:29----------
and they can appreciate what we go


---------69:31----------
through


---------69:32----------
yeah what is that feeling


---------69:35----------
well satisfying comforting


---------69:38----------
yeah i see you smiling a little bit


---------69:43----------
yeah do you know what you're feeling


---------69:45----------
right now like as we started talking


---------69:46----------
about it i noticed that that feeling


---------69:48----------
almost came up for you


---------69:51----------
yes it's trying to get to uh describing


---------69:54----------
where where you're leading me to trying


---------69:56----------
to help find the words to


---------69:58----------
describe it yeah what so what what are


---------70:01----------
you feeling


---------70:02----------
do you know it's the


---------70:06----------
understanding and the relationship


---------70:08----------
between people


---------70:09----------
yeah so can i toss out a word


---------70:13----------
connect it right you feel connected


---------70:19----------
and how how does it feel like because


---------70:21----------
like that feels good right so


---------70:23----------
so what what i'm hearing from you it's


---------70:24----------
strange right because you would


---------70:26----------
think for a moment let's be


---------70:27----------
non-judgmental okay dave so you would


---------70:30----------
think for a moment that


---------70:31----------
your family friends seeing one of


---------70:33----------
carson's meltdowns would be like a bad


---------70:35----------
thing


---------70:38----------
on paper it looks like a bad thing and


---------70:40----------
in a sense it is a bad thing


---------70:42----------
but i think there's something really


---------70:43----------
important here which is that


---------70:45----------
i get the sense that you and your family


---------70:47----------
are sort of like


---------70:50----------
fighting this like very isolated war


---------70:54----------
and every day is a struggle and and


---------70:57----------
carson's fighting with you guys too like


---------70:59----------
i don't think he's the enemy i think


---------71:01----------
he's on your team


---------71:02----------
and what you guys are fighting against


---------71:04----------
is carson's autism


---------71:06----------
and covet and and i think your brother


---------71:09----------
i mean your son put it beautifully that


---------71:12----------
he kind of thinks about carson as a


---------71:13----------
normal person


---------71:14----------
who's trapped in an autistic mind


---------71:18----------
what do you think about that i agree


---------71:21----------
and and sometimes it can feel


---------71:24----------
very very tiring and exhausting and


---------71:28----------
stressful


---------71:29----------
to fight what i imagine may sometimes


---------71:32----------
feel like you to be an


---------71:33----------
endless battle like do you think this is


---------71:36----------
a battle that you got a war that you


---------71:38----------
guys win


---------71:40----------
no i i don't look at it in that realm


---------71:45----------
it is something we have to learn


---------71:50----------
about him because we can't fix him


---------71:53----------
yet we have to


---------71:56----------
understand him and connect with him


---------72:00----------
and the way his mind processes


---------72:03----------
and how he deals


---------72:06----------
with his frustrations and challenges


---------72:10----------
and communications with us and it's a


---------72:13----------
daily


---------72:14----------
daily challenge and a daily lesson


---------72:16----------
learned


---------72:18----------
and it's it's trying


---------72:23----------
but that's the way my wife and i are is


---------72:26----------
we face challenges and we i see that on


---------72:30----------
and keep keep chugging away day at a


---------72:33----------
time


---------72:34----------
yeah you know he uh zach mentioned


---------72:35----------
something else to me was that which is


---------72:37----------
that carson


---------72:38----------
um when he was first diagnosed with


---------72:40----------
autism


---------72:41----------
you guys had been sort of given the


---------72:42----------
diagnosis that he's going to be


---------72:44----------
non-verbal


---------72:46----------
right and that he's apparently


---------72:49----------
overly verbal now which which i think is


---------72:52----------
actually like a huge testament to the


---------72:54----------
attitude that you and your wife take


---------72:57----------
which is that you know you face


---------72:58----------
challenges head on and and i'm telling


---------73:00----------
you i've seen


---------73:02----------
non-verbally diagnosed autistic people


---------73:04----------
who end up


---------73:05----------
non-verbal and i've also seen


---------73:08----------
families who do heroic things and and


---------73:11----------
defy all the odds and i've also seen


---------73:16----------
families who do heroic things and the


---------73:19----------
odds don't get divided


---------73:21----------
right we've been fortunate and


---------73:25----------
i do give credit to my wife because she


---------73:28----------
and


---------73:29----------
has endured it more than me because i've


---------73:30----------
been at work you know 18 hours a day and


---------73:32----------
she's been home


---------73:34----------
raising him but


---------73:39----------
we have treated him like a normal kid


---------73:41----------
with no disability


---------73:42----------
and inclusion is very important and i


---------73:46----------
think


---------73:46----------
because of that we we've had the


---------73:48----------
successes we've had


---------73:50----------
yeah how do you feel talking about this


---------73:53----------
stuff


---------73:57----------
it's it's great to talk about it it's a


---------73:59----------
great feeling uh


---------74:01----------
the um


---------74:04----------
even though we have the daily challenges


---------74:06----------
we have to reflect back on the progress


---------74:08----------
that we've made and how far he's come


---------74:10----------
and that for example like you mentioned


---------74:12----------
he's non-verbal and he's using sign


---------74:14----------
language we


---------74:15----------
taught sign language to him when he was


---------74:17----------
three years old


---------74:18----------
and uh wow cherry is now


---------74:22----------
fully verbal he's graduated from high


---------74:25----------
school


---------74:26----------
and um we've made great progress


---------74:30----------
he plays the piano he's a awesome skier


---------74:33----------
he's on


---------74:34----------
we're a coach in special olympics and so


---------74:37----------
he's made


---------74:37----------
great progress physically emotionally


---------74:40----------
and


---------74:41----------
intellectually as well but a lot of


---------74:44----------
credit goes to my wife


---------74:45----------
because she helped him get through high


---------74:47----------
school by tutoring at home


---------74:49----------
and building study sheets for him on the


---------74:51----------
very subject matters that he was taken


---------74:53----------
in high school


---------74:55----------
and uh it's it's been a team effort


---------75:00----------
a lot of investment and


---------75:03----------
we're reaping some of those rewards but


---------75:05----------
we still have a long ways to go though


---------75:07----------
independence independence is where we're


---------75:10----------
we're striving for that he can live on


---------75:11----------
his own


---------75:12----------
and hold uh hold down a job and um


---------75:16----------
be able to interact socially yeah we got


---------75:19----------
a ways to go


---------75:21----------
but that has come at a sacrifice too


---------75:24----------
with uh i think with what have you


---------75:25----------
sacrificed uh i think with zach it's


---------75:28----------
it sacrificed time with him because of


---------75:31----------
the interruptions and disturbances


---------75:33----------
uh due to carson's behavior and and uh


---------75:36----------
the challenges with him


---------75:38----------
uh and certainly other sacrifices you


---------75:40----------
know in the family as well


---------75:42----------
but um you know we're dealt our deck of


---------75:44----------
cards and we play our hand


---------75:46----------
and uh except we look back and look at


---------75:50----------
the great progress he's made


---------75:51----------
but it's been a lot of work getting


---------75:53----------
there


---------75:55----------
not complaining would it be okay if you


---------75:59----------
did


---------76:01----------
i think it'd be selfish you know um


---------76:05----------
this is our family what's selfish about


---------76:07----------
complaining


---------76:09----------
well complaining that my life pity on me


---------76:12----------
because of my family life with an


---------76:14----------
autistic son


---------76:16----------
but uh there's other great rewards that


---------76:19----------
others don't


---------76:20----------
don't experience and that's seeing a


---------76:22----------
child


---------76:23----------
that's disabled grow and become mature


---------76:26----------
and striving towards independence and


---------76:28----------
seeing the progress there's great


---------76:29----------
rewards and satisfaction in that


---------76:32----------
okay so dave i'm gonna toss something


---------76:35----------
out for you to think about okay


---------76:37----------
i understand where you're coming from in


---------76:39----------
terms of


---------76:41----------
not complaining and you know not


---------76:43----------
throwing yourself a pity party


---------76:46----------
and at the same time i think we're


---------76:48----------
running up against


---------76:50----------
some lost value and there's a difference


---------76:53----------
between


---------76:55----------
accepting that you have some negative


---------76:57----------
emotion


---------76:58----------
and throwing yourself a pity party


---------77:01----------
as bizarre as the sounds i think that


---------77:03----------
you


---------77:04----------
[Music]


---------77:06----------
are entitled if you feel like it to


---------77:09----------
complain


---------77:12----------
what do you think about that


---------77:17----------
i can understand that and i'll be honest


---------77:20----------
my wife and i


---------77:21----------
have complained to each other good and


---------77:25----------
it's good and healthy to talk about that


---------77:30----------
and


---------77:33----------
myself i'm more independent


---------77:38----------
prefer to do my own problem solving


---------77:43----------
and resolve things myself


---------77:46----------
and not have to rely on others where did


---------77:48----------
you find that


---------77:51----------
good question i don't know if i think


---------77:54----------
it's just i'm wired that way


---------77:56----------
how do people get wired dna


---------77:59----------
genetics probably from my parents


---------78:03----------
can you tell us my wife and i again


---------78:06----------
we're kind of


---------78:07----------
wired in the same fashion is we hunker


---------78:09----------
down and get her done


---------78:11----------
and uh yeah we can um


---------78:15----------
talk about it ourselves console each


---------78:18----------
other


---------78:19----------
and and if you want to say complain


---------78:22----------
but yet we look back and we see uh


---------78:26----------
how grateful we are in the gratitude and


---------78:30----------
how rewarding has been working with our


---------78:33----------
son but yet it's been very difficult at


---------78:35----------
the same time


---------78:36----------
yeah i think that complain is a tricky


---------78:39----------
word because it implies


---------78:41----------
i can't imagine complaining and


---------78:43----------
gratitude coexisting


---------78:46----------
but the way that you're kind of talking


---------78:48----------
about it i i do think that there's been


---------78:51----------
sorrow and joy triumph and failure


---------78:56----------
you know when i really hear about it i


---------78:59----------
think that there's been negative and


---------79:00----------
positive


---------79:02----------
um and i i do i would encourage you to


---------79:05----------
you know i'm actually happy that you you


---------79:07----------
complained to your wife i think that's


---------79:09----------
healthy for you i think it's healthy to


---------79:10----------
acknowledge that


---------79:11----------
things are hard for us sometimes and it


---------79:13----------
doesn't make us weak


---------79:14----------
what do you think yeah i agree it's


---------79:17----------
healthy


---------79:18----------
it's uh it's been consoling


---------79:21----------
it's therapeutic


---------79:25----------
even talking with friends we've we've


---------79:28----------
talked with friends before too that did


---------79:29----------
do understand carson and


---------79:31----------
they sympathize with this encourage us


---------79:33----------
and then they're also


---------79:38----------
very very encouraging as well


---------79:41----------
so can you tell us a little bit about


---------79:43----------
your upbringing


---------79:46----------
sure i uh


---------79:50----------
grew up in southern california was uh


---------79:55----------
involved in high school sports and in


---------79:58----------
band


---------79:59----------
uh went to college in southern


---------80:01----------
california


---------80:03----------
and then i was on a rotc scholarship


---------80:06----------
wow and so graduating from college then


---------80:08----------
i went right into the air force


---------80:10----------
i was commissioned within the air force


---------80:12----------
i had a variety of space operations


---------80:15----------
jobs and system acquisition for space


---------80:17----------
systems


---------80:19----------
and then uh spent 27 years in the air


---------80:21----------
force retired


---------80:23----------
13 years ago been working for a defense


---------80:25----------
contractor


---------80:26----------
ever since uh married my wife when i was


---------80:30----------
a little more senior


---------80:32----------
36 year old 36 years old and


---------80:35----------
um she had uh one son


---------80:38----------
from a prior marriage and then we had


---------80:41----------
zach and carson


---------80:43----------
and we've been married 27 years wow


---------80:47----------
so hey can i ask you a couple questions


---------80:49----------
they may be a little bit personal you're


---------80:51----------
allowed to not answer them


---------80:53----------
sure um i i appreciate the hesitation


---------80:56----------
with your answer there


---------80:58----------
but so let me ask you something like uh


---------81:00----------
you know


---------81:01----------
what about her what like so i think


---------81:03----------
about a 36 year old guy


---------81:05----------
who's unmarried and so i i sometimes


---------81:08----------
think that it takes a special kind of


---------81:09----------
woman


---------81:10----------
to you know get you to settle down


---------81:15----------
can you tell us a little bit about what


---------81:17----------
your experience with meeting your wife


---------81:18----------
was like and how you guys decided to get


---------81:20----------
married


---------81:22----------
sure um you're right she's a special


---------81:25----------
woman


---------81:26----------
i married up


---------81:29----------
and uh we had


---------81:32----------
i think a lot in common in uh


---------81:36----------
the career field we were in i was in the


---------81:38----------
air force she was a civilian


---------81:40----------
defense contract or excuse me a defense


---------81:42----------
employee


---------81:44----------
uh we had the same ambitions for his


---------81:47----------
family


---------81:48----------
uh same likes and dislikes in the way of


---------81:51----------
hobbies and sports and we kind of had


---------81:55----------
the same drive


---------81:56----------
too i think we're kind of wired similar


---------81:58----------
as i mentioned before we


---------82:00----------
we face challenges head on and we like


---------82:01----------
working challenges


---------82:03----------
and uh and being fulfilled with


---------82:06----------
success and the outcome of uh of


---------82:09----------
challenges


---------82:10----------
and uh we had just a lot in common


---------82:14----------
and uh we can communicate we could talk


---------82:17----------
she was


---------82:18----------
she's was my best friend then and she


---------82:20----------
still is


---------82:24----------
you say you're wired similarly um


---------82:28----------
you mean like in what way what about


---------82:30----------
y'all is similar in terms of your wiring


---------82:34----------
or drive um


---------82:40----------
follow through to completion


---------82:44----------
i'll say service


---------82:47----------
serving others so that they are


---------82:50----------
satisfied which


---------82:52----------
is sometimes challenging obviously but


---------82:54----------
um


---------82:55----------
concerned about always meeting the needs


---------82:58----------
of others


---------82:59----------
in our in our careers even what she does


---------83:01----------
now


---------83:02----------
she's an interior designer uh always uh


---------83:07----------
wanting to satisfy the customer the


---------83:10----------
client


---------83:11----------
sounds like she really puts other people


---------83:13----------
ahead of herself


---------83:15----------
yes definitely you sound like you value


---------83:20----------
her a lot


---------83:23----------
oh yeah


---------83:26----------
yeah like that she's she's my best


---------83:27----------
friend so i can lean on her with


---------83:29----------
anything


---------83:31----------
does she lean on you yes


---------83:37----------
um emotionally and she can come talk to


---------83:40----------
me


---------83:40----------
uh physically she's out helping me with


---------83:43----------
projects working on the house


---------83:46----------
um essentially any other project


---------83:50----------
we do things together and uh we're a


---------83:52----------
good team


---------83:54----------
and uh she has talents like in


---------83:58----------
communication she's better at


---------83:59----------
communicating than i am you know i'm


---------84:02----------
i'm an engineer engineers typically


---------84:04----------
don't know how to communicate very well


---------84:06----------
and i'm a good example of that


---------84:07----------
and she's uh very complimentary in that


---------84:10----------
realm when


---------84:11----------
if i have to write something or have to


---------84:13----------
uh articulate something she's very good


---------84:15----------
at helping in crafting


---------84:17----------
the right choices of words


---------84:21----------
you know oddly enough dave i don't know


---------84:23----------
that i would agree with you that


---------84:24----------
engineers are not good at communicating


---------84:27----------
nor would i call you a not good


---------84:29----------
communicator


---------84:32----------
um can i tell you what i see


---------84:37----------
sure i don't see a problem with


---------84:41----------
communication i see


---------84:42----------
a lack of vocabulary


---------84:47----------
fair fair assessment i i don't think


---------84:50----------
it's an issue of talent i think it's an


---------84:52----------
issue of


---------84:52----------
experience you know i think you're i


---------84:55----------
think if we gave you the words


---------84:58----------
you'd be able to use them very very well


---------85:00----------
i think you're just somewhat unfamiliar


---------85:02----------
with the words


---------85:03----------
because i think you're somewhat


---------85:04----------
unfamiliar with your internal


---------85:06----------
environment


---------85:08----------
which is a little bit judgmental to say


---------85:10----------
but i'm just you know you've been very


---------85:11----------
authentic with me and i hope it's okay


---------85:13----------
that i'd be transparent with you


---------85:14----------
and i'll explain what i mean by that


---------85:17----------
what do you think about that


---------85:20----------
you're right uh english and


---------85:23----------
communication has not been my strong


---------85:25----------
suit


---------85:26----------
nor a big interest


---------85:29----------
when it came to academics or school and


---------85:31----------
it has been


---------85:34----------
one of the weaker talents of mine


---------85:37----------
or skill sets i preferred more the math


---------85:41----------
technical side sure that's where that's


---------85:43----------
what i enjoy


---------85:45----------
uh never have been one that really


---------85:47----------
enjoys writing novels or


---------85:49----------
stories or or anything like that so my


---------85:52----------
wife is a little more talented in that


---------85:54----------
that realm and then so we balance each


---------85:56----------
other out


---------85:57----------
yeah so so if i can offer something kind


---------85:59----------
of relating to that so i think it's


---------86:01----------
interesting because


---------86:02----------
understanding the self in the west


---------86:06----------
has become related to like poetry


---------86:10----------
right it's like understanding the self


---------86:12----------
and understanding emotions is like


---------86:14----------
therapy and poetry and it's all these


---------86:15----------
like nebulous


---------86:17----------
like not really based in any real system


---------86:20----------
kind of things does that make sense


---------86:23----------
i mean i i say this as a psychiatrist


---------86:25----------
like i've just noticed this


---------86:27----------
so there's an interesting study that was


---------86:28----------
done that if you look at couples


---------86:30----------
counseling


---------86:31----------
men actually are reluctant to engage in


---------86:33----------
couples counseling


---------86:34----------
because they feel disadvantaged because


---------86:37----------
it's a territory that they don't know


---------86:39----------
how to play that game


---------86:41----------
what do you think about that


---------86:44----------
i don't know hadn't thought of that


---------86:46----------
before


---------86:48----------
yeah it's kind of interesting didn't


---------86:50----------
know it was studying like that


---------86:52----------
yeah it would you feel


---------86:55----------
uncomfortable doing something like


---------86:57----------
family counseling or couples counseling


---------87:00----------
no why not


---------87:06----------
because there's value in it


---------87:10----------
in making the family life better


---------87:14----------
okay so i completely agree that you


---------87:16----------
would be willing to do it and that you


---------87:17----------
would be gung-ho


---------87:19----------
what i'm asking you is would you feel


---------87:22----------
uncomfortable


---------87:24----------
sure right so like this is i think


---------87:27----------
something dave that i would really


---------87:29----------
encourage you to tunnel down and and


---------87:31----------
because i noticed that


---------87:32----------
you can feel a particular way and you're


---------87:34----------
very good at actually mastering your


---------87:36----------
feelings


---------87:37----------
but just because you can control your


---------87:39----------
discomfort or compensate for it


---------87:42----------
doesn't mean that the discomfort isn't


---------87:44----------
there


---------87:46----------
does that make sense yeah do you think


---------87:49----------
there's


---------87:50----------
value in understanding that the


---------87:53----------
discomfort is there and where it comes


---------87:55----------
from


---------87:56----------
yes why


---------88:01----------
in order to you have to understand the


---------88:04----------
root


---------88:05----------
of that discomfort before you can do any


---------88:07----------
sort of


---------88:08----------
correction okay


---------88:11----------
so can we play with live ammo


---------88:15----------
with that principle can i ask you a


---------88:17----------
question that may be a little bit


---------88:20----------
evoke some emotion


---------88:23----------
sure are you feeling uncomfortable


---------88:27----------
as i already up what are the questions


---------88:30----------
gonna be


---------88:30----------
i know right so so let's so we're


---------88:32----------
already playing with live ammo that was


---------88:34----------
the question


---------88:35----------
that was it there's another one but so


---------88:38----------
like when i asked that question now how


---------88:40----------
do you feel close your eyes


---------88:44----------
what do you feel in your body now that i


---------88:46----------
put you on the spot


---------88:49----------
a little discomfort where


---------88:54----------
um you're getting personal


---------88:57----------
yeah there's viewers online here yep so


---------89:00----------
when someone


---------89:01----------
engages you personally what do you feel


---------89:06----------
protective and what are you protecting


---------89:11----------
uh i guess weaknesses


---------89:15----------
okay and which weaknesses are you


---------89:18----------
protecting


---------89:20----------
particular ones


---------89:25----------
i think it's that i tend to be more


---------89:28----------
private so now i'm opening the door and


---------89:32----------
revealing


---------89:34----------
more so of who i am


---------89:38----------
in inside versus what is the appearance


---------89:41----------
on the outside


---------89:42----------
okay so


---------89:47----------
we can talk about that's a topic i think


---------89:50----------
for a different day about


---------89:51----------
you know thinking about i would


---------89:52----------
encourage you to think about you know is


---------89:54----------
it okay for other people to see what's


---------89:56----------
on the inside


---------89:57----------
because i imagine that you were taught


---------89:59----------
that the answer to that question is no


---------90:02----------
i think you have your own independent


---------90:03----------
answers


---------90:05----------
but i would hypothesize that you were


---------90:06----------
conditioned to not


---------90:08----------
show people and i would also hypothesize


---------90:10----------
that that has something to do with the


---------90:12----------
way that your parents were


---------90:14----------
what do you think about that i think


---------90:17----------
it's a little both


---------90:19----------
my parents i think


---------90:22----------
were um between this themselves


---------90:27----------
were open


---------90:30----------
outside of the household they'll say not


---------90:33----------
so much they're more


---------90:35----------
private um myself


---------90:39----------
some of that some of myself


---------90:42----------
is acquired from my upbringing


---------90:45----------
and some of it is by on personal


---------90:47----------
experience


---------90:49----------
in that if i have uh


---------90:52----------
opened up um


---------90:54----------
[Music]


---------90:56----------
i've been burned so


---------90:59----------
again going back to protection


---------91:02----------
and um it's


---------91:06----------
it's a protection i guess on how much


---------91:09----------
you reveal


---------91:11----------
or what you review okay


---------91:15----------
okay and i'll say there's value in doing


---------91:18----------
that


---------91:18----------
personally for me being able to trust


---------91:21----------
someone and to communicate


---------91:22----------
uh what's what's going on inside but


---------91:25----------
then also


---------91:26----------
i think there's value if somebody can


---------91:28----------
benefit from that or benefit from my


---------91:30----------
experience


---------91:33----------
maybe however private it might be


---------91:35----------
there's value in that to help someone


---------91:37----------
else out


---------91:37----------
sure so um dave i


---------91:41----------
i want to maybe ask you just a couple


---------91:43----------
more questions and then we can get you


---------91:44----------
and zach


---------91:45----------
on together is that okay sure so


---------91:48----------
um you mentioned earlier uh and i


---------91:52----------
noticed a little bit of negative emotion


---------91:54----------
around this that you know you you guys


---------91:57----------
have come really a long way with carson


---------91:59----------
but that sometimes at the cost


---------92:01----------
of zach you use the word sacrifice


---------92:05----------
can you help me understand that a little


---------92:07----------
bit better


---------92:11----------
when carson would have his meltdowns


---------92:14----------
when he was young and


---------92:15----------
even now um obviously it's a major


---------92:19----------
distraction


---------92:20----------
an interruption


---------92:23----------
and especially if there's already


---------92:26----------
some sort of interaction with zach


---------92:31----------
and there's a rhythm going and out of


---------92:34----------
the blue you get a


---------92:35----------
interruption from carson it


---------92:38----------
unfortunately takes time away from zach


---------92:42----------
and i think that has been the case


---------92:46----------
at with him growing up that carson is


---------92:49----------
always


---------92:51----------
distracted and uh


---------92:55----------
interfered with the relationship


---------92:57----------
development with zach


---------92:59----------
it's just my observation how do you feel


---------93:02----------
about that


---------93:14----------
um it's lost time


---------93:23----------
it's lost time that can never get back


---------93:27----------
and those uh


---------93:34----------
those younger years that i i think


---------93:38----------
of from 4 to 10 somewhere there where


---------93:41----------
they start to become independent


---------93:44----------
start to develop their own character and


---------93:46----------
who they're going to be those are


---------93:50----------
precious years


---------93:51----------
they go so stinking fast


---------93:57----------
and can't get back the lost time


---------94:01----------
and uh


---------94:05----------
it hurts


---------94:08----------
what hurts about it


---------94:12----------
that i think that could have


---------94:17----------
uh jeopardize the relationship that we


---------94:19----------
maybe have today


---------94:21----------
and um


---------94:24----------
if he was in need for any kind of


---------94:27----------
emotional support he couldn't get it


---------94:28----------
because


---------94:29----------
there's a distraction going on with


---------94:30----------
carson


---------94:32----------
and there is some guilt there


---------94:39----------
and


---------94:42----------
you know missed out on that opportunity


---------94:45----------
to really bond


---------94:46----------
in those early years like that because


---------94:49----------
they're precious moments and you realize


---------94:51----------
that obviously as you get older


---------94:53----------
and you look back those are just


---------94:56----------
precious years


---------94:58----------
that you and you can't get those any


---------95:00----------
other way


---------95:01----------
only only with a a parent-child


---------95:04----------
relationship like that you can't get


---------95:05----------
that kind of uh


---------95:07----------
fulfillment any other way


---------95:11----------
and are you talking about fulfillment


---------95:13----------
for you or fulfillment for zach


---------95:16----------
both


---------95:19----------
have you guys ever talked about this


---------95:25----------
very lightly that i recall


---------95:30----------
once okay


---------95:33----------
and um


---------95:38----------
i think it's possible that


---------95:41----------
either of us really didn't know how to


---------95:43----------
introduce it or how to even


---------95:44----------
start that discussion


---------95:48----------
um thank you for sharing that i can see


---------95:51----------
that it was emotional for you it was


---------95:53----------
emotional for me too


---------95:56----------
um how do you feel about


---------95:59----------
you know do you feel okay right now can


---------96:02----------
we keep talking


---------96:04----------
sure i'm good um


---------96:07----------
so how's your relationship with zach now


---------96:13----------
sounds like a good idea i think i'm


---------96:14----------
going to hydrate too yeah


---------96:17----------
um


---------96:22----------
non non-combative not confrontational


---------96:26----------
and pretty much we only see each other


---------96:31----------
since kovid that i've been working at


---------96:33----------
home might see him in the morning


---------96:36----------
in the kitchen when i take a break and


---------96:39----------
then see them at dinner


---------96:41----------
and we converse and talk pretty much


---------96:44----------
whatever's going on in the news


---------96:47----------
and it's very brief and that's it


---------96:50----------
and most of this time is in the basement


---------96:53----------
uh in his room uh assuming


---------96:57----------
uh gaming um


---------97:02----------
and that's really the extent of it okay


---------97:06----------
how do you feel about that


---------97:11----------
again it goes back to the relationship


---------97:13----------
uh i don't


---------97:14----------
think that's healthy


---------97:18----------
we're both missing out on time


---------97:21----------
time is ticking away and it's a valuable


---------97:24----------
opportunity


---------97:25----------
that we're all in the same household


---------97:28----------
and he's back from school that we could


---------97:32----------
attempt to bond


---------97:38----------
establish a friendship


---------97:42----------
and help even as


---------97:45----------
a him part of the team helping with


---------97:47----------
carson as well


---------97:49----------
do you feel like he doesn't help with


---------97:51----------
carson


---------97:55----------
he's attempted he's tried i think


---------97:59----------
um it's a it's a bit difficult for him i


---------98:02----------
think


---------98:03----------
uh emotionally i think also he may not


---------98:06----------
fully have the tool set the skill set of


---------98:09----------
how to


---------98:10----------
work with carson because he has been


---------98:13----------
away at school


---------98:14----------
essentially for five years


---------98:17----------
and uh it's a long time yeah


---------98:20----------
and the only time you saw him was when


---------98:21----------
he came home with you know holidays and


---------98:24----------
stuff like that and so it's very brief


---------98:27----------
and


---------98:27----------
he may not fully understand how carson


---------98:31----------
works or how he ticks now and


---------98:34----------
um how do you


---------98:38----------
how do you help him and i think one way


---------98:41----------
is


---------98:42----------
try to become a friend with carson try


---------98:44----------
to


---------98:45----------
understand um


---------98:49----------
what's going on in his mind what his


---------98:51----------
frustrations are


---------98:52----------
sure so dave i'm gonna


---------98:55----------
we're gonna get zach back in here in a


---------98:57----------
minute um because we've been talking for


---------98:59----------
a little while and i think this kind of


---------99:01----------
stuff can be kind of


---------99:02----------
energy intensive and i don't know that


---------99:05----------
you've got a whole lot of excess fuel to


---------99:06----------
burn


---------99:08----------
well i'm good okay


---------99:11----------
uh but my you know is it okay if i share


---------99:14----------
a couple of thoughts with you


---------99:16----------
sure so first thing is that i i don't


---------99:19----------
think that like


---------99:20----------
this is about carson yet so i know that


---------99:23----------
carson is a huge part of y'all's life


---------99:25----------
and


---------99:26----------
and you know dominates a lot of what


---------99:27----------
y'all spend your time


---------99:29----------
working on thinking on enjoying


---------99:32----------
um and my first thought is that


---------99:35----------
that at least between you and zach the


---------99:37----------
first thing that needs to happen is that


---------99:38----------
like you all need to form a relationship


---------99:41----------
independent of anyone else in your


---------99:43----------
family


---------99:44----------
right like like if i had to sum it up


---------99:47----------
you have to make up for lost time


---------99:49----------
right and so what do you think about


---------99:52----------
that


---------99:54----------
fully agree um


---------99:57----------
it's it's a little difficult right now


---------100:00----------
because


---------100:02----------
we're not communicating


---------100:05----------
to understand where he is right now


---------100:09----------
after returning from school


---------100:12----------
um obviously he's


---------100:16----------
funding relief through gaming


---------100:21----------
um there's certainly everybody has their


---------100:25----------
own way of dealing with stress and


---------100:27----------
and relief some you know maybe physical


---------100:29----------
exercise or whatever


---------100:31----------
but uh that tends to be his relief


---------100:35----------
and um i think


---------100:39----------
we we just want to make sure that we


---------100:41----------
don't


---------100:43----------
push him too hard because we


---------100:47----------
we don't fully understand what he's


---------100:48----------
going through emotionally


---------100:51----------
and mentally and uh so it's


---------100:54----------
kind of kid gloves and trying to


---------100:57----------
understand


---------100:58----------
would like to understand the emotions


---------101:01----------
what he's going through


---------101:03----------
and what he is thinking about for the


---------101:06----------
way ahead


---------101:07----------
okay so


---------101:11----------
dave a couple of thoughts the first


---------101:13----------
thing is


---------101:14----------
you know i want to respect your privacy


---------101:18----------
especially as you've gotten burned


---------101:20----------
before so we have an option


---------101:22----------
a couple of options one is that you know


---------101:24----------
we can just get zach back in here


---------101:26----------
we can sort of kind of sum up it'll be


---------101:29----------
kind of


---------101:29----------
kid gloves i'll hear a couple of general


---------101:32----------
thoughts


---------101:33----------
and then leave the two of you to start


---------101:35----------
that discussion


---------101:36----------
or whatever kind of on your own in


---------101:38----------
private


---------101:40----------
okay um upsides of that it's safe


---------101:44----------
downsides of that you may quickly fall


---------101:47----------
into a pattern where it's hard to get


---------101:49----------
over that activation energy of having


---------101:51----------
those kinds of conversations


---------101:53----------
option two is that we can think about


---------101:57----------
starting that conversation like now


---------102:01----------
um and problems with that is that


---------102:04----------
sometimes it could get emotional


---------102:06----------
it could feel voyeuristic because people


---------102:08----------
are


---------102:09----------
watching and i don't want to pressure


---------102:11----------
you into you know anything that you


---------102:12----------
don't feel comfortable with


---------102:14----------
upside is that i think that you've


---------102:16----------
you've said a couple of things to me


---------102:18----------
today that while they're hot and fresh


---------102:21----------
in your mind would be very valuable for


---------102:23----------
zach to hear


---------102:26----------
so i leave it up to you we're gonna go


---------102:28----------
you want to have the conversation with


---------102:30----------
him now


---------102:31----------
or do you want to just have a general


---------102:32----------
kind of sum up


---------102:35----------
i would like to get his input but


---------102:39----------
uh i think option one the general sum up


---------102:42----------
and then he and i embark on


---------102:45----------
a private conversation okay can i share


---------102:49----------
with you one or two things that i think


---------102:51----------
it's important for


---------102:52----------
you to say to him sure


---------102:56----------
um at the top of the list is i think


---------102:58----------
like you shared about


---------102:59----------
lost time i think that's something that


---------103:01----------
zach needs to hear from you


---------103:05----------
good um does that make sense to you


---------103:09----------
yes what makes sense about that


---------103:13----------
he understands where i'm coming from and


---------103:16----------
and sort of the reason to try to


---------103:20----------
reestablish that relationship


---------103:24----------
i think it's even more it's run simpler


---------103:26----------
than that


---------103:27----------
i think he needs to understand that the


---------103:30----------
fact that y'all lost


---------103:31----------
time hurts you


---------103:36----------
what do you think about that


---------103:40----------
yes he he needs to understand that


---------103:44----------
and and i think this is the tricky thing


---------103:45----------
right is like i don't think


---------103:47----------
anyone would say that you did anything


---------103:50----------
wrong


---------103:53----------
and that's important for you to


---------103:54----------
understand and that's important for him


---------103:56----------
to understand


---------103:57----------
and yet this kind of goes back to like


---------103:59----------
what is the value of negativity if it


---------104:02----------
leads to like you know


---------104:04----------
it's just i think he needs to see


---------104:07----------
that you recognize that y'all were dealt


---------104:11----------
a bad hand


---------104:12----------
because eight-year-old zach


---------104:13----------
nine-year-old zack and ten-year-old zach


---------104:15----------
didn't couldn't understand that


---------104:17----------
but now he's a grown he's a grown man


---------104:21----------
and i think that he also feels the lack


---------104:24----------
of y'all's relationship


---------104:27----------
and i think the the way to really start


---------104:29----------
bridging that gap is like


---------104:31----------
to talk about what you know what what it


---------104:34----------
was like


---------104:36----------
and and i i don't know and here's the


---------104:38----------
other last thing that i'll tell you dave


---------104:40----------
is that i think you


---------104:42----------
uh do an excellent job of trying to


---------104:44----------
understand


---------104:45----------
everything outside of yourself so even


---------104:48----------
when you talk about zach and you think


---------104:49----------
about your interactions with him you say


---------104:51----------
i need to understand him better the


---------104:53----------
other thing that i would encourage you


---------104:55----------
to do


---------104:56----------
is let other people understand you


---------104:59----------
you don't always have to be the


---------105:00----------
understander


---------105:03----------
and let zach let him see who you are


---------105:09----------
because it i i it seems to me like


---------105:12----------
you've raised


---------105:12----------
two amazing sons and you can start to


---------105:16----------
lean on them


---------105:17----------
too i know it sounds weird


---------105:20----------
but you know i i think the conversation


---------105:23----------
isn't just about understanding him in a


---------105:25----------
weird way like you almost have to model


---------105:27----------
opening up because he's more likely to


---------105:30----------
open up if you open up


---------105:33----------
if somebody's got the first move


---------105:37----------
and i i don't i don't know


---------105:42----------
and here's why i think i don't know that


---------105:45----------
it should be you


---------105:47----------
but the reason that i am defaulting to


---------105:49----------
you making the first move


---------105:51----------
is because out of all of the


---------105:54----------
conversations i've had with him and you


---------105:57----------
you're the one


---------105:58----------
who i think has said the words that are


---------106:00----------
the most important to say


---------106:03----------
and that's why i think you should say


---------106:05----------
them it's not about first it's just


---------106:07----------
you have the most important thing to say


---------106:11----------
yeah thoughts questions


---------106:17----------
so the first one you mentioned was lost


---------106:20----------
time


---------106:21----------
was there a second nope that i missed


---------106:24----------
okay


---------106:25----------
i mean i think that's that's a great


---------106:26----------
place to start right and thinking about


---------106:28----------
y'all's relationship


---------106:30----------
and and what that kind of looks like and


---------106:33----------
feels like to you guys now


---------106:34----------
i think the second point for you is that


---------106:37----------
i think understanding what you're


---------106:39----------
feeling


---------106:40----------
and also communicating that to zach


---------106:42----------
could be healthy for both of you


---------106:45----------
and i think will pave the way for him to


---------106:47----------
do the same


---------106:49----------
third thing is anyway the rest we can


---------106:51----------
talk about together you feel


---------106:52----------
okay grabbing him yeah okay we'll go get


---------107:02----------
yep i know everybody wants them to talk


---------107:03----------
on stream


---------107:05----------
but that's for us right that's not for


---------107:08----------
them


---------107:13----------
so i don't doubt that that would get


---------107:15----------
clipped and shipped


---------107:17----------
but that's not what we're here for


---------107:26----------
oh all right


---------107:36----------
right can we get both the perfect okay


---------107:40----------
so zack yeah i talked to your dad for a


---------107:43----------
little bit longer than i talked to you


---------107:46----------
did you i think so not sure


---------107:50----------
um what were you concerned at all about


---------107:53----------
what we were talking about or were you


---------107:54----------
thinking about it at all


---------107:56----------
well i was talking to my mom about it


---------107:57----------
but we ended up getting sidetracked from


---------107:59----------
other discussions


---------108:00----------
okay um zach do you want to summarize


---------108:04----------
uh kind of our conversation for your dad


---------108:06----------
and then we'll have your dad kind of


---------108:08----------
summarize


---------108:09----------
what we talked about how does that sound


---------108:11----------
start


---------108:12----------
sure so go for it


---------108:16----------
oh yeah i thought you said you're okay


---------108:18----------
nope you're gonna have to


---------108:21----------
just let me think here um


---------108:25----------
uh we kind of all over the place aren't


---------108:27----------
we


---------108:28----------
we started by talking about the a


---------108:30----------
conversation that i had with mom


---------108:32----------
earlier was this was like a half a week


---------108:34----------
ago um


---------108:36----------
which was about uh like the situation


---------108:39----------
with carson


---------108:40----------
um and his autism and


---------108:43----------
how they're infecting um


---------108:48----------
stuff like a lot of times spent on


---------108:52----------
the situation with the window cleaners


---------108:55----------
and so like


---------108:56----------
how she convey to me her perspective of


---------108:59----------
that situation


---------109:00----------
and what my perspective that situation


---------109:02----------
was as well


---------109:04----------
and how like there was a whole bunch of


---------109:06----------
crazy stuff going on


---------109:08----------
you know and how carson


---------109:09----------
[Music]


---------109:11----------
was obviously difficult and whatnot but


---------109:12----------
then also how you


---------109:14----------
play into that and how mom plays into


---------109:16----------
that and how um


---------109:19----------
everyone just sort of like beats on each


---------109:21----------
other right


---------109:24----------
like carson will have his pattern and


---------109:26----------
then


---------109:27----------
you will have your set rules or whatever


---------109:30----------
that you have to follow and then mom


---------109:31----------
will try to enforce those but then


---------109:33----------
carson will fight get back against that


---------109:35----------
and then other people fight each other


---------109:36----------
and that i'm just trying to like sit on


---------109:38----------
the sidelines and not get involved and


---------109:39----------
like hype myself right


---------109:41----------
because i don't want to be part of any


---------109:42----------
of that um


---------109:46----------
what else did we talk about


---------109:52----------
i don't remember i can i can kind of


---------109:54----------
jump in


---------109:55----------
um thanks thanks for sharing that zach


---------109:57----------
so a couple of other things


---------109:58----------
uh dave that we talked about are a


---------110:01----------
little bit about y'all's


---------110:02----------
interpersonal interactions and um


---------110:06----------
zach has the impression that you're


---------110:08----------
quite organized and quite structured


---------110:11----------
and i'd actually hypothesized to zach


---------110:14----------
that maybe if you


---------110:15----------
feel uncomfortable or anxious or


---------110:17----------
stressed


---------110:18----------
that the way that you resp the way that


---------110:20----------
you manage that stress


---------110:22----------
is by import imposing order around you


---------110:26----------
because that may help you you know like


---------110:28----------
the more chaotic things become the more


---------110:30----------
you kind of double down on imposing


---------110:31----------
order and structure


---------110:33----------
um we


---------110:37----------
uh also talked a little bit about


---------110:39----------
y'all's relationship


---------110:41----------
and and zach mentioned to me that you


---------110:44----------
know he feels a little bit closer


---------110:45----------
to your wife and that they're able to


---------110:48----------
talk a little bit more freely


---------110:50----------
um and that he does want to be able to


---------110:53----------
kind of talk to you maybe


---------110:55----------
somewhat in the same way i mean i think


---------110:56----------
he acknowledges that you all are


---------110:58----------
different and that you


---------110:59----------
don't have to have the same relationship


---------111:01----------
um but that


---------111:03----------
communicating and better understanding


---------111:04----------
between the two of you is actually


---------111:06----------
really important


---------111:07----------
we spent a fair amount of time talking


---------111:09----------
about carson


---------111:11----------
um you know y'all's family situation uh


---------111:14----------
the challenges that y'all face


---------111:16----------
um and and kind of gave me a lot of


---------111:19----------
background


---------111:21----------
shared a couple of stories but i think


---------111:22----------
that basically oh the other thing


---------111:25----------
interesting thing that he said is that


---------111:26----------
he actually knows very little about like


---------111:28----------
what your life growing up was like and


---------111:31----------
and he actually doesn't know too much


---------111:33----------
about


---------111:33----------
you um and maybe he was a little bit


---------111:36----------
curious about that


---------111:38----------
sometimes uh it it seems like um


---------111:42----------
either he or your wife may feel like


---------111:44----------
they they're kind of walking on


---------111:45----------
eggshells around you


---------111:47----------
that they're afraid that they may upset


---------111:49----------
you if they say or do the wrong thing


---------111:51----------
um and i'm just sharing this stuff with


---------111:53----------
you not to kind of put you on the spot


---------111:55----------
or try to get you to defend yourself or


---------111:57----------
anything like that


---------111:58----------
i don't think it's like either or i


---------111:59----------
don't think someone is right or someone


---------112:01----------
is wrong


---------112:02----------
i'm just sharing with you what their


---------112:03----------
pers what his perception is


---------112:05----------
and how he feels


---------112:09----------
any thoughts questions responses


---------112:13----------
oh i understand uh i've heard


---------112:17----------
those comments before


---------112:20----------
and um i do remember


---------112:24----------
zach one time expressing that he didn't


---------112:27----------
know much about me or my childhood


---------112:31----------
that's fair um


---------112:35----------
yet on the other hand


---------112:39----------
for example i think the time that


---------112:40----------
actually occurred was we were sitting


---------112:42----------
around a campfire


---------112:44----------
and that would have been an opportune


---------112:46----------
time


---------112:48----------
to ask questions


---------112:51----------
try to understand what was your


---------112:54----------
childhood like


---------112:58----------
did i do growing up and the


---------113:03----------
the fun times the challenging times


---------113:06----------
and experiences sure sure so


---------113:10----------
uh it's a little bit of both i didn't


---------113:13----------
divulge to him


---------113:15----------
nor did he inquire sure so what i'm


---------113:18----------
hearing from you is that it's a two-way


---------113:20----------
street


---------113:21----------
yes absolutely that's fair


---------113:24----------
all right sure um


---------113:27----------
uh dave do you want to sum up uh or or


---------113:30----------
kind of


---------113:31----------
share what we talked about with zach


---------113:35----------
yeah it seemed to pretty quickly


---------113:39----------
head down to carson


---------113:43----------
in the center of the discussion pretty


---------113:45----------
much


---------113:47----------
and the family dynamics and uh his uh


---------113:51----------
impact on the family and


---------113:55----------
how that i think


---------113:58----------
impacted our relationship when you were


---------114:00----------
younger


---------114:01----------
somewhere around that four to ten year


---------114:04----------
period


---------114:05----------
where uh to me those are very precious


---------114:08----------
years


---------114:09----------
as you start to develop your character


---------114:11----------
and and your identity and who you're


---------114:13----------
going to be


---------114:14----------
and uh those are very precious years


---------114:18----------
in my view of establishing the


---------114:21----------
relationship


---------114:23----------
and bonding and


---------114:26----------
i sensed that carson was a distraction


---------114:29----------
during that time


---------114:31----------
where we could not


---------114:34----------
establish that relationship and do


---------114:37----------
things together


---------114:38----------
do the the boy stuff the manly stuff


---------114:42----------
and uh as a result that's


---------114:45----------
uh i think contributed to sort of the


---------114:48----------
relationship we have today where it's


---------114:50----------
not as


---------114:51----------
close as it should be


---------114:56----------
i saw you reacting


---------115:03----------
dave i thought that was going to be a


---------115:04----------
private conversation


---------115:07----------
oh the details


---------115:11----------
okay so if that's option two if we've


---------115:15----------
already opened the door


---------115:16----------
if you want to continue i mean i didn't


---------115:18----------
open any doors bro


---------115:26----------
i i was okay


---------115:30----------
no i didn't cut off i just stopped


---------115:31----------
talking okay


---------115:33----------
i just couldn't okay


---------115:36----------
so now i'm a little bit confused because


---------115:38----------
i don't know what to do um


---------115:40----------
so okay i guess we're talking about it


---------115:44----------
now


---------115:45----------
so zack um what did you hear from your


---------115:48----------
dad


---------115:51----------
i'm already blind okay


---------115:54----------
so think for a second what what did he


---------115:56----------
say sorry for derailing both y'all i was


---------115:58----------
caught off guard


---------116:00----------
yeah now i'm caught off guard um


---------116:04----------
so like first of all two-way street i


---------116:06----------
remember that


---------116:08----------
then he said that you guys started


---------116:10----------
talking about cars oh yeah


---------116:12----------
how like the the early years


---------116:15----------
are important or whatever for like


---------116:19----------
developing your identity and stuff which


---------116:20----------
is actually something that i kind of


---------116:21----------
disagree with


---------116:22----------
i think that even still now i'm kind of


---------116:24----------
struggling with my identity and whatnot


---------116:25----------
and that's something that you got your


---------116:27----------
whole life but that's a different


---------116:28----------
conversation


---------116:29----------
um yeah carson i don't know if he was


---------116:32----------
necessarily a distraction per se


---------116:35----------
um i just think that as a family we


---------116:37----------
struggled to


---------116:39----------
handle him we didn't know what we were


---------116:40----------
doing there was no guidebook how to have


---------116:43----------
an autistic child in your family and


---------116:45----------
not screw up family-week relationships


---------116:46----------
because of it right


---------116:48----------
it's gonna cause strains and it's hard


---------116:49----------
to know how to handle that and so i


---------116:51----------
think that


---------116:52----------
it wasn't it was it was just really hard


---------116:54----------
for us all to handle that we were all


---------116:55----------
spending so much time on him


---------116:57----------
that we couldn't spend time on each


---------116:58----------
other because we didn't know what we


---------116:59----------
were doing


---------117:00----------
yeah and then like i now remember when i


---------117:03----------
was talking to you how


---------117:04----------
i say that it was difficult for me to


---------117:07----------
connect with carson because


---------117:08----------
i mean again i didn't know what i was


---------117:09----------
doing um


---------117:11----------
i felt like i was just in general being


---------117:13----------
an [ __ ] to him because


---------117:15----------
so zach i'm gonna just interrupt you


---------117:17----------
yeah i apologize


---------117:19----------
so dave so i think zach


---------117:22----------
what did you hear how would you describe


---------117:25----------
what zach heard


---------117:33----------
um


---------117:33----------
[Music]


---------117:37----------
maybe missed the mark that it was lost


---------117:40----------
time


---------117:40----------
yep and he didn't miss the mark i think


---------117:43----------
you guys did what y'all do


---------117:45----------
which is you guys talk about situations


---------117:48----------
right so he understood that you were


---------117:50----------
saying that like


---------117:51----------
you know there's character development


---------117:52----------
because you don't say


---------117:55----------
you leave out y'all


---------117:58----------
y'all eat brisket oh yeah


---------118:02----------
so like you know when you slice into


---------118:05----------
brisket


---------118:06----------
and that juice is in the middle and it's


---------118:08----------
like when you get a well-cooked brisket


---------118:10----------
and it falls apart but it's like moist


---------118:11----------
and juicy


---------118:13----------
yeah you left out the juice dave


---------118:17----------
right you talk you gave him the


---------118:19----------
structure


---------118:21----------
but what you said just now is very


---------118:24----------
different from what you conveyed to me


---------118:26----------
does that make sense to you


---------118:30----------
the words are the same


---------118:33----------
right i guess i miss i understand okay


---------118:36----------
sorry


---------118:37----------
so like you talked about lost time but


---------118:40----------
when we were talking about it


---------118:42----------
what were you feeling


---------118:45----------
when you and i talked about it it was


---------118:48----------
emotional


---------118:49----------
yep and when you were telling it to zach


---------118:51----------
what were you feeling


---------118:54----------
it was emotional and


---------118:58----------
not to the extent when i was talking to


---------119:01----------
you yep


---------119:02----------
right so like zach did you get any


---------119:05----------
emotion from him


---------119:05----------
when he said that uh a little bit at the


---------119:09----------
start but knows about it


---------119:10----------
yep and i think this is what what you


---------119:12----------
all do which is normal by the way


---------119:14----------
is that like you know you're conveying


---------119:16----------
the words but i i think


---------119:18----------
um if if you're okay dave i'm gonna push


---------119:20----------
you is that okay because i mean you open


---------119:21----------
the door but we can just stop


---------119:24----------
sure so how do you feel


---------119:27----------
so first of all let's be explicit like


---------119:29----------
what do you what does lost time mean to


---------119:31----------
you


---------119:33----------
in relation to zach


---------119:37----------
those are years of


---------119:41----------
childhood that are valuable as i


---------119:45----------
mentioned


---------119:47----------
and you can never get them back and


---------119:50----------
those years


---------119:51----------
those those precious years of four to


---------119:54----------
ten roughly


---------119:55----------
when when you're a child like that


---------119:58----------
and everything's happy go lucky


---------120:02----------
um no no worries in the world


---------120:06----------
no stresses or your mind is not polluted


---------120:08----------
yet


---------120:09----------
from the environment those


---------120:12----------
years of dad and child


---------120:15----------
development can never get


---------120:20----------
get those back again okay so you talk


---------120:23----------
about dad and child


---------120:26----------
so what i'm hearing you say is that


---------120:28----------
there


---------120:29----------
are times of zack's life that because


---------120:33----------
of carson's needs you were not able to


---------120:36----------
give him


---------120:37----------
what you really wanted to yes


---------120:40----------
is that fair yeah and i'll also add in


---------120:44----------
there too


---------120:45----------
that it isn't a blame or


---------120:48----------
all on carson i was still


---------120:52----------
pursuing a career at the same time


---------120:56----------
and very demanding and so


---------120:59----------
again trying to stay balanced personally


---------121:02----------
and with the family was extremely


---------121:04----------
challenging


---------121:06----------
and uh carson was a heavy weight


---------121:09----------
on that scale and who paid the price of


---------121:13----------
that weight


---------121:16----------
we all did but uh certainly zach


---------121:20----------
i think payday price


---------121:23----------
okay zach what's it like to hear that


---------121:28----------
i don't know it's


---------121:34----------
it's so weird because like i can't


---------121:36----------
remember that much


---------121:37----------
of that period of my life right and i've


---------121:39----------
been spending so much of my time


---------121:40----------
recently speaking thinking about like


---------121:42----------
recent times and trying to like help


---------121:43----------
myself right now with the future and


---------121:44----------
whatnot


---------121:46----------
um


---------121:49----------
so it's like it's hard to wrap my head


---------121:50----------
around the perspective honestly


---------121:57----------
yeah i don't know i don't really yeah


---------122:00----------
i don't really know what i'm doing so


---------122:03----------
i'm gonna try to translate for dave


---------122:06----------
okay dave is that okay i'm gonna take


---------122:09----------
the spotlight off of you is that cool


---------122:11----------
sure so zach i think what i understood


---------122:15----------
and this is the advantage of streaming


---------122:16----------
this to the internet is now


---------122:18----------
you can go back and watch it um but


---------122:21----------
i think what i heard from your dad uh


---------122:23----------
and what i felt very palpably is that


---------122:25----------
like


---------122:26----------
like we have to be careful because it's


---------122:28----------
not about blame


---------122:29----------
but what i really felt from him was that


---------122:31----------
he actually mourns


---------122:33----------
the lack of time that


---------122:37----------
he's been he he mourns the amount of


---------122:40----------
time that he hasn't been able to give


---------122:41----------
you


---------122:43----------
and we're not saying that he acted


---------122:46----------
wrongly


---------122:47----------
we're not saying that he's to blame


---------122:49----------
we're not saying that carson's to blame


---------122:51----------
it's just the reality of y'all's


---------122:52----------
household and that's


---------122:53----------
tough right no one's to blame


---------122:56----------
and yet he really wishes that he could


---------123:00----------
have had


---------123:01----------
and i know you don't remember those


---------123:03----------
years but i have i have an almost


---------123:05----------
five-year-old so i kind of know a little


---------123:06----------
bit about what dave's talking about


---------123:08----------
and and there is something incredibly


---------123:10----------
precious and valuable


---------123:11----------
about bonding and forming a relationship


---------123:14----------
and that time just doesn't come back


---------123:18----------
and um what i i think what really


---------123:22----------
maybe what dave is trying to say is that


---------123:25----------
you know just that


---------123:26----------
that he feels hurt by not being able to


---------123:28----------
give you


---------123:29----------
in a sense what he feels like you


---------123:31----------
deserve


---------123:34----------
how's that dave good summary


---------123:39----------
hard for dave to say how does it make


---------123:41----------
you feel to hear that from me


---------123:46----------
can can you try tell it'd probably be


---------123:48----------
better if you actually do you feel


---------123:49----------
comfortable saying


---------123:50----------
something like that directly to zach


---------123:54----------
oh yeah sure i feel comfortable doing


---------123:56----------
that can you all look at each other


---------123:57----------
because it's [ __ ] i feel


---------123:58----------
i don't know what it's [ __ ] weird


---------124:02----------
apologies for the language


---------124:06----------
when i was interested


---------124:10----------
in having the family i was really


---------124:14----------
interested in bonding with a young


---------124:18----------
innocent child and growing up with that


---------124:22----------
child


---------124:34----------
and doing cool stuff together and we we


---------124:37----------
did have some moments


---------124:39----------
where we've been camping and fishing and


---------124:41----------
skied like crazy


---------124:43----------
but there were always


---------124:46----------
distractions distractions of carson is


---------124:50----------
one


---------124:52----------
and certainly a distraction to the


---------124:53----------
stress of my my job and


---------124:55----------
what i was pursuing in a career and


---------124:59----------
it was a distraction to me mentally and


---------125:05----------
it didn't allow us i think to fully


---------125:07----------
develop


---------125:08----------
a relationship when you're younger that


---------125:11----------
could continue on


---------125:12----------
in your adult life and particularly now


---------125:16----------
when you like you mentioned trying to


---------125:18----------
understand your identity now


---------125:20----------
that i could be there along with your


---------125:23----------
mom


---------125:27----------
and uh help you through the the trial


---------125:30----------
you're going through now


---------125:34----------
is you can't explain it you can only


---------125:37----------
experience it but being a parent


---------125:40----------
it's a real tough balancing act


---------125:44----------
when you're trying to be a provider


---------125:46----------
emotionally


---------125:47----------
financially um and to provide for your


---------125:51----------
family


---------125:51----------
pursue a career have time to spend with


---------125:55----------
your wife


---------125:57----------
and spend time with your kids and yet


---------126:00----------
have


---------126:01----------
some alone time to do things you like to


---------126:03----------
do if you want to go to the gym or go


---------126:04----------
run or whatever but try to balance


---------126:07----------
all these demands in life and then


---------126:11----------
you have a special needs child thrown


---------126:14----------
into the equation


---------126:15----------
makes it even more difficult there's no


---------126:18----------
manual there's no training


---------126:22----------
to help young parents


---------126:28----------
manage a family like that and uh


---------126:34----------
that's one thing i think lacking in our


---------126:36----------
society and our school system


---------126:38----------
is how do you have


---------126:44----------
a functional family


---------126:48----------
how do you teach kids to raise kids


---------126:52----------
become parents and how to balance


---------126:56----------
their life and to be


---------127:01----------
successful with a parent parenting


---------127:04----------
we don't teach that in school and


---------127:06----------
there's no manual that comes with each


---------127:08----------
kid because every kid is unique


---------127:09----------
wired completely different and


---------127:13----------
we learned by the seat of our pants or


---------127:15----------
by our parents or by our


---------127:17----------
friends


---------127:20----------
zach what was that like to listen to


---------127:25----------
uh i don't know


---------127:28----------
it was emotional parts right um


---------127:34----------
so your dad did something where he went


---------127:36----------
underwater


---------127:37----------
felt those emotions and then suddenly


---------127:39----------
now we're talking about


---------127:41----------
how people need a manual for child race


---------127:44----------
rearing


---------127:45----------
yeah and so dave i think your mind does


---------127:47----------
something where


---------127:49----------
when you feel emotions the engineering


---------127:52----------
brain turns on and you start talking


---------127:53----------
about abstract problem-solving kinds of


---------127:55----------
things because it's hard for you to just


---------127:58----------
hit the pause button when you're


---------128:00----------
conveying


---------128:01----------
to zach how you feel which is okay


---------128:04----------
right so that's a skill that you'll need


---------128:06----------
to learn it may be


---------128:09----------
sort of an excuse is in that


---------128:12----------
um i did the best i could yep there's no


---------128:15----------
daniel to tell me


---------128:17----------
you know how to raise him or how to


---------128:19----------
spend time with


---------128:20----------
enjoying them and so uh


---------128:24----------
it's just trying to articulate that


---------128:27----------
every kid is unique and how you raise


---------128:30----------
them or how you


---------128:31----------
establish relationships is they're all


---------128:33----------
different


---------128:34----------
okay yeah i think it's everything you


---------128:36----------
said is spot on man


---------128:39----------
um zach you look like you're kind of


---------128:42----------
processing


---------128:43----------
anything that you want to share with


---------128:45----------
your dad i mean you don't have to share


---------128:47----------
anything by the way


---------128:49----------
and dave you were supposed to have this


---------128:51----------
conversation in private but i'm sort of


---------128:53----------
glad you had it in public because i


---------128:54----------
don't i don't know if


---------128:55----------
you would have come across the right way


---------128:58----------
yeah


---------128:59----------
you don't have to say anything if you


---------129:01----------
want to just process


---------129:02----------
i mean the only thought that's coming to


---------129:06----------
mind is that like


---------129:07----------
yeah it


---------129:10----------
you generally do not get emotional


---------129:12----------
practice


---------129:14----------
and a lot of like


---------129:18----------
that's an observation not a blame dave


---------129:20----------
yeah


---------129:21----------
yeah a lot of communication becomes


---------129:25----------
easier when you're able to


---------129:26----------
convey those things like when i was able


---------129:29----------
to


---------129:30----------
connect with mom really well when she


---------129:33----------
was able to explain how she felt


---------129:35----------
to me and i think that part of why


---------129:40----------
i've been able to get close to her is


---------129:45----------
more so is because of that right like


---------129:49----------
our relationship has always been about


---------129:53----------
i don't know how to explain it like


---------129:55----------
things right like it's


---------129:57----------
it's been we're gonna go skiing and


---------129:59----------
we're gonna go ride atvs or


---------130:01----------
we're gonna work on this thing together


---------130:02----------
or teaching it's been


---------130:04----------
so much more like


---------130:07----------
i guess literal i don't know how to


---------130:10----------
explain it or if there's words for that


---------130:11----------
but


---------130:12----------
yeah i understand that emotional


---------130:15----------
connection has


---------130:17----------
never really been there um it's yeah


---------130:22----------
and i i don't even yeah i'm just sort of


---------130:23----------
like spilling thoughts right i'm not


---------130:25----------
going somewhere i'm gonna jump in so


---------130:28----------
dave


---------130:29----------
i think you've got to be careful because


---------130:31----------
you can feel blame


---------130:32----------
when he says something like that do you


---------130:34----------
feel blame


---------130:38----------
it i'll say yes but i understand


---------130:42----------
where he's coming from because yeah so


---------130:44----------
this once again is about


---------130:45----------
you can feel blame but not be at fault


---------130:49----------
yeah right that's that's a big lesson


---------130:52----------
here is that what you feel on the inside


---------130:54----------
so so here's what i'm gonna say to y'all


---------130:57----------
okay and now we're gonna kind of wrap up


---------130:59----------
if that's okay with you guys any


---------131:01----------
questions so okay so the first thing


---------131:04----------
is that um zach


---------131:08----------
so dave when you think about those


---------131:10----------
formative years of four to ten


---------131:12----------
i think you lucked out because what zack


---------131:16----------
is telling you is that his formative


---------131:18----------
years aren't over yet


---------131:19----------
and he still needs your help so i think


---------131:23----------
sure you miss four to ten but he's as


---------131:25----------
old as he is now and he's asking for you


---------131:28----------
to help him figure that out


---------131:31----------
and he's saying that you know it's not


---------131:35----------
too late and that it's important that


---------131:38----------
even if you guys have had trouble


---------131:40----------
you guys have always focused on things


---------131:43----------
that like now is your chance


---------131:46----------
um is that fair zach


---------131:50----------
yeah let's see that's here the last


---------131:54----------
thing


---------131:55----------
that i'll just say is covet is a can i


---------131:57----------
are you all okay with bad language


---------132:02----------
okay so then i'll avoid it sorry um


---------132:05----------
you know i'm i grew up in a culture of


---------132:07----------
moral decay dave


---------132:09----------
so my my language is loose but


---------132:12----------
but covet is a mess and and it really


---------132:15----------
puts a lot of pressures on on families


---------132:18----------
and i i really hope that um


---------132:22----------
you know i think family counseling is is


---------132:26----------
gonna be important for you guys but the


---------132:28----------
most important thing that i would say is


---------132:30----------
that both of you guys want the same


---------132:32----------
thing


---------132:33----------
which is a deeper relationship and a


---------132:35----------
better understanding with each other


---------132:37----------
and it's going to be hard and it's going


---------132:39----------
to be confusing and all kinds of stuff


---------132:41----------
is going to come up


---------132:43----------
as you guys walk this journey but as


---------132:45----------
long as you guys walk it together


---------132:47----------
and you all lean on each other y'all are


---------132:50----------
going to be fine


---------132:57----------
any last thoughts or questions


---------133:13----------
i'll say one thing is


---------133:16----------
and we need to understand zach


---------133:20----------
better yep and that's one thing


---------133:24----------
as he matured and entered adulthood


---------133:28----------
his interests became different than


---------133:32----------
than mine so


---------133:35----------
that was one area where we started to


---------133:40----------
or he became more um isolated i guess


---------133:44----------
from the family and his interests were


---------133:46----------
different for example gaming


---------133:48----------
you know yeah i've done some xbox games


---------133:50----------
a few times big deal


---------133:52----------
uh i don't understand his perspective on


---------133:56----------
gaming


---------133:56----------
and the attraction with it and


---------133:59----------
satisfaction fulfillment with it


---------134:01----------
and that's just one example of our


---------134:03----------
differences


---------134:05----------
understanding those and appreciating


---------134:07----------
those and respecting each other


---------134:09----------
with those different interests but yet


---------134:11----------
how can we find something in common


---------134:14----------
and have that relationship with those


---------134:16----------
differences


---------134:19----------
sure so i i think these are ongoing


---------134:21----------
conversations


---------134:22----------
and i think at the end of the day


---------134:24----------
david's you know my


---------134:26----------
my first instinct in response to that


---------134:27----------
would be that you know it is important


---------134:29----------
for you to understand gaming i think


---------134:31----------
that's a really important discussion


---------134:33----------
um for actually i think it's the most


---------134:36----------
important discussion for our particular


---------134:38----------
community


---------134:39----------
because parents don't understand and we


---------134:42----------
don't do a good job as kids


---------134:43----------
explaining it to our parents and it's a


---------134:46----------
two-way street


---------134:47----------
yeah i i would say at the end of the day


---------134:49----------
though understanding


---------134:52----------
i think zach wants to understand you


---------134:54----------
better as well


---------134:55----------
and it's not so much about interest and


---------134:57----------
stuff i i think sharing some of what you


---------134:59----------
did today and i i know zack has been


---------135:01----------
working through a lot of stuff and and


---------135:04----------
zach hopefully you know you can you feel


---------135:06----------
comfortable enough to convey some of the


---------135:08----------
things that you're thinking through with


---------135:09----------
your parents and


---------135:10----------
and what your motivations and thoughts


---------135:12----------
are around some of that stuff


---------135:14----------
um but i think just keep communicating


---------135:18----------
and hopefully all will get there


---------135:26----------
thoughts on family counseling thing i


---------135:28----------
think you all should do family


---------135:29----------
counseling


---------135:31----------
okay i i think it's nice to have someone


---------135:34----------
to facilitate communication because it's


---------135:35----------
hard


---------135:36----------
right like like it's hard because i


---------135:39----------
think your dad had something really


---------135:40----------
really important to say


---------135:42----------
and it took him a couple of tries to be


---------135:44----------
able to say it in a way that you could


---------135:46----------
hear


---------135:47----------
so it's not just like he has to say it


---------135:49----------
the right way it's like


---------135:50----------
about the way that you're you're you


---------135:52----------
hear things too


---------135:54----------
and so sometimes you'll need a little


---------135:55----------
bit of a nudge until you learn how to do


---------135:58----------
it on your own


---------136:01----------
sound good take care


---------136:05----------
thank you you do strong work really


---------136:08----------
strong work today


---------136:10----------
adios


---------136:14----------
okay damn
