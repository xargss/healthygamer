uh i've been up to just i've


---------00:50----------
i stopped streaming like five months ago


---------00:52----------
or so and i've just been like on a


---------00:54----------
different journey completely that's kind


---------00:55----------
of what i've been up to


---------00:57----------
yeah i saw you were streaming a lot of


---------01:00----------
wow and it seemed like it was really


---------01:01----------
going well


---------01:03----------
yeah no i i kind of with like shadow


---------01:05----------
lens came out and my stream was


---------01:07----------
actually had peaked at like the highest


---------01:09----------
heights i'd ever hit but i was still


---------01:10----------
just like super unhappy


---------01:12----------
you know so i kind of just was like why


---------01:15----------
am i continuing to do this


---------01:16----------
it's like yeah i'm successful and like i


---------01:18----------
have like on the outside it all looks


---------01:20----------
good right but on the inside i was


---------01:21----------
i was not good so i just decided to try


---------01:23----------
something else


---------01:25----------
wow that seems hard to do


---------01:29----------
i mean it was actually not that hard i


---------01:31----------
kind of just was like my heart just like


---------01:33----------
knew it had to be done


---------01:34----------
you know like i i i just i just


---------01:37----------
something inside of me just told me like


---------01:39----------
there's got to be more to this life or


---------01:41----------
something you know like because i i've


---------01:43----------
been streaming a long time


---------01:44----------
and i feel like i've been in the


---------01:46----------
environment of just gaming and playing


---------01:47----------
games for


---------01:48----------
you know 10 years or so so i just wanted


---------01:50----------
to like throw myself full-fledged into


---------01:52----------
something else and see what happens


---------01:54----------
can you help me understand you said that


---------01:58----------
there were like


---------01:58----------
things were going really well but like


---------02:01----------
you just knew on the inside that it was


---------02:03----------
not right yeah like


---------02:06----------
like career-wise everything was going


---------02:08----------
well right like from the outside


---------02:09----------
like from perspective but my internal


---------02:12----------
happiness and


---------02:13----------
whatever is like guiding me i don't know


---------02:16----------
like my spirit whatever you want to call


---------02:17----------
it like just i just felt


---------02:19----------
deeply sad inside like after most of my


---------02:22----------
streams i would just like kind of


---------02:24----------
i would like to take these long showers


---------02:25----------
where i would just let the water just


---------02:27----------
slap me just lay there and slap me and i


---------02:28----------
would just cry for hours like this was


---------02:30----------
like


---------02:30----------
a ritual of mine while i was like


---------02:32----------
streaming shadowland so it's like i


---------02:33----------
would go live and i'm like all good when


---------02:35----------
i'm live but then it's when i turn off


---------02:37----------
the camera and it's just me


---------02:38----------
alone i'm not okay you know so


---------02:41----------
i just realized like why am i lying to


---------02:44----------
myself you know like no amount of money


---------02:46----------
or success


---------02:47----------
from twitch or any of that egotistical


---------02:49----------
stuff that i was chasing years ago is


---------02:51----------
going to make me happy and


---------02:52----------
shadowlands was like a realization for


---------02:55----------
me to really figure that out it was like


---------02:56----------
oh


---------02:58----------
this doesn't make me happy you know i


---------02:59----------
thought if i had


---------03:01----------
all the viewers and subs and all that i


---------03:02----------
would be good but i i was i was worse


---------03:04----------
than


---------03:05----------
bef when i wasn't you know so it's like


---------03:07----------
yeah that's how i knew i just


---------03:09----------
i needed to try something different it


---------03:11----------
was like it was time for me to try


---------03:12----------
something different


---------03:15----------
and wow man


---------03:18----------
that's that's big bro


---------03:22----------
yeah i mean it's definitely been a


---------03:25----------
journey for sure but i've been uh i've


---------03:27----------
been on a spiritual kind of like


---------03:29----------
growth path for a couple years now i


---------03:32----------
never really shared this with twitch


---------03:33----------
chat because i didn't think there was


---------03:34----------
much relatability there


---------03:36----------
um i thought it was you know more so i


---------03:38----------
just come on play my game get rank one


---------03:40----------
you know everyone's like you know thinks


---------03:41----------
i'm a good mage and


---------03:42----------
it's all good you know what i mean but


---------03:44----------
yeah i've been on like a spiritual path


---------03:45----------
for a while now and it just kind of all


---------03:46----------
hit me at once where i'm like


---------03:48----------
yeah i don't know i just need to like


---------03:50----------
follow my heart or something like that i


---------03:51----------
don't know if i could


---------03:52----------
it sounds cliche but i don't know yeah


---------03:55----------
you know there's a reason that cliches


---------03:57----------
are cliches


---------03:58----------
that's true yeah that is true right and


---------04:01----------
it's i i i when i hear something like


---------04:03----------
follow your heart


---------04:05----------
it's the kind of thing that like a lot


---------04:07----------
of people say but i think very few


---------04:08----------
people truly understand and like when


---------04:10----------
you understand it


---------04:12----------
it feels like it makes so much sense


---------04:16----------
yeah for sure it does make so much sense


---------04:18----------
i mean just


---------04:19----------
you know just six months ago i don't


---------04:22----------
know it's like everyone thought i was


---------04:24----------
happy you know like literally my friends


---------04:25----------
they were like


---------04:26----------
everyone thought i was happy yeah i was


---------04:27----------
i had like i don't know like a lot of


---------04:29----------
viewers playing


---------04:30----------
wow shadowlands and i don't know from


---------04:32----------
the outside i guess people just think


---------04:33----------
that's happiness right like just like


---------04:35----------
like uh financial or like career success


---------04:37----------
is like


---------04:38----------
sure it's just like i don't know i just


---------04:40----------
i really


---------04:41----------
am struggling in this world to find


---------04:43----------
deeper meaning than that you know


---------04:45----------
because like


---------04:46----------
yeah i'm just i really do want to find


---------04:47----------
something deeper and like


---------04:49----------
a way to express my like the real parts


---------04:51----------
of


---------04:52----------
me that that i haven't been able to


---------04:54----------
express through streaming just because i


---------04:56----------
feel like


---------04:56----------
with streaming it's it's not as like as


---------04:59----------
an emotional of a connection with the


---------05:00----------
viewer that i would like i guess so that


---------05:02----------
makes sense


---------05:04----------
yeah like go ahead sorry no no keep


---------05:07----------
going man


---------05:08----------
no i was just saying it's hard for me to


---------05:09----------
relate to like to the viewers that i had


---------05:11----------
like playing wow and all that


---------05:13----------
it just didn't feel like i was making


---------05:15----------
that like real emotional connection and


---------05:16----------
whenever i would try and like open


---------05:18----------
myself up it's like people didn't seem


---------05:19----------
to really care there was just pushback


---------05:20----------
like you know like dude shut up just


---------05:22----------
play well whatever you know


---------05:23----------
so it's like i don't know i just want


---------05:25----------
people to like to uh that's why i


---------05:27----------
started music because like it was just


---------05:28----------
me


---------05:28----------
alone with like a microphone and i could


---------05:31----------
just like express my


---------05:32----------
my soul in a way and like i just want


---------05:34----------
people to be able to listen to that


---------05:36----------
that version of me rather than like the


---------05:38----------
version of me that just had to


---------05:40----------
you know be this like sort of character


---------05:42----------
to on stream


---------05:43----------
if i don't know yeah so i'm hearing that


---------05:46----------
you were sort of living a fake


---------05:47----------
life on screen uh yeah well


---------05:52----------
i was just trying to portray a happy


---------05:53----------
version of myself when i wasn't actually


---------05:55----------
happy so if that's fake then i guess


---------05:57----------
yeah but i was trying to portray a put


---------05:59----------
together happy


---------06:01----------
normal functioning human when that was


---------06:03----------
far from the reality that i was actually


---------06:05----------
living


---------06:06----------
what was the reality you were living


---------06:09----------
honestly just hell like i i really feel


---------06:12----------
like streaming has done a number on my


---------06:13----------
mental health over over the years


---------06:15----------
and i don't say that with like obviously


---------06:17----------
streaming has done a lot of good things


---------06:18----------
for me you know so it's


---------06:20----------
not like it's all bad i'm just saying


---------06:21----------
there's there's a lot of


---------06:23----------
things with it that that sort of did a


---------06:25----------
number on me


---------06:26----------
uh over the years and


---------06:29----------
i i wish i had like sort of taken this


---------06:32----------
leap of faith sooner in my life to be


---------06:33----------
honest with you because


---------06:34----------
i've been very much so a lot more


---------06:37----------
myself and able to express myself and


---------06:39----------
just be


---------06:40----------
happier in general since i stopped


---------06:42----------
streaming uh but


---------06:44----------
a lot of the reason that i kind of was


---------06:46----------
took this


---------06:47----------
leap of faith was just like obviously


---------06:50----------
you know the reckful passed away


---------06:51----------
and that was a like giant moment for me


---------06:54----------
to be like wow


---------06:55----------
like this [ __ ] is never the same for me


---------06:57----------
again like for real that was like a


---------06:59----------
moment where i realized it would never


---------07:00----------
be the same again


---------07:02----------
and uh i don't know i think a lot of


---------07:04----------
other broadcasters talked about how


---------07:05----------
reckful touched them or whatever but


---------07:06----------
like


---------07:07----------
i i just i had like a super deep


---------07:10----------
friendship with byron for many years


---------07:11----------
like we go back to like 2012


---------07:13----------
playing you know cataclysm wow together


---------07:16----------
before twitch was even really a thing


---------07:17----------
and


---------07:17----------
before anyone made like any money doing


---------07:19----------
it so it was like


---------07:21----------
to me that event just like hit me like a


---------07:22----------
brick and it still does


---------07:24----------
and i i sound like uh yeah it's like


---------07:28----------
i don't know it still really haunts me


---------07:30----------
though that he's gone


---------07:32----------
can you help me understand what changed


---------07:34----------
for you when


---------07:35----------
byron passed away i just realized that


---------07:41----------
i don't have as much time as i thought


---------07:43----------
you know i really


---------07:44----------
realized that it's not like


---------07:48----------
like i was always living in the past


---------07:49----------
hoping that the past would


---------07:51----------
happen again and then once he


---------07:55----------
passed away i realized the past will


---------07:57----------
never happen again and i need to stop


---------07:59----------
chasing on to something that doesn't


---------08:00----------
exist anymore


---------08:04----------
damn dude that's deep yeah that's


---------08:07----------
sad that's kind of how i feel about it


---------08:11----------
so yeah i'm very thankful though for all


---------08:13----------
the twitch stuff you know what i mean


---------08:14----------
like i had a great career it was dope


---------08:16----------
and i'm hoping that i'm really hoping


---------08:19----------
that i can express myself in a different


---------08:20----------
manner and people


---------08:21----------
will be uh okay with


---------08:25----------
the the deeper parts of me you know not


---------08:27----------
like the shallow fart jokes


---------08:28----------
on twitch but like the deeper parts of


---------08:30----------
me i hope people would like


---------08:32----------
want to see what's up with that too


---------08:35----------
yeah man well so help me understand a


---------08:37----------
little bit


---------08:38----------
what is it what is it that makes you


---------08:42----------
[Music]


---------08:44----------
how can i say this so it seems like some


---------08:47----------
people


---------08:48----------
are really happy with a slice of mitch


---------08:51----------
right not the whole pie they're good


---------08:53----------
with this yes


---------08:56----------
yeah not for sure go ahead sorry


---------08:59----------
and so i'm just kind of wondering a


---------09:00----------
little bit about like


---------09:03----------
you know why does


---------09:06----------
everyone or not maybe not everyone but


---------09:08----------
but you know what are you like


---------09:09----------
would it be okay if people weren't happy


---------09:12----------
with the rest of the pie


---------09:14----------
you know what yeah i'm sure because i


---------09:17----------
didn't get it


---------09:19----------
i was just like i'm getting a sense that


---------09:21----------
you want to share more and you want to


---------09:23----------
connect more


---------09:24----------
and yeah i'm a little bit confused


---------09:27----------
because


---------09:28----------
it seems to me like something about our


---------09:30----------
language is kind of falling apart where


---------09:32----------
i'm getting a sense of words that sound


---------09:36----------
like you're looking for approval


---------09:38----------
but the feeling that i'm getting from


---------09:39----------
you is not really about approval at all


---------09:42----------
and i just want to try to understand


---------09:44----------
that


---------09:46----------
you know that boundary between like


---------09:48----------
giving people what they want and wanting


---------09:50----------
them to give them more


---------09:51----------
and like wanting to give them something


---------09:53----------
authentic and wanting them to accept it


---------09:56----------
yeah that's kind of the way yeah that's


---------09:58----------
that's probably


---------09:59----------
how i would say is like i just want to


---------10:02----------
be


---------10:03----------
my authentic self and make art rather


---------10:05----------
than just like you know i do something


---------10:07----------
deeply meaningful


---------10:08----------
for like me i guess you know like i want


---------10:10----------
to i want to do something deeply


---------10:12----------
meaningful for me and i


---------10:13----------
i have like a weird story i mean um and


---------10:16----------
i feel like


---------10:17----------
a lot of people might be able to relate


---------10:18----------
to that weird story yeah i'd love to


---------10:20----------
hear it


---------10:21----------
yeah for sure i have i have a crazy


---------10:23----------
story like with with all


---------10:24----------
all of it i mean i don't we don't


---------10:26----------
probably have enough time to go into


---------10:27----------
everything but


---------10:28----------
yeah i have a really really uniquely odd


---------10:30----------
story and you know i might just be some


---------10:32----------
dumb kid from


---------10:33----------
baltimore or whatever like i've never


---------10:35----------
really struggled financially because


---------10:36----------
i've had like you know the twitch


---------10:37----------
success from an early age and stuff but


---------10:39----------
i think that actually may be a part of


---------10:41----------
why i fundamentally have grown up


---------10:43----------
awkwardly if that makes sense like i


---------10:45----------
think um


---------10:47----------
i didn't really understand at like a


---------10:50----------
young age


---------10:51----------
what i really had and it's like


---------10:54----------
it just sort of took control what is


---------10:57----------
what did you have at a young age


---------11:01----------
i was just fortunate enough to not grow


---------11:03----------
up financially struggling like i grew up


---------11:05----------
you know going to private school all of


---------11:06----------
that and then i


---------11:07----------
i got big and started making money on


---------11:09----------
twitch was like 20 21


---------11:11----------
you know so it's like i didn't really


---------11:13----------
have the traditional


---------11:14----------
like glo grow up and it's like i feel


---------11:16----------
like as i got more successful i became


---------11:18----------
more lonely


---------11:18----------
um it's like a weird like double-edged


---------11:21----------
sword type thing


---------11:23----------
um yeah so i've had like the material


---------11:26----------
things that humans


---------11:27----------
like sir saw like search after right but


---------11:29----------
i never really had


---------11:31----------
like deep love or anything that i really


---------11:33----------
felt like i could connect to like


---------11:34----------
on that level and truthfully like i'm a


---------11:36----------
very emotional


---------11:38----------
spiritual like person and


---------11:41----------
i've never really shared that i always


---------11:43----------
kind of dumb myself down and made myself


---------11:45----------
out to be this just like clown


---------11:47----------
stir wow player right yeah and uh for me


---------11:50----------
i feel like that was


---------11:51----------
i did myself a huge dis justice and it


---------11:53----------
just this justice


---------11:54----------
in that way i uh i i i regret doing that


---------11:58----------
a bit but it's like at the same time


---------12:00----------
that's what made me successful so it's


---------12:02----------
like


---------12:03----------
it's just you know fighting the


---------12:05----------
double-edged sword that is i'm sure


---------12:06----------
there's a lot of parallels like this


---------12:08----------
with any career path right um


---------12:10----------
so yeah


---------12:13----------
yeah i mean you know i i


---------12:17----------
it's interesting i i find that the


---------12:19----------
double-edged sword isn't so much with


---------12:21----------
the career path but it's more with us


---------12:24----------
um for sure and but at the same time


---------12:28----------
i kind of hear you loud and clear


---------12:29----------
because i think that it's it's you know


---------12:31----------
you can


---------12:32----------
easily make an argument that there's a


---------12:35----------
cost


---------12:36----------
to being a successful personality on the


---------12:39----------
internet


---------12:40----------
yeah and there's like i just wish i had


---------12:43----------
guidance in any way like i didn't really


---------12:44----------
have


---------12:45----------
much family guidance going into this


---------12:47----------
like my father was always pretty much


---------12:48----------
like uh


---------12:49----------
just obsessed with his work and his his


---------12:51----------
business and all that and like he


---------12:53----------
and i told you you know about the


---------12:54----------
situation about my mother she's you know


---------12:56----------
she's not really able to be there for me


---------12:57----------
because she's


---------12:58----------
extremely ill and then i have a brother


---------13:00----------
with autism who's currently


---------13:02----------
in some mental hospital probably like i


---------13:05----------
don't know like the last time i spoke to


---------13:06----------
him was like a year or two ago and


---------13:08----------
there's just a lot of things that weigh


---------13:10----------
heavy on my conscious and um


---------13:12----------
yeah so like from the outside i had all


---------13:14----------
this [ __ ] success and all this [ __ ]


---------13:16----------
but it's like i i


---------13:17----------
i just it didn't do anything for the


---------13:19----------
pain inside man like i i really feel


---------13:21----------
like


---------13:22----------
i had a i had a really good thing with


---------13:25----------
like a couple friends that i met


---------13:26----------
like reckful being one of them and it's


---------13:29----------
like


---------13:30----------
i don't know i feel alone in the world


---------13:33----------
but


---------13:33----------
it's all good because um


---------13:37----------
i don't know i'm just i'm gonna find a


---------13:39----------
way to like shed this pain you know one


---------13:40----------
way or another


---------13:43----------
when you say it's all good help me


---------13:45----------
unders


---------13:46----------
doesn't seem all good no it's not i'm


---------13:49----------
not all good right now but i know


---------13:51----------
in the future i i've like i've done a


---------13:54----------
lot of work on like self-reflection and


---------13:55----------
like


---------13:56----------
you know just pretty much just like


---------13:57----------
emotionally like become more intelligent


---------14:00----------
and


---------14:00----------
not only that with like body mind spirit


---------14:02----------
chakras whatever you want to say


---------14:04----------
so eventually i will do the work that is


---------14:06----------
necessary to


---------14:08----------
be a human again but right now i'm


---------14:11----------
sort of doing uh i'm just kind of seeing


---------14:16----------
i'm on like a path right now that i have


---------14:18----------
to see through if that makes sense


---------14:20----------
yeah so you gotta you gotta get to the


---------14:22----------
end of your journey


---------14:24----------
and this is maybe the tough part yeah


---------14:27----------
it's kind of


---------14:28----------
the dark valley that you have to get


---------14:30----------
through to kind of come out the other


---------14:32----------
side


---------14:33----------
yeah for sure yeah and i


---------14:38----------
can i just think for a second mitch


---------14:40----------
absolutely man


---------14:41----------
no big deal i feel like i'm playing a


---------14:45----------
lot of catch up


---------14:46----------
because i i i think um it's it's clear


---------14:49----------
to me that you've been walking a very


---------14:51----------
serious journey for some time now


---------14:54----------
and uh i'm just trying to recalibrate


---------14:56----------
from the person that i


---------14:58----------
first spoke to because you seem like


---------15:00----------
you've changed a lot in a good way


---------15:02----------
oh i've definitely changed you know when


---------15:04----------
you sort of just have to look at


---------15:05----------
yourself in the mirror and just be


---------15:07----------
honest


---------15:07----------
like that moment happened to me and let


---------15:10----------
me tell you the person i was looking at


---------15:12----------
[ __ ] hated i hated the person i was


---------15:13----------
looking at that's why i was like


---------15:17----------
i just saw this insecure sad dude


---------15:20----------
running away from


---------15:21----------
everything that makes him hurt and just


---------15:23----------
hiding behind this mask


---------15:25----------
of like streaming success or whatever


---------15:29----------
you want to call it just like sort of


---------15:31----------
maybe i wasn't like


---------15:33----------
hiding full-on hiding but i was


---------15:35----------
definitely running away


---------15:37----------
like my anxiety my anxiety and


---------15:40----------
all the things that i have like held


---------15:42----------
deep inside myself


---------15:44----------
i just ran away from them you know it


---------15:47----------
goes back to like


---------15:48----------
me feeling like i don't really have many


---------15:50----------
deep connections


---------15:51----------
you know i i really don't have anyone to


---------15:55----------
really call


---------15:56----------
you know it's like if i if i'm like for


---------15:58----------
example this talk i'm having with you


---------16:00----------
i don't feel like i could have this talk


---------16:02----------
with my own father and he's like the


---------16:04----------
only one


---------16:05----------
in my family that is even like


---------16:06----------
coherently enough to like hold a


---------16:08----------
conversation with me


---------16:10----------
and that sucks


---------16:14----------
what what gets in the way of you being


---------16:17----------
able to have a conversation like this


---------16:18----------
with your dad


---------16:21----------
he just isn't there emotionally for me


---------16:23----------
and


---------16:25----------
he never really was i think he's working


---------16:28----------
on it now that he's getting older


---------16:30----------
but at the same time i i think to my


---------16:33----------
father i'm just some sort of like prop


---------16:35----------
to him like it's


---------16:36----------
like i'm his only son that is like


---------16:39----------
functional and has a career and is doing


---------16:41----------
stuff and


---------16:42----------
like he to him i'm just sort of like


---------16:44----------
like


---------16:45----------
his only thing to carry his name or


---------16:48----------
whatever you want to call it i


---------16:49----------
truthfully i think if i had an older


---------16:51----------
brother that was doing


---------16:52----------
other things my dad would never even


---------16:54----------
talk to me that's actually how i feel


---------16:57----------
wow yeah


---------17:01----------
so i'm kind of almost hearing that your


---------17:04----------
value is sort of


---------17:06----------
not based on you as a person but sort of


---------17:08----------
like the role you


---------17:10----------
fill yeah you're like the


---------17:13----------
carrier of the legacy yeah for sure


---------17:16----------
and there's some crazy things that i've


---------17:18----------
gone through with uh i don't know how


---------17:20----------
personal i can get but there are some


---------17:21----------
crazy things that i've gone through


---------17:23----------
in terms of just like betrayal in that


---------17:26----------
regard where


---------17:27----------
i was just like put in charge of things


---------17:30----------
that i really shouldn't have been at a


---------17:31----------
young age you know


---------17:34----------
i mean you can share you understand


---------17:37----------
twitch terms of service better than i do


---------17:39----------
i'm happy to hear whatever you want to


---------17:41----------
share but also


---------17:42----------
you know you don't you don't have to


---------17:43----------
talk about that stuff i think there's


---------17:45----------
plenty that we can talk about in terms


---------17:46----------
of your spiritual journey but


---------17:49----------
for sure i just think uh if yeah it's


---------17:52----------
nothing like tos or anything like that


---------17:53----------
it's more of just like morally incorrect


---------17:56----------
things that have sort of happened i


---------17:58----------
guess but yeah like we don't have to


---------17:59----------
dive deep into some deep


---------18:00----------
crazy stuff if you don't if you it's up


---------18:02----------
to you


---------18:05----------
well let me kind of lay out how i think


---------18:07----------
about that mitch and then you tell me


---------18:08----------
whether we should dive in


---------18:10----------
so what i'm hearing what i'm hearing at


---------18:12----------
the core of it


---------18:14----------
is that there's mitch jones


---------18:17----------
and then there's mitch right there's


---------18:20----------
like the streamer personality there's


---------18:22----------
the


---------18:23----------
i still remember the first time we


---------18:24----------
talked i still remember you kind of said


---------18:27----------
but it's all good i'm mitch jones


---------18:30----------
yeah i remember that and and so i think


---------18:32----------
it must have been like over a year ago


---------18:34----------
but like that


---------18:35----------
man just the way you said that really


---------18:37----------
encapsulated


---------18:39----------
that there's like this persona on the


---------18:42----------
outside


---------18:43----------
and then there's like the person inside


---------18:46----------
like moving the levers


---------18:48----------
yeah for sure and on the outside it's


---------18:50----------
like a big smile and lots of fun and


---------18:52----------
inside there's a dude who's like


---------18:53----------
exhausted and sweaty and like can't get


---------18:56----------
a breath of fresh air


---------18:58----------
yeah for sure uh i think the mitch jones


---------19:02----------
thing you're talking about


---------19:03----------
is gone now like i even when i even when


---------19:06----------
i stream shadow lines i was not really


---------19:08----------
putting on


---------19:08----------
an act it was more of just like being


---------19:11----------
myself playing wow


---------19:12----------
and trying to put out the best version


---------19:14----------
of myself but truthfully mitch jones the


---------19:16----------
streamer whatever person persona


---------19:18----------
whatever you want to call it


---------19:20----------
i think that person died when reckful


---------19:23----------
when reckful died like truthfully like i


---------19:25----------
i just i couldn't do it anymore


---------19:28----------
and um yeah yeah


---------19:32----------
do you remember earlier when i was like


---------19:34----------
i need a second to process because you


---------19:35----------
seem like a different person yeah for


---------19:38----------
sure


---------19:38----------
and i need to catch up i think what i'm


---------19:41----------
grappling with is that i don't i don't


---------19:42----------
detect a whole lot of mitch jones so i


---------19:44----------
was like wait this is weird


---------19:46----------
yeah no i've really i really dug into


---------19:48----------
myself and that's why


---------19:50----------
i start that's why i changed you know


---------19:52----------
from twitch streaming to like music


---------19:53----------
because


---------19:54----------
i just want to be me


---------19:58----------
and give that you know whether it's


---------20:00----------
painful or not like i need to


---------20:02----------
give whatever it is that my soul is like


---------20:05----------
it's just i need to just be open heart


---------20:07----------
i don't want to be a closed heart


---------20:08----------
anymore walking around you know


---------20:10----------
so i think that's sounds like it's i'd


---------20:12----------
love to talk about


---------20:14----------
that when it comes back to your dad i


---------20:16----------
want to just share a couple of thoughts


---------20:19----------
so what i'm really getting the sense of


---------20:21----------
is that what you want more than anything


---------20:23----------
else


---------20:23----------
is to be connected and that there was


---------20:26----------
sort of like a farce that you could put


---------20:28----------
on


---------20:29----------
because at the end of the day there were


---------20:31----------
like a couple of like people like byron


---------20:34----------
who you did feel connected to and so


---------20:37----------
that was kind of enough


---------20:38----------
but really losing him has helped you


---------20:40----------
realize like


---------20:41----------
you really need to be seen you need to


---------20:43----------
be heard you need to be


---------20:46----------
i don't even want to say accepted but


---------20:49----------
you need to be treated with authenticity


---------20:52----------
and even if that's acceptance that's


---------20:54----------
fine and even if that's rejection if


---------20:55----------
people say like your music sucks


---------20:58----------
oddly enough i think you may be okay


---------20:59----------
with that as long as they're straight


---------21:01----------
with you that they see you for who you


---------21:03----------
are


---------21:03----------
and you say this is not for me or this


---------21:05----------
is for me you're actually


---------21:07----------
okay either way yeah i'm good i i'm like


---------21:10----------
i said i


---------21:11----------
i know who i am and what i need to do


---------21:14----------
you know what i'm saying and um i'm more


---------21:17----------
so just trying to


---------21:19----------
show a deeper side of myself and i am


---------21:21----------
okay with acceptance or not acceptance


---------21:23----------
either way


---------21:24----------
it's like you know i'm not looking for


---------21:25----------
validation externally i more so


---------21:27----------
i've done the work internally to be able


---------21:29----------
to share what


---------21:31----------
i have to say i guess rather than just


---------21:33----------
giving this


---------21:35----------
uh i don't know i think streaming in


---------21:37----------
general has just changed a lot


---------21:39----------
and uh i think the game now is more just


---------21:41----------
like


---------21:43----------
it's just a big pr


---------21:46----------
fest of [ __ ] and it doesn't really feel


---------21:49----------
as genuine as when i


---------21:50----------
was a part of it back like five six


---------21:52----------
years ago


---------21:54----------
and i'm just not really down for the


---------21:56----------
game anymore if that makes sense


---------21:58----------
sure you're


---------22:02----------
you got too much actual living to do to


---------22:04----------
be pretending to live


---------22:07----------
yeah i mean i've been in the back end of


---------22:08----------
streaming and like the forefront of


---------22:10----------
streaming for a long time like i've seen


---------22:11----------
it all


---------22:12----------
so i know i just know


---------22:15----------
and i know it doesn't do anything for


---------22:17----------
like for like


---------22:19----------
a deeper meaning it doesn't do [ __ ] like


---------22:21----------
you know


---------22:22----------
true yeah so kind of the reason i


---------22:25----------
mention this is


---------22:26----------
because if we think a little bit about


---------22:28----------
you know the stuff potentially like the


---------22:29----------
weird stories of uh


---------22:31----------
you know whatever betrayal or whatever


---------22:33----------
yeah if what you're looking for is


---------22:35----------
connection


---------22:36----------
right because that's really what i'm


---------22:37----------
hearing is that yeah exactly


---------22:39----------
exactly it's exactly what i'm looking


---------22:41----------
for i just want


---------22:42----------
people to feel me for me because i gave


---------22:45----------
people this thing that wasn't me and i


---------22:47----------
just like i feel like i want


---------22:49----------
people to really feel like the actual


---------22:52----------
me you know and it's not like an


---------22:54----------
acceptance thing i just need them to


---------22:55----------
know


---------22:56----------
before i go that that's like


---------22:59----------
that that person is and was there


---------23:01----------
because people seem to have this like


---------23:03----------
preconceived notion of me uh from years


---------23:06----------
ago


---------23:07----------
how i was like a jackass and all that


---------23:08----------
but that that was part of the job for me


---------23:10----------
and you know and i felt like i was


---------23:12----------
creating a show whereas like now


---------23:14----------
i just want to be uh


---------23:17----------
i just want to be seen for who i am not


---------23:19----------
for like


---------23:20----------
something that was built as like a


---------23:23----------
career


---------23:24----------
if that makes sense okay


---------23:27----------
sounds wonderful and also i'm a


---------23:30----------
tiny tiny tiny bit alarmed


---------23:34----------
because you said before i go i'm curious


---------23:37----------
what do you mean by that


---------23:40----------
i i'm more so mean like before i just


---------23:42----------
drop off the social media grid


---------23:44----------
okay yeah like i have a long term plan


---------23:47----------
of just ending up


---------23:48----------
not in the public at all you know


---------23:51----------
uh it's kind of just like like i said


---------23:53----------
it's hard to


---------23:55----------
really be an actual like human when you


---------23:57----------
have to look at all of these different


---------23:59----------
opinions of you


---------23:59----------
every single day and yeah you can just


---------24:02----------
not look at it but like you know that


---------24:03----------
shit's like


---------24:04----------
like how do you create art without


---------24:06----------
connecting with your


---------24:07----------
you know the people that are following


---------24:09----------
it you know what i'm saying


---------24:10----------
so yeah yeah so what i'm kind of hearing


---------24:14----------
is that


---------24:16----------
you're on a journey to find who you are


---------24:19----------
you want to share that with other people


---------24:20----------
they can accept or reject it


---------24:22----------
but that being engaged with them in a


---------24:25----------
social media pr


---------24:27----------
fest will actually negatively impact


---------24:30----------
your journey because then it'll be about


---------24:32----------
giving people what they want and you


---------24:34----------
need to pull away from all that


---------24:36----------
so that you can continue to create yeah


---------24:39----------
for sure i think


---------24:40----------
being truly creative especially in an


---------24:42----------
artistic way like whether you make art


---------24:44----------
or


---------24:44----------
whether you're a musician or whatever


---------24:45----------
you do i think it's very important to be


---------24:48----------
in at peace with yourself and really be


---------24:50----------
able to express yourself right like if


---------24:52----------
you're


---------24:53----------
living this like reality where you're


---------24:54----------
just juggling like five different


---------24:56----------
different


---------24:56----------
like you know uh the social media sphere


---------24:58----------
where it's like a ladder climbing


---------25:00----------
reality like if you're living that


---------25:01----------
then i don't think you can create like


---------25:03----------
true art in my in my opinion and like


---------25:05----------
i'm just trying to really


---------25:06----------
paint a beautiful picture of some pain


---------25:09----------
that i've gone through


---------25:10----------
you know yeah yeah it's interesting i


---------25:14----------
think uh


---------25:15----------
you know what we create is content


---------25:19----------
yeah content there you go so [ __ ]


---------25:23----------
soulless


---------25:24----------
yeah for sure you know


---------25:27----------
it's interesting because even even here


---------25:29----------
at healthy gamer what we create is


---------25:31----------
content and yeah true i mean it's all


---------25:34----------
content right


---------25:36----------
yeah so i think it's interesting because


---------25:38----------
i think internally we we also have a


---------25:40----------
you know kind of a process of like you


---------25:43----------
know what


---------25:43----------
what do we want to do here do we want to


---------25:46----------
grow or do we want to help people


---------25:48----------
and sometimes those are at odds with


---------25:50----------
each other


---------25:52----------
for sure and i do think sometimes people


---------25:55----------
get caught up in a good thing that's bad


---------25:57----------
for them


---------25:58----------
which is i think i think sometimes


---------26:02----------
there's good things that are not the but


---------26:04----------
it's not the correct thing for people


---------26:05----------
but because it's good


---------26:06----------
they stay doing it and they're not


---------26:08----------
unhappy right like


---------26:10----------
it's like someone that has you know a


---------26:11----------
crazy position at like some


---------26:13----------
job that they work for and they're


---------26:15----------
making you know a lot of money or


---------26:16----------
whatever but they're just like


---------26:18----------
they're not really fulfilling themselves


---------26:20----------
in a way that like their


---------26:21----------
deeper self wants to like express itself


---------26:25----------
yeah so how would you know well i knew


---------26:28----------
when i just looked in the mirror and i


---------26:30----------
wanted to beat the [ __ ] out of that


---------26:31----------
person in the mirror that's what i knew


---------26:32----------
i knew


---------26:32----------
i i just knew like you know it just hit


---------26:35----------
me like but


---------26:36----------
but i only was able to get to that point


---------26:37----------
because i was doing like off stream i


---------26:39----------
was doing work on myself to like because


---------26:40----------
i was just extremely depressed i was you


---------26:42----------
know


---------26:43----------
and i was like how do i fix this like


---------26:44----------
i've always been a problem solver kind


---------26:45----------
of guy


---------26:46----------
so i was like how do i fix this and the


---------26:49----------
only way i was able to really like


---------26:51----------
it's not like i fixed it but the only


---------26:53----------
way i was able to like get pieces of


---------26:56----------
uh the pain to like sort of shed off of


---------26:58----------
me i didn't have to wear it as much was


---------27:00----------
just through


---------27:01----------
like the things that you told me like


---------27:02----------
meditation uh really diving deep


---------27:04----------
into uh just yoga uh


---------27:08----------
definitely food that you eat all that's


---------27:10----------
like cleansing my body sort of like


---------27:11----------
enabled my mind to like shed that pain


---------27:14----------
and it was a painful experience and for


---------27:15----------
a while i was absolutely crazy


---------27:17----------
but i came out the other end knowing a


---------27:20----------
lot more about myself


---------27:21----------
even if it was a painful journey to go


---------27:23----------
through can you tell me about that


---------27:24----------
journey


---------27:27----------
sure i mean i i was nuts for a while


---------27:30----------
like


---------27:30----------
i was on like i tried all these diets i


---------27:32----------
showed like keto i tried


---------27:35----------
intermittent fasting i even fasted for


---------27:37----------
10 days straight where i didn't eat


---------27:38----------
anything i just drank water for 10 days


---------27:40----------
i did all these things just like


---------27:42----------
because you know i was just researching


---------27:44----------
like on the web that's where i've


---------27:45----------
learned everything it's just like


---------27:47----------
on the internet so you kind of have to


---------27:48----------
decipher like what is valuable


---------27:50----------
information what isn't and not like be


---------27:51----------
an idiot about it but


---------27:53----------
uh yeah i was just like sort of like


---------27:54----------
teaching myself more about the human


---------27:56----------
body and the human mind how it works all


---------27:58----------
that


---------27:58----------
so i think i i don't know i think i


---------28:02----------
definitely learned a lot but it was a


---------28:04----------
painful experience for sure


---------28:06----------
so mitch i'm you you kind of you'll use


---------28:08----------
these words that have a lot of


---------28:10----------
volume but i'm not quite sure what i'm


---------28:12----------
hearing you'll say i was crazy for a


---------28:14----------
while


---------28:15----------
so i'm getting oh well you were on the


---------28:16----------
outside i was crazy


---------28:18----------
yeah well a lot of people


---------28:22----------
i feel like would view me as like crazy


---------28:24----------
or something if i'm just like doing all


---------28:25----------
this like it looks manic like sort of


---------28:27----------
right but


---------28:27----------
to me it was like something i had to go


---------28:29----------
through does that make sense


---------28:31----------
sort of because i i don't i'm


---------28:35----------
like i can understand your conclusion


---------28:38----------
but i'm having a lot of trouble


---------28:39----------
understanding like you know when you


---------28:41----------
were doing let's say keto or


---------28:42----------
intermittent fasting


---------28:44----------
what were you experiencing what were you


---------28:46----------
looking for


---------28:47----------
what you know i get that you come out


---------28:51----------
the other side


---------28:51----------
but cleanse yeah i was looking at this


---------28:53----------
cleanse spiritually


---------28:55----------
mentally physically all of it how did


---------28:57----------
you know you needed to cleanse


---------29:00----------
because i was miserable i was i had the


---------29:03----------
most anxiety out of any human i'd ever


---------29:05----------
met i would wake up every day and


---------29:07----------
constantly check my heartbeat just to


---------29:08----------
see if it was beating and if it was


---------29:10----------
beating too fast


---------29:11----------
i would assume that i'm having like a


---------29:12----------
heart attack or something like it was


---------29:13----------
like i was literally crazy with anxiety


---------29:16----------
and the only thing that gave me a little


---------29:17----------
bit of peace from that was


---------29:19----------
cleansing my body uh like truthfully


---------29:21----------
like


---------29:22----------
if i had kept eating the same way and


---------29:24----------
keeping the same stress levels that i


---------29:26----------
had from streaming and i stressed myself


---------29:28----------
i was streaming because


---------29:29----------
it was always like this like numbers


---------29:30----------
game right and like if i if my [ __ ]


---------29:32----------
wasn't doing well like


---------29:33----------
i had to pretty much just destroy the


---------29:35----------
part of my ego that gave a [ __ ] about


---------29:36----------
streaming because that part of me was


---------29:38----------
destroying me whether it was like making


---------29:39----------
me successful or not


---------29:41----------
that part of me was absolutely


---------29:42----------
destroying me and i


---------29:44----------
literally had to just kill that part of


---------29:46----------
me because


---------29:48----------
living every day just like like if i had


---------29:50----------
a bad stream the rest of the day i would


---------29:52----------
feel like i was a failure


---------29:54----------
i was a loser i was a [ __ ] up whatever


---------29:56----------
you know


---------29:57----------
and i just had to destroy that part of


---------29:59----------
me because i literally could not keep


---------30:01----------
living like that


---------30:02----------
how how do you destroy that part of you


---------30:06----------
just taking a lot of time off of


---------30:07----------
streaming and healing and not looking at


---------30:09----------
social media going for walks in the


---------30:11----------
woods becoming


---------30:12----------
a [ __ ] human again you know like


---------30:13----------
that's what helped me a lot actually was


---------30:15----------
just


---------30:16----------
not being plugged in and just being


---------30:18----------
completely unplugged sort of living a


---------30:20----------
boring life for a while but


---------30:22----------
that boring life sort of gave me


---------30:25----------
uh i i guess you could call it a


---------30:26----------
dopamine fast for a long time you know


---------30:29----------
yeah interesting um


---------30:32----------
it was funny a couple weeks ago speaking


---------30:34----------
of content i i did a


---------30:36----------
i did a a quick debunk of the dopamine


---------30:39----------
fast


---------30:40----------
and and talked a little bit about it but


---------30:43----------
um


---------30:44----------
you know it's interesting mitch because


---------30:45----------
i hear you say you had to kill that part


---------30:47----------
of you but what i'm sort of hearing is


---------30:49----------
that you


---------30:50----------
sort of let it wither out and die is it


---------30:53----------
yeah yeah


---------30:55----------
yeah i would say withered yeah i didn't


---------30:56----------
just like slay with a sword die it sort


---------30:58----------
of


---------30:59----------
it died a slow painful death yeah for


---------31:01----------
sure but eventually like i said i came


---------31:03----------
out the other side happier like


---------31:04----------
even today like i'm still sad like


---------31:07----------
obviously in this conversation it's a


---------31:08----------
little bit more sad because i'm


---------31:09----------
digging deep into the things that i


---------31:11----------
still haven't really come to full


---------31:12----------
fruition and like dealt with right


---------31:15----------
there's still a lot of things that hide


---------31:16----------
inside of me and i have to deal with


---------31:18----------
those but


---------31:18----------
yeah yeah i mean i think that it's


---------31:22----------
important to remember that


---------31:23----------
the goal of spirituality is not to not


---------31:26----------
feel sad anymore because sadness is a


---------31:28----------
part of life


---------31:30----------
it's to sort of feel peace or


---------31:32----------
tranquility


---------31:33----------
in the face of sadness yeah or in the


---------31:36----------
face of


---------31:37----------
excitement yeah um and and i do get the


---------31:41----------
sense mitch that you're


---------31:42----------
more at peace now than i've ever seen


---------31:44----------
you


---------31:46----------
i am more at peace now and i have music


---------31:50----------
to thank for that truthfully


---------31:52----------
i think that putting all of my energy


---------31:54----------
into a different outlet


---------31:56----------
that isn't just like built with that


---------31:59----------
immediate feedback that twitch had


---------32:02----------
like it just makes me slow down and able


---------32:05----------
to


---------32:05----------
live a better lifestyle if that makes


---------32:08----------
sense


---------32:09----------
yeah can you tell me a little bit about


---------32:11----------
how music has helped you


---------32:14----------
absolutely uh when i first started music


---------32:16----------
i was just kind of [ __ ] around


---------32:18----------
or messing around with uh you know some


---------32:20----------
viewers of mine or whatever


---------32:21----------
and then after like a couple songs i was


---------32:24----------
like you know i kind of want to try and


---------32:25----------
make like a heartfelt song right and


---------32:27----------
then i was like thinking


---------32:28----------
to myself like what bothers me the most


---------32:30----------
right now and what bothered me the most


---------32:33----------
what still bothers me the most is the


---------32:34----------
fact that rick was no longer here


---------32:36----------
and i decided to just put all that pain


---------32:38----------
into into a song


---------32:40----------
and uh in the first verse there's like a


---------32:42----------
memory i have with reckful that uh this


---------32:44----------
one haunts me like crazy is um


---------32:46----------
a week before he died i was at


---------32:50----------
uh his like condo downtown with like his


---------32:53----------
his roommate merc i was hanging out with


---------32:54----------
his roommate merc and it was like 3 a.m


---------32:57----------
or something


---------32:58----------
um but merc was like yeah like you can


---------32:59----------
just pass out down down they had like


---------33:01----------
two condos right so he's like you could


---------33:02----------
just pass out at the condo


---------33:04----------
uh below no one's there he told me no


---------33:06----------
one was there and i go down there


---------33:08----------
and i walk into the kitchen and i just


---------33:10----------
look over and i just see byron


---------33:12----------
like on the balcony just kind of like


---------33:14----------
looking off into the sky


---------33:15----------
you know and he was just like you know


---------33:17----------
just pondering like thinking whatever


---------33:19----------
and i in that moment i was like i should


---------33:22----------
go


---------33:23----------
you know say something or talk to him


---------33:25----------
and i was like too scared to i was like


---------33:27----------
oh he might not want to see me or like


---------33:29----------
you know maybe he doesn't want to talk


---------33:30----------
right now maybe he's just you know


---------33:31----------
having a moment to himself whatever


---------33:33----------
so i just i thought you know i really


---------33:35----------
just turned around and went back


---------33:37----------
upstairs


---------33:37----------
and then a week later he's gone so like


---------33:39----------
in the first verse of that song it's


---------33:41----------
like


---------33:42----------
i kind of talk about that that that that


---------33:44----------
story


---------33:45----------
and um i don't really go into the same


---------33:47----------
detail that i just told you


---------33:48----------
but it's like i kind of put everything i


---------33:50----------
had into


---------33:52----------
that song when it came to the pain that


---------33:53----------
i was dealing with from that situation


---------33:55----------
and i still live in regret every day not


---------33:57----------
not being able to say anything


---------33:59----------
to him that day what do you regret about


---------34:02----------
not being able to speak to him that day


---------34:05----------
my fear and anxiety stop me from from


---------34:07----------
saying something to him and i'll never


---------34:08----------
get a chance to say anything again


---------34:18----------
i literally saw him a week before he


---------34:20----------
died


---------34:22----------
and i said nothing


---------34:26----------
it haunts me like really badly


---------34:29----------
when you say haunts you how does that


---------34:31----------
affect you


---------34:33----------
nightmares um


---------34:36----------
just i don't know it's like this like i


---------34:38----------
like whenever i really deeply think


---------34:40----------
about it i just get this overwhelming


---------34:42----------
sense of like grief i guess it's like uh


---------34:44----------
it's like uh like i messed up or


---------34:46----------
something you know


---------34:52----------
i'm gonna think for a second okay mitch


---------34:55----------
yeah you're fine


---------35:00----------
what does your mind tell you would have


---------35:02----------
happened if you did not


---------35:04----------
let your fear and anxiety control you in


---------35:06----------
that moment


---------35:08----------
i think i could have i think i could


---------35:11----------
have had a conversation i think i could


---------35:12----------
have helped byron because at this time i


---------35:14----------
was on some spiritual journey and


---------35:15----------
whether i'm an idiot or not


---------35:17----------
i'd like to believe that i've learned


---------35:18----------
some things and that i could have maybe


---------35:20----------
you know


---------35:20----------
just showed him that there's other ways


---------35:24----------
to find happiness you know like uh


---------35:26----------
i think he was already on a spiritual


---------35:28----------
journey of his own but


---------35:30----------
i i think that i i don't know like if i


---------35:32----------
had just spoken to him i think it would


---------35:33----------
have


---------35:35----------
i think it could have sparked something


---------35:37----------
that may have


---------35:38----------
helped you know so i think it's fair to


---------35:42----------
say that


---------35:44----------
if you had said something it could have


---------35:46----------
sparked something


---------35:47----------
that could have helped yeah that's a


---------35:50----------
very accurate assessment


---------35:52----------
and at the same time i i don't know


---------35:54----------
mitch if you've gotten to this point


---------35:56----------
in your journey but like you know a big


---------35:58----------
part of my


---------35:59----------
understanding of the journey is that


---------36:01----------
like things


---------36:02----------
have to happen in a particular time and


---------36:05----------
place


---------36:07----------
that you can regret as much as you want


---------36:10----------
to about the past


---------36:12----------
but at the end of the day it's the past


---------36:14----------
that makes you the person that you are


---------36:16----------
today yeah


---------36:19----------
um i know yeah i know


---------36:23----------
i'm just saying the person i am today i


---------36:25----------
still have a lot of work to do


---------36:27----------
i just yeah it's like i live every like


---------36:29----------
the red sickness that we talked about


---------36:31----------
last year has gotten worse but like i've


---------36:34----------
found ways of uh coping you know


---------36:36----------
internally


---------36:37----------
but truthfully like yeah i feel alone as


---------36:41----------
[ __ ] man like i do


---------36:42----------
and uh i'm trying my best


---------36:45----------
to to cope with like


---------36:49----------
you know and it's like on the internet i


---------36:51----------
almost wasn't allowed to be sad you know


---------36:53----------
it's like oh


---------36:54----------
you're [ __ ] making this much money or


---------36:56----------
whatever like you're successful like


---------36:57----------
shut the [ __ ] up like that's kind of


---------36:59----------
what i was like just like this boot up


---------37:00----------
my ass like you know i'm not allowed


---------37:02----------
it was like it just felt like a very i


---------37:04----------
just couldn't be in that environment you


---------37:06----------
know so i had to


---------37:07----------
stop yeah i had to just stop


---------37:17----------
so you know mitch i'm a little bit


---------37:20----------
curious you know what


---------37:23----------
i mean i could send data your way i


---------37:25----------
don't think that would really help


---------37:27----------
um i've read a lot of data


---------37:32----------
like i said i don't think it would help


---------37:35----------
um


---------37:36----------
you know it's hard so you know i deal


---------37:38----------
with suicide a lot


---------37:40----------
as a psychiatrist i think it's really


---------37:42----------
challenging for people to


---------37:46----------
you know i think just about every person


---------37:49----------
that i've talked to who's a survivor


---------37:51----------
after


---------37:52----------
someone they love or care about commit


---------37:54----------
suicide has thoughts or experiences like


---------37:56----------
yours


---------37:56----------
right like they their mind finds one


---------37:59----------
moment in particular


---------38:02----------
and it'll sort of like think about


---------38:05----------
it'll usually involve personal weakness


---------38:08----------
yeah right like where you'll say like if


---------38:10----------
i had been stronger than


---------38:12----------
dot dot dot yeah


---------38:15----------
and but the thing is the person i am now


---------38:18----------
i feel like i would have made a


---------38:19----------
different uh decision


---------38:22----------
yeah and so this is where if you want to


---------38:24----------
get like you know off the deep end of


---------38:25----------
spirituality like what we have to


---------38:27----------
understand


---------38:28----------
is that the person that


---------38:32----------
you are now


---------38:36----------
was born out of that tragedy was born


---------38:40----------
out of that moment


---------38:41----------
yeah what do you think about that


---------38:47----------
i think


---------38:50----------
it awoke me in a way but it's like i


---------38:53----------
don't know if i was ready to be awoken


---------38:55----------
that way but it happened regardless of


---------38:56----------
what if i was ready or not


---------38:58----------
and yeah i think it


---------39:01----------
it took me on a journey of like i said


---------39:03----------
spiritual like


---------39:05----------
a spiritual journey to where i started


---------39:07----------
caring less and less about my ego and


---------39:09----------
more and more about


---------39:10----------
inner peace


---------39:13----------
bro the whole [ __ ] internet was so


---------39:16----------
so asleep that that's what it took to


---------39:19----------
wake us up


---------39:21----------
yeah right when you say you weren't


---------39:24----------
ready


---------39:25----------
you're right you weren't ready and yeah


---------39:28----------
well that's


---------39:28----------
why that's why it was necessary


---------39:34----------
right because sometimes it takes a big


---------39:36----------
ass wake-up call


---------39:39----------
and so i think this is where like this


---------39:41----------
may sound kind of weird but like i'm


---------39:43----------
gonna lay a burden at your feet


---------39:46----------
because if this is the price that was


---------39:48----------
paid to wake you up


---------39:49----------
you better [ __ ] be awake now which i


---------39:53----------
think you understand


---------39:54----------
i'm definitely awake man and i am just


---------39:57----------
trying to change


---------39:58----------
the whole thing like i'm trying to


---------39:59----------
change everything that i used to do and


---------40:00----------
do things in a in a correct way


---------40:03----------
uh yeah and that's why i i do still


---------40:05----------
struggle a little bit with like the


---------40:06----------
internet stuff because like


---------40:07----------
you know there's obviously some people


---------40:09----------
that say some pretty [ __ ] up [ __ ] to


---------40:10----------
me and it's like uh


---------40:12----------
i don't really want to get into it but


---------40:13----------
uh yeah i read some terrible things like


---------40:15----------
uh because i know people just don't seem


---------40:17----------
to do their research or know


---------40:19----------
like how like i don't know yeah


---------40:22----------
that is true yeah people people tend to


---------40:25----------
make judgments very easily


---------40:29----------
and and you know there's a correlation


---------40:31----------
between not doing your research and


---------40:32----------
making judgments which is that


---------40:34----------
the more research you do i think the


---------40:36----------
harder it is to make a judgment


---------40:38----------
yeah and so what we end up with is a


---------40:40----------
bunch of people who make judgments


---------40:42----------
without doing any research because


---------40:43----------
that's the only way you can do it


---------40:46----------
yeah i just i don't know i've never been


---------40:49----------
someone that does that too often


---------40:50----------
especially yeah i don't know so to me


---------40:52----------
it's


---------40:52----------
hard for me to relate to that like i


---------40:54----------
would never comment on someone else's


---------40:55----------
like [ __ ]


---------40:56----------
without like knowing what the [ __ ]


---------40:58----------
happened yeah


---------41:00----------
i think that that's a healthy way to go


---------41:02----------
through life but


---------41:03----------
it's hard to do that right it takes a


---------41:05----------
lot of effort it's a lot easier to just


---------41:07----------
judge but


---------41:10----------
for sure for sure and i i don't think


---------41:12----------
that should matter like i think


---------41:14----------
you know if i was a strong if i was as


---------41:17----------
strong as i


---------41:18----------
want to be and am capable of being i


---------41:20----------
don't think i would even pay any mind to


---------41:22----------
that but


---------41:23----------
truthfully it's like i was raised on the


---------41:25----------
internet and like it just like


---------41:27----------
the opinions of people on the internet


---------41:28----------
obvi you know they just


---------41:30----------
it matters to me right just because this


---------41:31----------
is like to me it's like


---------41:33----------
it's like i've been my whole life you


---------41:34----------
know so it's uh it's hard to look at it


---------41:37----------
from a different


---------41:38----------
point of view but that's what i'm


---------41:38----------
working toward is looking at it from a


---------41:40----------
different point of view


---------41:41----------
absolutely yeah i mean i think like you


---------41:44----------
said we were all raised on the internet


---------41:46----------
so it's just how we how we function i


---------41:49----------
was absolutely raised on the internet


---------41:50----------
for sure which is like maybe a bad thing


---------41:52----------
but


---------41:52----------
definitely was raised on the internet


---------41:55----------
yeah so this is also where i'd kind of


---------41:56----------
think a little bit karmically for a


---------41:58----------
second i'd say it's i don't think it's a


---------41:59----------
bad thing it's


---------42:00----------
it's what you needed right so if you


---------42:03----------
think about your struggles and even


---------42:06----------
i venture to say your contributions what


---------42:09----------
i want


---------42:09----------
what i'm seeing in you i don't know if


---------42:11----------
this is actually true or not


---------42:12----------
but what i'm seeing in you mitch is like


---------42:15----------
you are not alone


---------42:16----------
in your struggle you are not alone in


---------42:18----------
being a child of the internet and


---------42:19----------
actually like


---------42:20----------
even more so today children that are


---------42:22----------
born born today will be more a children


---------42:25----------
of the


---------42:25----------
child of the internet than you were


---------42:29----------
right because things are getting worse i


---------42:31----------
think you're right i think they are


---------42:32----------
getting worse


---------42:33----------
so if you think about it you had a


---------42:34----------
couple of years before as you put it


---------42:37----------
twitch became pr [ __ ] but now


---------42:40----------
everyone coming up on twitch is existing


---------42:43----------
in this current


---------42:44----------
world yeah which this current world i


---------42:46----------
feel like


---------42:47----------
is just filled with manipulation and


---------42:49----------
what can you do for me


---------42:50----------
and all these people that are just


---------42:52----------
running around with their heads cut off


---------42:54----------
trying to like build this false sense of


---------42:56----------
ego and add things to their resume


---------42:58----------
and then they're gonna wake up one day


---------42:59----------
and be like wow i wasted my whole life


---------43:01----------
chasing a dragon that didn't even make


---------43:03----------
me happy and i'm glad that i realized


---------43:05----------
that at a young age because


---------43:07----------
if i didn't i would still be that


---------43:08----------
[ __ ] idiot person you know sitting


---------43:09----------
there and doing this like


---------43:11----------
shallow-ash [ __ ] trying to make myself


---------43:12----------
feel like i'm cool


---------43:15----------
yeah so hopefully your music will help


---------43:19----------
people get there


---------43:21----------
yeah for sure you know


---------43:24----------
so i'd also be a little bit careful


---------43:26----------
because i'm still detecting some amount


---------43:28----------
of


---------43:28----------
ego and judgment towards them what do


---------43:30----------
you think


---------43:32----------
bitterness who's them i don't know


---------43:36----------
but you're talking about you're talking


---------43:38----------
about people


---------43:40----------
oh yeah no i yeah you're right for sure


---------43:42----------
no i definitely have


---------43:44----------
a little bit of like resentment and


---------43:46----------
stuff towards like


---------43:47----------
just like ignorance in the world i


---------43:50----------
really like


---------43:51----------
and when i say people it's more so just


---------43:53----------
like the manipulation that


---------43:54----------
is like behind the scenes it's not


---------43:56----------
really like the viewers or any of that


---------43:57----------
it's more of just like


---------43:58----------
the things that i've seen on the back


---------44:00----------
end of just straight


---------44:02----------
as9 like some acting that deserves an


---------44:05----------
oscar winning a war type [ __ ] you know


---------44:07----------
i've


---------44:08----------
just seen i've seen everything man and


---------44:10----------
uh


---------44:11----------
it's sad to see just the masses be


---------44:14----------
fooled on a [ __ ] scale that's like


---------44:17----------
i don't really feel like getting more


---------44:18----------
deep into it but uh it's just


---------44:20----------
i've seen it all just trust me i've seen


---------44:22----------
it all


---------44:23----------
yeah i i don't doubt that you've seen it


---------44:25----------
all i'm just a little bit confused and i


---------44:27----------
want to be careful because i don't you


---------44:28----------
know i don't want to push you into


---------44:30----------
starting drama and at the same time oh


---------44:31----------
it has nothing to do with anyone like no


---------44:33----------
drama none of that [ __ ] like this


---------44:35----------
this honestly stems from like my father


---------44:37----------
and other things like that like


---------44:38----------
obviously this happens on the


---------44:39----------
you know it's it's just a lot of things


---------44:42----------
i just feel like i have trouble trusting


---------44:43----------
people because of


---------44:44----------
the experiences i've gone through okay


---------44:48----------
yeah so now we're gonna kind of take a


---------44:49----------
i'm going to take a slightly different


---------44:51----------
approach


---------44:51----------
mitch just toss something out you decide


---------44:54----------
whether it's worth pursuing


---------44:55----------
so i feel like we were talking a little


---------44:57----------
bit more spiritually and the reason i


---------44:58----------
had mentioned your father i'm


---------44:59----------
glad you brought him up again is because


---------45:01----------
if your challenge


---------45:02----------
is to connect with other humans okay


---------45:05----------
let's say that like i feel alone


---------45:07----------
i think if we want to try to understand


---------45:09----------
that there's absolutely a spiritual


---------45:11----------
element that we've talked about it's


---------45:12----------
like hey i put on a mask


---------45:14----------
i become this person that i want to be i


---------45:16----------
hate what i see when i look in the


---------45:17----------
mirror


---------45:18----------
shedding that mask letting that ego


---------45:20----------
wither away starting your creative


---------45:21----------
process


---------45:22----------
putting something out there that is


---------45:24----------
authentically you giving people an


---------45:26----------
opportunity to connect with that


---------45:28----------
we walk down that road there's another


---------45:30----------
element here


---------45:32----------
um which we can talk more about that i


---------45:34----------
don't think that's done


---------45:35----------
but there's another element here which


---------45:37----------
is just very simply from like a


---------45:39----------
psychological standpoint from a social


---------45:41----------
conditioning standpoint


---------45:43----------
if you're telling me that your problem


---------45:45----------
is loneliness


---------45:46----------
and you're telling me that you've been


---------45:48----------
deeply betrayed


---------45:49----------
as long as that emotional energy of


---------45:52----------
betrayal and that


---------45:53----------
the conditioning the adaptations that


---------45:55----------
happened in your mind due to that


---------45:57----------
betrayal exist


---------45:58----------
it's gonna be hard to connect to other


---------46:00----------
people bro


---------46:02----------
oh yeah for sure but i feel like i've


---------46:04----------
done a good job of forgiving those


---------46:05----------
people like


---------46:06----------
that's the first step to me was like


---------46:08----------
forgiveness of the betrayal but it


---------46:09----------
doesn't it doesn't


---------46:10----------
like fill the hole that still exists you


---------46:12----------
know like i have forgived


---------46:14----------
forgave most you know everything that's


---------46:16----------
happened to me


---------46:17----------
and like especially on the internet [ __ ]


---------46:18----------
like i give i could give a [ __ ] about


---------46:20----------
that


---------46:20----------
but it's yeah like there's people in


---------46:22----------
chat saying train for example but me and


---------46:24----------
train talk daily and are like are good


---------46:25----------
friends so


---------46:26----------
like this is again like the ignorance


---------46:28----------
does bother me a little bit because that


---------46:29----------
guy who typed that didn't do his


---------46:30----------
research and for me that's annoying but


---------46:32----------
like


---------46:32----------
i don't know that's just part of why i


---------46:34----------
quit streaming you know


---------46:36----------
i don't feel like babysitting all day so


---------46:39----------
but i then what do you think why do you


---------46:42----------
what's the whole


---------46:43----------
if you've forgiven what's left what help


---------46:46----------
me understand that


---------46:48----------
uh what do you mean so you said like


---------46:50----------
like you've


---------46:52----------
you've learned how to authentically


---------46:53----------
forgive which you know


---------46:55----------
sure i'll if that's what you're saying i


---------46:57----------
i think


---------46:58----------
i trust you there but i'm curious then


---------47:00----------
like what's the hole that's


---------47:02----------
left you said the hole that's it doesn't


---------47:05----------
repair the hole or doesn't fill the hole


---------47:08----------
yeah i think the hole that's left is


---------47:09----------
just


---------47:11----------
like i said i i want to express myself


---------47:14----------
in


---------47:14----------
a true manner you know that's like the


---------47:16----------
whole and obviously


---------47:18----------
once i do that i feel like maybe i'll be


---------47:20----------
able to connect with people


---------47:22----------
easier and not have as many walls put up


---------47:25----------
or whatever whatever is like stopping me


---------47:28----------
from


---------47:28----------
experiencing like love or


---------47:31----------
something like similar to that you know


---------47:33----------
just like deep connections i guess


---------47:41----------
so mitch at this point i think i'm about


---------47:44----------
to ask you to tell me more or i'm i am i


---------47:48----------
do actually at this point want to know a


---------47:49----------
little bit more about your dad


---------47:51----------
but let me first explain my reasoning


---------47:53----------
sure so what i what i'm hearing is that


---------47:55----------
you feel uh


---------47:56----------
emptiness and lack of connection on the


---------47:57----------
inside and what yeah


---------48:00----------
what you fi what you've hypothesized so


---------48:02----------
you've started on this spiritual journey


---------48:04----------
and you're going to create this music


---------48:05----------
and you're going to share it with the


---------48:06----------
world and you'll


---------48:07----------
hopefully connect with people yeah in my


---------48:09----------
experience


---------48:11----------
that is going to be an important but


---------48:13----------
insufficient step


---------48:15----------
for sure and and so i think that what


---------48:18----------
i'm hearing is that you have


---------48:20----------
walls up but making music may be a part


---------48:22----------
of that process


---------48:23----------
but there's a part of me that just the


---------48:25----------
way you're describing things


---------48:26----------
makes me feel like maybe there's


---------48:28----------
something to be learned or gained from


---------48:30----------
like


---------48:30----------
understanding more of the details


---------48:32----------
because you you


---------48:34----------
you know all the details and based on


---------48:36----------
the details you've come up with a


---------48:37----------
hypothesis


---------48:38----------
yeah if we think about you know what i


---------48:40----------
try to do and what i try to help people


---------48:42----------
with


---------48:43----------
it's it's not just to sort of fulfill


---------48:46----------
the plan that they've created


---------48:49----------
it's actually to sort of figure out if


---------48:51----------
the way that you've constructed your


---------48:53----------
hypothesis is


---------48:54----------
missing something and this is the first


---------48:56----------
time during our conversation where


---------48:58----------
i feel like maybe something is not


---------49:01----------
adding up for me like with all the


---------49:03----------
spiritual stuff oddly enough with the


---------49:04----------
grief stuff things like that


---------49:05----------
all that stuff like i'm with you 100 i


---------49:07----------
think i like i think it makes perfect


---------49:09----------
sense


---------49:10----------
for some reason i'm getting the sense


---------49:11----------
that there's a blind spot something


---------49:13----------
about


---------49:14----------
with what you're talking about now yeah


---------49:16----------
for sure


---------49:17----------
there definitely is a blind spot i just


---------49:19----------
think it's uh


---------49:22----------
it's a lot to indulge into but i mean i


---------49:24----------
can tell you


---------49:25----------
what like what bothers me and i don't


---------49:27----------
know i just


---------49:28----------
it's hard to explain i just feel as


---------49:30----------
though i'm constricted of what i can say


---------49:33----------
just because i do really feel as though


---------49:36----------
my father is all that i do have and even


---------49:39----------
though our relationship is [ __ ]


---------49:41----------
it's like maybe one day wouldn't be and


---------49:43----------
if i just air out


---------49:44----------
all of the shitty things that have


---------49:48----------
happened that i'm just forever closing


---------49:52----------
that portal i guess


---------49:54----------
okay i'm so glad you shared that because


---------49:57----------
let's think about this okay so


---------50:01----------
number one our our north star our


---------50:04----------
primary compass is we do not want to


---------50:06----------
have a conversation with you or do


---------50:09----------
anything


---------50:10----------
that will hurt you in any way shape or


---------50:12----------
form


---------50:13----------
okay so if if you feel like talking


---------50:16----------
about the stuff and


---------50:17----------
airing this [ __ ] out is going to


---------50:18----------
negatively impact your relationship with


---------50:20----------
your father we don't want to do it


---------50:23----------
well i don't even think he would ever


---------50:25----------
see this because he's never given


---------50:26----------
a [ __ ] about what i've done on the


---------50:28----------
internet so but regardless


---------50:30----------
yeah yeah so then this is the thing


---------50:33----------
right so like i think this is what i'm


---------50:34----------
kind of picking up on like


---------50:36----------
you're kind of thinking if you air this


---------50:38----------
[ __ ] it'll close the portal forever


---------50:40----------
i know it sounds kind of weird it's the


---------50:43----------
this will close the door


---------50:44----------
forever if i do this thing


---------50:48----------
that's not how life works


---------50:52----------
right i mean sometimes you can have


---------50:53----------
catastrophic events like


---------50:55----------
death right where doors are sort of


---------50:58----------
closed forever


---------51:00----------
but you know that's the rarity and what


---------51:02----------
i'm wondering is


---------51:04----------
if that fear of closing the door forever


---------51:07----------
is part of what is actually the problem


---------51:11----------
yeah it probably is part of the problem


---------51:13----------
i actually do have


---------51:14----------
a lot of fear about that like i've


---------51:15----------
wanted to speak about the things that


---------51:18----------
that have like really bothered me about


---------51:19----------
that situation but i've sort of kept it


---------51:21----------
to myself


---------51:22----------
um and um yeah it's


---------51:25----------
it's something that is difficult to


---------51:27----------
think and speak about for sure


---------51:29----------
yeah so now we have a choice okay so i'm


---------51:31----------
going to toss out one statement this is


---------51:33----------
going to be inflammatory


---------51:34----------
it may evoke emotions but in the past


---------51:37----------
mitch


---------51:38----------
have you has your fear controlled what


---------51:41----------
you want to say


---------51:45----------
right so like here we are again where we


---------51:49----------
want to


---------51:49----------
we want to give you time and space but


---------51:51----------
like i'm going to point it out to you


---------51:53----------
because if your fear


---------51:54----------
of saying something like we actually


---------51:55----------
don't want to hurt you right we don't


---------51:56----------
want


---------51:57----------
you to do anything that's going to like


---------51:58----------
end up bad so we want to be sensitive


---------52:01----------
that we don't want to create drama we


---------52:02----------
don't want to ruin your relationship


---------52:04----------
with your dad but if he ain't gonna


---------52:05----------
watch it then like that fear is all in


---------52:06----------
here


---------52:08----------
yeah it is internally yeah it is it is


---------52:10----------
yeah


---------52:11----------
it is internally i have a


---------52:14----------
it's it's just so [ __ ] up man like i


---------52:16----------
don't i don't know


---------52:17----------
so once again if if you're not ready to


---------52:20----------
talk about it that's actually fine i'm


---------52:22----------
okay with that but i think


---------52:23----------
at the least what we should talk about


---------52:26----------
is your


---------52:26----------
fear about not like you don't actually


---------52:28----------
have to talk about it


---------52:29----------
the important thing is not whether you


---------52:31----------
share some story or not the important


---------52:33----------
thing is the fear that's controlling you


---------52:36----------
yeah for sure it's not it i guess it is


---------52:39----------
fear yeah i guess it is fear


---------52:41----------
it's more of a thing where it's like


---------52:44----------
am i the piece of [ __ ] if i talk about


---------52:47----------
it


---------52:47----------
you know like it's it's like it could be


---------52:49----------
that's the problem right it's like


---------52:51----------
i just think of these in this like


---------52:52----------
skewed way because it's like if i talk


---------52:54----------
about things that bother me


---------52:56----------
then there's always going to be people


---------52:58----------
that are assuming


---------52:59----------
that i'm saying x for y reason


---------53:02----------
you know it's like i don't feel like i i


---------53:05----------
don't feel


---------53:06----------
like if i make myself vulnerable that it


---------53:09----------
won't be twisted in some way because


---------53:11----------
most of the times i have made myself


---------53:13----------
vulnerable it has been twisted in some


---------53:15----------
way and


---------53:16----------
and i don't feel safe in that way


---------53:19----------
yeah all right mitch i need your help


---------53:23----------
okay yeah i need you to tell me if i'm


---------53:27----------
bullying the [ __ ] out of you


---------53:29----------
no man you're fine wait for it


---------53:33----------
okay so here's the thing like bro that's


---------53:36----------
exactly the problem


---------53:37----------
like here you are not being authentic


---------53:40----------
about the person that you


---------53:42----------
like what you feel on the inside because


---------53:44----------
you're like oh what if these people


---------53:46----------
think i'm saying this [ __ ] for pr


---------53:49----------
like that's exactly what you've spent


---------53:51----------
the last who knows how many months


---------53:52----------
getting away from


---------53:54----------
is to connect to your authenticity and


---------53:56----------
not give a [ __ ] about how people are


---------53:58----------
gonna judge you


---------53:59----------
and you speak your truth yeah you're


---------54:02----------
right it actually is fear holding me


---------54:03----------
back from that you're right


---------54:04----------
it's like it's all about this like how


---------54:07----------
you know


---------54:08----------
and it's more it's not just like pr it's


---------54:09----------
more of like how would my


---------54:11----------
like it's like how would my father twist


---------54:13----------
that like let's say my father heard this


---------54:14----------
conversation


---------54:15----------
and i said what bothered me how would he


---------54:18----------
twist that to me that's more of what i'm


---------54:20----------
talking about you know yes


---------54:21----------
i and why the [ __ ] that started with


---------54:24----------
your dad and now you're doing it with


---------54:26----------
the rest of the internet


---------54:28----------
yeah you're right


---------54:31----------
yeah you're you're not wrong i'm like


---------54:34----------
literally


---------54:35----------
i'm literally like [ __ ] up from that


---------54:37----------
and i just put that on everyone else


---------54:38----------
it's like


---------54:39----------
i'm like oh yeah well you're right yeah


---------54:42----------
you're right i just assumed the internet


---------54:43----------
would do the same thing then


---------54:44----------
yeah you're right you're right you're


---------54:45----------
right because the


---------54:47----------
because but you you learn how to


---------54:50----------
recognize that pattern


---------54:52----------
and be afraid of it but it sounds like


---------54:54----------
that started with your dad and like


---------54:56----------
the internet was just you know not


---------54:59----------
taking you seriously 2.0


---------55:02----------
but i don't even know because i actually


---------55:05----------
don't know i mean i could be talking


---------55:06----------
completely out of my ass because i still


---------55:07----------
don't know what happened with your dad


---------55:09----------
and that's sort of why i can give you


---------55:11----------
i'll i can give you a little bit of


---------55:13----------
details like i'm just going to slowly


---------55:14----------
ease into it rather than just yeah you


---------55:16----------
know i'm saying


---------55:16----------
that's what i mean about bullying you i


---------55:17----------
don't want you to like you know push you


---------55:19----------
into speaking no


---------55:20----------
if i unleashed all that i would probably


---------55:22----------
just yeah my mind would not be good like


---------55:24----------
it's like i have to i have to deal with


---------55:25----------
this like one phase at a time type


---------55:27----------
yeah but a big thing a couple couple


---------55:29----------
things that


---------55:30----------
happened was i feel like i told you


---------55:34----------
about the situation with my brother


---------55:35----------
right where it's like i just feel as


---------55:37----------
though


---------55:38----------
um like i guess i can just tell one


---------55:41----------
story but please


---------55:42----------
just like hear me out because this is


---------55:44----------
very personal [ __ ] you know what i'm


---------55:46----------
saying


---------55:46----------
um yeah well there was one i was like 23


---------55:50----------
or so


---------55:51----------
and my brother had always he grew up


---------55:53----------
with autism like asperger's


---------55:55----------
and you know he was always different but


---------55:58----------
um


---------55:59----------
he was a good he was a good smart dude


---------56:01----------
you know he used to paint


---------56:02----------
and he had some beautiful paintings man


---------56:04----------
like uh yeah he was very talented dude


---------56:07----------
and uh as he grew up like my mother got


---------56:09----------
really ill and my mother was kind of the


---------56:11----------
main like caretaker for him then like


---------56:13----------
held his hand through life and [ __ ] you


---------56:15----------
know


---------56:16----------
and um


---------56:19----------
i just remember one time when i was 20


---------56:22----------
my my dad was like my brother was


---------56:23----------
falling apart you know he was


---------56:24----------
he was not going he was


---------56:28----------
calling my mother was not able to take


---------56:30----------
care of him anymore


---------56:32----------
and uh were you gonna say something yeah


---------56:34----------
i think i'm


---------56:35----------
lagging from a server standpoint i'm


---------56:38----------
wondering if this is the universe's way


---------56:40----------
of


---------56:41----------
like double checking that we want to say


---------56:42----------
what we're about to say


---------56:46----------
i mean i can stop it's up to you man


---------56:50----------
i think that this this feels important


---------56:52----------
to me but at the same time


---------56:54----------
like absolutely like i don't want to


---------56:56----------
pressure you into this


---------56:58----------
you know yeah i don't really feel


---------57:00----------
pressured i just okay


---------57:02----------
like i already told you the things i'm


---------57:03----------
fearful of is more so just


---------57:06----------
um yeah just i think sometimes when you


---------57:10----------
are honest and have an open heart


---------57:14----------
people like to


---------57:18----------
sort of stab that invulnerability or


---------57:21----------
that sorry that that vulnerability


---------57:23----------
and yeah that's the only thing i'm


---------57:25----------
fearful of is that


---------57:27----------
i don't know i just uh yeah so we'll


---------57:30----------
we'll i'd like to help you


---------57:38----------
feel supported enough


---------57:41----------
to be able to be courageous and to help


---------57:44----------
you be


---------57:45----------
more vulnerable despite the fact that


---------57:49----------
you've learned probably the hard i mean


---------57:51----------
undoubtedly the hard way that that's a


---------57:52----------
bad idea


---------57:54----------
so if you're cool with it i'd love to


---------57:56----------
hear the rest of that story you were


---------57:57----------
talking about your brother and how he


---------57:59----------
made good art


---------58:07----------
yeah my brother hold on


---------58:11----------
all right i


---------58:16----------
yeah okay so the story i don't know


---------58:18----------
where we left off but


---------58:19----------
my brother yeah he makes good art and


---------58:22----------
uh he there was one time when i was 23


---------58:25----------
and my


---------58:25----------
my my dad or sorry my brother was not


---------58:28----------
doing well


---------58:29----------
he was you know not taking care of


---------58:31----------
himself because my mother was not able


---------58:33----------
to


---------58:34----------
take care of him the way she used to


---------58:36----------
because of her own illness and


---------58:39----------
uh there was like my dad told me i i had


---------58:41----------
i rented


---------58:42----------
this is like when my stream first


---------58:44----------
started doing well so i rented the house


---------58:45----------
next door to my


---------58:46----------
mom's house because i wanted to be close


---------58:48----------
to her and i was with my


---------58:50----------
friend ethan we lived at this place next


---------58:52----------
door right


---------58:53----------
and my dad called me and he's like hey i


---------58:55----------
need you to do me a favor


---------58:56----------
and i was like okay what is it and he


---------58:59----------
just said


---------59:00----------
uh i've called social services and


---------59:03----------
they're picking up


---------59:05----------
your brother and you need to go there


---------59:07----------
and moderate it and make sure everything


---------59:08----------
goes okay


---------59:09----------
and i'm just like what why why the hell


---------59:12----------
am i doing that


---------59:13----------
you know and he just put that all on me


---------59:17----------
and i remember the [ __ ] cops came and


---------59:19----------
they were just like


---------59:22----------
they were like uh my


---------59:25----------
my they were like my brother is like not

---------60:32----------
any of this [ __ ] and it's like i i may i


---------60:35----------

---------60:36----------
it's it's just hard for me to even


---------60:39----------
think about it like it sucks i feel like


---------60:43----------
all the parts of my childhood that i


---------60:45----------

---------60:55----------
mitch we're gonna help you with this all


---------60:58----------
right


---------60:59----------
so i don't think we need to talk more


---------61:01----------
about your past but that was a really


---------61:03----------
powerful share and i can sort of see


---------61:07----------
so much can i start talking


---------61:12----------
yeah the first thing is holy [ __ ] no


---------61:15----------
wonder you feel alone


---------61:18----------
i feel so alone man like i fee and not


---------61:21----------
only that like


---------61:22----------
i've never shared this [ __ ] you know


---------61:24----------
like this [ __ ] is like [ __ ] that i've


---------61:25----------
been trying my best to just deal with


---------61:27----------
on my own and i just portrayed myself


---------61:31----------
as like this put together gamer or


---------61:33----------
whatever like that was my escape from


---------61:35----------
all of this [ __ ] you know and


---------61:38----------
uh once you just really dig inside


---------61:41----------
yourself and realize you


---------61:42----------
can't escape you can't no matter how


---------61:46----------
successful you become no matter


---------61:47----------
how far away you run this [ __ ] will


---------61:51----------
destroy you man


---------61:53----------
and it [ __ ] me up every [ __ ] day


---------61:55----------
okay mitch


---------61:57----------
are you in a space to listen i have


---------62:00----------
yeah so you are a hundred percent right


---------62:03----------
that no matter how far you run you can't


---------62:06----------
escape


---------62:07----------
and that's because you carry it inside


---------62:10----------
you


---------62:12----------
you know if i have kryptonite if i have


---------62:14----------
kryptonite in my backpack


---------62:17----------
and i go for a jog i'm taking that [ __ ]


---------62:19----------
with me bro


---------62:22----------
yeah and if i were to think about


---------62:24----------
speaking of


---------62:25----------
artistry and imagery can you hear me


---------62:27----------
okay


---------62:28----------
i can okay i know you're hurting i'm


---------62:30----------
gonna talk okay


---------62:33----------
is that okay yeah obviously a lot has


---------62:36----------
become clear for me and i i think that


---------62:39----------
you can't escape from it but you can


---------62:41----------
absolutely deal with it


---------62:44----------
and and that's becoming clear to me so i


---------62:46----------
i know it sounds weird like i know that


---------62:48----------
you're feeling like


---------62:49----------
shattered and [ __ ] and i'm sorry if i


---------62:52----------
you know because i did that


---------62:53----------
sort of i mean it was there but


---------62:57----------
mitch i feel hopeful


---------63:02----------
i need to help my brother somehow man


---------63:04----------
we'll get to your brother in a second


---------63:07----------
okay let's focus on you for a second can


---------63:09----------
you do that for me bro


---------63:11----------
yeah so if i were to if i were to


---------63:17----------
if i were to make a picture okay maybe


---------63:19----------
not


---------63:20----------
what are you feeling sorry [ __ ] i'm


---------63:22----------
good i'm good i'm good


---------63:24----------
tell me wait what are you feeling i


---------63:26----------
don't i don't need to get all ugly right


---------63:27----------
now just it's fine man they just


---------63:30----------
i'm having trouble i just need a deep


---------63:31----------
breath okay just give me yeah let's


---------63:33----------
breathe


---------63:36----------
like i said it's like i do i have


---------63:39----------
thought about these things before


---------63:41----------
and it's like but alone you know like i


---------63:42----------
i don't talk about this [ __ ]


---------63:44----------
and uh it's just uh i just yeah


---------63:51----------
i had a plan though with all this [ __ ]


---------63:53----------
you know like i really did


---------63:55----------
i don't know i had a plan man it's like


---------64:00----------
i'm just trying to do an ounce of good


---------64:02----------
bro you know like i i


---------64:03----------
for my for my [ __ ]


---------64:07----------
i've just lost the [ __ ] child like


---------64:10----------
the person that i once was you know


---------64:12----------
it's gone like it's just been


---------64:15----------
[ __ ] shattered man like


---------64:23----------
oh i just i feel like the world is just


---------64:25----------
dampening me and uh


---------64:27----------
i have a lot to share yeah


---------64:31----------
yeah so i know it sounds weird mitch but


---------64:33----------
do you have a sense of why


---------64:35----------
i could be hopeful when you say things


---------64:38----------
like that


---------64:43----------
no can you tell me why yeah it's weird


---------64:47----------
right


---------64:47----------
because the first thing is like because


---------64:49----------
you're not alone in this moment


---------64:52----------
like you're saying that you don't share


---------64:54----------
this stuff and you just did


---------64:56----------
right because like the problem here is


---------64:58----------
that you've been carrying this [ __ ] all


---------64:59----------
by yourself


---------65:01----------
and like that's like you're carrying it


---------65:05----------
with you wherever you go and you're the


---------65:06----------
only one who's carrying it so like right


---------65:08----------
now in this moment what i


---------65:10----------
what i saw you do is take off your


---------65:12----------
backpack for a second


---------65:14----------
and pass it to me


---------65:17----------
right and i can hold it for a few


---------65:19----------
seconds before i pass it back which is


---------65:21----------
fine man


---------65:23----------
like the only way this works is for you


---------65:25----------
to like not be alone anymore


---------65:29----------
right and and this is the this is the


---------65:31----------
challenge is like when i think about


---------65:33----------
i'm gonna just keep talking okay


---------65:36----------
whatever you're feeling


---------65:37----------
you gotta tell me if i should stop


---------65:41----------
feeling like a dick for keeping talking


---------65:43----------
but i'm gonna keep going


---------65:45----------
so here's what i'm here's what i'm


---------65:47----------
seeing mitch


---------65:50----------
if you were to ask me i'll look paint a


---------65:53----------
portrait of loneliness


---------65:55----------
what i would have done before this


---------65:57----------
conversation


---------66:02----------
you listening yeah i'm gonna keep going


---------66:06----------
okay you tell me when to stop do i need


---------66:07----------
to stop


---------66:09----------
well are you good okay i'm gonna keep


---------66:11----------
going okay


---------66:12----------
yeah if you were to tell me to to paint


---------66:14----------
a portrait of loneliness i would have


---------66:16----------
painted a person by themselves in an


---------66:17----------
empty room and what i'm realizing now


---------66:21----------
what that painting involves


---------66:23----------
is is if i had taken a snapshot of you


---------66:26----------
being on the phone being 23 years old


---------66:29----------
walking into into a room that has cops


---------66:32----------
your autistic brother


---------66:33----------
and your mom with cancer and strokes


---------66:37----------
that is the portrait of loneliness


---------66:46----------
in a nutshell


---------67:02----------
and yeah yeah


---------67:05----------
it feels overwhelming to share it


---------67:09----------
but i'm gonna ask you a question mitch


---------67:12----------
do you feel alone right now


---------67:18----------
no no i don't i just feel very


---------67:21----------
vulnerable


---------67:22----------
yep because this is this is it right


---------67:26----------
like it's really hard to like bury your


---------67:28----------
chest because you don't know if the


---------67:29----------
knife is coming


---------67:40----------
mitch bro this is a part of your journey


---------67:43----------
and i know you feel vulnerable and we're


---------67:44----------
gonna sit with you okay


---------67:54----------
yep we're just gonna sit you don't need


---------67:56----------
to do anything you don't need to say


---------67:58----------
anything


---------68:04----------
i can talk if you want to i can listen


---------68:06----------
if you want to


---------68:18----------
how how can i how can i


---------68:22----------
heal this like like even just opening


---------68:25----------
this small


---------68:26----------
little window has made me just feel


---------68:28----------
uncontrollably sad


---------68:30----------
and i have that image in my mind


---------68:49----------
yeah the image in my mind


---------68:52----------
and um


---------68:56----------
i just remember how much my my brother


---------68:58----------
and my mother


---------69:00----------
loved me you know i was just like


---------69:03----------
a year to a year or two ago


---------69:06----------
i just went my brother had this


---------69:09----------
i can't even [ __ ] talk now he had


---------69:12----------
this like chest


---------69:13----------
full of like everything he had collected


---------69:23----------
and he had like a he had these game boy


---------69:26----------
files it was a gameboy blue


---------69:31----------
gameboy red and one of the files was


---------69:35----------
he like named the file after me and


---------69:41----------
i opened up the file i just logged into


---------69:43----------
the game


---------69:45----------
he completed everything 100


---------69:52----------
he just he just misses me you know


---------69:57----------
and i just feel like i was just running


---------70:01----------
away


---------70:02----------
because i can't face this [ __ ] man


---------70:06----------
i can't face this [ __ ]


---------70:11----------
okay mitch i'm gonna say something weird


---------70:14----------
to you that you're probably gonna


---------70:16----------
push back against i'll ask you a


---------70:19----------
question


---------70:20----------
is it okay to not be able to face it


---------70:25----------
no it's not okay because


---------70:30----------
there's no one else that will you know


---------70:32----------
there's no one else that will


---------70:34----------
so if i if i don't


---------70:39----------
i'm gonna have to die with this paint


---------70:42----------
you are i know this is gonna sound


---------70:44----------
[ __ ] weird mitch but i want you to


---------70:46----------
listen okay i want you to use whatever


---------70:48----------
ounce of energy you have to listen to my


---------70:50----------
words can you do that right now


---------70:55----------
probably not maybe not


---------71:00----------
yeah if you give me like one second man


---------71:02----------
yep i i can listen just give me one


---------71:04----------
second yeah


---------71:05----------
yeah you want to take a break for a bit


---------71:07----------
go wash your face something like that


---------71:08----------
compose yourself


---------71:10----------
i'm sorry if i'm keeping you up i don't


---------71:12----------
know i don't know how this


---------71:13----------
you know i don't know man well looks


---------71:16----------
like we opened pandora's box so we're


---------71:17----------
gonna put it in order okay


---------71:19----------
we're here bro there's no rush


---------71:32----------
god man it's like everything that i ran


---------71:35----------
from


---------71:37----------
like you know i ran from this i met the


---------71:39----------
streaming people that i met


---------71:42----------
and now i can't even talk to them man


---------71:44----------
like


---------71:47----------
this world it's just so weird and like


---------71:51----------
i swear it's just like


---------71:54----------
i don't know man i don't know


---------72:04----------
all right yeah i'm gonna take a second


---------72:06----------
okay yeah take a second


---------72:20----------
all right so i guess if people are


---------72:22----------
watching


---------72:25----------
i forgot for a second that this is being


---------72:27----------
streamed


---------72:29----------
all right so let's take this opportunity


---------72:31----------
all of us to take a second


---------72:33----------
okay so feelings can be powerful they


---------72:36----------
can control


---------72:37----------
us um


---------72:40----------
and that's okay and that


---------72:44----------
you know learning how to tolerate


---------72:46----------
feelings sit with feelings


---------72:49----------
letting them out is absolutely like an


---------72:53----------
important part of this process


---------72:54----------
if we want to heal


---------73:00----------
all right i've collected myself a bit i


---------73:02----------
apologize


---------73:05----------
what are you apologizing for


---------73:09----------
i don't know i just need to keep myself


---------73:11----------
put together you know i just apologize


---------73:16----------
for


---------73:18----------
i don't know just everything i don't


---------73:21----------
think you did anything wrong


---------73:24----------
i'm worried i did yep i understand that


---------73:27----------
you're worried and i understand that


---------73:28----------
your instinct is to apologize


---------73:31----------
and i think what happened is


---------73:35----------
let's be honest i pushed you a little


---------73:37----------
bit i felt like there was something


---------73:39----------
important there


---------73:41----------
and you


---------73:45----------
you have a pandora's box


---------73:48----------
and i have i have a soul that bleeds


---------73:52----------
so hard yep and everyone just views me


---------73:55----------
as this person that i created and i hate


---------73:58----------
that person it's like i live like a


---------73:59----------
double life and i i


---------74:01----------
my life is [ __ ] weird man


---------74:04----------
yeah so mitch like this is why i have


---------74:06----------
hope for you because


---------74:08----------
in this moment you are no longer living


---------74:10----------
a double life


---------74:12----------
there is no longer the dude on the


---------74:14----------
inside and the dude on the outside


---------74:17----------
and you ask how can you heal from this


---------74:19----------
well you opened a window in this


---------74:21----------
it smells like [ __ ] in there and so the


---------74:24----------
the smell that comes out is so


---------74:26----------
overwhelming there's so much emotional


---------74:28----------
pain there's so much negativity


---------74:31----------
but the whole reason that it's in there


---------74:33----------
is because you never open up the window


---------74:36----------
you've just made a huge step forward and


---------74:39----------
when it comes to your brother you're


---------74:40----------
right that if you are not there for him


---------74:42----------
you will die with this pain


---------74:45----------
mitch how old are you i'm turning 29 in


---------74:49----------
two days


---------74:50----------
and how long are you gonna be alive


---------74:54----------
i don't know so let's say that like


---------74:57----------
if i carry this pain and this stress


---------75:00----------
i've learned enough about health that


---------75:02----------
that [ __ ] will probably end up giving me


---------75:04----------
some sort of illness that i don't want


---------75:06----------
so yep so let's say that average


---------75:09----------
average life expectancy in the u.s is 72


---------75:12----------
or so so you've got about 43 years


---------75:16----------
left if you have chronic illness you


---------75:17----------
knock off 10 off of that


---------75:19----------
so you've got 33 years left


---------75:22----------
so this is where i want i know it's


---------75:24----------
gonna be hard because you feel guilty


---------75:26----------
for abandoning your brother


---------75:28----------
okay but i think this is where like do


---------75:31----------
you need to be there for them


---------75:32----------
i for him i'm gonna say yeah and if you


---------75:35----------
say because no one else will


---------75:37----------
i will say yes mitch you are correct


---------75:40----------
that is your dharma that is your duty


---------75:43----------
and


---------75:45----------
you don't need to do it right this


---------75:47----------
second


---------75:51----------
yeah right you i honestly had a hard


---------75:54----------
time i had a hard time


---------75:56----------
every time i would call him i've caught


---------75:58----------
i called him


---------75:59----------
i i visited actually uh like a


---------76:02----------
couple years ago uh on like christmas


---------76:06----------
and wherever they have him they have him


---------76:09----------
on a lot of drugs


---------76:10----------
i think that's just part of how the


---------76:12----------
system works here


---------76:13----------
where it's like we deem you unfit for


---------76:16----------
society


---------76:17----------
so we put you on drugs but that's the


---------76:19----------
last thing he needed they have


---------76:21----------
they have uh just dampened my brother


---------76:25----------
to a point where he's just complacent


---------76:28----------
and there's no


---------76:31----------
he's not like i he needs help


---------76:35----------
okay so i i


---------76:38----------
understand that i i may have a slightly


---------76:41----------
different perspective


---------76:42----------
but that's neither here nor there but i


---------76:44----------
think like in my mind your road is


---------76:47----------
pretty clear


---------76:48----------
and you're walking it right so this


---------76:50----------
started with you streaming at the age of


---------76:52----------
20 becoming successful developing an


---------76:55----------
ego getting involved in drama


---------76:58----------
starting to die on the inside yeah


---------77:02----------
running away from the true pain yeah yep


---------77:04----------
and then you


---------77:05----------
started waking up and you lost byron and


---------77:08----------
that was hard for you and it was hard


---------77:10----------
for me and it was hard for everyone


---------77:11----------
oh it was so hard for me man yep


---------77:15----------
dude he was like the one i talked to him


---------77:17----------
about this [ __ ]


---------77:19----------
and he knew what he knew all this [ __ ] i


---------77:22----------
talked to him we had so many heart to


---------77:24----------
hearts about [ __ ]


---------77:25----------
yeah and byron was someone that


---------77:29----------
had been in this streaming world so long


---------77:31----------
too that we were both


---------77:32----------
so [ __ ] over it man and


---------77:36----------
oh man i just wish i could talk to him


---------77:38----------
one more time


---------77:42----------
well i mean i know it sounds kind of


---------77:45----------
weird but


---------77:46----------
mitch you can talk to him


---------77:52----------
right like you may not be able to hear


---------77:54----------
his words but you can still talk to him


---------77:58----------
i do i literally [ __ ] send i [ __ ]


---------78:02----------
i'm crazy bro like i literally dm his


---------78:05----------
twitter every now and then like he's


---------78:07----------
there


---------78:07----------
i'm sick yo man


---------78:22----------
i don't know there's very few people


---------78:24----------
that you meet in this world that


---------78:26----------
will listen to you and he listened to me


---------78:29----------
you know


---------78:34----------
so mitch i know this is going to sound


---------78:36----------
kind of weird i think that that has been


---------78:38----------
your experience so far


---------78:41----------
but what i'm seeing right now makes me


---------78:44----------
hopeful that there are a lot of people


---------78:46----------
in this world that if you give them the


---------78:50----------
chance


---------78:50----------
they will listen and maybe this is a


---------78:52----------
consequence of streaming and [ __ ]


---------78:54----------
because


---------78:54----------
like you said you know there's always an


---------78:56----------
ulterior motive so people who are like


---------78:58----------
streaming like this is a challenge that


---------79:00----------
we see is like


---------79:01----------
you're in the business of friendship


---------79:04----------
right yeah


---------79:05----------
exactly it's it's all like


---------79:08----------
half of it is like a sham in my eyes


---------79:12----------
half of it is just like i want to be


---------79:14----------
friends with x person because x person


---------79:16----------
can do this for me and like


---------79:18----------
it's so empty dude it is


---------79:22----------
empty as [ __ ] and like i don't


---------79:25----------
understand


---------79:26----------
why people want to be that why


---------79:29----------
do you want to be like if why do you


---------79:32----------
want to feel like me in the end nobody


---------79:34----------
you know what i mean like so


---------79:36----------
mitch let that go as best as you can


---------79:41----------
okay and recognize that when you make


---------79:46----------
your music


---------79:47----------
you are taking one step closer to


---------79:49----------
connecting when you share this today and


---------79:52----------
you


---------79:52----------
open the pandora's box and all the


---------79:54----------
emotion comes rushing out


---------79:56----------
and it feels overwhelming you are taking


---------79:59----------
one step closer to being like authentic


---------80:02----------
and like letting that healing process


---------80:04----------
begin this is what healing looks like


---------80:08----------
you know surgery ain't pretty it's not


---------80:11----------
like wow where you see these beautiful


---------80:13----------
green pluses


---------80:15----------
and a bar fills up


---------80:22----------
like healing is more like blood magic


---------80:24----------
like


---------80:25----------
in reality right it's like you pay the


---------80:28----------
price


---------80:29----------
to fuel that healing


---------80:34----------
yeah and like i paid the price like i i


---------80:36----------
i've done some work to deal with this


---------80:38----------
but as soon as i go


---------80:42----------
a little deep even like alone like this


---------80:44----------
this comes out in me and like this is


---------80:46----------
where i was at when i was making music


---------80:47----------
you know i was like


---------80:49----------
this would come out and i would just be


---------80:50----------
sitting there like writing


---------80:52----------
and like just putting it into like words


---------80:54----------
i guess and like to me


---------80:56----------
that was sort of therapeutic but it


---------80:58----------
doesn't fix the problem you know


---------81:00----------
yeah so i think you've done a lot on


---------81:02----------
your own but bro


---------81:05----------
this is where like you're right like i


---------81:07----------
don't know that


---------81:09----------
it's the i mean i'm sure you can because


---------81:11----------
you're still


---------81:12----------
young i mean you've got you've made a


---------81:14----------
lot of good breakthroughs and you'll


---------81:15----------
keep making breakthroughs


---------81:17----------
but this is where i'd say bro don't walk


---------81:18----------
this journey alone this is not a journey


---------81:20----------
you need to walk along


---------81:22----------
i understand why you feel alone i


---------81:25----------
understand that there have been people


---------81:27----------
in your life who


---------81:28----------
should have been very close to you and


---------81:29----------
like that has like you know your dad


---------81:31----------
kind of dumped that [ __ ] on you


---------81:33----------
and then you know there have been people


---------81:35----------
who have you haven't been able to


---------81:36----------
connect to


---------81:38----------
but this is where you need to party up


---------81:40----------
this is not a single player game anymore


---------81:42----------
making music sure


---------81:45----------
i feel like making music is more of a


---------81:47----------
way


---------81:48----------
it's more of a deeper way of doing my


---------81:50----------
job if that makes sense


---------81:52----------
you know like uh i just feel like as a


---------81:54----------
streamer i couldn't i had to just


---------81:57----------
i had to you know like nobody wants to


---------82:00----------
watch this [ __ ] you know what i mean


---------82:01----------
like people want to watch a happy person


---------82:03----------
playing a game


---------82:04----------
but like with music like people can


---------82:06----------
relate and there's a message and a story


---------82:08----------
and it's like


---------82:09----------
it's it's it's it's authentic you know


---------82:11----------
and that's why i felt like


---------82:13----------
i yeah yeah mitch your music has


---------82:16----------
the pain has purpose when it comes to


---------82:19----------
your music


---------82:20----------
and so i can totally respect that but


---------82:24----------
you know that's like that's one part of


---------82:26----------
your journey that i think is awesome


---------82:27----------
that you've been watching but there's


---------82:28----------
like


---------82:29----------
this is the blind spot that i'm talking


---------82:31----------
about like


---------82:32----------
this [ __ ] needs to be dealt with


---------82:34----------
directly


---------82:36----------
right like you need to share these


---------82:38----------
stories and


---------82:39----------
let them out of your soul when you say


---------82:41----------
your soul bleeds on the inside


---------82:43----------
yeah that's because it's like stuck full


---------82:45----------
of knives and like you're not pulling


---------82:47----------
them out


---------82:49----------
because when you pull that knife out the


---------82:50----------
blood starts spurting more


---------82:53----------
yeah and then when the blood spurts more


---------82:55----------
i'm in fear


---------82:56----------
of how you know people will like i don't


---------82:59----------
want to be attacked


---------83:00----------
when i'm opening myself up on the most


---------83:02----------
vulnerable level because i have


---------83:04----------
i i have been attacked before you know


---------83:06----------
on a wide scale


---------83:07----------
and like i know like that pain as well


---------83:10----------
you know the pain of being widely hated


---------83:12----------
by the internet


---------83:12----------
my that was my reality for like two


---------83:14----------
years and it like


---------83:16----------
it was like it was it was mainly hurting


---------83:18----------
my ego which i learned to get away from


---------83:20----------
that and not really


---------83:22----------
give a [ __ ] about that side of things as


---------83:24----------
much as more which i'm glad i made that


---------83:26----------
development as well but like i'm in fear


---------83:28----------
that if i pull the knives out on a scale


---------83:30----------
where it's not just me alone in a room


---------83:32----------
by myself that i'll just bleed out


---------83:34----------
until i'm dead you know yes like so so


---------83:37----------
bro listen like very simply right


---------83:39----------
you've got 32 years left


---------83:44----------
and so what i want you to do very dying


---------83:46----------
at 60.


---------83:48----------
yeah if you this this [ __ ] keeps going


---------83:50----------
right and i'd give yourself like two or


---------83:52----------
three years


---------83:54----------
like honestly i'd give yourself two or


---------83:56----------
three years to put yourself in a good


---------83:58----------
head space


---------83:59----------
before you help your brother but should


---------84:01----------
you help him yes


---------84:03----------
absolutely are you the only one who can


---------84:05----------
probably


---------84:07----------
yeah and so like i i get that he's kind


---------84:09----------
of medicated out and stuff like that but


---------84:11----------
that too i mean they're


---------84:13----------
you know i know it sounds kind of weird


---------84:14----------
you just gotta trust me on this one as a


---------84:16----------
psychiatrist sometimes


---------84:17----------
there are people i see their fam i see


---------84:19----------
family members


---------84:20----------
who come and see like their chronically


---------84:23----------
mentally ill


---------84:25----------
family and they're devastated by what


---------84:27----------
they see but honestly like


---------84:30----------
there are some places that are pretty


---------84:32----------
good where people are actually happy


---------84:33----------
there i know it sounds crazy


---------84:36----------
yeah i know it sounds absolutely crazy


---------84:38----------
but like


---------84:39----------
there is happiness to be found in a


---------84:41----------
mental hospital and way too many people


---------84:44----------
fall in love that's a whole different


---------84:46----------
problem but


---------84:47----------
anyway i just when i visited there it


---------84:49----------
didn't seem like an environment where he


---------84:51----------
could thrive to the fullest that's all


---------84:53----------
so so i i can't comment on that facility


---------84:56----------
but


---------84:56----------
you know i i know it sounds shocking and


---------84:58----------
it can be emotionally painful to accept


---------85:00----------
but like


---------85:01----------
having worked in some of those


---------85:02----------
facilities i i know if that i had family


---------85:05----------
members who were like that


---------85:07----------
like i would actually be willing to send


---------85:09----------
them there because i know that


---------85:10----------
life on the outside can actually be


---------85:12----------
harder


---------85:13----------
right some anyway this is this i'm


---------85:15----------
getting off into yeah you kind of come


---------85:17----------
coming back to you my point to you is


---------85:19----------
that you know i would


---------85:20----------
to a certain degree trust what your mind


---------85:22----------
is telling you but also recognize that


---------85:25----------
like


---------85:26----------
you know if you that for now this may


---------85:30----------
not be quite as bad for your brother is


---------85:32----------
emotionally


---------85:33----------
you think it is because your feelings of


---------85:35----------
abandonment are gonna amplify


---------85:38----------
the situation that you see him in does


---------85:40----------
that make sense


---------85:41----------
yeah so i'm not saying you shouldn't get


---------85:43----------
him out of there i'm not saying you


---------85:44----------
shouldn't do more for him by all means


---------85:46----------
do both of those things


---------85:47----------
but cut yourself a little bit of slack


---------85:51----------
right because you were thrust into this


---------85:53----------
situation at the age of 23


---------85:55----------
and the responsibility for your brother


---------85:57----------
while it's unfortunate that all of it


---------85:59----------
falls onto you


---------86:00----------
you can't be expected to bear it right


---------86:03----------
away


---------86:05----------
yeah so be patient with yourself


---------86:08----------
not only that my my mother as well my


---------86:10----------
it's not just my brother it's my mother


---------86:12----------
as well so


---------86:13----------
i will say this to you in the strongest


---------86:16----------
possible way so when you say it's hard


---------86:18----------
to be vulnerable because you've been


---------86:19----------
punished


---------86:20----------
so what you need more than anything else


---------86:22----------
mitch is a regular person i would highly


---------86:25----------
recommend therapy


---------86:26----------
where you can go in on a weekly basis


---------86:29----------
and share this [ __ ] open one tiny window


---------86:33----------
at a time


---------86:36----------
yeah i've never actually given therapy


---------86:38----------
uh 100


---------86:40----------
of a try i have spoken to people but


---------86:43----------
it was just it just didn't get anywhere


---------86:46----------
yeah so i think that you probably


---------86:50----------
the spiritual fortitude that you've


---------86:52----------
developed over the last year


---------86:54----------
will hopefully help you


---------86:58----------
handle therapy like a little bit better


---------87:00----------
and get more out of it maybe you just


---------87:01----------
weren't ready yet


---------87:02----------
but i think now that you've done all of


---------87:04----------
this personal work


---------87:06----------
it's time to start cleaning out the


---------87:08----------
cellar


---------87:10----------
and you're right that if you pull


---------87:11----------
everything out of your soul all at once


---------87:14----------
alone there's gonna be too much bleeding


---------87:17----------
out that happens


---------87:18----------
that's exactly what happened to me when


---------87:19----------
i went into this i went into this alone


---------87:21----------
and was trying to just deal with the


---------87:22----------
pain through


---------87:23----------
just like body like manipulation i guess


---------87:26----------
you know


---------87:26----------
and um it worked like i was bleeding but


---------87:30----------
holy [ __ ] i was bleeding so hard that i


---------87:32----------
didn't even want to continue


---------87:34----------
you know and it's like that was


---------87:37----------
very like some of the moments that i hit


---------87:40----------
in in those times when i truly opened up


---------87:43----------
even alone


---------87:44----------
were almost were too much you know and i


---------87:47----------
can't even imagine


---------87:48----------
if i was that person with you know


---------87:52----------
telling to somebody else you know it


---------87:53----------
just feels like you're even


---------87:55----------
it's it's weird you know i don't know i


---------87:57----------
had a couple eye-opening moments though


---------87:59----------
when i was


---------88:00----------
trying to deal with this on my own so


---------88:02----------
mitch you are i think


---------88:03----------
an amazing example an amazing example


---------88:07----------
of the benefits and shortcomings


---------88:10----------
of spirituality when it comes to dealing


---------88:13----------
with something incredibly traumatic


---------88:16----------
because there's no doubt in my mind that


---------88:17----------
you've come a very long way on your own


---------88:19----------
it's amazing


---------88:20----------
like even that one story is like


---------88:24----------
absolutely heartbreaking and


---------88:25----------
soul-shattering there's


---------88:27----------
man there's so many more yep so we're


---------88:29----------
not going to go there


---------88:31----------
okay so now i'm going to set a limit if


---------88:33----------
i can


---------88:34----------
because i think we don't we want to like


---------88:35----------
we want to do this sort of like


---------88:38----------
you know like yeah once yeah yeah right


---------88:41----------
so i think that's healthy


---------88:42----------
anything more than that i think would


---------88:44----------
feel a little bit too much


---------88:46----------
yeah right so i appreciate you for real


---------88:48----------
i feel i feel


---------88:49----------
like after i've calmed down i feel a


---------88:51----------
little like a little


---------88:52----------
like i don't feel as heavy i guess i


---------88:54----------
feel a little bit like better


---------88:56----------
i still feel like i have a lot to do and


---------88:59----------
there's you know


---------88:59----------
but i do feel a bit better thank you


---------89:02----------
yeah you're welcome


---------89:03----------
bro you're right you have a [ __ ] ton to


---------89:04----------
do but this is how we


---------89:06----------
have to teach you you have to learn how


---------89:08----------
to do it in a safe way right


---------89:10----------
like you don't go jumping into the


---------89:11----------
pacific ocean it's like let's step into


---------89:13----------
the kiddie pool


---------89:15----------
let's try swimming four feet let's


---------89:18----------
yeah you know kiddie pool sounds good


---------89:21----------
yeah


---------89:22----------
and and i think bro like it's amazing


---------89:24----------
like you've done awesome stuff with diet


---------89:26----------
and it sounds like you're you know


---------89:27----------
making


---------89:28----------
music and it's like very authentic and i


---------89:30----------
think it's really unfortunate but


---------89:32----------
you know the most beautiful art is


---------89:34----------
created by the most painful life and


---------89:38----------
that's why as a society we love


---------89:40----------
art right because it speaks to us on a


---------89:43----------
level that like


---------89:45----------
you know an artist that painted a


---------89:47----------
painting 700 years ago


---------89:50----------
can talk to you today you can feel


---------89:52----------
connected with them


---------89:56----------
so like i don't know this is gonna this


---------89:57----------
is gonna sound kind of random i'm gonna


---------89:58----------
say this to kind of light in the mood


---------90:00----------
you know that song in the air tonight by


---------90:02----------
phil collins


---------90:04----------
i do the one that was it was in tarzan i


---------90:06----------
think no


---------90:07----------
i don't know what movies is that but


---------90:09----------
it's one of these songs where like i


---------90:10----------
don't know what the [ __ ] he's talking


---------90:12----------
about


---------90:13----------
because the lyrics are so damn vague he


---------90:15----------
just says i can feel it coming in the


---------90:17----------
air tonight


---------90:18----------
that's all he says yeah and i have no


---------90:22----------
idea


---------90:22----------
idea what he's talking about but i


---------90:24----------
understand him a hundred percent


---------90:26----------
um yeah that's why music is special i


---------90:28----------
feel like even if you haven't gone to


---------90:30----------
the depths of pain that the person is


---------90:31----------
speaking of


---------90:32----------
there's a human consciousness that can


---------90:34----------
sort of connect with it


---------90:35----------
absolutely so like you walk that


---------90:37----------
spiritual journey


---------90:38----------
you create your music have it be part of


---------90:41----------
your growth


---------90:41----------
have it be part of your therapy yeah and


---------90:44----------
also


---------90:46----------
work with someone else don't bear this


---------90:48----------
[ __ ] alone


---------90:50----------
right but you see why the music helps me


---------90:52----------
though it's like


---------90:53----------
if i can't share this in a way through


---------90:55----------
words it's like


---------90:56----------
i'm i'm looking for deep connections


---------90:58----------
right so if


---------90:59----------
if i can deeply connect with somebody


---------91:02----------
out there through music then i've done


---------91:04----------
that's what i'm looking for love


---------91:06----------
whatever you want to call it you know


---------91:07----------
some sort of


---------91:08----------
thing that isn't just on the surface


---------91:10----------
like i really strive to


---------91:12----------
for that can you tell me a little bit


---------91:15----------
about


---------91:16----------
your music yeah what what about it


---------91:20----------
just tell me about it well and what in


---------91:23----------
specific


---------91:24----------
what do you mean so i understand what


---------91:27----------
you're striving to do what have you met


---------91:29----------
like what are you conveying through your


---------91:31----------
music


---------91:33----------
my story you know the my


---------91:36----------
uh my my little album that's coming out


---------91:38----------
on my birthday and


---------91:39----------
three two days is like it's it just


---------91:42----------
tells a story you know


---------91:44----------
and uh so yeah i'm trying to just convey


---------91:47----------
my


---------91:48----------
story in in little windows like you said


---------91:51----------
um and be able to relate


---------91:55----------
on a level where i feel like i can


---------91:57----------
connect with people


---------91:58----------
because i felt like as a streamer i was


---------92:00----------
having difficulty connecting with people


---------92:04----------
awesome man yeah


---------92:07----------
mitch you've really come a long way dude


---------92:10----------
thank you bro


---------92:11----------
i appreciate you saying that for real it


---------92:13----------
means a lot to me thank you


---------92:15----------
i'm going to do my best not to get


---------92:17----------
emotional but i'm going to toss this


---------92:18----------
last one out i feel really


---------92:20----------
if it's it's heartbreaking to me that


---------92:22----------
you've had to come so far


---------92:24----------
on your own and if i if i had if i could


---------92:27----------
change


---------92:28----------
one if i had a magic wand that could


---------92:29----------
change one thing in your life


---------92:32----------
i wouldn't try to take away your journey


---------92:35----------
um because i think it's important and


---------92:37----------
healthy to walk the journeys that where


---------92:38----------
we walk even if they're painful the only


---------92:40----------
thing that i wish is that you didn't


---------92:42----------
have to walk it alone


---------92:44----------
yeah i appreciate you for saying that


---------92:47----------
even after just talking to you i don't


---------92:49----------
feel as alone as i did


---------92:50----------
you know i feel like you were able to


---------92:52----------
listen to me


---------92:54----------
and um thank you for that i


---------92:57----------
this was very scary for me and i still


---------92:59----------
am worried


---------93:00----------
you know but it's all good i feel like


---------93:03----------
uh


---------93:04----------
that's part of you know me just


---------93:07----------
accepting things for what they are


---------93:10----------
yeah man i i think it makes sense to me


---------93:13----------
that this


---------93:13----------
felt good and it's scary because i think


---------93:16----------
learning how to trust


---------93:18----------
is going to be a slow process the


---------93:20----------
saddest thing is very hard for me


---------93:22----------
very very very very hard for me


---------93:25----------
the saddest thing about trust is that it


---------93:28----------
can take a lifetime to build and a


---------93:29----------
moment to shatter


---------93:32----------
yeah for sure and that that's another


---------93:34----------
thing with the you know the the music is


---------93:36----------
like


---------93:37----------
uh i'll on friday at like


---------93:40----------
oh it's scheduled for like 3 p.m i'm


---------93:42----------
doing like a live


---------93:43----------
or like a performance or whatever and


---------93:45----------
i'm like i'm really anxious that that


---------93:46----------
you know but i feel like that's going to


---------93:48----------
help me just like be in that


---------93:50----------
moment like those like flow state


---------93:51----------
moments where you can really just be


---------93:53----------
yourself like those are the kind of the


---------93:54----------
moments i like live for


---------93:56----------
you know and uh i'm


---------93:59----------
just looking forward to trying something


---------94:01----------
different whether people


---------94:02----------
[ __ ] on me or not i'm just going to keep


---------94:05----------
pushing my head


---------94:06----------
face strong into the [ __ ] brick wall


---------94:07----------
until it collapses you know like i'm


---------94:09----------
just


---------94:09----------
i'm just going to keep going man yeah


---------94:11----------
man


---------94:13----------
yeah mad respect i i think


---------94:17----------
here's what i'd say to you mitch like


---------94:19----------
you kind of said whether people like it


---------94:21----------
or don't like it


---------94:22----------
it's not about what people like or don't


---------94:24----------
like it's about what you have to offer


---------94:27----------
yeah so if you're doing a live stream


---------94:29----------
some you know what i'd say to you is


---------94:30----------
like you may be worried


---------94:32----------
oh what if i screw up or whatever like


---------94:33----------
it's not about screwing up or doing a


---------94:35----------
good job


---------94:36----------
it's about giving us whatever you have


---------94:39----------
to offer yeah i'm just very nervous i


---------94:42----------
you know


---------94:43----------
i haven't streamed i haven't streamed in


---------94:44----------
six months and i'm doing


---------94:46----------
something completely different and it's


---------94:49----------
just


---------94:50----------
it just you know it's just a little


---------94:52----------
nerve-wracking it's all


---------94:53----------
yeah i can imagine man i do not i do not


---------94:57----------
envy you


---------94:59----------
yeah for sure i don't think anyone dies

i i i you know it was kind of weird i

you know i know we've communicated a


---------98:58----------
little bit


---------98:58----------
prior to the stream but i i actually


---------99:01----------
haven't listened


---------99:02----------
to it i found emotionally for some


---------99:04----------
reason it was hard for me and i'm i'm


---------99:06----------
beginning to think maybe that was


---------99:08----------
karmic in some way oh it is loaded


---------99:11----------
emotionally yeah for sure yeah i just i


---------99:13----------
couldn't bring myself to


---------99:15----------
to listen to it for some reason um


---------99:18----------
but i think maybe that was the


---------99:21----------
universe's way of


---------99:23----------
telling me to you know wait until it was


---------99:25----------
time and it seems like it's time


---------99:27----------
in a couple of days yeah no it would


---------99:30----------
