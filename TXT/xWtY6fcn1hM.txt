---------00:11----------
so what do you go by


---------00:14----------
a mass of roxa what do you prefer


---------00:19----------
uh i guess we can go with proxa okay


---------00:22----------
that's one of the most people in the


---------00:24----------
community broxah it is


---------00:26----------
and um thanks for coming on broxah um


---------00:30----------
and uh so any questions about how this


---------00:33----------
works or anything like that


---------00:35----------
do you want some need some orientation


---------00:37----------
oh no not really i feel like


---------00:40----------
i have a decent idea of what what's


---------00:42----------
about to happen okay what it's about


---------00:44----------
so tell us what's about to happen


---------00:47----------
explain it to us


---------00:48----------
yeah i'm curious what's about to happen


---------00:50----------
okay


---------00:51----------
well you are gonna


---------00:55----------
some shitties are about to get wrecked


---------01:01----------
well i guess you'll be directing me


---------01:03----------
through a solid and healthy conversation


---------01:06----------
about


---------01:07----------
toxicity and general mentality within


---------01:10----------
the gaming community


---------01:12----------
and in this case the pro gaming


---------01:14----------
community in particular since i'm a pro


---------01:15----------
player


---------01:16----------
okay um yeah so i think that that's a


---------01:19----------
great way to describe


---------01:20----------
um what we try to do here so let me see


---------01:22----------
if i can um add kind of a caveat


---------01:25----------
for to it so brock's i think what i'd


---------01:27----------
really love to do is


---------01:28----------
help learn about you as a person


---------01:31----------
and kind of use so what we do at


---------01:34----------
healthygamer is we we try to like look


---------01:36----------
at


---------01:36----------
individual people's experiences to give


---------01:39----------
us an


---------01:39----------
insight into like broader phenomenon


---------01:42----------
right so instead of like getting


---------01:44----------
let's say a psychological expert to talk


---------01:46----------
about incels


---------01:47----------
we actually want to talk to and in cell


---------01:49----------
about what their experience is


---------01:51----------
and i think that when when we sort of


---------01:53----------
have that one-on-one perspective


---------01:55----------
it actually gives us a lot of insight


---------01:56----------
into the community as a whole


---------01:59----------
um the other big thing that i'd love to


---------02:01----------
do today if i can in


---------02:03----------
any way shape or form is actually help


---------02:04----------
you as a person


---------02:06----------
so if there's anything that you um


---------02:09----------
you know i have a pretty varied


---------02:10----------
background so if there's any


---------02:12----------
thing that i've studied or learned or


---------02:15----------
had experience with that you think could


---------02:17----------
help you


---------02:18----------
that's really my main goal um and


---------02:22----------
and so if we learn about toxicity in the


---------02:25----------
you know pro-gaming community along the


---------02:27----------
way like that's totally cool but i'm


---------02:28----------
really here to


---------02:29----------
you know kind of have a one-on-one


---------02:30----------
conversation and try to help you if i


---------02:32----------
can


---------02:34----------
sound good yeah yeah sounds really good


---------02:36----------
so can you just tell me a little bit


---------02:38----------

---------02:40----------

---------03:15----------

---------03:17----------
okay wow congratulations thanks


---------03:21----------
and so um can you help me understand


---------03:23----------
like how you got to playing law like


---------03:25----------
when did you start playing league of


---------03:26----------
legends


---------03:28----------
well i guess i could go back to the


---------03:31----------
beginning of gaming and


---------03:34----------
yeah so i've been gaming almost as


---------03:37----------
far back as i can remember it started


---------03:39----------
when i was maybe


---------03:41----------
i don't know let's say five years old


---------03:43----------
playing game boy playing a lot of


---------03:45----------
pokemon


---------03:46----------
on my my game boy um i have two older


---------03:49----------
cousins who i've already


---------03:51----------
always looked up to a lot and they


---------03:53----------
started playing pokemon and game boy so


---------03:55----------
of course i had to do


---------03:56----------
do the same later they transfer to pc


---------03:59----------
games


---------04:00----------
starting with world of warcraft and they


---------04:02----------
taught me how to play world of warcraft


---------04:04----------
i got into that


---------04:05----------
later we moved on to league of legends


---------04:08----------
how old were you when you


---------04:09----------
started playing world of warcraft


---------04:14----------
must have been around eight nine years


---------04:16----------
old or so wow


---------04:17----------
okay i was pretty young i think it was


---------04:20----------
like third grade or something in school


---------04:22----------
so it was it was pretty early and how


---------04:25----------
old you said you were about five when


---------04:26----------
you started playing pokemon


---------04:29----------
yeah that's that would be my guess so


---------04:31----------
usually when i would start with


---------04:33----------
with these games i would be very young


---------04:36----------
compared to


---------04:36----------
the general player base and i wouldn't


---------04:38----------
really know what i was doing


---------04:40----------
so i would have my cousins helping me


---------04:43----------
learn the game and like in world of


---------04:46----------
warcraft for example


---------04:47----------
i i remember really clearly what


---------04:48----------
happened because they


---------04:50----------
showed me the game and i don't know how


---------04:53----------
familiar


---------04:54----------
you are with world of warcraft but the


---------04:56----------
way that the game functions yeah is that


---------04:58----------
you you create a character you go around


---------05:00----------
you


---------05:00----------
you do quests and you gain experience


---------05:02----------
right and


---------05:03----------
i didn't really understand how this game


---------05:05----------
worked so instead of picking up the


---------05:07----------
quests and doing


---------05:08----------
i guess what you're supposed to do in


---------05:10----------
the game i just found some monsters


---------05:12----------
around and i killed them


---------05:14----------
and i just walked around killing


---------05:15----------
monsters and then eventually


---------05:18----------
i couldn't really gain more experience


---------05:19----------
because they're all


---------05:21----------
good yeah they were all grey they were


---------05:23----------
too low level and i was just kind of


---------05:25----------
stuck there not knowing what to do


---------05:26----------
because i didn't know quests existed so


---------05:28----------
i deleted the character created a new


---------05:29----------
one and i repeated you know


---------05:31----------
that was my experience like i had no


---------05:34----------
clue what i was doing right


---------05:35----------
and then eventually later on one of my


---------05:37----------
cousins came in and he


---------05:39----------
he showed me the way you know and i feel


---------05:42----------
like


---------05:42----------
in general for me when it comes to


---------05:43----------
gaming that's that's


---------05:45----------
like how i got into it that's how my


---------05:47----------
experience has been and even


---------05:50----------
can i just a couple more questions about


---------05:51----------
so what was that like when you


---------05:53----------
discovered that you were kind of doing


---------05:57----------
it wrong


---------05:58----------
do you remember when they showed you the


---------06:01----------
way


---------06:03----------
i don't remember exactly what my


---------06:05----------
reaction to i guess


---------06:07----------
if anything i was just impressed and you


---------06:10----------
know i was already looking up to my


---------06:11----------
cousins right and then i was like


---------06:13----------
wow these guys are so smart they're so


---------06:15----------
good at the game i remember here with


---------06:16----------
world of warcraft


---------06:18----------
i was just making random characters and


---------06:19----------
then my older costume appeared on his


---------06:22----------
his warlock on you know his horse and


---------06:25----------
with his little imp


---------06:26----------
and his different demons and i was like


---------06:27----------
wow you know this guy he looks cool like


---------06:29----------
i want to be a warlock too


---------06:31----------
and then i created a warlock and now


---------06:33----------
looking back on world of warcraft my


---------06:35----------
oldest character is this warlock that i


---------06:37----------
created back then


---------06:38----------
because my of my cousin coming to to


---------06:40----------
show me how to do quests and all that


---------06:42----------
right


---------06:43----------
wow and and can you tell me about your


---------06:45----------
cousins


---------06:47----------
yeah so my cousins are three and six


---------06:50----------
years older than me


---------06:52----------
okay and um that obviously means they've


---------06:56----------
in general they've always been a bit


---------06:58----------
more experienced when we when they got


---------06:59----------
into games they've


---------07:00----------
had a better understanding because i was


---------07:02----------
the young one i sure


---------07:04----------
i was younger i didn't really understand


---------07:06----------
english to begin with


---------07:08----------
and yeah in general i come from a game


---------07:11----------
of family


---------07:12----------
most of my my close family a lot of my


---------07:14----------
family in general


---------07:16----------
has played different games at one point


---------07:18----------
with world of warcraft in particular


---------07:20----------
uh you know half of the family like


---------07:23----------
my mom dad sister my uncle


---------07:27----------
cousins you know wow it was like a


---------07:28----------
family thing almost like


---------07:31----------
and um that has always been really


---------07:33----------
exciting so in general games have always


---------07:35----------
been a really big part of my life


---------07:38----------
so if your parents are playing world of


---------07:40----------
warcraft they're just letting you run


---------07:42----------
around


---------07:43----------
kill boars delete characters and make


---------07:45----------
them again like they didn't


---------07:46----------
teach you what no they got into the game


---------07:48----------
later oh okay


---------07:51----------
they were the type of parents who were


---------07:53----------
because i was so


---------07:55----------
caught up into the game i was so excited


---------07:56----------
about this game right


---------07:58----------
so they started playing the game as well


---------08:00----------
it was like


---------08:01----------
play with me and learn the game


---------08:03----------
alongside me and so kind of helped me


---------08:05----------
when i was a bit confused and didn't


---------08:07----------
know what was going on


---------08:09----------
that actually sounds really rare i i


---------08:11----------
very rarely hear about parents picking


---------08:13----------
up a video game because their kid is


---------08:15----------
interested in it


---------08:17----------
it is a bit of a rare thing um


---------08:20----------
and in that sense i definitely have some


---------08:22----------
pretty cool parents with pokemon on game


---------08:24----------
boy


---------08:25----------
it's the same i mean my mom my mom


---------08:28----------
learned how to play pokemon because her


---------08:30----------
little kid had no clue how to proceed on


---------08:33----------
a bus and i sat there getting so


---------08:34----------
angry you know and i just kept kept


---------08:37----------
dying and dying and i didn't know


---------08:38----------
how to proceed and then she would come


---------08:40----------
in and show me like


---------08:41----------
oh hey mass this is how you do i just


---------08:43----------
read up on this and then


---------08:45----------
you know i could proceed and go go


---------08:47----------
further in the game


---------08:48----------
so she would see that you were


---------08:50----------
frustrated and would actually go and


---------08:52----------
read about pokemon and then help you


---------08:54----------
through it


---------08:55----------
yes that's the that's the level where


---------08:58----------
we're speaking of here


---------09:02----------
that sounds quite remarkable to me


---------09:05----------
yeah i have been i've been very lucky in


---------09:08----------
that since there's no doubt about that


---------09:10----------
yeah you know it's interesting because


---------09:11----------
you said you you've been playing league


---------09:12----------
of legends for four years and you're 23


---------09:15----------
years old


---------09:15----------
no so i've played league of legends


---------09:17----------
professionally for four years


---------09:19----------
yeah i've played league of legends i


---------09:22----------
started playing league of legends like


---------09:24----------
10 11 years ago but it's four years ago


---------09:27----------
that i i started like actually playing


---------09:29----------
it professionally


---------09:31----------
yeah so i i think that that's


---------09:33----------
interesting because when i think about a


---------09:34----------
19 year old pro league of legends player


---------09:37----------
you know you know we hear about these


---------09:38----------
like people like


---------09:40----------
um who are like you know start playing


---------09:43----------
chess for example at a really young age


---------09:45----------
and you have parents that will like


---------09:47----------
encourage them arguably even force them


---------09:50----------
to play chess will find tutors for them


---------09:52----------
there's a lot of like support


---------09:54----------
right from the family to support this


---------09:56----------
hobby which then becomes a profession


---------09:58----------
and and this is the first time i've


---------10:00----------
talked to a lot of pro gamers worked


---------10:02----------
with a lot of pro gamers


---------10:03----------
i mean most of them have a pretty common


---------10:05----------
story which is that they're


---------10:07----------
you know they had some problems actually


---------10:09----------
growing up and things were hard in some


---------10:11----------
way


---------10:12----------
and and it seems like your parents were


---------10:13----------
actually like quite supportive of your


---------10:15----------
gaming


---------10:16----------
which is not very common definitely


---------10:20----------
i that there was periods where they were


---------10:22----------
not fully supportive of it


---------10:24----------
because they thought it was it was a bit


---------10:26----------
too much and


---------10:27----------
i remember there was a period as well


---------10:29----------
when i was


---------10:31----------
i don't know let's say in fourth fifth


---------10:32----------
grade where i had


---------10:34----------
that they thought i was playing way too


---------10:36----------
much world of warcraft so eventually i


---------10:38----------
had


---------10:39----------
one day a week where i was not allowed


---------10:41----------
to play video games at all


---------10:43----------
and then the other days i could it was a


---------10:45----------
bit more free but this one day


---------10:47----------
i wasn't allowed to to touch my pc and i


---------10:49----------
could go outside and play football or


---------10:51----------
read a book or whatever it may be and


---------10:54----------
and how did you


---------10:55----------
do you remember how you felt or how you


---------10:57----------
reacted or what that conversation was


---------10:59----------
like where they said


---------11:01----------
no games for one day well i wasn't


---------11:04----------
i wasn't too happy about it at least


---------11:06----------
initially but


---------11:08----------
to be fair it's i felt like it was kind


---------11:11----------
of fair


---------11:13----------
because i had so much freedom in general


---------11:15----------
compared to


---------11:16----------
a lot of my friends and especially now


---------11:19----------
you know hearing a lot of other people's


---------11:20----------
stories i can easily see that i did have


---------11:22----------
a lot of freedom


---------11:23----------
and my parents were really supportive


---------11:26----------
and while


---------11:27----------
sometimes i thought it was a bit boring


---------11:29----------
not being able to sit as a pc


---------11:31----------
i think it was a good opportunity as


---------11:33----------
well to just do other things and have


---------11:35----------
other interests


---------11:36----------
especially because they were so nice


---------11:38----------
even letting me


---------11:40----------
like at the start of the week i could be


---------11:41----------
like uh


---------11:43----------
this week i'm not gonna play on


---------11:44----------
wednesday or then the next week i'll be


---------11:46----------
like i'm not gonna play on friday and i


---------11:48----------
could even choose myself for it and then


---------11:50----------
i could just pick whichever day and then


---------11:52----------
i could make plans with a friend to go


---------11:54----------
play football or


---------11:55----------
like interesting do whatever you know do


---------11:57----------
a lot of homework whatever it may be


---------11:59----------
right


---------11:59----------
so plan a bit around it if i if i'm kind


---------12:02----------
of filling in the gaps a little bit


---------12:04----------
brock so what i'm hearing is that


---------12:05----------
actually because your parents


---------12:07----------
were so supportive you seem to be more


---------12:10----------
okay with their restrictions


---------12:13----------
yes i think that is fair to say yeah


---------12:17----------
can you tell me about your parents


---------12:20----------
so yeah so my parents


---------12:25----------
uh well my mom is an accountant my dad


---------12:28----------
is a what's it called in english like a


---------12:30----------
train


---------12:31----------
conductor i believe those people that


---------12:33----------
control the trains check people's


---------12:34----------
tickets all that kind of stuff make sure


---------12:36----------
everything is functioning and


---------12:40----------
i don't come from i feel like i come


---------12:43----------
from a pretty


---------12:45----------
average family in the sense that we we


---------12:48----------
were not poor but we were not rich


---------12:49----------
either


---------12:51----------
so growing up i had everything i needed


---------12:54----------
i never had the feeling that


---------12:56----------
you know i was missing out on something


---------12:58----------
or if i if i wanted something then


---------13:00----------
i would usually have it but we were not


---------13:02----------
the family to go on


---------13:04----------
expensive holidays or whatever either of


---------13:07----------
my


---------13:07----------
my my parents were kind of prioritizing


---------13:10----------
time


---------13:11----------
uh with me and my sister rather than


---------13:14----------
you know just constantly working and in


---------13:16----------
that sense growing up i've always


---------13:19----------
i guess appreciate it i appreciate this


---------13:21----------
family time appreciated


---------13:23----------
spending time with the people around me


---------13:25----------
because


---------13:27----------
while them being home a little bit more


---------13:30----------
than perhaps some other parents meant


---------13:32----------
that we didn't have a big load of money


---------13:35----------
we had a lot of great moments and


---------13:38----------
opportunities to spend


---------13:39----------
spend time together


---------13:43----------
yeah it sounds like they really


---------13:44----------
prioritize prioritize


---------13:46----------
time with you yeah definitely


---------13:49----------
and supporting you and it sounds like


---------13:51----------
you have a sister


---------13:53----------
yeah i have a i have two siblings


---------13:55----------
actually um so


---------13:56----------
i grew up with my sister my little


---------13:59----------
sister was three years younger than me


---------14:01----------
and i have a little brother who is


---------14:03----------
15 years younger than me who i'm slowly


---------14:06----------
turning into a little


---------14:07----------
a little gamer he's already starting to


---------14:09----------
talk about fortnite and doing his


---------14:11----------
fortnight dances and all that good stuff


---------14:14----------
so soon enough we'll get them on the


---------14:15----------
legends hype train but for now


---------14:17----------
it's fortnite focused yeah


---------14:20----------
you know it's interesting i have a


---------14:22----------
five-year-old and three-year-old


---------14:24----------
and um i you know i tried to teach my fi


---------14:28----------
i try to teach my five-year-old how to


---------14:29----------
play games cause you know i'm a pretty


---------14:31----------
big gamer


---------14:31----------
she seemed to be relatively uninterested


---------14:34----------
and


---------14:35----------
and you know like i tried to teach her


---------14:36----------
like mario kart and stuff because like


---------14:38----------
you know i had the i had the wheel


---------14:40----------
and so i was thinking oh she's gonna


---------14:41----------
have the wheel and you know her brain is


---------14:43----------
new so it can learn how to do things


---------14:44----------
quickly


---------14:45----------
she just is not that interested as it


---------14:47----------
turns out my three-year-old


---------14:49----------
um so you know when they're now they're


---------14:50----------
pretend playing it seems like like my


---------14:52----------
three-year-old is one of us


---------14:54----------
because so so my older one pretends to


---------14:57----------
be like a queen


---------14:58----------
and a princess and has like teacups and


---------15:00----------
things like that and the younger one


---------15:02----------
is um the most recent character


---------15:05----------
she was pretending to be was a dragon


---------15:07----------
that was dual wielding a sword and a


---------15:09----------
knife


---------15:10----------
and so i was very surprised because i've


---------15:13----------
never showed her dual wielding


---------15:14----------
which i was really surprised because but


---------15:16----------
she was like yeah i have a dagger in one


---------15:18----------
hand and i have a


---------15:19----------
knife in the other and and so


---------15:22----------
the older one is queen of the you know


---------15:25----------
queen of whatever kingdom


---------15:26----------
and then the younger one says i'm queen


---------15:28----------
of the demons


---------15:31----------
and it's bizarre but you know maybe


---------15:33----------
she's one of us


---------15:35----------
um it certainly would appear so what's


---------15:38----------
up


---------15:39----------
yeah go ahead sorry uh it's it's a while


---------15:42----------
ago i showed my


---------15:43----------
my little brother league of legends for


---------15:44----------
the first time he was probably


---------15:46----------
i know four or five years old and you


---------15:49----------
know i was


---------15:50----------
i was sitting at my my dad's place my


---------15:53----------
parents are divorced now


---------15:55----------
um and i was playing league of legends


---------15:58----------
and


---------15:58----------
this little guy was sitting on my lap


---------16:01----------
and i i just wanted to enter a normal


---------16:03----------
game i don't even remember if it was


---------16:04----------
normal or against bots because


---------16:06----------
it was pretty hard playing with this


---------16:07----------
little guy sitting there and trying to


---------16:09----------
control my keyboard and all sorts but


---------16:12----------
i'm then going into the game he he


---------16:15----------
decided that we were going to play fizz


---------16:17----------
to champion fizz and then he found this


---------16:20----------
great skin


---------16:20----------
where it's basically a rabbit a rabbit


---------16:23----------
skin


---------16:24----------
and we were we were having a great game


---------16:26----------
and we were walking around killing


---------16:28----------
everyone and


---------16:28----------
you know every time we got a kill he was


---------16:30----------
like yay and cheering for me and


---------16:32----------
now it still happens sometimes you know


---------16:35----------
he's like


---------16:36----------
mass when are we gonna play the rabbit


---------16:38----------
again i want to see you on the on the


---------16:39----------
rabbit or


---------16:40----------
if he watches one of my one of you know


---------16:43----------
the games i play with my team he's like


---------16:45----------
why didn't you play the rabbit


---------16:48----------
which is pretty cool good question mass


---------16:51----------
why didn't you play the rabbit like no


---------16:54----------
it's disappointing


---------16:55----------
i know but that's the way it goes i


---------16:57----------
guess does he understand


---------16:59----------
um so i know we're supposed to be


---------17:01----------
talking about toxicity in league of


---------17:03----------
legends and whatnot


---------17:04----------
is it okay that we're like talking about


---------17:05----------
this yeah it's fine


---------17:08----------
so does he understand that you're a pro


---------17:10----------
gamer


---------17:11----------
he does he so


---------17:15----------
when i when i played for fanatic


---------17:18----------
i was pretty fortunate in the sense that


---------17:20----------
fnatic had these


---------17:22----------
you know the all teams do these player


---------17:24----------
jerseys and stuff it's fnatic there's


---------17:26----------
player jerseys and shorts in like size


---------17:29----------
for a free four year old or something


---------17:32----------
and my little brother got one of these


---------17:34----------
and he was


---------17:35----------
taking his shirt on um in well i guess


---------17:38----------
it would have been kindergarten back


---------17:39----------
then


---------17:40----------
and he was going my dad was telling me


---------17:42----------
that he was going around in kindergarten


---------17:44----------
and being like oh


---------17:44----------
look guys i have a fanatic shirt on and


---------17:47----------
hey do you know that my


---------17:49----------
my big brother is broxah you know


---------17:51----------
bragging so to the people working that


---------17:53----------
what not


---------17:55----------
yeah he is he's a very


---------17:58----------
supportive little brother too and he he


---------18:00----------
does know quite a bit about


---------18:02----------
gaming and what not by by now i think


---------18:05----------
i i guess i'm a i'm both a good and bad


---------18:08----------
example in a sense because


---------18:10----------
i'm sure that eventually my uh my dad


---------18:13----------
and his girlfriend


---------18:14----------
i'm gonna have a bit of a difficult time


---------18:16----------
getting this guy away from the pc


---------18:18----------
because he's just gonna point at me and


---------18:19----------
be like what do you mean my brother's


---------18:20----------
playing video games all day long but


---------18:22----------
yeah but but yeah he does he does


---------18:25----------
know and understand what what my job is


---------18:29----------
what's it like to have a little brother


---------18:31----------
who looks up to you so much


---------18:34----------
it's uh


---------18:38----------
i don't know i'm trying to find a word


---------18:40----------
to describe it but i guess if


---------18:42----------
anything it just it's just really


---------18:45----------
interesting and exciting and


---------18:47----------
i guess it's i feel sometimes that it


---------18:49----------
puts some pressure on me and


---------18:50----------
as well in a way to you know perform and


---------18:53----------
to live up to this


---------18:54----------
this little guy's expectations


---------18:58----------
but in a sense when it comes to that um


---------19:03----------
like my family in general has never


---------19:05----------
really put too much


---------19:08----------
value on like they don't care too much


---------19:11----------
about


---------19:12----------
i mean they care about how i perform and


---------19:14----------
how my team is doing


---------19:16----------
but usually the moments where i have


---------19:19----------
felt


---------19:20----------
that like my mom for example has been


---------19:22----------
the most proud of me was when i had like


---------19:24----------
a really good


---------19:25----------
interview where i acted really


---------19:27----------
professional or nice


---------19:28----------
rather than when i was at my absolute


---------19:31----------
peak as a player


---------19:33----------
because usually when i perform as a


---------19:34----------
player and when the team is doing really


---------19:36----------
well


---------19:36----------
they're happy because i'm happy yeah


---------19:39----------
and when we're not doing so well you


---------19:41----------
know they don't really appreciate it


---------19:43----------
because i'm kind of


---------19:44----------
sad and frustrated but usually they've


---------19:46----------
been the most proud in some of those


---------19:48----------
moments


---------19:48----------
with with things happening out of the


---------19:51----------
game


---------19:52----------
and for my for my little brother i don't


---------19:55----------
know it's probably a bit of a mix of


---------19:57----------
everything because he doesn't really see


---------19:58----------
everything with


---------19:59----------
in the same light i mean he's probably


---------20:01----------
the most excited to know that i'm a pro


---------20:02----------
gamer right


---------20:04----------
yeah i i it seems it sounds to me like


---------20:06----------
your parents don't


---------20:08----------
you know your parents value you


---------20:12----------
outside of your performance in your job


---------20:15----------
yes exactly right so it actually sounds


---------20:18----------
quite different i don't know if you've


---------20:19----------
heard the term


---------20:20----------
tiger parents no not really


---------20:23----------
so it's it's like parents who um


---------20:27----------
want their children to be really really


---------20:29----------
successful and almost like use their


---------20:31----------
children like trophies so i i grew up in


---------20:35----------
the indian community where


---------20:36----------
um three out of the five indian kids


---------20:40----------
in my school became doctors okay


---------20:43----------
and and usually the first words out of


---------20:45----------
my mom's mouth when she's talking about


---------20:47----------
someone that i haven't heard of in 10 or


---------20:49----------
15 years


---------20:50----------
is whether they're a doctor or not okay


---------20:53----------
and and so you know some cultures and


---------20:55----------
some parents will want their children to


---------20:57----------
be


---------20:57----------
my parent my mom is not a tiger parent


---------20:59----------
by any means but


---------21:00----------
um you know they really want their


---------21:02----------
children to be like successful


---------21:04----------
and like if their children go to


---------21:06----------
prestigious universities or have


---------21:08----------
prestigious jobs or make lots of money


---------21:10----------
that makes them like really really happy


---------21:12----------
and they like value their kids for being


---------21:14----------
successful


---------21:16----------
sounds like your parents really were not


---------21:18----------
like that


---------21:19----------
or aren't like that oh like i could


---------21:23----------
i could quit being a pro gamer and


---------21:27----------
i could go back to my studies and i


---------21:29----------
could i could


---------21:30----------
become whatever it may be and obviously


---------21:33----------
there's


---------21:34----------
some you know they're proud of me for


---------21:36----------
what i've accomplished and they're proud


---------21:38----------
of me for


---------21:39----------
you know being a pro gamer in in a sense


---------21:43----------
but


---------21:44----------
they wouldn't care if i was


---------21:47----------
working at a supermarket or whatever it


---------21:50----------
it may be working at mcdonald's


---------21:52----------
like as long as that's what made me


---------21:54----------
happy they would be


---------21:55----------
happy too the other thing that i wanted


---------21:59----------
to just point out is


---------22:00----------
i'm noticing a remarkable similarity


---------22:02----------
between


---------22:04----------
what your cousins did for you and what


---------22:06----------
you're doing for your brother yeah i


---------22:13----------
i guess you could you could say that in


---------22:14----------
a way


---------22:16----------
how does it do like i'm just i'm


---------22:18----------
noticing it on the surface


---------22:20----------
if you is that thought ever crossed your


---------22:22----------
mind that because it kind of seems like


---------22:23----------
you're shepherding your brother in the


---------22:25----------
way that your cousins like kind of


---------22:26----------
shepherded you


---------22:29----------
i think for me it's gonna be maybe maybe


---------22:32----------
somewhat perhaps a middle ground between


---------22:34----------
the two


---------22:36----------
partly because usually um


---------22:40----------
like i don't get to see my family that


---------22:41----------
much because i'm i'm


---------22:43----------
traveling and i'm away from most of the


---------22:45----------
year uh


---------22:47----------
like this year for example i was away


---------22:49----------
for eight months and


---------22:52----------
oftentimes when i'm home and i'm on


---------22:53----------
holiday i don't


---------22:55----------
i don't feel like playing as much i


---------22:57----------
oftentimes i want to get away from the


---------22:59----------
pc


---------22:59----------
because i sit in front of it playing


---------23:01----------
league of legends all day for so much of


---------23:03----------
the year


---------23:04----------
so i don't think my brother feels like


---------23:06----------
he plays


---------23:07----------
as many games with me as he wants to


---------23:10----------
because


---------23:11----------
he wants to play 24 7 right and i


---------23:14----------
i want to play a bit but i want to do


---------23:15----------
other things too so


---------23:17----------
i'm i'm the type of big brother who


---------23:20----------
does play games with him but who also


---------23:23----------
tries to get him to


---------23:25----------
you know go play football or get away


---------23:27----------
wow get away for good


---------23:29----------
i think he's very lucky to have you


---------23:30----------
broxah because it sounds like


---------23:34----------
i i hope i hope so yeah it sounds like


---------23:36----------
you're teaching him a lot about


---------23:37----------
balance and gaming right that you can


---------23:39----------
have fun but you should also prioritize


---------23:41----------
other things this is coming from someone


---------23:42----------
who plays games for a living


---------23:44----------
so i i hope he hears that message loud


---------23:47----------
and clear


---------23:48----------
um i hope so too and and tell me a


---------23:52----------
little bit about


---------23:53----------
um so i i guess we've got kind of two


---------23:56----------
directions i know i've been asking you


---------23:57----------
about a lot of stuff that has nothing to


---------23:58----------
do with league of legends or toxicity


---------24:00----------
so you know i'm a little bit curious


---------24:02----------
about two things so i'll let you kind of


---------24:04----------
pick unless and of course if you want to


---------24:05----------
talk about something by all means dive


---------24:07----------
into it one is we sort of left off


---------24:09----------
with you discovering league of legends


---------24:11----------
so we could kind of pick back up with


---------24:13----------
you starting to play league of legends


---------24:15----------
how you became a pro


---------24:17----------
um uh option two is i'm a little bit


---------24:20----------
curious about um


---------24:21----------
your parents divorce and just what that


---------24:23----------
was like if you feel like that's worth


---------24:25----------
talking about


---------24:26----------
um and then the third thing would be you


---------24:29----------
know if you just want to talk about


---------24:30----------
toxicity and like


---------24:31----------
kind of cut straight to the chase we can


---------24:33----------
do that because we've been kind of


---------24:34----------
you know we've been sitting in the lobby


---------24:36----------
for a while now


---------24:39----------
um but you know what


---------24:42----------
i don't know i we could go for option


---------24:46----------
one or two i guess and get to the the


---------24:48----------
toxicity stuff a bit later okay


---------24:50----------
can you just tell me uh quickly just a a


---------24:53----------
quick overview of


---------24:54----------
your understanding of why your parents


---------24:55----------
got divorced and what that was like for


---------24:57----------
you


---------24:59----------
um i don't think i want to go into


---------25:01----------
exactly why they got the most


---------25:03----------
but i can i can explain kind of what is


---------25:06----------
what it was like


---------25:08----------
so um as a as a kid


---------25:13----------
it never seemed like my parents had any


---------25:14----------
problems actually they were


---------25:16----------
they seemed really happy together our


---------25:18----------
family was really happy and yeah


---------25:20----------
certainly i was having a really nice


---------25:22----------
childhood


---------25:23----------
um but then uh kind of what seemed like


---------25:27----------
from


---------25:27----------
from one day to another we were sitting


---------25:30----------
at the dinner table and you know


---------25:32----------
they they sat there telling me and my


---------25:33----------
sister like hey


---------25:35----------
we uh we're gonna we're gonna break up


---------25:37----------
we're gonna have a divorce


---------25:39----------
and at first i was very surprised


---------25:42----------
because


---------25:43----------
i didn't really see it coming i didn't


---------25:44----------
really expect it


---------25:46----------
and it was it was pretty difficult at


---------25:49----------
times


---------25:50----------
dealing with um especially when


---------25:53----------
seemingly it came


---------25:54----------
kind of out of nowhere right


---------25:57----------
and i think in a sense


---------26:00----------
after that gaming was a bit of an escape


---------26:04----------
at least at times because i was already


---------26:05----------
gaming a lot right but


---------26:07----------
um most people this that when when


---------26:10----------
they're dealing with something if


---------26:11----------
they're stressed if they're having


---------26:12----------
negative emotions sometimes just


---------26:14----------
opening up a video game and just living


---------26:17----------
through like


---------26:18----------
that experience at least for a couple of


---------26:19----------
hours can help take focus away from all


---------26:21----------
the


---------26:22----------
the frustrating things you're dealing


---------26:23----------
with so through


---------26:25----------
some of those periods i definitely was


---------26:28----------
was using it a little bit


---------26:29----------
uh as an escape but at the same time


---------26:33----------
they were not having like a really bad


---------26:35----------
divorce or brutal divorce by any means


---------26:37----------
they actually


---------26:38----------
handle it really well and um even now my


---------26:41----------
parents can still


---------26:42----------
you know have conversations together and


---------26:44----------
whatnot so


---------26:45----------
um that that's also pretty lucky that we


---------26:48----------
avoided a lot of those problems that


---------26:50----------
some parents are having when they're


---------26:51----------
having intervals


---------26:53----------
yeah i mean part of the reason that i


---------26:55----------
asked is because i was a little bit


---------26:56----------
surprised to hear that your parents did


---------26:58----------
get divorced because


---------26:59----------
you know just like you said it's kind of


---------27:01----------
unexpected right


---------27:03----------
yeah um i think i think that's how it


---------27:06----------
was for


---------27:06----------
a lot of people back then it was a bit


---------27:08----------
unexpected and then


---------27:10----------
when something unexpected happens that


---------27:12----------
kind of catches you a bit of god then


---------27:14----------
you get a bit stressed you get a bit out


---------27:15----------
of it and during


---------27:17----------
those periods where i didn't feel that


---------27:19----------
great about it


---------27:21----------
um i don't remember if i was playing


---------27:23----------
world of warcraft or league back then


---------27:24----------
but whichever i was i was using the game


---------27:26----------
as


---------27:27----------
a bit of an escape sometimes and you


---------27:28----------
know just grinding grinding the game


---------27:31----------
and what was difficult about it for you


---------27:36----------
um


---------27:39----------
i don't know i guess most of all all the


---------27:42----------
uncertainties all the the question marks


---------27:46----------
because i was happy with our family


---------27:49----------
sure and in general i'm not the type of


---------27:51----------
person who appreciates


---------27:53----------
change if something is working you know


---------27:54----------
i don't i don't want it to change and


---------27:56----------
for me as a kid


---------27:57----------
life was great you know we were having a


---------27:59----------
great little family and i didn't want


---------28:01----------
anything to change in that family


---------28:04----------
and i i think that was the the toughest


---------28:06----------
thing to deal with and i'm sure that's


---------28:07----------
how


---------28:08----------
um a lot of a lot of kids or teenagers


---------28:12----------
or even


---------28:12----------
older people feel when their parents get


---------28:14----------
divorced right it's it's a big change


---------28:16----------
and


---------28:17----------
sometimes it can be stressful and kind


---------28:19----------
of confusing to


---------28:21----------
understand what's happening and navigate


---------28:23----------
through that well yeah because it's


---------28:25----------
really hard to understand what's


---------28:26----------
happening right it doesn't


---------28:27----------
seem to make sense you don't know what


---------28:29----------
the future is going to hold


---------28:31----------
you really like the way your family is


---------28:32----------
now you don't


---------28:34----------
all you know is that it's going to


---------28:35----------
change


---------28:38----------
it can't be good because you're pretty


---------28:40----------
happy with what you have now


---------28:43----------
yeah exactly it's hard man i hear you


---------28:47----------
um yeah so and so it sounds like you


---------28:50----------
started playing league of legends when


---------28:51----------
you were like maybe


---------28:52----------
13 12 13 something like that yeah


---------28:55----------
exactly


---------28:56----------
around around that i i got into league


---------29:01----------
and again one of my my cousins


---------29:03----------
introduced me to the game


---------29:05----------
i still remember it pretty clearly


---------29:06----------
because we were gonna have our own


---------29:08----------
little two-man


---------29:09----------
land party and play most of the night


---------29:11----------
and


---------29:12----------
back then i was really into world of


---------29:14----------
warcraft like i i


---------29:16----------
loved world of warcraft so much and i


---------29:19----------
thought we were just going to play world


---------29:20----------
of warcraft all night but then


---------29:21----------
eventually at some point in the evening


---------29:22----------
he was like


---------29:23----------
hey mass i found this new game that i


---------29:25----------
want to show you and


---------29:27----------
then you know i installed league of


---------29:28----------
legends and


---------29:30----------
we played a couple of games and i don't


---------29:32----------
think it took more than a couple of


---------29:34----------
months


---------29:34----------
and i was uh i was better than he was


---------29:37----------
all of a sudden because i had just been


---------29:39----------
playing it so much and i was so excited


---------29:41----------
and into it and the same thing happened


---------29:44----------
with both pokemon


---------29:45----------
and world of warcraft by the way like


---------29:47----------
they they were


---------29:49----------
so good at these games and it was so


---------29:50----------
hard for me to catch up but eventually i


---------29:52----------
would just be


---------29:54----------
be so hooked that i i don't think


---------29:57----------
i necessarily got better better than


---------29:59----------
them at world of warcraft but i was


---------30:00----------
definitely spending


---------30:01----------
my fair share of hours improving and


---------30:04----------
learning


---------30:05----------
about the game and and how did you


---------30:08----------
can you tell us what the journey of


---------30:09----------
becoming a pro looked like


---------30:13----------
yes so in


---------30:16----------
so with pokemon with world of warcraft


---------30:19----------
and


---------30:19----------
even the first five six years of playing


---------30:22----------
league of legends


---------30:23----------
i was just playing for fun i just


---------30:25----------
thought it was really fun i enjoyed


---------30:26----------
playing


---------30:28----------
after school with with my friends and


---------30:32----------
for league of legends in particular in


---------30:34----------
the first season


---------30:35----------
i was not great at the game i was i


---------30:38----------
think i ended


---------30:38----------
the first season in bronze uh which was


---------30:41----------
the absolute lowest dragon of players


---------30:44----------
the next season i i climbed up a bit


---------30:47----------
towards gold


---------30:48----------
and then season 3 in my first year


---------30:51----------
that's when i really started playing the


---------30:53----------
game seriously and i


---------30:55----------
i started actually meeting some of the


---------30:58----------
pro players in my games and started


---------31:00----------
proving in that sense and in my my first


---------31:04----------
year


---------31:05----------
of high school i like i just slowly


---------31:08----------
started taking it


---------31:09----------
more seriously started playing a bit


---------31:10----------
more solo because


---------31:12----------
i really enjoyed the competitive part of


---------31:14----------
it that i


---------31:15----------
i hadn't experienced that much before


---------31:17----------
sure and it fit really


---------31:18----------
it kind of resonated with me because i'm


---------31:20----------
a really competitive person


---------31:22----------
as well so i was just playing a lot of


---------31:25----------
solo games climbing the ladder


---------31:28----------
and in my my first year of high school


---------31:31----------
i got to challenge her top 200


---------31:34----------
in europe for the first time but


---------31:37----------
even then i just thought it was a cool


---------31:40----------
achievement i didn't really consider


---------31:41----------
becoming a pro player and


---------31:43----------
i think more than anything my i mean my


---------31:46----------
friends really enjoyed bragging about


---------31:48----------
knowing a challenger and when we saw the


---------31:50----------
game and they were


---------31:51----------
you know they they started bragging and


---------31:52----------
all chat about how they have to


---------31:54----------
challenge you on the enemy team doesn't


---------31:56----------
you know they were having a lot of a lot


---------31:57----------
of fun and bragging


---------31:59----------
bragging for me but i just enjoyed


---------32:02----------
the competitive side of it meeting pro


---------32:05----------
players was really exciting getting to


---------32:06----------
play against them


---------32:08----------
um get to know some of them and just


---------32:10----------
learn


---------32:11----------
how did the pro player life functions


---------32:13----------
it's interesting i'm not hearing that


---------32:15----------
you brag very much but it seems like a


---------32:17----------
lot of people about


---------32:18----------
around you brag about you


---------32:21----------
i don't know maybe i brag sometimes


---------32:24----------
maybe maybe some of my


---------32:26----------
my family friends um or girl girlfriends


---------32:29----------
consider me a person that brags about


---------32:31----------
myself i don't think i'm the worst


---------32:33----------
offender at this


---------32:34----------
um but yeah anyways


---------32:38----------
then in the so


---------32:41----------
in my in my second year of high school


---------32:43----------
um


---------32:45----------
i was invited by some danish friends to


---------32:47----------
start playing in danish lad events and


---------32:49----------
tournaments around denmark


---------32:51----------
so we were traveling from city to city


---------32:54----------
and


---------32:54----------
i don't know how many tournaments we


---------32:56----------
played maybe five or so but we basically


---------32:59----------
won all of them and


---------33:01----------
uh earned a little bit of money for that


---------33:03----------
which was which was great because


---------33:05----------
i was just in school i wasn't learning


---------33:07----------
anything at the time


---------33:09----------
and then


---------33:12----------
even then it was just you know it was


---------33:14----------
just fun like i just enjoyed it there


---------33:15----------
was a great experience and i


---------33:17----------
i didn't really want the team that


---------33:19----------
practiced a lot because


---------33:23----------
i wanted to have time for for friends


---------33:25----------
and school


---------33:26----------
and family and it kind of fits really


---------33:30----------
well with the way that


---------33:32----------
i've been growing up and what my parents


---------33:34----------
have taught me which is that


---------33:36----------
um that there should be time for games


---------33:39----------
or whatever i want to do


---------33:42----------
but the main thing is that i take care


---------33:44----------
of my homework and that


---------33:45----------
i'm actually doing my job in school


---------33:48----------
because what happens with a lot of


---------33:49----------
people and what i've seen with


---------33:51----------
a lot of the people in my classes um


---------33:54----------
wait are you in school and a pro player


---------33:58----------
no i i'm not in school anymore okay


---------34:01----------
but yeah what happens to


---------34:05----------
a lot of people is that they just get so


---------34:08----------
addicted to


---------34:09----------
games or whatever it may be and then


---------34:11----------
they stop doing homework entirely so


---------34:13----------
it's like they're doing well on the


---------34:14----------
gaming side but then they don't do


---------34:16----------
anything on the school side and


---------34:18----------
life kind of falls apart where my


---------34:20----------
parents made it really clear that i


---------34:21----------
could play games


---------34:23----------
but i have to do my homework otherwise


---------34:25----------
there's no mercy yeah


---------34:26----------
that's kind of the deal we had which


---------34:28----------
which was fair so


---------34:29----------
in high school i when i started getting


---------34:31----------
invites to


---------34:32----------
similar professional professional teams


---------34:35----------
i didn't really want to do it because i


---------34:36----------
couldn't really


---------34:37----------
see how to make life work and how i


---------34:39----------
would be happy having both


---------34:42----------
and then when i finished high school all


---------34:45----------
right before i finished high school i


---------34:47----------
had a conversation


---------34:48----------
with my mom about about my future


---------34:51----------
basically


---------34:52----------
what i wanted to do and


---------34:55----------
i couldn't really see myself continuing


---------34:58----------
my studies for that next year


---------35:00----------
i kind of needed a break and i couldn't


---------35:03----------
really see


---------35:04----------
myself in any of the possible jobs


---------35:06----------
either like i had i had pretty good


---------35:08----------
grades and


---------35:08----------
i had some different options but


---------35:12----------
you know now sitting down having that


---------35:14----------
conversation was when i really realized


---------35:16----------
wow this could be my chance to actually


---------35:19----------
make a living out of gaming to try to be


---------35:21----------
a pro player because before that i just


---------35:23----------
i just always had fun but i didn't


---------35:25----------
really consider it that way but


---------35:27----------
when i reached that point and had to


---------35:28----------
make that big decision of


---------35:30----------
going to the university or being a pro


---------35:33----------
player


---------35:34----------
i couldn't do both anymore i had to to


---------35:37----------
make a choice


---------35:38----------
because i i just wouldn't have have any


---------35:42----------
opportunity to be a competitive player


---------35:44----------
if i didn't


---------35:45----------
go for it at that point in time so then


---------35:49----------
after the the summer holiday that year


---------35:53----------
i started playing a lot more solo queue


---------35:56----------
i


---------35:57----------
spent most of my time playing solo queue


---------36:01----------
actually initially i was looking for


---------36:02----------
jobs like i looked for jobs at all the


---------36:04----------
supermarkets and


---------36:06----------
um mcdonald's wherever it may be like i


---------36:09----------
think i


---------36:09----------
searched jobs in like 50 different


---------36:11----------
places and i didn't get anything


---------36:12----------
and then i was like okay i'm not getting


---------36:15----------
any jobs anyways so you know what i'm


---------36:17----------
just going to go all in on league of


---------36:18----------
legends and hope for the best


---------36:21----------
if you got a job at mcdonald's you may


---------36:23----------
not be a pro today


---------36:25----------
yeah things would have been different


---------36:26----------
right because maybe my priorities would


---------36:29----------
have changed a bit maybe i wouldn't have


---------36:30----------
enough time to practice


---------36:32----------
yeah i don't know but so then i just


---------36:35----------
went all in


---------36:36----------
and i think that was in it's in


---------36:38----------
september maybe and


---------36:40----------
at the start of january not january at


---------36:43----------
the start of november sorry


---------36:44----------
i think it was november mid-november


---------36:46----------
maybe i got in talks with


---------36:49----------
fnatic it was by far the biggest


---------36:53----------
european esports organization at the


---------36:55----------
time


---------36:56----------
because i knew i knew that coach who


---------36:59----------
used to be a professional


---------37:01----------
player too and who i had a good


---------37:03----------
relationship with and


---------37:04----------
he was like you know what i think you're


---------37:06----------
a good player i want you on the academy


---------37:07----------
team


---------37:09----------
so i i started playing for the academy


---------37:12----------
team in


---------37:13----------
around that time end of november start


---------37:15----------
of december and


---------37:18----------
then february i was thrown right onto


---------37:21----------
the main team


---------37:22----------
and now i've been a pro player ever


---------37:25----------
since


---------37:26----------
what's it like being a pro league of


---------37:27----------
legends player


---------37:30----------
it's it's really exciting


---------37:34----------
but i i would say it's the type of job


---------37:38----------
that does


---------37:38----------
ups and downs to i think it's it's a


---------37:41----------
really awesome job but i'm really


---------37:43----------
happy about all the things i've


---------37:44----------
experienced these past four years


---------37:48----------
but there's also some downsides to it


---------37:51----------
but because it's also a really stressful


---------37:53----------
job and with my personality and the way


---------37:55----------
that


---------37:56----------
i function as a person like wanting to


---------37:58----------
balance life wanting


---------38:01----------
because as i told you like when growing


---------38:03----------
up family time


---------38:04----------
was so important and having that time


---------38:07----------
with close ones


---------38:08----------
with family friends with my girlfriend


---------38:11----------
while being a pro player while living on


---------38:13----------
the other side of the world


---------38:14----------
some of those things are kind of you're


---------38:16----------
in a relationship right now


---------38:18----------
i am in a relationship yes how long have


---------38:20----------
you been in that relationship


---------38:23----------
i have been in that relationship for


---------38:24----------
over four years


---------38:26----------
oh wow yeah so


---------38:29----------
basically well ever since i got into it


---------38:33----------
all i've been in the relationship


---------38:35----------
okay so


---------38:40----------
so you said their downsides and and


---------38:42----------
where does toxicity kind of come in


---------38:45----------
yeah so um


---------38:49----------
i guess if we


---------38:52----------
i think toxicity has been a pretty big


---------38:54----------
one that i've always had a


---------38:56----------
pretty difficult time understanding


---------38:59----------
um let's say this year in particular i


---------39:02----------
think this year is a pretty good example


---------39:03----------
for me


---------39:04----------
but it's not going to happen throughout


---------39:06----------
my entire career but this year


---------39:08----------
um i was on the other side of the globe


---------39:11----------
in la


---------39:12----------
i um was in a lockdown


---------39:15----------
my team wasn't doing too well things


---------39:17----------
were not going the way we had hoped for


---------39:20----------
and then you know


---------39:23----------
criticism hateful comments all that sort


---------39:26----------
started


---------39:27----------
appearing everywhere especially in my


---------39:30----------
private messages and the sorts


---------39:32----------
comments and social media all that good


---------39:34----------
stuff and


---------39:38----------
wait people would dm you hate messages


---------39:41----------
yeah


---------39:42----------
the way that it works in general is that


---------39:45----------
if you are a pro gamer and i don't think


---------39:48----------
this is only the case in league of


---------39:49----------
legends i think it's the case in general


---------39:51----------
you need to be really strong mentally


---------39:54----------
because


---------39:55----------
there's a lot of good things happening


---------39:57----------
but whenever something


---------39:59----------
bad happens or whenever things are not


---------40:01----------
going your way or your team's way


---------40:04----------
some people tend to forget that and


---------40:07----------
i like an example could be even


---------40:11----------
um my best year as a pro player so far


---------40:14----------
has been


---------40:15----------
2018 where we went all the way to the


---------40:18----------
world final


---------40:20----------
um and i was considered one of the best


---------40:23----------
junglers


---------40:24----------
in the world at the time and i think all


---------40:28----------
really in the next


---------40:29----------
uh split or maybe even right when we


---------40:31----------
dropped out of worlds


---------40:33----------
people started getting angry at us


---------40:35----------
because it's like this team reached the


---------40:37----------
world final but they didn't win


---------40:38----------
so they must suck you know they they


---------40:41----------
went zero free this is not good enough


---------40:43----------
they haven't represented


---------40:44----------
the region well and then obviously it's


---------40:46----------
a minority feeling that way


---------40:48----------
usually most of the time it's a minority


---------40:50----------
but


---------40:51----------
that minority kind of adds up and


---------40:55----------
recently i i put out a video


---------40:58----------
talking about all this toxicity and i


---------41:00----------
saw a lot of


---------41:01----------
pro players and influencers chiming in


---------41:04----------
saying that


---------41:07----------
kind of agreeing with me saying that


---------41:09----------
it's kind of frustrating that you


---------41:11----------
if you're a public figure you have to


---------41:14----------
deal with all these things


---------41:15----------
um because the reality is if you're a


---------41:19----------
public figure within the gaming


---------41:20----------
community if you're not really strong


---------41:22----------
mentally


---------41:23----------
you're just gonna break you're not gonna


---------41:25----------
be able to handle it because you can't


---------41:26----------
really hide


---------41:27----------
for me for example i have i have


---------41:30----------
accounts on all


---------41:31----------
possible social medias at this point


---------41:33----------
almost um


---------41:35----------
i have a youtube channel i have a twitch


---------41:37----------
stream i have all the social medias and


---------41:40----------
people have so many ways of getting


---------41:42----------
getting in touch with me or of writing


---------41:44----------
things that


---------41:46----------
i'm almost certainly gonna read right


---------41:48----------
and


---------41:49----------
for a lot of people um


---------41:52----------
one comment two comments ten comments


---------41:55----------
that are negative and hateful


---------41:58----------
doesn't mean too much but eventually it


---------42:00----------
kind of adds up right


---------42:02----------
and it becomes really difficult to deal


---------42:03----------
with to the point where


---------42:06----------
at times i feel like people are just


---------42:08----------
getting bullied


---------42:09----------
like it's just too obnoxious and there's


---------42:12----------
a really


---------42:13----------
big difference between productive


---------42:16----------
criticism or productive feedback and


---------42:20----------
really offensive language and death


---------42:22----------
threats and


---------42:23----------
all these type of things right death


---------42:25----------
threats


---------42:27----------
i i'm pretty lucky in the sense that i


---------42:31----------
haven't gotten


---------42:32----------
way too many but it would happen once in


---------42:36----------
a while that


---------42:38----------
i was part of losing a really important


---------42:40----------
game or my team lost a really important


---------42:42----------
game


---------42:43----------
and i kind of had to hide from my my dms


---------42:46----------
on twitter for a little while let's just


---------42:48----------
put it that way because again it's a


---------42:51----------
minority


---------42:51----------
but what is that what does that do to


---------42:54----------
you you say you have to be mentally


---------42:55----------
strong so let's say like i open up my


---------42:57----------
twitter


---------42:58----------
dms and like what's an example of a


---------42:59----------
message that you would see


---------43:02----------
um i mean i


---------43:06----------
i don't think i should mention some of


---------43:07----------
the worst ones i think


---------43:09----------
yeah sure but so you know some people


---------43:13----------
it could be anything from people stating


---------43:14----------
that i'm i'm bad or that i'm garbage


---------43:17----------
and that i should quit the game which is


---------43:20----------
you know


---------43:20----------
okay that's an opinion i can deal with


---------43:22----------
that it's not productive criticism but


---------43:24----------
it's an opinion


---------43:26----------
so people that say that i i shouldn't be


---------43:28----------
living life anymore and that


---------43:30----------
i i don't deserve to live and that you


---------43:32----------
know i've done all sorts of things to


---------43:34----------
their team and


---------43:36----------
that it's you know and they start saying


---------43:38----------
very bad things because of that


---------43:40----------
rate and i think


---------43:44----------
sometimes it can be a little extra as a


---------43:47----------
pro player


---------43:48----------
or as an influencer like you you get


---------43:49----------
more messages right because you're in


---------43:51----------
the spotlight


---------43:52----------
you have to listen to this more because


---------43:53----------
you're kind of an easy target in that


---------43:55----------
sense and


---------43:56----------
especially for the people streaming and


---------43:57----------
whatnot you know


---------43:59----------
the chat can be a bit a bit ruthless at


---------44:02----------
times


---------44:02----------
it doesn't take much for people to to go


---------44:05----------
off in there


---------44:06----------
but it happens to a lot of people within


---------44:09----------
the community i think that was the most


---------44:11----------
people even


---------44:12----------
uh for just you know regular


---------44:15----------
people playing the game yeah and and


---------44:18----------
what does that do to you broxah


---------44:19----------
like when you see that message what's


---------44:21----------
your experience


---------44:22----------
in those like walk me through the next


---------44:24----------
few moments of what


---------44:27----------
happens to you i i think it depends of


---------44:30----------
this


---------44:31----------
it depends a bit on the state of mind


---------44:33----------
that i'm in


---------44:34----------
um let's say if i'm in a period where


---------44:37----------
things are not working that well where


---------44:40----------
um


---------44:41----------
things are not going well with the team


---------44:42----------
where i feel like i'm not performing


---------44:44----------
that well maybe there's something


---------44:45----------
personal that i'm dealing with


---------44:47----------
it's really hard you know you see some


---------44:49----------
of these really really hateful things


---------44:51----------
and you start questioning yourself quite


---------44:52----------
heavily


---------44:53----------
and it takes quite a lot to


---------44:58----------
have all those question marks in your


---------45:00----------
head and still you know power


---------45:03----------
power through and be confident in


---------45:05----------
yourself what are the question marks


---------45:09----------
um again it could be stuff like


---------45:12----------
um am i am i good enough to play this


---------45:16----------
game am i letting the team down


---------45:19----------
am i a good enough person am i a good


---------45:22----------
example for this community


---------45:24----------
because some people perceive me this way


---------45:27----------
it could be stuff like if i am being


---------45:31----------
treated this way as a human being what


---------45:34----------
am i even doing here like why do i


---------45:36----------
bother


---------45:36----------
having this job if i just get depressed


---------45:39----------
from some of these things


---------45:40----------
people tell me why don't i have another


---------45:42----------
job where i'm being treated properly um


---------45:46----------
why do i put up with the abuse yeah


---------45:49----------
basically like why why do i put up with


---------45:51----------
this why do i have to accept this this


---------45:53----------
is


---------45:53----------
unfair this is ridiculous this is not


---------45:55----------
the way that things should be


---------45:57----------
and i think and and that's the main


---------46:00----------
issue that i feel like it it doesn't


---------46:03----------
really make sense that


---------46:06----------
you have to like you shouldn't have to


---------46:08----------
be really strong mentally to function


---------46:11----------
anywhere let's say with gaming is with


---------46:13----------
secular people play video games because


---------46:15----------
it's


---------46:15----------
it's fun you know it's just fun it


---------46:17----------
should be fun


---------46:19----------
but if you are met with a lot of hate


---------46:22----------
constantly then that's


---------46:26----------
not very very easy to deal with that's


---------46:27----------
really really difficult and


---------46:29----------
again for a pro player it's it's one


---------46:32----------
thing because


---------46:32----------
you are in the spotlight but even for


---------46:35----------
some of my my friends you know they they


---------46:38----------
can also get fed up with


---------46:40----------
playing a game and people start


---------46:44----------
slaughtering them with offensive


---------46:46----------
messages or


---------46:47----------
people at them after the game and tell


---------46:49----------
them really obnoxious things


---------46:51----------
social media i


---------46:57----------
that's a good question how do i deal


---------47:01----------
with it


---------47:01----------
um


---------47:07----------
i think the way


---------47:10----------
that i try to deal with it is


---------47:16----------
i consider myself a really strong person


---------47:19----------
mentally


---------47:21----------
and i've always been confident in myself


---------47:24----------
my own abilities um


---------47:28----------
and i think that alone has helped a lot


---------47:32----------
like no matter what i've had to go


---------47:34----------
through no matter what


---------47:36----------
problems has come my way i've just told


---------47:38----------
myself that


---------47:40----------
no i'm in this position for a reason and


---------47:42----------
i deserve to be here and


---------47:43----------
i'm good enough both as a player as a


---------47:45----------
person and then


---------47:48----------
sometimes when i felt necessary or


---------47:51----------
i i needed to vent out i would go to


---------47:53----------
some of my close ones


---------47:55----------
um i would go to a coach or a teammate


---------47:58----------
and be like hey


---------47:59----------
you know this this is bothering me this


---------48:03----------
is


---------48:03----------
on my mind people are telling me this


---------48:06----------
and that what do you think


---------48:07----------
i should what do you think about my


---------48:10----------
performance


---------48:10----------
how do you think i'm doing in terms of


---------48:13----------
the team how do you think i'm


---------48:15----------
i am i am as a person and


---------48:18----------
just to get some some proper feedback in


---------48:21----------
the way i guess you could say


---------48:22----------
yeah because obviously most of the


---------48:24----------
things that are are coming from like


---------48:26----------
external sources and from social media


---------48:30----------
people within the game whatever it might


---------48:31----------
be a lot of the


---------48:35----------
the really obnoxious comments are coming


---------48:37----------
um


---------48:39----------
i mean some of them are very


---------48:40----------
questionable and i can't really


---------48:41----------
understand why people behave that way


---------48:43----------
but some of them are just really


---------48:44----------
emotional and frustrated and they might


---------48:47----------
have their own problems to deal with


---------48:49----------
right and i just


---------48:50----------
try to tell myself okay you know if


---------48:52----------
someone


---------48:53----------
feels okay writing this to another


---------48:55----------
person then


---------48:56----------
you know i kind of feel sorry for the


---------48:59----------
person like there's no point getting


---------49:01----------
getting mad over this this problem


---------49:03----------
this person probably needs even more


---------49:04----------
help than me yeah


---------49:07----------
it's interesting because i mean you talk


---------49:08----------
about mental strength


---------49:10----------
and and i think the interesting thing


---------49:12----------
there is that you


---------49:14----------
so you have this voice when when so


---------49:17----------
here's what i'm


---------49:18----------
gonna try to piece together um


---------49:23----------
so you know this let's say you have a


---------49:25----------
bad


---------49:26----------
placement in a tournament or something


---------49:27----------
like that right and then you say you


---------49:29----------
kind of got to avoid


---------49:30----------
your dms for a while so like you open


---------49:31----------
your dms and you see a message that's


---------49:33----------
kind of hateful


---------49:34----------
they tend to pile up and then you start


---------49:36----------
to doubt


---------49:38----------
right you start to ask yourself like hey


---------49:40----------
are these guys actually right like


---------49:43----------
do i deserve to be here and then so


---------49:45----------
there's like the doubt about your


---------49:47----------
capability and there's a separate thing


---------49:48----------
which is like


---------49:49----------
it feels really unfair it feels like you


---------49:52----------
shouldn't have to put up with this


---------49:54----------
and so there's this sort of feeling of


---------49:55----------
like


---------49:57----------
yeah like it's like doubt in yourself


---------49:59----------
and also separate from that


---------50:00----------
this is unfair and i no one should have


---------50:03----------
to deal with this


---------50:04----------
you know why why do i have to do this


---------50:07----------
and then like as you start to those


---------50:10----------
those kind of feelings can kind of grow


---------50:12----------
maybe with the more messages that you


---------50:14----------
get and you can kind of discard some of


---------50:16----------
them right like you can


---------50:17----------
you can ignore 10 of them you can ignore


---------50:19----------
20 of them you can ignore 30 of them but


---------50:21----------
then


---------50:21----------
as you have all these different social


---------50:23----------
media channels and they start pounding


---------50:24----------
you from the left and the right


---------50:26----------
and like all over the place youtube


---------50:28----------
twitch


---------50:29----------
you're you're streaming and then some


---------50:31----------
haters show up in your channel and then


---------50:33----------
you log off and you open up twitter and


---------50:34----------
people are [ __ ] talking you


---------50:36----------
and it kind of piles up and then you end


---------50:38----------
up with these two doubts


---------50:40----------
and then something really interesting


---------50:41----------
happens because what i'm hearing you say


---------50:43----------
is that you actually


---------50:44----------
tell yourself i do deserve to be here


---------50:48----------
and that's a really really interesting


---------50:52----------
point because i think that a lot of


---------50:54----------
people


---------50:57----------
don't have that voice


---------51:00----------
right a lot of people actually the


---------51:02----------
really unlucky ones will actually have a


---------51:04----------
voice


---------51:05----------
telling them the opposite yeah


---------51:08----------
and some people will even have you know


---------51:11----------
positive messages


---------51:13----------
and then they have a voice in their head


---------51:14----------
that tells them that these people don't


---------51:16----------
really know who you


---------51:17----------
are they're just being nice you know


---------51:21----------
yeah for sure uh you're smiling as if


---------51:24----------
you


---------51:25----------
understand which is yeah


---------51:28----------
no i i'm just kind of thinking of what


---------51:31----------
you're saying especially about


---------51:33----------
being confident in myself and that's the


---------51:36----------
voice in my head and


---------51:38----------
in my first year as a pro player we had


---------51:42----------
we had a really good sports sports


---------51:44----------
psychologist was working with a lot


---------51:47----------
due to conf yeah confidence especially


---------51:51----------
i was so nervous like i didn't i didn't


---------51:53----------
feel ready to play for the main team


---------51:55----------
in my first games i was literally you


---------51:57----------
know physically shaking on stage


---------52:00----------
i was so nervous it was so hard to play


---------52:02----------
high-pressure games and


---------52:04----------
in the past with with exams and all


---------52:07----------
those things like


---------52:08----------
it would be the same thing like i just


---------52:09----------
couldn't perform i got too nervous


---------52:12----------
but then um this guy came in and


---------52:15----------
really helped me a lot working on my my


---------52:18----------
confidence and my


---------52:20----------
he called it negative self-talk in


---------52:21----------
particular trying to


---------52:24----------
really think about the way that i'm


---------52:28----------
like the voice in my head basically how


---------52:30----------
i'm thinking to myself and what that


---------52:31----------
voice is


---------52:32----------
is doing to me in those moments


---------52:35----------
and that's something i i got better at


---------52:39----------
and started


---------52:40----------
kind of taking with me


---------52:44----------
because i don't know


---------52:47----------
like part of why why i was was smiling


---------52:51----------
what was thinking about that and like


---------52:54----------
honestly


---------52:56----------
if i wasn't so confident in myself i


---------52:59----------
probably


---------53:00----------
i mean it's not really a feast to smile


---------53:01----------
but i can't probably would have broke at


---------53:03----------
some point like mentally i would just


---------53:05----------
have quit


---------53:06----------
which is part of why i think it's a big


---------53:08----------
problem because


---------53:10----------
i consider myself really really strong


---------53:12----------
mentally and that's probably


---------53:13----------
a lot of people out there were stronger


---------53:15----------
there's also a lot of people who are not


---------53:18----------
but if i felt that


---------53:21----------
my confidence in myself and my own


---------53:25----------
abilities


---------53:27----------
my confidence in myself as a human was


---------53:29----------
the main thing that


---------53:31----------
you know kept me going in this job and


---------53:34----------
in this community


---------53:36----------
then that's kind of a problem because


---------53:38----------
there's gonna be


---------53:39----------
countless of people out there who are


---------53:41----------
just going to kind of break mentally and


---------53:43----------
we're not going to be able to handle it


---------53:46----------
and


---------53:46----------
i i don't i don't really like the


---------53:48----------
thought of that


---------53:50----------
that's not the way things should be yeah


---------53:54----------
so i think there are a couple of uh


---------53:58----------
i guess i've got kind of two threads two


---------54:00----------
or three threads one is


---------54:01----------
i'm sure a lot of people are curious um


---------54:04----------
you know what that sports psychologist


---------54:06----------
told you and how you managed


---------54:08----------
to change that voice in your head i


---------54:10----------
think that's something that a lot of


---------54:12----------
people


---------54:13----------
are very very interested in um


---------54:16----------
another thing to kind of think a little


---------54:17----------
bit about is you say that you are


---------54:19----------
mentally strong i'd agree


---------54:20----------
and i i don't really consider that


---------54:22----------
arrogant or anything like that i think


---------54:23----------
that you do have a lot of confidence in


---------54:25----------
yourself


---------54:26----------
we can explore a little bit about where


---------54:28----------
that comes from and how to find it


---------54:31----------
the third thing um that i just want to


---------54:33----------
toss out is that sometimes especially


---------54:35----------
when it comes to issues of toxicity


---------54:37----------
we're still sort of talking in the


---------54:38----------
abstract and


---------54:41----------
you know so this is something that i


---------54:42----------
want to be really careful about


---------54:45----------
uh sometimes it can be very very helpful


---------54:48----------
to take an


---------54:48----------
actual case of raw data of


---------54:51----------
uh like and walk through it in more


---------54:55----------
detail


---------54:56----------
now i know that some people are


---------54:57----------
concerned about that because


---------54:59----------
in that process if you talk about


---------55:01----------
toxicity and we use an actual example


---------55:03----------
there you know people may know who


---------55:06----------
you're talking about if it's a public


---------55:07----------
figure or things like that so i want to


---------55:09----------
be really careful


---------55:10----------
we're not here to really like um you


---------55:12----------
know point fingers or anything like that


---------55:14----------
we're really here to focus on is


---------55:15----------
is kind of your experience and how to


---------55:18----------
deal with toxicity


---------55:20----------
but at the same time you know i have


---------55:22----------
found that generally speaking when


---------55:24----------
people give


---------55:25----------
when we go through raw data it can be


---------55:28----------
very very illustrative


---------55:29----------
as opposed to talking things abstractly


---------55:31----------
because i'm still not sure


---------55:33----------
broxah like anyone who's watching this i


---------55:35----------
don't know how this actually helps


---------55:38----------
anyone in a concrete way does that make


---------55:41----------
sense like we've heard a lot about it


---------55:42----------
i i completely i completely see that


---------55:45----------
right so


---------55:46----------
so and i think that's where so these are


---------55:49----------
three options i think it sort of depends


---------55:50----------
on what you feel comfortable with


---------55:56----------
or what you think would be useful


---------55:59----------
i'm not sure i think the


---------56:02----------
the mental strength one would be a good


---------56:05----------
place to start


---------56:06----------
because i think that's something that


---------56:08----------
could help


---------56:09----------
a lot of people and that's really


---------56:11----------
important sure


---------56:13----------
okay um so the mental strength when you


---------56:15----------
mean so not the sports psychologist but


---------56:17----------
where confidence comes


---------56:19----------
yeah i i guess so like honestly i'm not


---------56:23----------
i'm not even sure exactly where it comes


---------56:25----------
from but yeah i


---------56:26----------
i i'm pretty sure why i'm so interested


---------56:29----------
in this one yeah yeah so that's


---------56:30----------
remember we're here to help you right so


---------56:32----------
it's like your questions so like that's


---------56:34----------
a great question so let's talk about


---------56:35----------
this


---------56:36----------
where does your confidence come from


---------56:44----------
well the first thing that comes to my


---------56:46----------
mind is you know


---------56:48----------
all the all the work that i put into it


---------56:52----------
i guess like


---------56:52----------
all the the hard hard work all the hours


---------56:55----------
that that has gone into it


---------56:58----------
i'm a really structured person so


---------57:02----------
when i approach a task or a problem


---------57:06----------
i usually go into it in a really


---------57:08----------
structured way and really really clear


---------57:10----------
plan of what i'm gonna do and


---------57:11----------
i kind of have you know my days almost


---------57:14----------
set in stone right from the from the


---------57:17----------
beginning


---------57:19----------
because that way i feel i feel like i'm


---------57:22----------
gonna be productive i feel like i have a


---------57:24----------
really clear plan in my head


---------57:26----------
of what what the day is going to bring


---------57:27----------
and how at the end of that day


---------57:29----------
i will have learned something i will


---------57:32----------
have


---------57:33----------
proved one way or another okay


---------57:39----------
like let's say uh it could be


---------57:43----------
so i'm gonna i'm gonna just interrupt


---------57:46----------
you for a second okay


---------57:47----------
so so because i don't want you to get


---------57:48----------
too far because we're gonna i'm gonna


---------57:50----------
be a little bit more interruptive so if


---------57:52----------
it bothers you please let me know okay


---------57:54----------
so the first thing that you said is it


---------57:55----------
comes from my hard work so let's like


---------57:57----------
let's look at that kind of


---------57:58----------
scientifically


---------57:59----------
so you had worked pretty hard when you


---------58:01----------
hit the academy team


---------58:03----------
yeah you had worked pretty hard when you


---------58:08----------
got on the main team yeah


---------58:11----------
and were you confident


---------58:15----------
no okay i see where you're coming from


---------58:18----------
right so


---------58:19----------
so we're i know it sounds bizarre it's a


---------58:21----------
very


---------58:22----------
very um reasonable hypothesis


---------58:26----------
that confidence comes from hard work


---------58:29----------
turns out


---------58:30----------
not really the case


---------58:33----------
okay yeah okay oh i i i see that


---------58:37----------
yeah so so hard work plays a role for


---------58:39----------
sure but


---------58:41----------
you know it doesn't come from there so


---------58:43----------
then you said okay so you you have like


---------58:45----------
a very structured


---------58:46----------
mind okay so i think that sort of makes


---------58:48----------
a little bit more


---------58:50----------
sense to me structured mind is a really


---------58:53----------
really


---------58:53----------
difficult thing to really understand


---------58:56----------
it's a very deep


---------58:57----------
system of knowledge but here's the way


---------59:00----------
that i would walk through it


---------59:02----------
so a structured mind like your mind


---------59:06----------
tells you a b c d e and f


---------59:09----------
is gonna happen right let's you organize


---------59:12----------
your thoughts you organize your day


---------59:13----------
you lay out your day and then you


---------59:15----------
execute on your tasks


---------59:18----------
yeah and things work


---------59:21----------
out the way that you expected them to


---------59:25----------
is that the case when you have a


---------59:26----------
structured mind over a given day


---------59:30----------
yeah generally speaking obviously there


---------59:32----------
can always be things that


---------59:34----------
are unexpected things that show up but


---------59:36----------
like on a broad level i i


---------59:38----------
yeah i i have an expectation or an idea


---------59:42----------
of what


---------59:43----------
what the day is going to bring yep and


---------59:45----------
so i think that sort of makes more sense


---------59:47----------
because if we kind of think about it a


---------59:48----------
little bit


---------59:50----------
um you know literally what is confidence


---------59:54----------
confidence is the capacity to


---------59:59----------
have an expectation in your performance


---------60:03----------
yeah right so if we like define it it's


---------60:06----------
like


---------60:06----------
knowing what you're capable of and


---------60:09----------
if you have a structured mind and you


---------60:11----------
lay out six things for you to do


---------60:13----------
and then you do those six things what is


---------60:16----------
your expectation of your performance the


---------60:18----------
next day


---------60:22----------
right it sort of builds confidence


---------60:23----------
because you said i'm gonna do this


---------60:26----------
and then you actually do it yeah and so


---------60:28----------
confidence increases


---------60:29----------
right so so i think a structured mind is


---------60:31----------
a big part of it


---------60:33----------
um but i think of


---------60:37----------
i don't really think that's where


---------60:39----------
confidence comes from because what we're


---------60:40----------
talking about is like the negative voice


---------60:42----------
in your head


---------60:44----------
right and if we really think about it


---------60:46----------
like like where is that


---------60:48----------
voice let me ask you this when you


---------60:51----------
tell yourself that you are a good person


---------60:54----------
and that you do deserve to be there


---------60:57----------
whose voice is that


---------61:00----------
whose voice do you hear in those words


---------61:11----------
interesting question


---------61:25----------
i feel like it's it's hard to say yep i


---------61:28----------
was thinking it could be


---------61:33----------
i'm about to say all the


---------61:37----------
many of you know the close ones that


---------61:40----------
i really care for that i feel like i'm


---------61:42----------
kind of fighting for in a way that are


---------61:44----------
putting a lot of trust in me then


---------61:46----------
that's really respect me for what i'm


---------61:49----------
doing


---------61:50----------
mm-hmm but i'm not sure if that's


---------61:53----------
if that's really it so even from your


---------61:57----------
answer which you're sort of confused


---------61:59----------
there's actually a very big answer


---------62:02----------
so you've actually given us a fantastic


---------62:04----------
answer because you said it's an


---------62:06----------
interesting question


---------62:08----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------62:10----------
because it's a hard and interesting


---------62:12----------
question the answer is not


---------62:14----------
it's my voice do you see that


---------62:17----------
yeah no i i yeah i don't think it's


---------62:21----------
like i can't just sit here and say it's


---------62:22----------
my voice because right so so the fact


---------62:25----------
the fact that you can't say that is


---------62:27----------
incredibly significant


---------62:29----------
because what what you what we must


---------62:31----------
conclude from that or what


---------62:33----------
i mean we don't have to conclude but


---------62:34----------
what i'd hypothesize what i'd pull away


---------62:36----------
from that


---------62:37----------
is that confidence actually i know this


---------62:39----------
sounds [ __ ] weird doesn't come from


---------62:40----------
you


---------62:41----------
just think about it because if it came


---------62:42----------
from you you'd say it's my voice


---------62:45----------
that's me talking to myself


---------62:48----------
but you're like i don't know whose voice


---------62:50----------
it is


---------62:52----------
so could it be your voice sort of maybe


---------62:55----------
you don't know


---------62:55----------
what you sound like well right obviously


---------62:59----------
to an extent it's always it's always


---------63:01----------
your own voice talking right


---------63:03----------
but where does like where does that


---------63:06----------
confidence really come from and


---------63:08----------
like does it actually come from my voice


---------63:10----------
or


---------63:13----------
is it kind of inspired from something


---------63:14----------
else beautifully


---------63:17----------
yeah so broxah i think that that this is


---------63:19----------
where we got to trust your instincts


---------63:20----------
because you're right


---------63:21----------
just follow your instincts so i i think


---------63:23----------
that like even you when you kind of say


---------63:25----------
that like


---------63:26----------
it's my voice there's a piece of it


---------63:28----------
that's me but it's inspired


---------63:30----------
by something else right


---------63:33----------
that i think is like like feels in the


---------63:36----------
same vein of what my experiences have


---------63:38----------
been


---------63:38----------
in terms of exploring confidence so


---------63:41----------
here's the kind of really interesting


---------63:43----------
thing is that


---------63:44----------
you know what i would say is that


---------63:45----------
confidence is doesn't come from


---------63:48----------
you it is taught to you


---------63:52----------
what do you think about that


---------63:59----------
yeah i think that is fair to say i feel


---------64:02----------
like


---------64:03----------
i feel like during my time as a


---------64:05----------
professional league of legends player i


---------64:08----------
i literally learned how to be confident


---------64:10----------
than myself because


---------64:11----------
as i said initially


---------64:14----------
i wasn't really confident i was i was


---------64:16----------
nervous i i


---------64:18----------
i wasn't sure if i was going to perform


---------64:20----------
and i went on on stage into official


---------64:22----------
games kind of


---------64:23----------
questioning a lot of things and when i


---------64:25----------
was about to make a play in the game


---------64:27----------
i had all these voices in my head


---------64:30----------
you know kind of fighting with each


---------64:33----------
other about whether going in was a good


---------64:35----------
idea or not


---------64:35----------
like you have second thoughts in a way


---------64:37----------
right and


---------64:40----------
i don't really i don't really have to


---------64:41----------
have that anymore that's something that


---------64:44----------
changed and that i i learned and picked


---------64:46----------
up somewhere along the way


---------64:49----------
yeah so i don't think that that is


---------64:52----------
the whole of the answer i think that's


---------64:54----------
actually the second half because there's


---------64:56----------
something important there too you say


---------64:57----------
that


---------64:58----------
when i was a pro player there was a


---------65:00----------
fight


---------65:01----------
right in your own head between two


---------65:03----------
voices


---------65:05----------
yeah so confidence and now you're saying


---------65:08----------
okay now that fight has been resolved


---------65:10----------
and the confidence has won right


---------65:14----------
for the most part generally speaking


---------65:16----------
there could always be exceptions


---------65:17----------
but if we really if we really tunnel


---------65:19----------
down brock so what that means is that


---------65:21----------
the confidence was always there


---------65:24----------
it was fighting at one point but at that


---------65:25----------
point it was already formed


---------65:29----------
yeah which means that you didn't become


---------65:31----------
confident


---------65:33----------
you didn't learn how to become confident


---------65:35----------
sure confidence grew


---------65:37----------
but that voice was already there


---------65:41----------
so this is where i think it's


---------65:42----------
interesting because most people think oh


---------65:44----------
i


---------65:44----------
i became confident you know through my


---------65:47----------
trial that's when confidence wins but


---------65:49----------
it's not where it originates from


---------65:51----------
and this is where people run into


---------65:52----------
problems because when people


---------65:54----------
look at you and they say oh like broxah


---------65:57----------
did it because


---------65:58----------
he like fought through that mental


---------66:00----------
difficulty and then like that is how he


---------66:03----------
became confident


---------66:04----------
but the you're going into the game


---------66:07----------
evenly matched


---------66:08----------
right the reason that you struggle is


---------66:10----------
because you're going into the game


---------66:11----------
you've got your draft of like confidence


---------66:14----------
and then the enemy has their draft and


---------66:16----------
then you win


---------66:17----------
the problem that people run into is that


---------66:19----------
when they look at you and they try to


---------66:20----------
learn from your case


---------66:22----------
they're not going in with the same draft


---------66:24----------
that you're going in with


---------66:25----------
and then when they fail they blame


---------66:28----------
themselves because they say why can't i


---------66:30----------
do this


---------66:32----------
so we still have to go back to like


---------66:34----------
where that voice that was fighting


---------66:36----------
we'll we'll get into you know how you


---------66:38----------
learn to be confident because obviously


---------66:39----------
you


---------66:40----------
grew a lot negative self-talk and stuff


---------66:42----------
like that maybe that's more the sports


---------66:43----------
psychology side we can talk about that


---------66:45----------
journey


---------66:45----------
but i want to even dig further back so


---------66:47----------
like you know when you think about


---------66:50----------
when you were five years old and playing


---------66:52----------
game boy


---------66:54----------
did you feel confident in yourself


---------67:04----------
i think i think at one point i i felt


---------67:08----------
very


---------67:08----------
very confident that my ability is


---------67:10----------
playing pokemon in that game for yes i


---------67:12----------
thought


---------67:13----------
i was very very good at that game okay


---------67:16----------
what about when you were playing wow


---------67:21----------
at one point it was the same thing i


---------67:23----------
think


---------67:24----------
usually with games


---------67:27----------
it is this kind of started the same way


---------67:30----------
where


---------67:31----------
it's always a bit up and down right


---------67:33----------
because um


---------67:34----------
like let's say in league of legends for


---------67:36----------
example you can be


---------67:38----------
you can be really confident being in


---------67:40----------
gold elo or diamond if you're playing


---------67:42----------
against lower to your players but


---------67:44----------
there's always a


---------67:45----------
step up and that's where you know you


---------67:47----------
kind of start over with the entire


---------67:48----------
confidence thing again because someone


---------67:51----------
smashes you in the game and you you kind


---------67:52----------
of have to repeat the cycle rate


---------67:54----------
and i think with most games it kind of


---------67:57----------
started


---------67:59----------
with me just going in a bit blind and


---------68:02----------
not feeling that confident because i


---------68:04----------
didn't really know what i was doing what


---------68:05----------
i was doing i was just learning having a


---------68:07----------
lot of question marks and then


---------68:08----------
eventually as i put more and more hours


---------68:12----------
into it as i put more


---------68:14----------
hours into doing research and


---------68:17----------
kind of having a better understanding of


---------68:20----------
the game


---------68:21----------
and became better at it


---------68:25----------
that's when i started becoming a bit


---------68:27----------
more confident in myself


---------68:28----------
yeah so i think that makes a lot of


---------68:30----------
sense to me and i think there's one


---------68:31----------
really really important piece there


---------68:33----------
which is oftentimes overlooked


---------68:37----------
which is you said you go into it blind


---------68:41----------
that's where the money is so let me give


---------68:43----------
you two scenarios right like


---------68:45----------
let's say one thing someone says oh look


---------68:48----------
you have to


---------68:51----------
you know fight for your life in the next


---------68:54----------
24 hours


---------68:55----------
and then i go into it and then someone


---------68:57----------
says oh look you have to prepare for


---------68:59----------
something


---------69:00----------
over the next 24 hours and then you're


---------69:02----------
gonna do something


---------69:03----------
if i succeed in the blind one versus i


---------69:06----------
succeed in the prepared one


---------69:08----------
which one leads to more confidence


---------69:12----------
obviously the prepared one why


---------69:17----------
because you have time to gather your


---------69:20----------
thoughts and create a


---------69:22----------
again this is where the structure comes


---------69:24----------
in play right because


---------69:25----------
like i would take the opportunity to you


---------69:28----------
know preparing


---------69:29----------
create a structured plan of how i would


---------69:31----------
approach the problem and


---------69:33----------
go about it that way and then once once


---------69:36----------
it starts


---------69:37----------
i have a good idea in my head of what


---------69:40----------
what's about to happen what


---------69:41----------
what i'm about to do like let's say with


---------69:44----------
school for example


---------69:45----------
with exams i would always be really


---------69:48----------
confident about the


---------69:50----------
the writing exams those that you you


---------69:52----------
just sit for yourself you get a piece of


---------69:54----------
paper and you can just look at all your


---------69:55----------
notes and


---------69:56----------
you know just write something but all


---------69:59----------
the oral exams where


---------70:00----------
i walk in i have no idea what subject


---------70:03----------
i'm gonna


---------70:04----------
i'm gonna have in the exam like i go in


---------70:06----------
a bit blind in the sense not knowing


---------70:08----------
what


---------70:08----------
what i'm gonna gonna discuss i would get


---------70:11----------
so nervous because


---------70:12----------
oh oh okay okay i


---------70:16----------
okay so but let me ask you this let's


---------70:18----------
say you go into an


---------70:19----------
oral exam and you ace it how do you feel


---------70:22----------
about yourself afterward


---------70:25----------
i it there's a limit to how many times


---------70:29----------
it has happened but when it happened i


---------70:31----------
felt very


---------70:33----------
relieved and very very proud because


---------70:36----------
i was put in a place where i was really


---------70:39----------
out of my comfort zone and i still


---------70:41----------
you know came out with a really good


---------70:42----------
result i i made it work


---------70:45----------
so if we think about how confidence is


---------70:46----------
built i completely agree with you that


---------70:48----------
the oral exam you're less confident when


---------70:50----------
you're going when you go in


---------70:52----------
yeah but i would say that in terms of


---------70:54----------
growing your confidence


---------70:56----------
the oral exam actually grows it more


---------71:00----------
than the written exam yeah


---------71:03----------
at least for me because i always viewed


---------71:06----------
the oral exams as


---------71:08----------
the big challenge to overcome what i was


---------71:11----------
afraid right


---------71:11----------
right so so i think this is huge because


---------71:14----------
i


---------71:14----------
i think when you say i went into it


---------71:16----------
blind the less prepared you are


---------71:20----------
the more confident you have the


---------71:22----------
possibility of ending up


---------71:25----------
yeah so so when i look at people who are


---------71:28----------
highly highly avoidant and lack


---------71:30----------
confidence


---------71:31----------
what they try to do is prepare


---------71:34----------
so that they never have to be tested


---------71:37----------
right they prepare and prepare and


---------71:39----------
prepare so they never truly get tested


---------71:41----------
they like set up all of these things in


---------71:44----------
their favor so that success is


---------71:45----------
guaranteed


---------71:46----------
like i'm not going to if if i say broxah


---------71:49----------
i want to build my confidence as a legal


---------71:51----------
i want to


---------71:51----------
build i want to be a good league of


---------71:53----------
legends player so what i'm going to do


---------71:54----------
i'm going to ask you


---------71:55----------
and i'm going to ask all the other


---------71:56----------
league of legends pros that i've had on


---------71:58----------
stream


---------71:58----------
we're going to queue up together and i'm


---------72:00----------
going to stack the deck so that i win


---------72:03----------
so they're going to do nothing for my


---------72:04----------
confidence it is my insecurity


---------72:07----------
that causes me to reach out to people


---------72:09----------
like you and says will you join my team


---------72:11----------
will you help me stack the deck


---------72:12----------
will you help me prepare for victory


---------72:14----------
here and the victory is completely empty


---------72:18----------
yeah right because i got i got carried


---------72:21----------
yeah and you you want to be the one


---------72:23----------
carrying


---------72:24----------
right but no but no i don't because


---------72:26----------
caring's [ __ ] scary


---------72:28----------
right so when you take a written exam


---------72:30----------
you can get carried by your notes


---------72:37----------
and the oral exam is so much scarier


---------72:39----------
because you're like i have none of these


---------72:41----------
where's my [ __ ] who's carrying me no


---------72:43----------
one's carrying you bro


---------72:45----------
and it's terrifying


---------72:48----------
yeah right so actually so this is where


---------72:52----------
we're talking about building confidence


---------72:55----------
going in blind like when you really


---------72:59----------
test yourself because then you know it's


---------73:01----------
not


---------73:02----------
i'm not getting carried by pro it's not


---------73:04----------
my notes it's not all of this


---------73:06----------
it's just me i did this


---------73:11----------
right like like that's where confidence


---------73:13----------
comes from i can do this


---------73:14----------
i don't need the notes i don't need to


---------73:17----------
queue up with brock's as my jungler to


---------73:18----------
play


---------73:19----------
a game of legal like to win a game of


---------73:20----------
league of legends


---------73:22----------
i can do it and in your case just to


---------73:25----------
kind of


---------73:26----------
toss another hypothesis you know i think


---------73:29----------
that confidence is taught


---------73:31----------
right there's a lot of psychological


---------73:32----------
research about this i can go into more


---------73:33----------
detail but


---------73:34----------
i think that like it would when you kind


---------73:36----------
of think about


---------73:38----------
even the way that your parents let you


---------73:40----------
pick the day


---------73:42----------
right like what your parents were so


---------73:44----------
that you they let you pick your day that


---------73:46----------
you're not allowed to play


---------73:48----------
so even like when you were in fourth


---------73:49----------
grade your parents were saying


---------73:51----------
broxah a mass i trust you


---------73:54----------
i have faith in you that you can pick


---------73:57----------
the day


---------73:58----------
and i was surprised because when when


---------73:59----------
you know when most parents like


---------74:02----------
when most parents think their kids are


---------74:03----------
playing too many video games they don't


---------74:04----------
say there's one day that you can't play


---------74:07----------
they say there's one day that you can


---------74:09----------
play


---------74:10----------
yeah for sure right and so


---------74:14----------
it's kind of interesting because i think


---------74:15----------
that you also mentioned like having


---------74:16----------
support so i think that


---------74:18----------
it's hard but this is a rough answer


---------74:21----------
but the short answer is that i think to


---------74:22----------
confidence is taught to people just


---------74:24----------
because that's how our brains learn like


---------74:26----------
we learn very little from ourselves we


---------74:28----------
learn a lot from you know


---------74:29----------
other people and i think part of the


---------74:32----------
reason that you're mentally strong


---------74:34----------
is sure you've worked hard sure you have


---------74:35----------
a structured mind but i think frankly


---------74:37----------
like you got some good rng when it comes


---------74:40----------
to your family


---------74:42----------
you know yeah i i can confirm that


---------74:46----------
right and and so i think it's important


---------74:47----------
to acknowledge and not to say that you


---------74:49----------
don't deserve it or anything like that


---------74:51----------
but i think that


---------74:52----------
one of the things that really bothers me


---------74:54----------
is that when people look at you and


---------74:56----------
they're like look at this


---------74:57----------
23 year old chad league of legends


---------74:58----------
player who's got a girlfriend and gets


---------75:00----------
laid from time to time


---------75:01----------
what i want people to understand is that


---------75:04----------
you were dealt a particular hand in life


---------75:06----------
which has nothing i'm not saying you


---------75:08----------
didn't


---------75:08----------
work hard or anything like that but to


---------75:10----------
hold in your mind two things one is that


---------75:13----------
you had parents who taught you that you


---------75:15----------
have value


---------75:18----------
right they were like mass i want you to


---------75:20----------
be happy


---------75:22----------
like if you lose a game of league of


---------75:24----------
legends you we


---------75:25----------
you still have value as a person


---------75:29----------
you're not just a summary of your


---------75:31----------
results


---------75:32----------
you're more than that and that's where


---------75:35----------
confidence comes from right like it's an


---------75:37----------
intrinsic sense


---------75:38----------
of value and the more that you value


---------75:40----------
yourself the more you can face


---------75:42----------
uncertainty because i think you've had


---------75:45----------
little


---------75:46----------
little um run-ins with uncertainty a lot


---------75:49----------
so i think your parents divorce is a


---------75:50----------
good example of like


---------75:52----------
you were facing uncertainty right you


---------75:54----------
were going in blind it was like an oral


---------75:56----------
exam


---------75:56----------
you didn't know what was gonna happen


---------75:59----------
and when you get through that when you


---------76:01----------
cross that


---------76:02----------
you know lake of fire and you wind up on


---------76:04----------
the other side


---------76:05----------
you're like okay i can handle this now


---------76:09----------
and you've had your trials like when you


---------76:11----------
you know certainly when you started to


---------76:13----------
become a pro it sounds like


---------76:14----------
you you know you had that voice and then


---------76:17----------
you had to fight


---------76:18----------
so it's not like it was easy for you no


---------76:21----------
definitely and


---------76:22----------
i think in my time as a professional


---------76:24----------
player one of the


---------76:25----------
biggest things that i had to learn to


---------76:27----------
deal with both as a player but


---------76:29----------
especially also as a personal level was


---------76:31----------
to navigate through all that uncertainty


---------76:34----------
and dealing with it even


---------76:36----------
let's say the first time i i went to


---------76:38----------
went to berlin to


---------76:40----------
play with the team i had no idea what


---------76:43----------
was going to happen i had never been in


---------76:44----------
this situation before i had never met


---------76:46----------
any of these people


---------76:47----------
and often times when when traveling i


---------76:51----------
have no idea


---------76:52----------
when i'm coming home sometimes i don't


---------76:54----------
even know when i'll be leaving until


---------76:56----------
a couple of days before i'm leaving and


---------77:00----------
when playing tournaments it's kind of


---------77:02----------
the same like


---------77:03----------
the entire future in the tournament


---------77:05----------
depends sometimes on one single game


---------77:08----------
that you have to play and you have to


---------77:09----------
set yourself


---------77:10----------
up for up for that game and you need to


---------77:12----------
be ready to perform and in that sense


---------77:15----------
i think that is one of the two things


---------77:17----------
that i've


---------77:18----------
really had to spend the most time kind


---------77:20----------
of dealing with and learning along the


---------77:22----------
way


---------77:23----------
move a bit out of the structure and my


---------77:26----------
comfort zone and


---------77:28----------
feel a bit more comfortable with all the


---------77:31----------
uncertainties and navigating


---------77:33----------
through them and still getting getting


---------77:35----------
the most out of myself


---------77:37----------
yeah so that's a great way to put it i


---------77:40----------
think


---------77:40----------
moving outside of your comfort zone and


---------77:44----------
becoming comfortable with


---------77:48----------
the uncertainty right so like this is


---------77:50----------
this is tricky because this is what a


---------77:52----------
lot of people who are not confident do


---------77:54----------
they try to remove the uncertainty


---------77:58----------
yeah and if you remove the uncertainty


---------78:01----------
you may succeed you may work hard but


---------78:04----------
you won't become more confident


---------78:07----------
yeah for sure and that's kind of uh


---------78:12----------
i guess a mental not necessarily mental


---------78:14----------
cycle but like a mental state of mind


---------78:16----------
somewhere with


---------78:17----------
where i've been to at times where things


---------78:19----------
have been


---------78:20----------
really difficult with the job and at


---------78:22----------
times i would be


---------78:24----------
questioning myself and questioning


---------78:26----------
whether i would be able to navigate


---------78:27----------
through it and i've


---------78:28----------
i've been thinking to myself like do i


---------78:31----------
do i actually want to do this am i ready


---------78:32----------
for this do i want to


---------78:33----------
continue this way but that's where that


---------78:36----------
confidence comes in and tells me that


---------78:38----------
as long as i just you know


---------78:42----------
as long as i'm just me and as long as i


---------78:44----------
i i do my best it's gonna work out one


---------78:47----------
way or another and it's gonna be fine at


---------78:49----------
the end of the day and so let me


---------78:52----------
let me ask you a concrete question there


---------78:54----------
you say am i ready for this


---------78:56----------
and what's the answer you tell yourself


---------79:01----------
it's not always yes it's it's not always


---------79:04----------
a simple yes


---------79:05----------
sometimes it's just a maybe or


---------79:08----------
i think so but it's just that's where


---------79:10----------
confidence comes from


---------79:13----------
is doing something when you're not ready


---------79:15----------
for it


---------79:17----------
yeah right it's i think that's


---------79:21----------
yeah that's a good answer to it it's


---------79:24----------
beautiful because i i think sometimes


---------79:26----------
you know you'll you'll give an


---------79:27----------
answer that sounds vague on the surface


---------79:29----------
like it's not always a yes


---------79:30----------
but that is a great answer it says a lot


---------79:35----------
yeah because that's the important thing


---------79:37----------
it's not always yes


---------79:39----------
and and so i think brock's a really what


---------79:41----------
you should commend yourself for or give


---------79:43----------
yourself a pat on the back i think you


---------79:44----------
were dealt a good hand i thought you'd


---------79:45----------
think you were given a nice


---------79:47----------
starting stat for confidence


---------79:51----------
right it started off pretty high and


---------79:54----------
and at the same time i think you really


---------79:56----------
have pushed yourself


---------79:58----------
into uncomfortable situations


---------80:01----------
and you've done things that you haven't


---------80:03----------
been ready for


---------80:05----------
and that i think is what makes you


---------80:06----------
strong mentally


---------80:08----------
right is that you're willing to face the


---------80:10----------
uncertain and and


---------80:11----------
if you guys i kind of cut you off but i


---------80:13----------
think you were on a kind of a good chain


---------80:14----------
of thought if you guys listen to


---------80:16----------
brock's thought process it's sort of


---------80:17----------
like i may not win


---------80:20----------
but it's gonna be okay in the end like


---------80:22----------
that's a statement of confidence


---------80:25----------
because some people are like if i don't


---------80:26----------
win it's over


---------80:29----------
i i've been there before too many times


---------80:31----------
and like honestly


---------80:34----------
often times when i go into a game um


---------80:37----------
whether it's solo queer professional


---------80:39----------
game


---------80:41----------
that's that's oftentimes the default


---------80:43----------
process that can appear right


---------80:45----------
but that's where you need to this is one


---------80:48----------
of


---------80:48----------
the things that has been difficult for


---------80:49----------
me as well as like going into a game and


---------80:51----------
really setting me up


---------80:52----------
like just thinking to myself that if i


---------80:55----------
don't carry this game if i don't look


---------80:57----------
like a god and if we don't win this


---------81:00----------
everything is going to be doomed you


---------81:01----------
know like everything is going to be over


---------81:04----------
but i've kind of learned along the way


---------81:06----------
to really


---------81:07----------
take everything one step at a time and


---------81:10----------
i've never been the type of player to


---------81:12----------
inside tournament and go out in


---------81:13----------
interviews and say that


---------81:15----------
we're gonna smash everyone and we're


---------81:16----------
gonna win no matter what because that's


---------81:18----------
not really how i wanna


---------81:20----------
that's not how i set myself up for


---------81:22----------
success


---------81:23----------
um obviously that's that's always the


---------81:25----------
goal and that's always what i'm working


---------81:26----------
towards but


---------81:28----------
um if we if we're in a tournament then


---------81:31----------
the first thing i'm gonna tell myself is


---------81:32----------
that


---------81:33----------
all right we need to reach playoffs or


---------81:36----------
we need to get to the group stage


---------81:37----------
and i'm trying to figure out what i can


---------81:40----------
do in order to help


---------81:42----------
myself and my team get to that level and


---------81:44----------
then once we are


---------81:45----------
playing a qualifier and i'm like okay


---------81:48----------
but this is the team we're going up


---------81:49----------
against this is the situation this is


---------81:51----------
what needs to be done in order for us to


---------81:52----------
reach the semi-final


---------81:54----------
and just always really taking it one


---------81:56----------
step at a time


---------81:57----------
because that way if something goes wrong


---------82:00----------
inside the game which is very common


---------82:02----------
like sometimes you


---------82:04----------
you insert a game with a plan and two


---------82:06----------
minutes in


---------82:07----------
everything collapses and you know things


---------82:10----------
fall apart and you need to


---------82:12----------
you need to be really good at um


---------82:15----------
reacting


---------82:15----------
on the fly and figuring out how you're


---------82:18----------
going to win the game with a different


---------82:19----------
plan


---------82:20----------
and especially as a jungler and league


---------82:23----------
of legends that's so important like if


---------82:25----------
something falls apart you


---------82:26----------
you have to do whatever you can to bring


---------82:28----------
your team back on track


---------82:30----------
and like i i found that if i go into the


---------82:34----------
game thinking i have to win no matter


---------82:36----------
what if something goes wrong


---------82:39----------
like i i just i just black out i get so


---------82:42----------
frustrated you know because


---------82:43----------
the first thing that comes to my mind is


---------82:44----------
like oh no it's lost we're not gonna win


---------82:47----------
but if i just think to myself that


---------82:51----------
like if i just try to come in prepared


---------82:53----------
no matter what happens and take it one


---------82:55----------
step at a time


---------82:56----------
then anything can come my way or


---------83:00----------
that's how i feel right like no matter


---------83:01----------
what comes my way i'm gonna be


---------83:03----------
ready to adapt and i'm gonna figure


---------83:05----------
things out on the fly and i'm gonna


---------83:07----------
get us in the position to win win this


---------83:10----------
game or the very least do my very best


---------83:12----------
to make us win this game


---------83:13----------
and i i found that at least for me


---------83:16----------
that's


---------83:17----------
a really healthy way of thinking because


---------83:19----------
it does


---------83:21----------
put some pressure on me in a way but by


---------83:23----------
no means to the same extent of just


---------83:25----------
having to win no matter what


---------83:28----------
well said i i think that you've you've


---------83:30----------
stumbled upon


---------83:32----------
something which is a little bit


---------83:33----------
different but i think it's not having


---------83:35----------
expectations


---------83:37----------
and devoting yourself to your action as


---------83:39----------
opposed to the result


---------83:41----------
and yeah and this is something that i i


---------83:43----------
i mentioned to


---------83:44----------
you know people in in esports before


---------83:47----------
which is like


---------83:48----------
um you know if you're let's say you're


---------83:51----------
the mid laner


---------83:52----------
and you're going 2-0 you go 2-0 and


---------83:56----------
you're lane


---------83:57----------
yeah let's say you're the mid-laner and


---------83:58----------
you go 0-2


---------84:01----------
which one is more likely to make you


---------84:02----------
tilt


---------84:05----------
going too so i know you say that


---------84:09----------
you're a pro league of legends player so


---------84:11----------
you you have more experience than i do


---------84:14----------
bizarrely in my experience


---------84:18----------
what often times happens is when you go


---------84:20----------
to an o you say i got this [ __ ]


---------84:22----------
i've crushed this noob and then


---------84:25----------
and then if you die once or you die


---------84:27----------
twice then suddenly you're two and two


---------84:31----------
and then if you're o and two and then


---------84:34----------
you get two kills at the end of the day


---------84:36----------
if you end up as two and two


---------84:39----------
the person who is two and o is more


---------84:41----------
likely to tilt


---------84:45----------
because they create an expectation of a


---------84:47----------
victory but you're the actual league of


---------84:48----------
legends pro so if you disagree we're


---------84:50----------
going to defer to your answer


---------84:52----------
no i i had a feeling you were going to


---------84:55----------
say that


---------84:56----------
and i i kind of see where you're coming


---------84:59----------
from because


---------85:00----------
i i think it mostly depends on the


---------85:02----------
expectations you set


---------85:03----------
for yourself and that's it the way that


---------85:05----------
the mind functions because some people


---------85:07----------
are gonna have an easy time tilting if


---------85:09----------
they have a lead


---------85:10----------
because they they feel pressure they


---------85:12----------
feel like now


---------85:13----------
whoa i have a lead i have to carry and


---------85:15----------
then because that


---------85:17----------
because of that they start it's


---------85:19----------
questioning themselves and they do crazy


---------85:20----------
things and they throw that lead


---------85:23----------
but i think what often happens is that


---------85:25----------
when when someone has a


---------85:28----------
bad game from my personal experience


---------85:30----------
that's where


---------85:31----------
the mental path can really shine because


---------85:34----------
being in a really tough position


---------85:38----------
and just staying strong just accepting


---------85:40----------
that you've made a mistake and dealing


---------85:43----------
dealing with the situation you are in


---------85:44----------
and making it work is really difficult


---------85:46----------
and what a lot of people tend to do


---------85:49----------
myself included sometimes start rather


---------85:52----------
than


---------85:53----------
admitting that you made certain mistakes


---------85:55----------
and that you're the reason you're in


---------85:56----------
that position you start


---------85:58----------
blaming other people and you the focus


---------86:01----------
kind of


---------86:01----------
like the voice inside your head starts


---------86:05----------
focusing on random things that don't


---------86:06----------
help you win the game at all


---------86:09----------
and often that's where that's where the


---------86:13----------
the attitude problems and the mentality


---------86:15----------
problems come in because people are


---------86:17----------
having a rough time and then rather than


---------86:20----------
taking


---------86:20----------
full responsibility for it and dealing


---------86:22----------
with the situation they start


---------86:24----------
blaming other people and they're like


---------86:26----------
you know i died in my lane


---------86:28----------
the jungle was here and killed me it's


---------86:30----------
your fault why are you not here


---------86:32----------
yeah that's something i understand very


---------86:33----------
well so i play more dota than league and


---------86:36----------
i'm a jungler and dota


---------86:37----------
and and often times my my team blames me


---------86:40----------
for junglic


---------86:41----------
but i try not to let that affect my


---------86:44----------
attitude and i continue jungling every


---------86:45----------
game


---------86:47----------
that is the life of a jungler especially


---------86:50----------
when you're at jungle in these type of


---------86:52----------
games you you have to deal with a lot


---------86:54----------
and you have to learn to accept that


---------86:57----------
um sometimes i think of it as being a


---------87:01----------
being a babysitter in a way you know


---------87:03----------
there's all these children


---------87:04----------
in the lanes and if anything small goes


---------87:06----------
wrong you know they start


---------87:08----------
they start screaming and crying and then


---------87:10----------
you have to figure out like


---------87:12----------
how to navigate through that and how to


---------87:14----------
deal with that i'm laughing roxy because


---------87:16----------
i was trolling you a little bit


---------87:18----------
there's uh there's no role of jungler


---------87:20----------
and donut


---------87:22----------
it's it's like an offline though there's


---------87:24----------
something similar


---------87:25----------
there's something similar but generally


---------87:26----------
speaking when you actually go jungler


---------87:28----------
it's a terrible idea because it's like a


---------87:30----------
bad strategy


---------87:32----------
and oh really i thought i thought it was


---------87:34----------
actually like


---------87:35----------
a viable strategy


---------87:39----------
no okay so junglers are just


---------87:42----------
like you know there is offline like a


---------87:44----------
lot of people will go into the jungle


---------87:46----------
but there isn't a dedicated role and


---------87:47----------
generally speaking it's incredibly range


---------87:49----------
of


---------87:50----------
rage inducing when when there's a


---------87:52----------
jungler on your team


---------87:53----------
but so you know just speaking of of you


---------87:56----------
know expectations and letting down


---------87:57----------
teammates i understand we were supposed


---------87:59----------
to


---------88:00----------
um talk about toxicity and we really


---------88:03----------
haven't


---------88:03----------
done that i mean we've been at it for


---------88:06----------
now


---------88:07----------
you know a little over an hour and a


---------88:09----------
half do you or right around an hour and


---------88:10----------
a half do you want to talk about


---------88:12----------
toxicity or


---------88:13----------
do you feel like this has been


---------88:14----------
productive or


---------88:16----------
i mean is there something i can help


---------88:18----------
help you with in terms of toxicity or


---------88:20----------
anything you want to say


---------88:26----------
i'm not sure i i feel like i feel like


---------88:28----------
this has been this has been productive i


---------88:30----------
mean the entire conversation


---------88:32----------
um i mean i think i saw the start that i


---------88:35----------
felt like i had an idea of what was


---------88:37----------
coming


---------88:37----------
and you said that maybe it wasn't the


---------88:39----------
case and i definitely didn't expect to


---------88:40----------
sit and talk about all these things for


---------88:42----------
for this long um when it comes to the


---------88:46----------
toxicity there was one thing that that


---------88:48----------
came to my mind


---------88:50----------
it was one of the things you said about


---------88:52----------
how


---------88:53----------
my parents were when i grew up and how


---------88:56----------
they


---------88:56----------
put a lot of faith in me and i think


---------89:01----------
when it comes to toxicity or bad


---------89:04----------
attitudes or treating people a certain


---------89:06----------
way


---------89:07----------
when i grew up i was taught to be


---------89:11----------
responsible i guess and i think being


---------89:14----------
responsible for your actions being


---------89:15----------
responsible for the way that you treat


---------89:17----------
other people is


---------89:19----------
incredibly important and


---------89:22----------
again you know i'm not the best example


---------89:25----------
of all time in that regard but i can


---------89:27----------
consider myself pretty pretty


---------89:28----------
responsible and


---------89:30----------
um when it comes to to treating other


---------89:33----------
people a certain way


---------89:35----------
i'm also not perfect but i always try my


---------89:37----------
best to treat


---------89:39----------
treats i mean it sounds a bit dumb


---------89:41----------
saying it like this maybe but three


---------89:43----------
dollars the way that i want to be


---------89:44----------
treated and treat them like you know


---------89:46----------
good humans human beings rather than


---------89:49----------
going


---------89:50----------
going off when something goes wrong and


---------89:52----------
when it comes to people


---------89:55----------
you know flaming others and getting


---------89:57----------
really mad in video games


---------90:00----------
i kind of understand like i'm a really


---------90:02----------
competitive person too


---------90:03----------
i can also get gets really mad when


---------90:05----------
something goes wrong in my game and when


---------90:07----------
i feel like someone is ruining my game


---------90:10----------
but there's still


---------90:13----------
a difference between getting really mad


---------90:15----------
and actually typing really obnoxious and


---------90:18----------
hateful messages


---------90:19----------
to a person and i feel like when it


---------90:21----------
comes to


---------90:23----------
the hate that influencers


---------90:26----------
um are dealing with pro players dealing


---------90:28----------
with it's it's kind of the same that


---------90:31----------
like there's no i've never been able to


---------90:35----------
understand


---------90:36----------
um why people send hateful messages to


---------90:40----------
others


---------90:41----------
like when when whenever when i was a kid


---------90:44----------
and we were watching the danish national


---------90:46----------
team


---------90:46----------
play football like you know we would be


---------90:48----------
yelling at the tv and


---------90:50----------
that stuff and we would be like oh this


---------90:52----------
player is so bad why why did he let the


---------90:53----------
team down but


---------90:54----------
we would never consider you know


---------90:56----------
reaching out to them about it it's kind


---------90:58----------
of crazy


---------90:58----------
you couldn't right but now you can


---------91:02----------
so yeah and i think sometimes when


---------91:04----------
people


---------91:05----------
get caught up in those emotions and when


---------91:09----------
something goes goes off they kind of


---------91:11----------
forget about that entire


---------91:13----------
responsibility that they're carrying


---------91:16----------
well hold on a second brock so i'm gonna


---------91:18----------
push back a little bit


---------91:20----------
so i agree with your general so like


---------91:21----------
like your general point but when you say


---------91:23----------
you know i know that it's you seem like


---------91:25----------
a super stand-up guy you seem super


---------91:27----------
responsible


---------91:27----------
but at the same time i want to point


---------91:29----------
something out because


---------91:31----------
one of the things i'm hearing from you


---------91:32----------
and one of the things i've been curious


---------91:34----------
about


---------91:34----------
is like i love to talk to the toxic


---------91:37----------
[ __ ] on stream


---------91:38----------
i've said this like over and over and


---------91:40----------
over again where i want to find the most


---------91:42----------
we've like tried this with like incels


---------91:44----------
and and like misogyny


---------91:46----------
right so like like dudes who hate women


---------91:49----------
and


---------91:49----------
i don't know if it's just because of


---------91:51----------
like our audience or


---------91:52----------
people are more like mild when they come


---------91:55----------
on stream and they really are not like


---------91:57----------
as fiery or offensive as they are i mean


---------92:00----------
we don't want them to violate tos but


---------92:01----------
like


---------92:02----------
you know we've had a couple of people


---------92:03----------
who sort of identify as incels and my


---------92:06----------
take after talking to them


---------92:07----------
is that they tend to be like pretty


---------92:09----------
decent people


---------92:10----------
and and that's just been my my own


---------92:13----------
experience with most people who come on


---------92:14----------
stream i think like even when they're


---------92:16----------
hated by the internet


---------92:17----------
or um you know have been toxic towards


---------92:20----------
other people like i


---------92:21----------
i we just see the nice side of people


---------92:24----------
so i'm kind of curious about that but


---------92:26----------
when you say like you know when you used


---------92:28----------
to watch football and you yell at the tv


---------92:30----------
like that's the same thing right


---------92:33----------
it's just now we have twitter so you can


---------92:35----------
actually like the dude


---------92:37----------
on on the tv can hear you


---------92:40----------
for sure and i feel like that's that's


---------92:43----------
that's kind of the problem and that's a


---------92:44----------
big change in


---------92:45----------
society because i know um if you go


---------92:48----------
generations back


---------92:49----------
again denmark football or soccer is the


---------92:52----------
biggest sport and


---------92:53----------
i've seen people so many times you know


---------92:57----------
yelling and getting mad over football


---------92:59----------
players or something going wrong with a


---------93:00----------
team but you would never have that


---------93:02----------
luxury of actually being able to reach


---------93:04----------
out to them and for them to


---------93:06----------
hear what you were what you were saying


---------93:08----------
yeah and


---------93:09----------
now that is the case and that creates


---------93:12----------
some


---------93:14----------
sometimes really uncomfortable


---------93:16----------
situations and


---------93:17----------
absolutely all parties that that's


---------93:20----------
that's kind of the problem so what do we


---------93:23----------
do about it broxah


---------93:26----------
i'm not sure because it's it is a it's


---------93:29----------
it's a tricky one one to deal with and


---------93:32----------
it's a bit


---------93:35----------
saying that that everyone has to be


---------93:37----------
responsible and everyone has to to


---------93:39----------
you know push themselves to be better to


---------93:41----------
make a change that


---------93:43----------
that might help to in some cases and to


---------93:45----------
a certain extent but is it is it gonna


---------93:47----------
make it


---------93:47----------
an actual difference i'm not sure the


---------93:50----------
way


---------93:50----------
the way that i've always looked at it


---------93:55----------
especially now that i've grown my my


---------93:57----------
brand


---------93:58----------
to a certain extent is that


---------94:01----------
what i can do is to try to be


---------94:04----------
a professional and the way that i that


---------94:07----------
there's a lot of people out there who


---------94:08----------
look up to me


---------94:09----------
for whichever reasons whether it's as a


---------94:12----------
person or as a player


---------94:14----------
and when i say something or when i do


---------94:16----------
something


---------94:17----------
many of those people kind of idolize us


---------94:19----------
in a way they want to


---------94:20----------
act the same way they want to play the


---------94:22----------
same way and if i come across


---------94:25----------
in a poor manner and a pathway


---------94:27----------
especially if i do it consistently


---------94:29----------
all those people are going to start


---------94:30----------
doing the same things they're gonna


---------94:31----------
start


---------94:32----------
behaving that way whenever they play


---------94:33----------
video games they're gonna behave that


---------94:35----------
way whenever they go


---------94:36----------
on social media and


---------94:39----------
therefore even though i'm by no means


---------94:42----------
perfect at it


---------94:43----------
i i always try to go into


---------94:46----------
um streams or


---------94:50----------
videos whatever it might be with without


---------94:52----------
that mindset that


---------94:53----------
um i i want to be a good person


---------94:56----------
i want to be a responsible person and i


---------94:59----------
want to make sure that


---------95:01----------
i am not part of pushing


---------95:04----------
this particular thing that's actually


---------95:06----------
bothering me and that's bothering us out


---------95:08----------
of other people


---------95:09----------
because i think it's a problem so i'm


---------95:10----------
gonna


---------95:12----------
i'm gonna speak up i'm gonna state that


---------95:14----------
it's a problem and i'm gonna try to


---------95:17----------
be part of setting an example of you


---------95:20----------
know how you should treat other people


---------95:21----------
how you should behave


---------95:22----------
on the internet


---------95:26----------
okay i think it's beautiful that you


---------95:28----------
want to do that


---------95:30----------
and also i'm curious


---------95:33----------
what about the people who don't do that


---------95:37----------
yeah and that's uh that can be a bit of


---------95:40----------
a problem right because there's a lot


---------95:42----------
there's a lot of different type of


---------95:43----------
people out there


---------95:46----------
and this goes for


---------95:49----------
you know there's a lot of different


---------95:50----------
famous people out there and all in all


---------95:52----------
aspects whether it's video game sports


---------95:55----------
movies whatever it may be and


---------95:58----------
the way that i see it is that anyone who


---------96:00----------
has a following


---------96:01----------
has a big responsibility for the reason


---------96:04----------
that


---------96:05----------
reasons that i i just mentioned i think


---------96:07----------
it's so important


---------96:08----------
in the in this community the pro-gaming


---------96:11----------
community the league of legends


---------96:12----------
community whatever


---------96:13----------
whatever gaming community is that all


---------96:16----------
those people with a big voice with a big


---------96:17----------
following


---------96:21----------
they don't necessarily have to sugarcoat


---------96:22----------
everything or be positive all the time


---------96:25----------
or whatever it may be but it's so


---------96:28----------
important that you


---------96:30----------
um you come across in the right way


---------96:32----------
because you have


---------96:33----------
like some of these people have thousands


---------96:35----------
and thousands of of


---------96:37----------
our fans so brock's i'm gonna


---------96:41----------
push back a little bit once again so i'm


---------96:43----------
all for your positivity


---------96:45----------
you know we're we try to be positive


---------96:46----------
here but just to


---------96:48----------
because i i genuinely want to work on


---------96:50----------
this so i want to challenge your ideas a


---------96:51----------
little bit is that okay


---------96:54----------
sure so the first thing is that in my


---------96:56----------
experience sometimes the people who


---------96:58----------
we perceive as toxic believe that


---------97:00----------
they're behaving


---------97:01----------
in the same way that you're describing


---------97:04----------
they believe that they're behaving in a


---------97:06----------
responsible way right


---------97:07----------
they just think that like you know being


---------97:09----------
honest or not letting people get away


---------97:11----------
with their [ __ ] or things like that


---------97:13----------
so i think that's something we have to


---------97:14----------
acknowledge


---------97:15----------
i don't think that there are people


---------97:16----------
walking around thinking you know they


---------97:18----------
wake up in the morning and they look in


---------97:20----------
the mirror


---------97:20----------
like boy am i a toxic [ __ ] let me go


---------97:22----------
make some dude's life


---------97:23----------
miserable i think most people think that


---------97:25----------
they're behaving actually exactly the


---------97:27----------
same way that


---------97:28----------
you say you aren't i actually don't know


---------97:29----------
anything about you know toxicity in


---------97:31----------
league so


---------97:32----------
maybe you're actually a toxic [ __ ]


---------97:34----------
and i just am not aware of it


---------97:36----------
right um so that's one thing and the


---------97:38----------
second thing that i kind of toss out is


---------97:40----------
that


---------97:41----------
so i get what you're saying i think each


---------97:42----------
person who has a platform has a


---------97:44----------
responsibility to try to be a model


---------97:47----------
for behavior right that's what you're


---------97:48----------
saying


---------97:50----------
yeah i think that's that's one of the


---------97:52----------
things i thought about that


---------97:54----------
that's important yeah so i agree with


---------97:56----------
you i think the challenge is


---------97:58----------
a couple of things one is that some


---------98:00----------
people who may be perceived by others as


---------98:02----------
toxic


---------98:03----------
do believe that they are being a model


---------98:07----------
yeah right so that's a challenge that we


---------98:09----------
have to somehow overcome


---------98:10----------
and so this is where like sometimes i


---------98:12----------
wonder a little bit about like actually


---------98:14----------
conflict resolution directly


---------98:17----------
so this is where where you know you're


---------98:19----------
saying that everyone should hold


---------98:20----------
themselves to a higher standard what i'm


---------98:22----------
curious about is


---------98:23----------
is there a healthy way if there's


---------98:25----------
toxicity between two people


---------98:27----------
is there a healthy way to actually


---------98:29----------
resolve that that toxicity


---------98:31----------
instead of i'm gonna be a responsible


---------98:33----------
dude over here and you're gonna be a


---------98:35----------
responsible dude over there


---------98:37----------
and like


---------98:41----------
you know because i think we have to


---------98:42----------
engage people this is my hypothesis now


---------98:45----------
so i'm not really challenging what


---------98:46----------
you're saying


---------98:47----------
it's it's actually if i really think


---------98:48----------
about what i'm asking for is


---------98:50----------
your approval or your criticism


---------98:54----------
based on what i'm thinking to help me


---------98:55----------
think through this


---------98:57----------
because when i think about conflict


---------98:58----------
resolution in real life it's not like


---------99:01----------
when i have an argument with my wife i


---------99:03----------
don't just hold myself to a model of


---------99:05----------
high behavior and he


---------99:06----------
she holds herself to an a model of high


---------99:08----------
behavior that's why we [ __ ] argue in


---------99:10----------
the first place is because


---------99:11----------
i think i'm holding myself to a good


---------99:12----------
standard she thinks she's holding


---------99:14----------
herself to a good standard we just


---------99:15----------
disagree


---------99:18----------
right so so what i'm kind of curious


---------99:20----------
about is like now that


---------99:21----------
you can you know in the past we used to


---------99:23----------
yell at footballers on the tv


---------99:25----------
now we can dm them and and so


---------99:29----------
i'm just i just don't i think relying on


---------99:32----------
people to be models of good behavior


---------99:34----------
basically this is what i'm saying


---------99:35----------
doesn't seem to be working


---------99:38----------
no it's uh it it doesn't


---------99:42----------
it works to a certain extent but not not


---------99:45----------
to


---------99:45----------
to the maximum and and so just curious


---------99:49----------
if if you think there's some


---------99:51----------
i know conflict resolution may not be i


---------99:53----------
don't know if people know what that


---------99:55----------
means practically but like


---------99:57----------
that i basically believe that we need to


---------100:00----------
engage


---------100:00----------
people in like a more active way if we


---------100:02----------
want to do something about toxicity


---------100:05----------
that's my hypothesis


---------100:10----------
yeah but how exactly would you do that i


---------100:12----------
don't know


---------100:14----------
so so i i will say this


---------100:17----------
um there's a particular


---------100:21----------
esport that that i actually run a group


---------100:25----------
for pro players that um and we kind of


---------100:28----------
work through toxicity issues


---------100:31----------
on a weekly basis and we kind of show up


---------100:34----------
and we talk and i think it's been really


---------100:36----------
interesting to see how things have


---------100:37----------
changed because


---------100:39----------
being able directly like like fighting


---------100:41----------
over twitter


---------100:43----------
it's really easy to get mad at someone


---------100:44----------
but like when you get people in a room


---------100:46----------
together it's like


---------100:47----------
harder to call each other [ __ ] and


---------100:50----------
sometimes they do call each other


---------100:52----------
[ __ ]


---------100:53----------
and and even if they do call each other


---------100:55----------
[ __ ] then we kind of like work


---------100:56----------
through it


---------100:58----------
yeah and i think a lot of a lot of


---------101:01----------
people who


---------101:02----------
who don't don't behave that well on the


---------101:04----------
internet a lot of them aren't


---------101:06----------
[ __ ] a lot of them are good people


---------101:08----------
but there's certain reasons or


---------101:10----------
that they might have a bad day there


---------101:13----------
might be something recently that has


---------101:15----------
happened that's making them frustrated


---------101:16----------
and they just went out on the internet


---------101:18----------
or


---------101:19----------
something that happened when they were


---------101:20----------
growing up there's a lot of reasons


---------101:22----------
as to why people behave a certain way


---------101:24----------
right and i totally get where you're


---------101:26----------
coming from that


---------101:27----------
someone can behave one way on the


---------101:29----------
internet and then when you meet them in


---------101:31----------
person it's like


---------101:32----------
meeting a completely different person


---------101:35----------
and that can be the case both you know


---------101:38----------
it can be this way where it's a positive


---------101:40----------
experience but it can also go the other


---------101:41----------
way


---------101:42----------
absolutely yeah so i mean after


---------101:45----------
listening to you you know here uh i


---------101:48----------
don't know if


---------101:49----------
what is more exciting to me but i have


---------101:51----------
two or three random ideas one is that


---------101:53----------
i think it would be cool if i don't know


---------101:55----------
if this is like actually okay with


---------101:57----------
tos for twitch but i think it would be a


---------102:00----------
lot of fun so my


---------102:01----------
younger daughter the three-year-old


---------102:02----------
actually likes dota


---------102:05----------
and and she likes um she likes playing


---------102:08----------
once again the monstrous creatures so


---------102:10----------
she's not interested


---------102:11----------
in in you know the the female wizards


---------102:15----------
and things like that she likes to play


---------102:17----------
this hero called tide hunter who's like


---------102:19----------
a sea monster


---------102:20----------
so she said she wants to play the sea


---------102:21----------
monster and and so she likes to play


---------102:23----------
this year i think it'd be like i think


---------102:24----------
it's like really cool i'd love to


---------102:26----------
do like a stream with like you and your


---------102:28----------
brother and and me and my


---------102:30----------
daughter and have like a kids and anyway


---------102:33----------
i don't know if that's okay because it


---------102:34----------
has children on twitch so maybe that's


---------102:36----------
like against tos but


---------102:37----------
i think it would be cool um because i i


---------102:39----------
do really enjoy


---------102:41----------
so i my mind is kind of going there uh


---------102:43----------
the second thing is i don't know if it


---------102:45----------
would


---------102:45----------
you know my wife would be okay with it


---------102:46----------
or even i would be okay with it with


---------102:48----------
having my kid on stream but


---------102:49----------
um that may not be you know because as


---------102:52----------
we're talking about the internet is a


---------102:53----------
toxic place


---------102:55----------
uh the other thing that i'm wondering


---------102:56----------
about is whether we need like some kind


---------102:58----------
of couples counseling


---------103:00----------
for people on the internet um and


---------103:04----------
and just you know because i i think like


---------103:06----------
people


---------103:07----------
i don't know that's just thoughts but


---------103:10----------
yeah you think i'm not i'm not sure like


---------103:13----------
i think as you're saying finding


---------103:14----------
different ways to


---------103:16----------
engage people so i'm just chad is


---------103:19----------
telling me that


---------103:20----------
no no no nobody below 13 so that's


---------103:22----------
abandonable


---------103:23----------
makes sense okay so that's probably the


---------103:25----------
idea of the window


---------103:27----------
yeah apparently so as you're saying like


---------103:29----------
i also think it's important to try to


---------103:32----------
well come up with ways to engage people


---------103:34----------
because


---------103:36----------
um in inside these games


---------103:39----------
on social media you can always you can


---------103:41----------
always tighten up the rules and you can


---------103:43----------
make really strict rules but


---------103:45----------
it's not going to help i mean only to a


---------103:48----------
certain extent right i think it goes a


---------103:49----------
bit back to what you were saying earlier


---------103:50----------
but


---------103:51----------
rather than dealing with with the


---------103:54----------
problem in a good way you're just kind


---------103:55----------
of like you're not really dealing with


---------103:57----------
it you're just shutting it down a little


---------103:58----------
bit but the problem is still going to


---------103:59----------
exist and it's just going to come back


---------104:01----------
later yeah yeah i think finding that way


---------104:05----------
to


---------104:06----------
engage people and and make this changes


---------104:09----------
would be a big step but it's it's a


---------104:12----------
tricky one that no one has


---------104:13----------
quite figured out yet yeah but that's


---------104:16----------
what we're here for


---------104:16----------
roxanna oh right so sure so we're we're


---------104:19----------
stepping into uncertainty now


---------104:22----------
and we don't know if we can figure it


---------104:23----------
out but i i'd love it if you just


---------104:25----------
you know think on it sleep on it and if


---------104:27----------
you have any thoughts about what we can


---------104:29----------
do please let me know


---------104:31----------
um or what we can do if there's any way


---------104:34----------
i can help you with any answers that you


---------104:36----------
come


---------104:36----------
up with please let me know um


---------104:40----------
but yeah so last sort of thing that we


---------104:44----------
tend to do


---------104:45----------
any questions by the way


---------104:48----------
no not really um so the last thing is


---------104:50----------
some people


---------104:51----------
want to learn how to meditate i don't


---------104:53----------
know if you do meditate or if you're


---------104:54----------
interested in learning but i'm happy to


---------104:56----------
teach you if you


---------104:57----------
are curious about it i've done a bit of


---------105:01----------
mindfulness before if that counts


---------105:04----------
sure it's mindfulness but it's not


---------105:07----------
meditation


---------105:08----------
yeah yeah i think it certainly counts in


---------105:10----------
the same bucket


---------105:11----------
yeah to a certain extent it counts but


---------105:14----------
i've never done


---------105:15----------
i guess you could say actual meditation


---------105:16----------
so i'm down for the experience


---------105:18----------
okay do you want to do something a


---------105:20----------
little bit more


---------105:22----------
okay so if we're gonna do something a


---------105:23----------
little bit away from mindfulness


---------105:27----------
um i'm gonna teach you maybe a more


---------105:28----------
intensive meditation


---------105:30----------
technique that i think also relates to


---------105:32----------
confidence


---------105:34----------
okay okay yeah so i'm gonna teach you


---------105:37----------
something called um it's been a while


---------105:40----------
since we've taught this on stream but


---------105:42----------
you seem to be a pretty resilient guy so


---------105:44----------
we'll we'll kind of go there and and for


---------105:46----------
people


---------105:47----------
because we talked a lot about confidence


---------105:48----------
as opposed to toxicity


---------105:50----------
so a lot of people you know if we think


---------105:51----------
about confidence confidence is this


---------105:53----------
intrinsic


---------105:56----------
can i just think for a second of course


---------106:16----------
okay so i'm going to try to summarize


---------106:19----------
and then i'll teach you a meditation


---------106:20----------
technique okay


---------106:21----------
okay so


---------106:25----------
a lot of people ask us how do i


---------106:28----------
become confident right like how do i


---------106:32----------
like gain confidence how do i build


---------106:34----------
confidence so i think


---------106:35----------
as we learned about from talking to you


---------106:37----------
broxah the first thing to understand


---------106:39----------
is that people when when they say how do


---------106:42----------
i become


---------106:42----------
confident they're missing something


---------106:44----------
because confidence is not something that


---------106:46----------
you intrinsically do


---------106:48----------
it's not something you can build all by


---------106:50----------
yourself


---------106:51----------
that's the first misnomer so we think


---------106:53----------
about where your confidence comes from


---------106:55----------
it's actually


---------106:56----------
taught so originally for young children


---------106:59----------
and even like you know older children or


---------107:01----------
teenagers


---------107:02----------
confidence is something that is taught


---------107:04----------
to you and what i mean by that is that


---------107:07----------
your parents or other people that are


---------107:09----------
close to you in life will like speak to


---------107:11----------
you in a certain way


---------107:12----------
and that thing becomes the voice in your


---------107:16----------
head


---------107:18----------
and then what happens is you know in in


---------107:20----------
moments where you have crisis


---------107:22----------
of confidence what happens is you have a


---------107:24----------
war in your head


---------107:25----------
and there are two voices right one is


---------107:27----------
saying you can do it


---------107:28----------
and the other one's saying you can't do


---------107:30----------
it


---------107:32----------
and so already if if you have that


---------107:34----------
conflict the first thing to understand


---------107:35----------
is that when you're really young


---------107:37----------
the part of you that says you can do it


---------107:39----------
is not something that you can build on


---------107:41----------
your own


---------107:41----------
it's something that you're given and so


---------107:43----------
some people are kind of given the short


---------107:45----------
straw


---------107:46----------
and some people are given like a good


---------107:48----------
hand i mean


---------107:49----------
a bad hand of cards or a good hand of


---------107:51----------
cards


---------107:52----------
good rng or bad rng and so


---------107:56----------
that's the first thing okay so then the


---------107:58----------
next thing is then you have a little war


---------108:00----------
and the more that you


---------108:03----------
face things uncertainly the more that


---------108:06----------
you face things that you're not sure are


---------108:08----------
going to work out well


---------108:10----------
the more you go into things blind the


---------108:12----------
more your confidence is going to grow


---------108:14----------
and this is another tricky thing that


---------108:15----------
people fall into is that when they lack


---------108:17----------
confidence


---------108:18----------
what they try to do is adjust the


---------108:22----------
rules of the game so that they don't


---------108:25----------
have to take a chance


---------108:27----------
right so what i'm gonna do is like if


---------108:29----------
i'm not confident that i'm going to pass


---------108:31----------
the test what i'm going to do is cheat


---------108:33----------
and even though i can get the result


---------108:35----------
it's not going to build my confidence at


---------108:37----------
all


---------108:38----------
so people are willing to sacrifice


---------108:42----------
confidence to gain a victory


---------108:47----------
so we also see this sometimes in like


---------108:49----------
dudes who get friend zoned


---------108:51----------
where they're afraid like let's say i


---------108:53----------
want to ask a girl out


---------108:55----------
and if we if you ever come back on


---------108:56----------
stream we've got to talk about your


---------108:57----------
girlfriend


---------108:59----------
um but you know let's say you want to


---------109:02----------
ask a girl out and you're afraid she's


---------109:03----------
gonna say no


---------109:04----------
and so then what they end up doing is


---------109:06----------
like they'll do things like they'll get


---------109:07----------
her gifts and stuff


---------109:09----------
and what they want to do is they want


---------109:11----------
her to like like them more so that they


---------109:14----------
can remove the uncertainty of the


---------109:16----------
equation


---------109:17----------
and then when they ask her out she's


---------109:18----------
going to like me so much she's going to


---------109:20----------
see how awesome of a dude i am


---------109:22----------
i care about her so much she's going to


---------109:24----------
notice that she'll notice it eventually


---------109:26----------
i'll get her flowers for valentine's day


---------109:28----------
but i won't tell her that i'm interested


---------109:31----------
and so then they like invest a lot to


---------109:33----------
remove uncertainty from the equation


---------109:36----------
yeah right and then anyway it usually


---------109:39----------
doesn't end up going well


---------109:41----------
but at the end of the day though like


---------109:43----------
that's tricky because the things that we


---------109:44----------
do like we're not willing to face things


---------109:46----------
we're not willing to face uncertainty


---------109:49----------
so and when we do face uncertainty and


---------109:51----------
we come out on top or even if we fail


---------109:54----------
we actually end up more confident at the


---------109:56----------
end of it as long as you're willing to


---------109:57----------
face uncertainty


---------109:58----------
as long as you're willing to go into


---------110:00----------
something blind


---------110:01----------
and when you survive at the end you


---------110:03----------
mentioned to us earlier that


---------110:04----------
you know you even if you lose you know


---------110:06----------
everything's gonna be okay


---------110:07----------
and if you really think about that how


---------110:09----------
did you learn that


---------110:11----------
like that's a really important lesson


---------110:13----------
but the way you learned that


---------110:15----------
is by going into something failing and


---------110:17----------
then like


---------110:18----------
waking up the next day and being like oh


---------110:21----------
i'm still okay right


---------110:24----------
and and so this is where early on you


---------110:26----------
said kind of confidence comes from


---------110:28----------
maybe the hard work that you put in or


---------110:30----------
some people think that confidence comes


---------110:31----------
from success


---------110:32----------
but actually if we really think about it


---------110:34----------
when you talk about your thoughts of


---------110:35----------
confidence


---------110:36----------
they don't necessarily come from your


---------110:37----------
success they actually come from your


---------110:39----------
failure


---------110:40----------
what they really come from is stepping


---------110:42----------
into something not knowing whether you


---------110:44----------
can handle it or not


---------110:46----------
that's how you grow it but it sort of


---------110:48----------
starts with


---------110:49----------
you know there's a part that's given to


---------110:50----------
you and there's a part that you grow


---------110:52----------
and that's how you become confident in


---------110:54----------
short so


---------110:57----------
the next question is let's say people


---------110:59----------
have bad


---------111:00----------
rng and they're not like you and they


---------111:02----------
grew up in a situation


---------111:04----------
where they don't have intrinsic


---------111:05----------
confidence their self-talk is not


---------111:08----------
positive their self-talk is negative


---------111:09----------
which is something you've experienced


---------111:11----------
right


---------111:12----------
so how do we start if you were given a


---------111:14----------
bad hand and so what i'm going to teach


---------111:16----------
you is a meditation technique


---------111:18----------
that will neutralize your self-talk and


---------111:21----------
will start to give you


---------111:22----------
a sense of who you are as a person


---------111:25----------
that is free from what other people


---------111:28----------
think of you


---------111:30----------
okay so what that sort of means is that


---------111:32----------
if you're not confident i hope that


---------111:34----------
you'll get a sense of like


---------111:36----------
your core being if you are confident


---------111:39----------
hopefully it'll still feel good


---------111:40----------
okay so there's gonna be kind of a weird


---------111:42----------
technique


---------111:43----------
so this this technique is um is


---------111:47----------
called b's breath and also it's two


---------111:51----------
techniques


---------111:51----------
it's b's breath like the breath of a bee


---------111:54----------
and then the second technique is the


---------111:55----------
closing of the nine


---------111:56----------
gates okay i know it's weird


---------112:00----------
it's gonna be weird it's gonna be even


---------112:02----------
weirder when you do it but the goal is


---------112:03----------
that you're gonna do this technique


---------112:06----------
and it's gonna be quite enveloping


---------112:09----------
for your consciousness


---------112:13----------
and then after you do this technique for


---------112:15----------
a while what it's hopefully is going to


---------112:16----------
do


---------112:17----------
is going to knock out your thoughts


---------112:19----------
knock out your self-talk completely and


---------112:21----------
you're going to be


---------112:22----------
left with a state of self that is like


---------112:25----------
super super neutral


---------112:27----------
but the more you sit with that neutral


---------112:30----------
state the more


---------112:31----------
your negative self-talk will melt away


---------112:34----------
and the more you'll be able to go to


---------112:36----------
that neutral state


---------112:37----------
if you start to tilt if you start to


---------112:40----------
lose confidence you can go ahead and


---------112:41----------
yawn just yawn bro


---------112:42----------
it's totally fine um it's just


---------112:46----------
you know i'm lecturing so it's


---------112:47----------
completely fair oh it's not that it's


---------112:49----------
boring it's just


---------112:50----------
there's been so much to digest you know


---------112:52----------
i i understand that's why i'm not i


---------112:54----------
don't take it offensively and people


---------112:55----------
think it's offensive if you


---------112:57----------
but i yawn i lecture all the time and


---------112:59----------
people are yawning all the time and i


---------113:00----------
know it's not my fault just like i know


---------113:02----------
that in dota when i jungle and my team


---------113:04----------
loses it's not my fault it's just what


---------113:05----------
happens right


---------113:07----------
anyway okay so you ready for the


---------113:09----------
technique


---------113:10----------
yes okay so this is gonna be kind of


---------113:12----------
weird because you're gonna have to take


---------113:13----------
off your headset to do it


---------113:15----------
okay but this is gonna be complicated


---------113:17----------
i'm gonna show you first i'm gonna show


---------113:18----------
you


---------113:19----------
the closing of the nine gates okay


---------113:23----------
so i'm gonna take my hands


---------113:27----------
hold on let me think about this okay


---------113:30----------
so i'm going to take my hands this is


---------113:32----------
going to be hard so oh [ __ ] how can i


---------113:33----------
shoot


---------113:33----------
okay these are my hands right so my


---------113:35----------
pinkies are going to go here


---------113:37----------
my middle uh ring finger is going to go


---------113:40----------
here right outside my nose


---------113:42----------
and this is going to be kind of weird


---------113:43----------
these two fingers are going to go on


---------113:45----------
either sides of my eyes like this okay


---------113:53----------
okay and then my thumbs are gonna go in


---------113:56----------
my ears


---------113:58----------
like that so what i'm gonna do is sort


---------114:01----------
of block


---------114:02----------
off all of the ways that my mind goes


---------114:05----------
out into the external world


---------114:08----------
okay so the nine gates that we're


---------114:10----------
closing if we think about the way that


---------114:12----------
we relate to the outside world we do


---------114:14----------
through


---------114:15----------
do we connect to the outside world


---------114:17----------
through our sense organs


---------114:20----------
okay and the outside world doesn't


---------114:22----------
really know who we are


---------114:23----------
so what we're gonna try to do is


---------114:24----------
disconnect from the outside world and


---------114:26----------
just be inside


---------114:28----------
okay okay so if you need an easy version


---------114:31----------
all you really need to do is close your


---------114:32----------
eyes and do this


---------114:33----------
this works too it's not as powerful but


---------114:36----------
it works okay


---------114:37----------
but if you have trouble doing huh that


---------114:40----------
can be planned


---------114:41----------
yeah that's gonna be plan b and then


---------114:43----------
what we're gonna do is we're gonna buzz


---------114:44----------
like a b


---------114:45----------
okay so i'm gonna show you the technique


---------114:56----------
[Music]


---------115:05----------
you got me did that clip out


---------115:09----------
well i i heard the style yeah that's


---------115:12----------
great so you're not a buzz right so why


---------115:13----------
don't you take off your headset


---------115:15----------
and adopt the thing and i'm i'm not


---------115:17----------
going to be able to tell you because you


---------115:18----------
won't be able to hear


---------115:19----------
but how do you feel about trying this is


---------115:21----------
too [ __ ]


---------115:24----------
it's going to be interesting but yeah i


---------115:26----------
i think i think


---------115:28----------
i have an idea so how long do i have to


---------115:29----------
do it for like


---------115:31----------
we're gonna do one breath and then we're


---------115:32----------
gonna check in again okay


---------115:34----------
okay


---------115:39----------
okay so oh you can't hear me


---------115:43----------
so look oh there we go


---------115:47----------
figured it out yep good he can't hear me


---------115:50----------
and then it


---------115:51----------
inside the ear and then


---------115:56----------
we can't really hear him they can't


---------116:00----------
hear us


---------116:13----------
okay what was that like


---------116:22----------
i don't know okay so


---------116:27----------
great so we're going to give you one or


---------116:29----------
two pointers


---------116:30----------
so the first time you do it it just


---------116:32----------
feels weird


---------116:34----------
yeah it felt a bit awkward and i was


---------116:36----------
kind of the


---------116:37----------
the first stage was questioning what i


---------116:38----------
was doing right so so


---------116:41----------
what we want to do is power through that


---------116:43----------
questioning


---------116:44----------
so the first time you do it you're just


---------116:45----------
going to feel so uncomfortable that


---------116:47----------
you're not even focusing on the practice


---------116:49----------
okay so i'm going to give you two


---------116:51----------
pointers one is that


---------116:53----------
the you don't want to press on your eyes


---------116:54----------
for sure okay


---------116:56----------
yeah so if you want to you can do this


---------116:58----------
if this is easier like


---------117:00----------
something like this is fine you want


---------117:03----------
your thumbs to be


---------117:04----------
inside your ear canal okay


---------117:07----------
okay and now what i want you to do is at


---------117:09----------
your own pace


---------117:11----------
do five breaths so take a big long


---------117:13----------
breath


---------117:17----------
okay and then you're gonna feel weird


---------117:19----------
doing it


---------117:20----------
and then the second breath is gonna be


---------117:22----------
easier


---------117:24----------
the third breath you're gonna get into


---------117:26----------
it the fourth breath hopefully is


---------117:28----------
relatively peaceful


---------117:29----------
and the fifth breath you may feel a


---------117:31----------
little bit light-headed which is fine


---------117:33----------
so you can go at your own pace if you


---------117:35----------
start to feel like lightheaded


---------117:37----------
you can go ahead and take a breath in


---------117:38----------
between like you can just you know take


---------117:40----------
a few breaths in between the rounds okay


---------117:42----------
and you're gonna feel super anxious and


---------117:44----------
weird at the beginning and then the


---------117:45----------
whole point of the practice


---------117:47----------
is that as you breathe the anxiety and


---------117:50----------
the feeling weird is going to go down


---------117:51----------
and you're going to be centered like


---------117:53----------
kind of in yourself


---------117:55----------
okay and then after the last round i


---------117:58----------
want you to just keep your eyes closed


---------117:59----------
and just


---------118:00----------
sit with yourself okay okay


---------118:03----------
let's do it together okay okay


---------118:07----------
but you're gonna have to do it at your


---------118:08----------
own pace you're gonna have to do it at


---------118:09----------
your own pace because we're not gonna be


---------118:10----------
able to hear each other


---------118:12----------
okay okay chat you guys do it too


---------118:18----------
okay


---------118:32----------
um


---------118:42----------
[Music]


---------119:00----------
um


---------119:14----------
hmm


---------119:17----------
[Music]


---------119:28----------
um


---------119:31----------
[Music]


---------119:56----------
one


---------120:07----------
how you doing


---------120:10----------
i do feel a bit hills yeah it can lead


---------120:13----------
to that


---------120:15----------
what did you what was your experience of


---------120:17----------
it


---------120:24----------
i can i can see


---------120:27----------
where what you said about coming to like


---------120:30----------
a neutral state come from


---------120:32----------
because it was just like


---------120:35----------
focusing on the breath focusing on the


---------120:38----------
on the b sound really


---------120:39----------
yeah and just not thinking about


---------120:41----------
anything else for like


---------120:43----------
a little a little moment right and then


---------120:45----------
even afterwards


---------120:47----------
um you know normally the mind wanders


---------120:49----------
and you think about a billion things but


---------120:50----------
even


---------120:51----------
right after closing my eyes i mean i was


---------120:54----------
i was thinking


---------120:54----------
at a certain point like how long am i


---------120:56----------
supposed to have my eyes closed right or


---------120:58----------
what i want to that point there's like


---------121:01----------
i wasn't really thinking about anything


---------121:04----------
just focusing on the breath


---------121:07----------
right so as you practice this and if you


---------121:08----------
don't do it on stream and you can do it


---------121:10----------
you know on your own


---------121:11----------
you'll it's gonna be way easier but


---------121:14----------
the the whole point so i guess this


---------121:16----------
isn't really a technique to build


---------121:18----------
confidence what this is is a technique


---------121:20----------
to wipe away


---------121:22----------
lack of confidence yeah


---------121:25----------
right so when you're having that


---------121:27----------
negative self-talk when your mind is


---------121:29----------
full of that negativity


---------121:31----------
it's a way to flatline it


---------121:34----------
and what i would encourage you to do if


---------121:36----------
if it fit for you great do it if it


---------121:38----------
didn't fit for you no big deal


---------121:40----------
um but i'd say if you continue to do it


---------121:42----------
you know


---------121:44----------
sit quietly for like two minutes three


---------121:46----------
minutes four minutes five minutes with


---------121:47----------
your eyes closed afterward


---------121:49----------
and then gradually as your brain


---------121:51----------
acclimatizes to the


---------121:53----------
you know different level of co2 and


---------121:55----------
oxygen


---------121:56----------
you can go up to nine breaths so nine


---------121:59----------
rounds and then really just sit


---------122:00----------
and it'll kind of like balance you out


---------122:04----------
okay yeah cool okay


---------122:07----------
well thanks a lot for coming on man yeah


---------122:10----------
i mean thanks for for having me this has


---------122:12----------
