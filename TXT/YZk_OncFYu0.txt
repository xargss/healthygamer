---------00:00----------
that's the big trick right that's the


---------00:02----------
tricky thing that's the paradox of life


---------00:05----------
is that if you want to stop being a


---------00:06----------
failure the first step is advertising uh


---------00:09----------
this is kind of interesting


---------00:10----------
and broke sand is saying i'm a


---------00:11----------
psychologist but had little to no


---------00:13----------
benefit from therapy myself for anxiety


---------00:15----------
and depression although i know the


---------00:17----------
literature supports efficacy over


---------00:18----------
placebo my experience creates an


---------00:20----------
internal conflict within me when


---------00:22----------
thinking of exercising the profession of


---------00:24----------
a therapist


---------00:25----------
i'm considering changing career path


---------00:27----------
because of this and i feel lost so i


---------00:28----------
think this is great


---------00:30----------
so i mean not that you're in the


---------00:31----------
situation the situation's unfortunate


---------00:33----------
bro but i think this is a a great


---------00:35----------
example also you may not be a bro and


---------00:37----------
this is a great example of like it's


---------00:38----------
that internal conflict that you've got


---------00:40----------
to potentially work through with a


---------00:41----------
therapist right so i don't know if you


---------00:42----------
ever did that but going to a therapist


---------00:45----------
and saying hey i'm not sure if this is


---------00:46----------
working even though i'm a psychologist


---------00:48----------
like i don't i don't know exactly what


---------00:49----------
to do about that


---------00:51----------
it's working through that internal


---------00:52----------
conflict which will absolutely be the


---------00:54----------
right thing


---------00:55----------
right because as long as that internal


---------00:56----------
conflict is there like you're not going


---------00:57----------
to benefit from therapy that's the first


---------00:59----------
thing you need to go through go to


---------01:09----------
okay


---------01:13----------
uh yeah so but why do i want to play


---------01:14----------
solo so much because when you're playing


---------01:16----------
solo no one has to see your failures


---------01:19----------
that's why we love playing solo


---------01:22----------
right


---------01:23----------
so you guys ever do this thing where


---------01:24----------
like


---------01:25----------
if you know like if you're going to a


---------01:26----------
lan party and you haven't played a game


---------01:29----------
that you like practice at first before


---------01:30----------
the lan party so you don't get owned


---------01:35----------
if you do that then you know why you


---------01:36----------
play solo


---------01:40----------
it's one thing to be a failure it's


---------01:42----------
another thing to advertise it


---------01:44----------
that's the big trick right that's the


---------01:47----------
tricky thing that's the paradox of life


---------01:50----------
is that if you want to stop being a


---------01:51----------
failure the first step is advertising it


---------01:53----------
that's how you get help and help is op


---------01:54----------
like just think about this for a second


---------01:56----------
chat


---------01:57----------
think about this there are people out


---------01:59----------
there who are better at this than you


---------02:00----------
are


---------02:01----------
and you can try to learn it yourself the


---------02:03----------
hard way but like you can just like go


---------02:04----------
and get help and they'll tell you how to


---------02:05----------
do it people are there to help you


---------02:06----------
people love helping you like think about


---------02:08----------
you like you love helping other people


---------02:10----------
y'all are great


---------02:11----------
[Music]


---------02:12----------
but


---------02:14----------
it's it's devastating but


---------02:17----------
remaining a failure is borum


---------02:20----------
is


---------02:21----------
how can i say this


---------02:24----------
for most people


---------02:26----------
they would rather remain


---------02:28----------
a hidden failure


---------02:30----------
than advertise being a failure and no


---------02:32----------
longer being a failure


---------02:34----------
we'll we'll choose hidden failure over


---------02:37----------
public success any day of the week


---------02:40----------
and that's one of the most devastating


---------02:41----------
things about being human and i think our


---------02:43----------
current like internet based environment


---------02:45----------
only exacerbates that


---------02:50----------
so let go of ego meditate


---------02:53----------
you know


---------02:54----------
and let yourself suck


---------02:56----------
like that's okay


---------02:59----------
like this is the other problem that


---------03:00----------
happens is we identify with sucking


---------03:03----------
right so we don't say to ourselves


---------03:06----------
like we


---------03:08----------
we don't think about ourselves as


---------03:10----------
inexperienced


---------03:11----------
all we see is our performance so like we


---------03:14----------
we attribute our failures not to a lack


---------03:17----------
of inexperience but to personality


---------03:19----------
issues


---------03:20----------
so we say like oh like i am lazy or i'm


---------03:22----------
an idiot or like other people are


---------03:24----------
successful


---------03:26----------
we use these be verbs are am


---------03:29----------
i am this way i am a failure i am an


---------03:31----------
incel it's an identification with a


---------03:34----------
thing


---------03:35----------
you know i am


---------03:36----------
like we don't say i just haven't had a


---------03:38----------
girlfriend yet like that's not what we


---------03:40----------
say


---------03:41----------
i haven't had is like very different


---------03:42----------
like we identify with the thing and if


---------03:44----------
you look at research on psychedelics and


---------03:47----------
meditation


---------03:48----------
the method through which psychedelics


---------03:50----------
and meditation seem to work is they


---------03:52----------
change your perception of identity


---------03:54----------
so they change the identification that


---------03:56----------
you have with a particular condition


---------03:59----------
so people who will use psychedelics like


---------04:02----------
the ones that use it in the therapeutic


---------04:03----------
environment the ones that have good


---------04:05----------
experiences


---------04:06----------
will say things like i realize that i am


---------04:08----------
not a failure like i'm what i am is


---------04:10----------
different from a failure like and so


---------04:12----------
then they separate that out therapy can


---------04:14----------
do that meditation can do that you have


---------04:16----------
to divorce yourself from like the


---------04:18----------
outcomes of your actions and when you


---------04:20----------
start defining yourself as a failure


---------04:22----------
that's when you're screwed


---------04:23----------
right because then all kinds of like


---------04:25----------
subconscious calculations change


---------04:28----------
and i've come to appreciate over the


---------04:30----------
last couple weeks like the value of


---------04:31----------
subconscious calculations


---------04:33----------
and your mind is like constantly


---------04:35----------
calculating about what you can do and


---------04:37----------
what you can't do and if you perceive


---------04:38----------
yourself as a failure you're kind of


---------04:40----------
screwed there yeah so gravy boat is


---------04:42----------
saying a bad trip on lsd is as helpful


---------04:45----------
as a good one you still learn about


---------04:46----------
yourself albeit it's chaos so that's


---------04:48----------
where i'd say that you're lucky so i've


---------04:50----------
worked with unfortunately too many


---------04:52----------
people who have had bad trips that have


---------04:54----------
like basically permanently disabled them


---------04:57----------
so i've had people who have like ptsd


---------04:59----------
from


---------05:00----------
lsd trips and they're like not able to


---------05:02----------
hold jobs


---------05:04----------
one person described it to me as


---------05:06----------
permanent anxiety like this so they feel


---------05:08----------
anxious like constantly and like i


---------05:10----------
couldn't


---------05:11----------
i really couldn't help them i tried i


---------05:13----------
just didn't it was just weird


---------05:15----------
like i couldn't find any like root to


---------05:16----------
their anxiety or whatever


---------05:19----------
it's weird


---------05:22----------
so i i i wouldn't really advocate


---------05:25----------
substance use especially psychedelics


---------05:27----------
it's just


---------05:28----------
you're playing with fire so that's also


---------05:30----------
true of like advanced meditation


---------05:32----------
techniques so like my teachers told me


---------05:33----------
for example that you know some


---------05:35----------
techniques that i was taught like i


---------05:37----------
shouldn't do unless i was like with them


---------05:39----------
and like out in the woods


---------05:42----------
so deep meditation techniques the ones


---------05:44----------
that are a little bit more like


---------05:45----------
hallucinatory


---------05:46----------
are have been described to me as playing


---------05:48----------
with fire so even like the kundalini


---------05:50----------
shakti


---------05:51----------
is like viewed as fire that can like


---------05:53----------
consume you so it can burn away like all


---------05:55----------
of your negative karmas or it can burn


---------05:56----------
away everything so those practices need


---------05:58----------
to be done with with a lot of care and


---------06:01----------
caution


---------06:12----------
you
