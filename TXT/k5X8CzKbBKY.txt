---------00:00----------
hello hello


---------00:03----------
um sorry i'm a little nervous


---------00:07----------
yep so you're like what else


---------00:10----------
yeah so how do you deal with on


---------00:13----------
ironically being dead inside


---------00:15----------
due to a long time of suppressing


---------00:17----------
emotions


---------00:19----------
uh so how how do you manage having


---------00:22----------
suppressed emotions for a very long time


---------00:26----------
yeah and i feel kind of dead inside like


---------00:28----------
i do i don't even feel alive


---------00:30----------
i can't even feel any emotions


---------00:33----------
do you feel any emotions like


---------00:37----------
let's say i'm playing a game and and


---------00:40----------
sometimes i can get


---------00:41----------
frustrated and things like that but not


---------00:44----------
like


---------00:47----------
i don't know i don't know how to explain


---------00:49----------
it i just


---------00:52----------
i i don't know take your time


---------00:56----------
um i can feel like


---------01:00----------
um the


---------01:03----------
edge of an emotion if that makes sense


---------01:06----------
like


---------01:06----------
i can't feel like hate or love


---------01:09----------
or like happy or maybe sometimes sadness


---------01:13----------
but it's like


---------01:16----------
it's not like


---------01:21----------
sorry yeah no i i think you're doing


---------01:23----------
great and what what am i calling you


---------01:25----------
friend


---------01:26----------
you can call me rkm or my name is raven


---------01:30----------
if you can't pronounce that sure yeah so


---------01:33----------
ravi i think um so what i'm hearing you


---------01:36----------
say is that you kind of


---------01:37----------
feel the edge of emotion but you don't


---------01:39----------
really feel emotions


---------01:41----------
exactly yeah okay so i think you did a


---------01:44----------
very good job of explaining what do you


---------01:46----------
think


---------01:48----------
i don't think so okay fair enough


---------01:51----------
so i understood what you were trying to


---------01:52----------
say right yeah


---------01:55----------
okay anyway so so rabbit how long have


---------01:57----------
you felt


---------01:59----------
dead inside like


---------02:02----------
uh i was depressed when i was like


---------02:07----------
13 or 14 around that age


---------02:11----------
and probably ever since that and


---------02:14----------
how old are you now i'm 19 20


---------02:17----------
20. have you had treatment for


---------02:20----------
depression


---------02:22----------
no


---------02:26----------
okay would you say that between like 13


---------02:29----------
and now


---------02:29----------
you've had you felt about the same level


---------02:32----------
of debt inside


---------02:34----------
are there periods of time where you feel


---------02:35----------
like better for a little while and then


---------02:37----------
you go back to feeling dead inside


---------02:40----------
um


---------02:41----------
[Music]


---------02:43----------
probably that i feel better sometimes


---------02:47----------
okay and um can you help me understand a


---------02:51----------
little bit about


---------02:53----------
uh why you haven't gotten treatment for


---------02:56----------
depression


---------02:58----------
well i went to a psychologist once and


---------03:04----------
they didn't really understand me


---------03:08----------
so so they just said like


---------03:11----------
you don't have depression like go home


---------03:14----------
or something i don't know


---------03:16----------
so did they did they offer to see you


---------03:19----------
again


---------03:19----------
or they said i'm not going to see you


---------03:21----------
because you don't need to be here


---------03:24----------
it was kind of like an appointment to


---------03:27----------
assess


---------03:29----------
if i have depression or not that person


---------03:32----------
didn't think i had it


---------03:34----------
i see so who was gonna add to that and


---------03:37----------
and how long ago did you see this person


---------03:40----------
um it was kind of it was when i was like


---------03:44----------
15.


---------03:46----------
okay so here's my first thought


---------03:49----------
robin okay so you may have depression


---------03:52----------
and if you have depression there are


---------03:53----------
treatments for depression


---------03:55----------
and i think it's worth seeing someone


---------03:58----------
again


---------03:59----------
right because i have depression actually


---------04:03----------
what do you think you have


---------04:06----------
i don't know what i have i don't feel


---------04:09----------
anything


---------04:10----------
sure so so i think that's fair you may


---------04:13----------
have depression you may not have


---------04:14----------
depression you may think you don't have


---------04:16----------
depression


---------04:17----------
i completely agree i don't know if you


---------04:18----------
have depression or you don't have


---------04:19----------
depression


---------04:20----------
what i'm saying is that when we think


---------04:22----------
about fixing a problem like this


---------04:24----------
there's a chance you have depression and


---------04:27----------
so the right thing to do


---------04:29----------
is to at least we need to know whether


---------04:32----------
you do or you don't


---------04:33----------
right does that make sense


---------04:36----------
yeah so i'm not saying that this is the


---------04:39----------
end of my recommendation


---------04:40----------
but i think a useful piece of this


---------04:43----------
puzzle


---------04:44----------
is going to be getting evaluated by a


---------04:46----------
mental health professional


---------04:48----------
and the story that when you were 15 and


---------04:51----------
the story when you're 19 are different


---------04:52----------
stories


---------04:54----------
does that make sense like if you're a 15


---------04:57----------
year old and you go see a psychologist


---------04:58----------
once and they ask you about your


---------05:00----------
feelings and stuff


---------05:01----------
like at 15 you don't even know what you


---------05:03----------
feel and you've been feeling this way


---------05:05----------
maybe for about a year right but you


---------05:07----------
don't even know how to articulate


---------05:09----------
like you don't know how to say what you


---------05:11----------
feel when you're 15 years old


---------05:14----------
that's a very different story from when


---------05:16----------
i turned 13 or 14 i started feeling


---------05:18----------
depressed and i haven't really felt


---------05:20----------
emotions for the last six years


---------05:22----------
it's a completely different story


---------05:25----------
yeah and so just because someone


---------05:29----------
met you once and didn't think you were


---------05:30----------
depressed when you were 15


---------05:32----------
doesn't mean that that person was


---------05:34----------
correct or even that


---------05:36----------
even if they were correct in that day


---------05:39----------
the story back then and the story now is


---------05:42----------
like very different does that make sense


---------05:44----------
yeah i get time to get that right so


---------05:45----------
that's a really important like


---------05:47----------
clinical piece to understand is that if


---------05:49----------
you guys have been evaluated for


---------05:51----------
something


---------05:52----------
at some random time in the past and you


---------05:55----------
guys like


---------05:56----------
got even like it's not even it may have


---------05:58----------
been possible that


---------06:00----------
someone diagnosed you with depression


---------06:02----------
and now you don't have depression like


---------06:03----------
it


---------06:03----------
there are all kinds of mistakes that can


---------06:05----------
be made in the diagnostic process


---------06:07----------
and ravid i think you should get an


---------06:08----------
evaluation i'm not going to end there


---------06:10----------
i'm going to talk to you about i think


---------06:12----------
the more the answer that you're looking


---------06:13----------
for


---------06:14----------
but i think this is the kind of thing


---------06:15----------
where like i would feel stupid if i like


---------06:17----------
we just talked about feelings and


---------06:18----------
meditation and things like that


---------06:20----------
and you actually like had clinical


---------06:21----------
depression and like you just didn't get


---------06:23----------
treatment for it because that would be


---------06:24----------
like that would be dumb


---------06:26----------
does that make sense like we're going to


---------06:28----------
do the dr k like


---------06:30----------
understand yourself and like learn how


---------06:32----------
to feel your emotions


---------06:33----------
we're gonna do all that i'm gonna give


---------06:34----------
you all that but like at the end of the


---------06:36----------
day


---------06:37----------
it's important to be like very like


---------06:40----------
careful


---------06:41----------
and treat yourself with the respect that


---------06:43----------
you deserve


---------06:44----------
which is giving yourself every


---------06:46----------
opportunity to like get better


---------06:48----------
and overcome this problem and one of


---------06:50----------
those


---------06:51----------
one of those instruments or one of those


---------06:53----------
tools you can use is a clinical


---------06:54----------
evaluation


---------06:55----------
for some kind of depression does that


---------06:59----------
make sense


---------07:00----------
yes okay on to the dr k stuff okay


---------07:04----------
so so it sounds to me like you're alexa


---------07:06----------
thymic


---------07:07----------
have you heard us talk okay


---------07:10----------
so what's your understanding of how we


---------07:12----------
approach alexa thymia


---------07:15----------
i don't know how you approach it but i


---------07:18----------
know what it is


---------07:20----------
you you do know what it is yes


---------07:23----------
and what what's your understanding of


---------07:26----------
what alexa thyme is


---------07:28----------
you can't really explain how you feel


---------07:31----------
i guess yep yeah so i i would describe


---------07:34----------
alexa thymia


---------07:35----------
is like being unable to


---------07:38----------
feel like understand or feel


---------07:41----------
emotions so it's like you can't describe


---------07:45----------
how you feel it's sort of like you're


---------07:47----------
colorblind to emotions


---------07:49----------
and so lexithymia like do you play a lot


---------07:52----------
of video games robin


---------07:54----------
yeah for sure how how many hours a day


---------07:57----------
would you say you play


---------07:59----------
well maybe five okay


---------08:03----------
and how do you spend the rest of your


---------08:04----------
day


---------08:06----------
uh youtube twitch


---------08:09----------
dr k wasting time you know


---------08:13----------
yeah so i think this is the kind of


---------08:14----------
thing where like you literally like if


---------08:16----------
you play games and are like consuming


---------08:18----------
youtube


---------08:19----------
you know for most of your day those


---------08:24----------
those things are going to suppress your


---------08:27----------
emotional circuitry


---------08:28----------
in your brain so there are these things


---------08:32----------
called


---------08:32----------
fmri studies so f stands for functional


---------08:35----------
magnetic resonance imaging which is a


---------08:38----------
study that looks at blood flow


---------08:40----------
to the brain and what we discover from


---------08:42----------
fmri studies


---------08:44----------
is that when you play video games and do


---------08:45----------
this kind of mindless stuff like watch


---------08:47----------
youtube and things like that


---------08:49----------
what they do is they actually reduce the


---------08:52----------
blood flow to the parts of your brain


---------08:54----------
that experience emotion


---------08:56----------
and so you're kind of like you get you


---------08:57----------
activate this like dopamine circuitry


---------08:59----------
and shut down your emotional circuitry


---------09:01----------
which is why games feel so good and that


---------09:04----------
we use them as a coping mechanism


---------09:06----------
anything that we use as a coping


---------09:07----------
mechanism reduces


---------09:09----------
our negative like our ability to


---------09:13----------
experience


---------09:14----------
negative emotions so like earlier today


---------09:16----------
i had something stressful happen


---------09:18----------
and like i pulled up valheim for like 15


---------09:20----------
or 20 minutes


---------09:22----------
and it made me feel better because like


---------09:25----------
you kind of forget and then like all


---------09:27----------
those negative emotions like


---------09:28----------
go away for a little bit and so i think


---------09:31----------
this is where we've got to really


---------09:32----------
approach this


---------09:33----------
kind of in a from a couple of different


---------09:35----------
angles one is that


---------09:36----------
as long as you're basically like playing


---------09:39----------
games at this


---------09:40----------
rate it's going to be difficult for you


---------09:42----------
to feel emotions because you're going to


---------09:43----------
be shutting off


---------09:45----------
you're going to be reducing blood flow


---------09:46----------
to the part of your brain that like can


---------09:48----------
experience emotion


---------09:50----------
and and so you know this is where we've


---------09:53----------
got to think a little bit about how you


---------09:55----------
can do


---------09:55----------
other stuff so the next thing is that


---------09:58----------
that any questions about that i mean i


---------10:02----------
that's kind of complicated but i was


---------10:04----------
going to lay out two or three other


---------10:05----------
things


---------10:06----------
i wanted to add that like


---------10:09----------
i think i also use like


---------10:12----------
orgasm to do the same thing yep yeah so


---------10:16----------
people do that right so


---------10:17----------
if you look if you look at people like


---------10:19----------
we have we've had a couple of porn


---------10:20----------
addiction streams


---------10:22----------
which you should check out on on youtube


---------10:24----------
but like so


---------10:25----------
so orgasm and like pornography and


---------10:27----------
things like that are also other ways to


---------10:29----------
like


---------10:30----------
suppress emotions yeah


---------10:33----------
and so you know robin you've got a


---------10:36----------
couple of other options going forward


---------10:38----------
the first


---------10:38----------
is that if you want to get in touch with


---------10:41----------
your emotions


---------10:42----------
like you have to cut back on some of


---------10:43----------
these things if you can't cut back on


---------10:45----------
those


---------10:45----------
that's okay there are other things you


---------10:47----------
can do so the next is that like


---------10:49----------
you can intentionally activate that


---------10:53----------
emotional circuitry


---------10:54----------
so this is what things like therapy or


---------10:57----------
we do this in coaching too


---------10:58----------
where like our coaches work a lot with


---------11:00----------
people with a lexithymia because like


---------11:03----------
your coaches will and what they're gonna


---------11:04----------
tell you is that like you can


---------11:06----------
access your emotions through your body


---------11:09----------
too


---------11:09----------
so especially for men who are lexa


---------11:11----------
thymic


---------11:12----------
i would say that even if you can't feel


---------11:14----------
the emotion


---------11:16----------
you may feel stuff like in your body


---------11:18----------
like does that make sense to you


---------11:20----------
yes yes what do you feel in your body


---------11:25----------
right now like


---------11:28----------
that could be an emotion um


---------11:34----------
i have to think right


---------11:39----------
let me ask you this what do you feel in


---------11:40----------
your body when you go to bed at night


---------11:44----------
um warmth


---------11:49----------
what warm warmth


---------11:52----------
okay do you feel safe


---------11:56----------
yes relaxed okay so you do feel relaxed


---------11:59----------
like


---------12:00----------
how do you feel when you wake up in the


---------12:01----------
morning


---------12:03----------
tired


---------12:08----------
i don't know i can't really put myself


---------12:10----------
okay so so this is where like you know


---------12:12----------
when you feel the edge of an emotion


---------12:15----------
because you say you feel the edge of


---------12:16----------
them right when you feel that edge of


---------12:18----------
emotion


---------12:20----------
do you notice that you feel particular


---------12:22----------
things in your body at the same time


---------12:26----------
i don't really notice it okay so that's


---------12:29----------
something that you've got to pay


---------12:30----------
attention to so like the next time that


---------12:32----------
you feel at the edge of an emotion


---------12:35----------
i want you to pay attention to your body


---------12:37----------
and see if something is different in


---------12:39----------
your body


---------12:40----------
you may feel something like in your


---------12:42----------
stomach


---------12:43----------
you may feel something in your throat


---------12:45----------
you may feel something in your chest


---------12:47----------
you may feel like tension in your back


---------12:49----------
and that's gonna be


---------12:50----------
your like avenue into the emotion


---------12:54----------
yeah um that's something you can kind of


---------12:58----------
do


---------12:59----------
on your own but this is also something


---------13:00----------
that like if you work


---------13:02----------
you know with a trained professional it


---------13:03----------
can help so i think


---------13:06----------
this second thing a couple of other


---------13:09----------
things about alexa thymia is that like


---------13:11----------
you know when you do like coaching and


---------13:12----------
therapy like what's gonna happen is that


---------13:14----------
they're gonna be asking questions that


---------13:16----------
are gonna be bringing the emotion


---------13:19----------
up and so like during those times like


---------13:22----------
the blood flow to your emotional centers


---------13:24----------
of the brain is gonna be higher


---------13:25----------
and as you wake those parts up as you


---------13:28----------
learn how to feel those emotions


---------13:30----------
then it's gonna be like you're gonna


---------13:33----------
start to get the whole


---------13:34----------
range of them and so like i sort of


---------13:37----------
experienced this when i had kids because


---------13:39----------
my emotional circuitry like got more


---------13:41----------
active


---------13:42----------
and so then what happened is i started


---------13:43----------
like crying and stuff like all the time


---------13:45----------
like i didn't used to cry but now i like


---------13:47----------
cry all the time on stream


---------13:48----------
and so what i found is that i could feel


---------13:50----------
love more intensely


---------13:52----------
and i could also feel like sadness more


---------13:54----------
intensely and i'm not recommending that


---------13:55----------
you go out and have a child to fix this


---------13:57----------
problem but


---------13:58----------
you know like my point is that


---------14:00----------
essentially like if we look at our alexa


---------14:01----------
thymia


---------14:02----------
what happens is if we turn up the volume


---------14:05----------
on


---------14:05----------
our emotions we turn up the volume on


---------14:08----------
all of our emotions


---------14:11----------
and so then the next question is what


---------14:13----------
are the emotions that you're trying to


---------14:15----------
avoid


---------14:17----------
yeah what do you think


---------14:22----------
um loneliness but that's not emotion but


---------14:26----------
sure it is it is


---------14:29----------
sure


---------14:33----------
well that i guess right so like this is


---------14:35----------
where so now with what's happening


---------14:37----------
robin is that you're feeling lonely


---------14:40----------
and then you do certain things to push


---------14:43----------
the loneliness away


---------14:45----------
yeah yeah i know right and so as long as


---------14:48----------
that


---------14:49----------
cycle is going on you're not going to


---------14:50----------
feel much


---------14:52----------
because you're actually trying to not


---------14:54----------
feel


---------14:56----------
yeah but i'm kind of like addicted


---------14:59----------
so i can't stop you're damn right you're


---------15:01----------
addicted


---------15:02----------
so how do you get unaddicted right so


---------15:05----------
that's where like you've got to start by


---------15:07----------
facing that loneliness because as long


---------15:10----------
as long as you're afraid as long as the


---------15:12----------
loneliness controls you


---------15:14----------
and as long as you can't feel lonely


---------15:17----------
you're gonna be


---------15:18----------
addicted to this stuff and the more that


---------15:21----------
because because think about this why are


---------15:22----------
you addicted to it it's because you


---------15:24----------
can't


---------15:25----------
sit with being lonely


---------15:28----------
like it hurts so much to be lonely


---------15:30----------
you're like i can't feel that


---------15:32----------
i'm not gonna do it


---------15:35----------
and as long as you can't sit with the


---------15:37----------
loneliness then


---------15:38----------
you're gonna keep doing the thing


---------15:39----------
because that's your that's the way that


---------15:41----------
you


---------15:42----------
make the loneliness go away so of course


---------15:44----------
you're addicted


---------15:46----------
whether it's orgasms masturbation video


---------15:48----------
games netflix youtube whatever


---------15:50----------
it's all to run away from the loneliness


---------15:52----------
and if you want all of that stuff to


---------15:54----------
come crashing down


---------15:55----------
you have to sit with the loneliness


---------15:57----------
learn to be with the loneliness


---------15:59----------
if you can do that then you don't need


---------16:01----------
to play video games five hours a day


---------16:06----------
i also want to add like i will i'm


---------16:09----------
trying to become like a pro player


---------16:11----------
so it's hard to stop


---------16:14----------
gaming because of that also


---------16:17----------
okay i mean i i think that if you want


---------16:20----------
to be a successful


---------16:22----------
pro player you're going to have to deal


---------16:24----------
with the loneliness


---------16:27----------
how do i deal with the loneliness go see


---------16:30----------
a therapist


---------16:31----------
or you could do coaching too but i'd


---------16:33----------
really recommend therapy and


---------16:36----------
a clinical evaluation i can't really i


---------16:39----------
can't really afford


---------16:41----------
therapy


---------16:44----------
okay that's a tricky thing what country


---------16:47----------
are you in


---------16:48----------
sweden i thought it was free for you


---------16:51----------
guys


---------16:53----------
it is i think so i think until you're


---------16:57----------
20 it is


---------17:04----------
i would definitely check into that


---------17:08----------
you think it's not true or


---------17:16----------
what do you mean trick interest i i


---------17:18----------
would i would investigate


---------17:20----------
whether you actually have to pay for it


---------17:22----------
or if there's some way you can get it


---------17:23----------
for free


---------17:25----------
all right i would and and there are


---------17:28----------
usually like


---------17:30----------
even people who will in any country oh i


---------17:32----------
don't know about any country


---------17:33----------
but generally speaking in north america


---------17:36----------
and in europe


---------17:37----------
there are organizations that will offer


---------17:40----------
therapy for free


---------17:42----------
so you just have to find one of those


---------17:44----------
organizations i'm not


---------17:46----------
too sure but i think that there are


---------17:50----------
like organizations you can check out


---------17:51----------
rise above the disorder


---------17:53----------
which is a good organization i think


---------17:55----------
it's based in the united states i don't


---------17:56----------
know if they do things in europe but


---------17:58----------
i thought i thought sweden had


---------17:59----------
socialized medicine


---------18:02----------
i mean maybe they do i'm not i'm not


---------18:06----------
saying i'm just saying what i think


---------18:10----------
yeah so i would investigate that


---------18:13----------
because i i think the problem that


---------18:15----------
you're gonna face in the swedish


---------18:16----------
healthcare system


---------18:17----------
is that you're gonna have to wait a long


---------18:19----------
time to find a therapist


---------18:22----------
but it i think it should be free for you


---------18:26----------
also i think you have mentioned like


---------18:29----------
when you meditate and you get like a no


---------18:31----------
mind state that's when the emotional


---------18:34----------
emotions are like come up because you're


---------18:37----------
not suppressing them anymore


---------18:39----------
but i haven't really been successful


---------18:43----------
in getting there okay


---------18:46----------
so that's that's perfectly fine so i


---------18:49----------
would continue


---------18:49----------
practicing meditation and this is where


---------18:52----------
you may be able to find like a local


---------18:54----------
group


---------18:54----------
that you can join to like you know help


---------18:57----------
you meditate on a regular basis


---------19:00----------
and and you know if you haven't entered


---------19:03----------
if you haven't entered a no mind state


---------19:04----------
that's totally fine
