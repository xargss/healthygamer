really like about our community is like


---------00:16----------
a lot of people like the boomer


---------00:17----------
generation thinks that we're lazy or


---------00:18----------
undisciplined or whatever but


---------00:20----------
in my experience actually when you when


---------00:22----------
you really give


---------00:24----------
um you know a gamer or someone from


---------00:26----------
twitch or like a millennial or gen z or


---------00:28----------
like when you actually


---------00:30----------
give them a game that's not rigged


---------00:31----------
against them and you like say like hey


---------00:33----------
man time to like play this game


---------00:35----------
um you guys knock it out of the park and


---------00:38----------
it's just


---------00:39----------
equipping you to help you do what you


---------00:41----------
were on this earth to do


---------00:43----------
which is to knock it out of the park


---------00:45----------
that's what coaching is


---------00:46----------
so on september 4th we're going to have


---------00:48----------
a lot of spots opening up


---------00:50----------

---------00:57----------
a guy who's spent eight thousand dollars


---------00:59----------
on dating coaching


---------01:01----------
and so i don't know what's up with this


---------01:04----------
um so we're gonna try to find out


---------01:06----------
so we're gonna hop in with atomic


---------01:09----------
welcome buddy and and what am i what am


---------01:12----------
i calling you


---------01:13----------
friend i'm alex


---------01:16----------
alex okay um yeah so i was just gonna


---------01:19----------
tell can you tell us a little bit about


---------01:20----------
uh you know i know there's sort of a


---------01:22----------
click-baity title which is that you


---------01:23----------
spent eight grand on dating coaching


---------01:26----------
and so um is there something in


---------01:28----------
particular that you want to talk about


---------01:30----------
today alex


---------01:34----------
um yes um i guess probably a good


---------01:37----------
direction would be like in line of like


---------01:40----------
i can say like what would be like a


---------01:41----------
better way for me to learn how to like


---------01:43----------
get better at like


---------01:44----------
uh connecting with people or i was like


---------01:46----------
what's kind of like blocking me in


---------01:48----------
particular


---------01:49----------
like when i say a thousand grand dating


---------01:51----------
coaching like a lot of people might


---------01:53----------
think it's not like one big company was


---------01:54----------
actually on


---------01:56----------
i spent eight thousand dollars on seven


---------01:59----------
uh personal dating coaches so i had uh


---------02:02----------
seven different dating coaches like


---------02:04----------
basically how it was ran they were like


---------02:06----------
um


---------02:07----------
they're like weekly uh skype training


---------02:10----------
like if you wanted me to go more into


---------02:13----------
detail into that


---------02:14----------
like there's definitely a huge variety


---------02:16----------
of like i kind of like how i did things


---------02:19----------
sure i mean but the but the issue here


---------02:23----------
is that like despite like


---------02:28----------
you know having like seven different uh


---------02:30----------
dating coaches i


---------02:32----------
still pretty much got rejected by


---------02:34----------
literally every single girl ever


---------02:35----------
approached


---------02:36----------
it's like they um never even like gave


---------02:39----------
me a chance pretty much


---------02:41----------
okay like and i was actually like um


---------02:44----------
like pretty clear on what my intentions


---------02:46----------
were like when i define approach like i


---------02:48----------
would um


---------02:50----------
i go up to them in person like um the


---------02:52----------
places where i would approach would be


---------02:54----------
like uh on campus for example i would


---------02:56----------
approach in


---------02:58----------
uh stores uh sometimes in bars but


---------03:02----------
right now i'm 20 years old so i'm under


---------03:04----------
21 so


---------03:05----------
it kind of it cost me extra money to get


---------03:08----------
inside of bars


---------03:10----------
but yeah so basically like like on the


---------03:12----------
streets like on campus


---------03:13----------
in stores and


---------03:17----------
okay yeah like i'm i'm struck by the


---------03:19----------
word approach


---------03:22----------
like it's like you're going in for a


---------03:25----------
bombing run


---------03:26----------
you know we're we're like on the


---------03:27----------
approach


---------03:29----------
does that it sounds kind of like oh yeah


---------03:33----------
another name for it is like sargeant


---------03:36----------
another name for it is what


---------03:38----------
a sergeant what does that mean


---------03:45----------
i might be wrong but it might be like a


---------03:47----------
like a military term


---------03:49----------
or something like you're approaching


---------03:50----------
women i'm not that aggressive with


---------03:53----------
um yeah i mean okay


---------03:57----------
so so a couple of things atomic so so


---------04:00----------
alex thank


---------04:01----------
thank you so much actually for coming on


---------04:02----------
stream today and sharing some of these


---------04:04----------
thoughts


---------04:05----------
um twitch hat feels and i wouldn't


---------04:06----------
recommend reading to a chat but twitch


---------04:08----------
chat feels like this is way too real


---------04:09----------
so i think it's something that a lot of


---------04:11----------
our you know a lot of


---------04:13----------
people on twitch struggle with so thank


---------04:14----------
you very much for sharing your


---------04:16----------
perspective


---------04:17----------
um and all offering yourself up on the


---------04:20----------
altar of sacrifice


---------04:22----------
for the the knowledge growth and


---------04:24----------
entertainment and lulls


---------04:26----------
of twitch um yeah so can you tell me a


---------04:30----------
little bit about


---------04:31----------
you know how you decided to get a dating


---------04:34----------
coach or


---------04:35----------
or kind of how does that happen


---------04:40----------
okay so basically like what made me get


---------04:42----------
a dating coach yeah so basically


---------04:45----------
the first time i uh uh


---------04:48----------
my first dating coach was like in my


---------04:50----------
senior year in high school like


---------04:53----------
like basically i was like you know


---------04:55----------
extremely lonely like


---------04:58----------
i also just like struggled with


---------04:59----------
socializing in general and i was like


---------05:02----------
even before that also like i watched a


---------05:04----------
bunch of video programs as well


---------05:07----------
i like talking to them and i was like


---------05:09----------
video programs about what


---------05:13----------
like um basically like pua but there's


---------05:16----------
also like


---------05:16----------
this weird nlp stuff where you're like


---------05:18----------
using language patterns


---------05:20----------
to like attract women what is


---------05:24----------
p-u-a and nlp uh so p-o-a


---------05:28----------
is basically like pick-up artists okay


---------05:30----------
and nlp


---------05:31----------
stands for neuro-linguistic uh


---------05:33----------
programming


---------05:35----------
so it's kind of like it's it's very


---------05:37----------
related to hypnosis but you're like


---------05:39----------
implementing it into like your language


---------05:41----------
to


---------05:43----------
um i guess hypnotize women but that's i


---------05:46----------
guess like more the


---------05:46----------
creepier side of uh sure


---------05:50----------
doing things yeah so i mean i understand


---------05:53----------
that it comes across as creepy alex but


---------05:55----------
i i like that you're


---------05:56----------
sort of representing it i think the way


---------05:58----------
that it's advertised right


---------06:00----------
that's sort of what they that's what


---------06:03----------
they set out


---------06:03----------
to do um and so you said that you'd


---------06:07----------
watched a bunch of videos so even before


---------06:08----------
we get to the dating coach when did you


---------06:10----------
start getting videos or start getting


---------06:12----------
interested in this stuff


---------06:17----------
i mean i'd say uh like my motivation was


---------06:20----------
just like


---------06:22----------
i completely like uh dissatisfied like


---------06:26----------
where i am right now


---------06:28----------
and when did you start to become


---------06:32----------
dissatisfied


---------06:35----------
and i guess with uh women with women in


---------06:38----------
general it was um


---------06:40----------
i think it started like just as early as


---------06:43----------
my freshman year in high school


---------06:45----------
okay and how old were you then


---------06:49----------
like when i was a freshman in high


---------06:50----------
school yeah maybe like


---------06:54----------
13 or something okay


---------06:57----------
so you were 13 years old and can you


---------06:59----------
tell me what


---------07:00----------
feeling dissatisfied felt like


---------07:07----------
uh i meant china i mean i was definitely


---------07:11----------
like um


---------07:13----------
like pretty lonely i mean i also kind of


---------07:15----------
felt like


---------07:17----------
like alienated because i felt like um


---------07:19----------
like i was being


---------07:23----------
like i didn't think of myself as like a


---------07:25----------
weird person but


---------07:26----------
even like let's say if it was just like


---------07:28----------
a normal group setting


---------07:30----------
like people ask me like um hey alex are


---------07:32----------
you doing like


---------07:33----------
now like say stuff and then like okay


---------07:35----------
they just


---------07:40----------
they would what


---------07:45----------
i mean it's like everyone else like


---------07:48----------
talks to each other very normally but


---------07:50----------
when people


---------07:51----------
talk to me it's just like normal like


---------07:53----------
how high is how was your day and like


---------07:55----------
yeah it's very good and


---------07:57----------
i kind of like have trouble with like


---------07:59----------
going beyond


---------08:00----------
like small talk sure so i guess i felt


---------08:04----------
inadequate


---------08:05----------
uh like with my ability to socialize


---------08:09----------
sure it was a great part of it yeah so


---------08:12----------
so you know you speaking of


---------08:14----------
neuro-linguistic programming


---------08:17----------
so you know let's how are you feeling


---------08:19----------
right now by the way alex


---------08:22----------
um i feel fine okay so you know it's


---------08:25----------
interesting because you kind of talked


---------08:26----------
about being in a normal group


---------08:28----------
and you also use the word like feeling


---------08:31----------
pretty


---------08:32----------
lonely and alienated so i'm wondering if


---------08:35----------
you sort of felt like an


---------08:37----------
outsider among normal people yeah


---------08:41----------
right very much and and everyone else is


---------08:43----------
sort of like doing this thing and it


---------08:45----------
sort of seems so like effortless they're


---------08:46----------
just like talking to each other


---------08:49----------
and and you don't it seems to me like


---------08:52----------
you felt like you were


---------08:53----------
inadequate at sort of being able to


---------08:55----------
engage with like other human beings on


---------08:57----------
kind of like


---------08:58----------
an authentic level


---------09:03----------
yeah pretty much and so what


---------09:06----------
that sounds


---------09:12----------
how did you understand that how did you


---------09:14----------
think about that like what did you


---------09:15----------
like because when we were faced with a


---------09:17----------
situation right like our mind tries to


---------09:19----------
make sense of it


---------09:20----------
how did you make sense of that


---------09:27----------
um


---------09:31----------
and then like and i kind of like felt


---------09:35----------
like there was like nothing in


---------09:36----------
particular


---------09:37----------
that seemed like like there was anything


---------09:39----------
wrong with me except that


---------09:42----------
like i just really like sucked at


---------09:44----------
connection with people how to socialize


---------09:46----------
like


---------09:47----------
like it felt like there was like some


---------09:49----------
thing that i'm like unaware of


---------09:53----------
and um


---------09:56----------
i've also i've always also been like


---------09:58----------
like treated very mainly


---------10:00----------
like um ever since i was a kid as well


---------10:05----------
so i'm kind of curious about that but


---------10:08----------
let me see if i


---------10:08----------
kind of understand you here so i'm kind


---------10:11----------
of trying to put myself in your shoes


---------10:13----------
and and maybe i was to a certain degree


---------10:15----------
at some point in my life and i i can


---------10:17----------
imagine that maybe you felt like


---------10:19----------
you couldn't see anything wrong with you


---------10:21----------
and it didn't feel like there was


---------10:22----------
anything wrong with you but


---------10:24----------
when you looked from the outside like


---------10:27----------
clearly there's something


---------10:28----------
like wrong with you you just don't know


---------10:30----------
what it is


---------10:31----------
like you can't see it you can't feel it


---------10:33----------
but when you look at the results of your


---------10:35----------
interactions


---------10:36----------
something's not adding up


---------10:39----------
um yeah that sounds exactly


---------10:42----------
right and and so that's got to be kind


---------10:44----------
of confusing because


---------10:48----------
you know you have evidence that


---------10:49----------
something's wrong but you have no


---------10:51----------
vision you can't detect what's wrong


---------10:58----------
um yeah and and what happens


---------11:01----------
in your mind when when you kind of come


---------11:03----------
to that conclusion


---------11:10----------
it's a hard question by the way because


---------11:12----------
i'm asking you to boil down a lot of i


---------11:13----------
think what has taken


---------11:15----------
years to kind of understand how do you


---------11:17----------
see yourself what's the conclusion that


---------11:18----------
you come to


---------11:22----------
oh so basically like what's my opinion


---------11:24----------
like on myself


---------11:26----------
sure


---------11:31----------
i mean i guess like if we're talking


---------11:34----------
about like


---------11:35----------
um yeah like when i was a freshman like


---------11:38----------
yeah i definitely uh


---------11:40----------
i used to like hate myself a lot i guess


---------11:42----------
like nowadays um


---------11:44----------
i'm to be honest i don't really like


---------11:47----------
kind of like have a relationship with


---------11:48----------
myself anymore although if i do look in


---------11:50----------
the mirror


---------11:51----------
like i'll have this reaction where i


---------11:52----------
kind of like just cringe so


---------11:55----------
on a very uh subconscious level i do


---------11:57----------
think


---------11:58----------
like i'm kind of like cringy and what is


---------12:00----------
cringy like


---------12:02----------
yeah basically it's like socially like


---------12:08----------
like inadequate okay


---------12:11----------
do you feel inadequate


---------12:17----------
um yeah i'd say yeah okay


---------12:21----------
that's some powerful stuff you just


---------12:22----------
shared man


---------12:25----------
um to hate yourself as a freshman to


---------12:28----------
look in the mirror and like at yourself


---------12:30----------
cringing


---------12:30----------
because i almost get the sense that you


---------12:32----------
catch yourself it's not something that


---------12:33----------
you actively do


---------12:35----------
but it's just like right yeah


---------12:39----------
yeah literally like a subconscious


---------12:41----------
reaction


---------12:42----------
yeah so some i may use the word visceral


---------12:47----------
there


---------12:48----------
so it's like because it sounds like


---------12:50----------
you're aware of it on some level right


---------12:51----------
it's like something inside you is like


---------12:53----------
oh like look at that [ __ ]


---------12:55----------
and then it kind of and then you like


---------12:58----------
your it sounds like you learned how to


---------12:59----------
push that way


---------13:01----------
and not let that be active


---------13:04----------
does that make sense um yeah that


---------13:08----------
definitely uh makes sense because if i


---------13:11----------
let me just try to put together what i


---------13:12----------
heard so you used to hate yourself


---------13:16----------
and now you said that you don't have a


---------13:18----------
relationship with yourself


---------13:21----------
and so but at this at the same time


---------13:23----------
sometimes you


---------13:24----------
catch those feelings of hate when you


---------13:26----------
look at yourself in the mirror


---------13:28----------
so that really feels to me like


---------13:30----------
suppression does that make sense


---------13:33----------
that it used to be conscious oh yeah


---------13:35----------
that makes sense and now it's become


---------13:37----------
subconscious but it's still there


---------13:39----------
and sometimes it pokes its head out


---------13:43----------
yeah totally yeah so what did you hate


---------13:46----------
yourself for as a freshman


---------13:53----------
yeah i think it was um definitely


---------13:56----------
because i


---------13:57----------
you know struggled with um things like


---------13:59----------
making friends and uh


---------14:01----------
it's like socialize in general


---------14:06----------
and like i felt like that was like the


---------14:07----------
one the one part of my life that i was


---------14:09----------
like very bad at


---------14:10----------
like i remember like when i was a kid


---------14:12----------
like my person was telling me i used to


---------14:14----------
be like extremely shy


---------14:16----------
but nowadays that actually doesn't apply


---------14:18----------
to me at all like i can


---------14:21----------
like go up to and approach women very


---------14:22----------
easily like even out in public


---------14:24----------
approach and like you know state my yeah


---------14:27----------
yeah and also i state my premise


---------14:30----------
and um what does that mean


---------14:34----------
so um in the pickup artists uh community


---------14:39----------
it's basically like letting her know


---------14:40----------
like what the whole conversation is like


---------14:42----------
all about like state your premise


---------14:45----------
like an example could be like


---------14:49----------
like if you're using a direct opener for


---------14:51----------
example you could be like


---------14:53----------
like while i thought you were very


---------14:54----------
beautiful wanted to come and talk to you


---------14:56----------
at that point she may realize that


---------14:58----------
you're trying to like seduce her but


---------14:59----------
also it could be like


---------15:01----------
like me asking her out or or i guess


---------15:04----------
like kind of


---------15:05----------
like trying to like pull her from like


---------15:06----------
the certain venue like


---------15:08----------
if she says like she wants to go to like


---------15:09----------
a free bird's brito place and i'm like


---------15:11----------
at the targets i'd be like oh i mean can


---------15:13----------
i come with your friends


---------15:16----------
or yeah basically like asking her the


---------15:18----------
one i did the most was just like


---------15:20----------
asking her for a number like to go on on


---------15:22----------
a date with her


---------15:25----------
okay and how does that work


---------15:30----------
what do you mean i mean does how does


---------15:32----------
that work out for you


---------15:36----------
yeah i mean basically um


---------15:40----------
the longest i have ever


---------15:44----------
i mean the okay yeah the farthest i've


---------15:46----------
ever been to


---------15:47----------
and with getting a woman was basically


---------15:49----------
she gave me her number and then she


---------15:51----------
literally like


---------15:51----------
goes with me so like i haven't really


---------15:54----------
even done like a


---------15:55----------
date before okay how does it feel to say


---------15:59----------
that


---------16:04----------
i guess i'm not sure like


---------16:09----------
believing i guess


---------16:12----------
what's relieving about it


---------16:22----------
and i kind of like


---------16:28----------
i'm not sure yeah so i'm asking you hard


---------16:32----------
questions alex you're doing a fantastic


---------16:33----------
job


---------16:35----------
and i think we're talking hard questions


---------16:37----------
yeah dude the simplest ones are usually


---------16:40----------
the hardest


---------16:41----------
the ones that have to do with


---------16:42----------
understanding ourselves it's really easy


---------16:44----------
to understand women right like the


---------16:45----------
pua folks have them all figured out far


---------16:48----------
harder to understand yourself


---------16:51----------
um i i didn't mean that as a dig


---------16:55----------
i hope you didn't take it that way but


---------16:57----------
it occurred to me that that came across


---------16:58----------
as a little bit condescending


---------17:01----------
did it feel that way to you


---------17:04----------
uh not really okay so you know it's


---------17:07----------
interesting


---------17:08----------
alex because i i can imagine saying i've


---------17:10----------
never really been on a date with someone


---------17:12----------
if you're you know live streaming on the


---------17:14----------
internet in front of thousands of people


---------17:16----------
what i would expect is that you would


---------17:19----------
feel shame


---------17:22----------
did you feel shame


---------17:25----------
honestly not at all yeah so there's


---------17:28----------
something really cool


---------17:29----------
with that right like that like there's


---------17:31----------
something very special and i think


---------17:33----------
something really important


---------17:35----------
about because if you ask i'm sure if you


---------17:38----------
ask people hey


---------17:39----------
what would you guys say about like going


---------17:41----------
on the internet


---------17:43----------
and live streaming your your you know


---------17:45----------
that you've never been on a date


---------17:47----------
and you feel relief and i think that's


---------17:50----------
something that's really really important


---------17:52----------
powerful and worth understanding


---------17:54----------
although i don't know we're gonna quite


---------17:55----------
get to it right the second


---------17:57----------
do you have any idea why you would feel


---------17:59----------
relief instead of shame


---------18:01----------
if not we can cover it at the end i'm


---------18:03----------
just kind of curious it's a hard


---------18:04----------
question


---------18:08----------
i mean i


---------18:12----------
i mean for one i guess i don't really um


---------18:15----------
feel shameful about you know wanting to


---------18:17----------
get better with women


---------18:19----------
good for you like i know like a lot of


---------18:21----------
people think that makes you a creep and


---------18:25----------
a lot of people you know call me a creep


---------18:27----------
butts


---------18:30----------
i know that i'm not really you know i'm


---------18:32----------
not doing anything


---------18:34----------
that's bad like i'm not like i'm not


---------18:37----------
harassing anyone like


---------18:40----------
like


---------18:44----------
so yeah okay


---------18:47----------
man alex sorry if i'm bouncing around a


---------18:49----------
little bit but there's like a lot of


---------18:50----------
what you're saying that i think has


---------18:51----------
immense value and there's a lot to


---------18:54----------
understand


---------18:55----------
um is it if is it okay if we kind of go


---------18:58----------
back to like


---------18:59----------
earlier and then sort of maybe do a


---------19:00----------
little bit of a timeline


---------19:02----------
so you said that you used to hate so you


---------19:05----------
used to hate yourself as a freshman


---------19:07----------
and and that was because you had trouble


---------19:09----------
talking to people


---------19:14----------
yeah i definitely what did you hate


---------19:16----------
about yourself


---------19:24----------
what did you hate about yourself i mean


---------19:28----------
oh yeah i heard the question i was just


---------19:29----------
like okay kind of thinking yeah


---------19:33----------
and i guess because like


---------19:36----------
i just it's like very socially awkward


---------19:40----------
pretty much okay


---------19:43----------
okay so that's so and then you said


---------19:45----------
earlier that you were treated meanly


---------19:48----------
can you tell us about that


---------19:52----------
i treated badly um yeah i definitely um


---------19:56----------
i was um when i went to like this


---------19:59----------
other school in elementary yeah i


---------20:01----------
basically


---------20:03----------
i used to live in a different state from


---------20:05----------
like you know uh


---------20:06----------
k through eighth grade then i i moved to


---------20:09----------
another states


---------20:10----------
you know you know for high school yeah


---------20:13----------
basically


---------20:15----------
yeah they keep the kids would like treat


---------20:16----------
me like very bad like


---------20:19----------
like especially like during a recess


---------20:22----------
like i was always


---------20:25----------
i guess like like all by myself


---------20:28----------
and other guys were like you know


---------20:30----------
playing basketball and


---------20:33----------
you know uh playing flag football and i


---------20:35----------
was like the only one like


---------20:36----------
not joining in


---------20:40----------
and what what can i mean it's not just


---------20:42----------
that but i mean they're also like


---------20:44----------
you know call me names and stuff what


---------20:46----------
would they call you


---------20:52----------
yeah i don't really want to talk about


---------20:53----------
that to be honest but okay


---------20:55----------
thanks for letting me know can i ask you


---------20:58----------
um i'm not going to ask you any more


---------21:01----------
questions about that


---------21:02----------
sort of but what i would like to


---------21:04----------
understand


---------21:05----------
is what makes you uncomfortable talking


---------21:08----------
about it is it okay if i ask that


---------21:13----------
um i mean i suppose


---------21:16----------
you're also allowed to say no


---------21:22----------
i want to respect your space man but i


---------21:23----------
think it's important


---------21:25----------
and if you want me to i'm happy to


---------21:27----------
explain why i think it's important


---------21:35----------
i mean it's kind of hard for like me to


---------21:37----------
describe like why it feels uncomfortable


---------21:39----------
like about talking talking about it yeah


---------21:43----------
can i tell you why i think you feel


---------21:44----------
uncomfortable


---------21:47----------
um yeah please so you know how early we


---------21:50----------
were talking about


---------21:52----------
how do you protect yourself alex from


---------21:56----------
the hate that you feel towards yourself


---------22:02----------
so how do i protect myself from like the


---------22:05----------
hate i feel for myself


---------22:12----------
what do you do you used to hate yourself


---------22:15----------
you don't


---------22:15----------
have a relationship with yourself


---------22:17----------
anymore right how do you protect


---------22:19----------
yourself from that


---------22:23----------
you push it away yeah yeah right so


---------22:27----------
this oppression you talked about perfect


---------22:30----------
so now i think the reason


---------22:34----------
that you're uncomfortable is because i'm


---------22:38----------
asking you to not suppress


---------22:42----------
i'm asking you to do the very opposite i


---------22:45----------
don't think any of this [ __ ] has


---------22:46----------
anything to do with women


---------22:49----------
so if we think about this so you ready


---------22:52----------
for the answer


---------22:53----------
i know we're only like 20 minutes in but


---------22:56----------
i've got an answer for you


---------22:58----------
do you want i mean it could be wrong so


---------22:59----------
more likely to be wrong because i'm


---------23:01----------
making a big judgment right


---------23:03----------
so i have a hypothesis so it's not an


---------23:06----------
answer that's actually arrogant


---------23:08----------
i have a hypothesis and i'm going to run


---------23:10----------
it by you and then i want to know what


---------23:11----------
you think and then if you're okay with


---------23:13----------
it we can explore it


---------23:14----------
i know everyone here is is being


---------23:17----------
voyeuristic because they want to hear


---------23:19----------
about this noob who spent eight thousand


---------23:20----------
dollars on dating coach et cetera et


---------23:22----------
cetera


---------23:22----------
we're not going to give them what


---------23:23----------
they're looking for we're actually going


---------23:24----------
to try to help you and help them instead


---------23:28----------
and get to the pickup artist stuff later


---------23:29----------
awesome so i want you to just


---------23:32----------
i have one question for you how do we


---------23:35----------
learn how to see ourselves


---------23:41----------
like you see yourself a particular way i


---------23:43----------
see myself a particular way


---------23:45----------
how did i learn how to see myself


---------23:51----------
i mean i suppose a lot of it can come


---------23:54----------
from like


---------23:55----------
your environments like yeah and you're


---------23:58----------
like


---------23:58----------
the stuff that like happens to you yep


---------24:01----------
right so so what were you taught


---------24:04----------
about yourself from k to eight


---------24:11----------
yeah basically like a bunch of negative


---------24:14----------
stuff like that


---------24:15----------
yep just like wouldn't fit in yep and so


---------24:19----------
how did you feel


---------24:20----------
at 13 you went to a new high school but


---------24:23----------
what did you know about yourself before


---------24:24----------
you even stepped into the door


---------24:26----------
what did you know about yourself alex is


---------24:29----------
a guy who doesn't


---------24:34----------
yeah i basically carried over the same


---------24:37----------
stuff yeah alex is a guy who


---------24:39----------
you know like isn't normal absolutely


---------24:43----------
and then you open yourself up to a


---------24:45----------
really dangerous thing


---------24:47----------
which is something called a confirmation


---------24:49----------
bias


---------24:50----------
so you start with the get-go before you


---------24:53----------
even step in the door


---------24:56----------
alex is a guy who doesn't fit in


---------25:00----------
everything else that you've tried to fix


---------25:02----------
that so you've tried to fix


---------25:04----------
that right like you've spent a lot of


---------25:08----------
time


---------25:08----------
and effort and and i don't think you're


---------25:11----------
like a creep i think


---------25:12----------
i think it's quite noble if you see a


---------25:14----------
weakness in yourself to try to get


---------25:15----------
better at it


---------25:16----------
i actually salute you for doing it but


---------25:19----------
let me ask you


---------25:20----------
another weird question alex


---------25:24----------
why don't if we try to fix something


---------25:28----------
and it doesn't get fixed what are the


---------25:30----------
reasons that it doesn't get fixed


---------25:34----------
so let me actually ask in a different


---------25:36----------
way sorry that's a too abstract of a


---------25:38----------
question so i'm a doctor right


---------25:40----------
sometimes as a doctor i use treatments


---------25:44----------
right and i use treatments to fix


---------25:46----------
problems with me


---------25:47----------
i know it's super simple


---------25:51----------
so if a treatment doesn't work what are


---------25:54----------
the reasons that the treatment may not


---------25:56----------
work


---------26:00----------
i mean it could be like you're trying to


---------26:02----------
treat like the wrong thing or something


---------26:04----------
abso [ __ ] lutely so now let me ask


---------26:08----------
you scientifically


---------26:09----------
if you're a guy who watches a bunch of


---------26:11----------
videos and spends eight thousand dollars


---------26:13----------
on dating coaching


---------26:14----------
and it doesn't work what are the reasons


---------26:16----------
for that


---------26:22----------
i wasn't i was like trying to focus on


---------26:25----------
the wrong thing


---------26:26----------
absolutely and that's like just logical


---------26:28----------
right because


---------26:29----------
this is a very well-developed system


---------26:32----------
you're clearly a smart guy


---------26:33----------
you've been trying hard you're not an


---------26:35----------
idiot


---------26:37----------
and it doesn't seem to be a work


---------26:40----------
and it doesn't seem to be working and so


---------26:43----------
my


---------26:44----------
sense actually is that this has nothing


---------26:46----------
you're not socially incompetent


---------26:47----------
i mean you may be on some level but you


---------26:49----------
know it sounds like you've actually


---------26:50----------
worked on those skills like


---------26:52----------
you used to be shy you even tell us


---------26:54----------
you've made progress and it's still not


---------26:55----------
working


---------26:56----------
which makes us kind of scratch our heads


---------26:58----------
oh you're uh


---------27:00----------
the mic is sometimes transmitting


---------27:03----------
so so like i just want you to think


---------27:05----------
about that because like you've overcome


---------27:07----------
your shyness you've learned how to


---------27:08----------
approach women those were things that


---------27:10----------
you used to struggle with


---------27:11----------
you've actually improved in the ways


---------27:13----------
that you perceived as your weakness and


---------27:15----------
it's still not working


---------27:18----------
which then suggests to me in a very


---------27:20----------
simple logical level that you're trying


---------27:22----------
to treat the wrong thing


---------27:25----------
and i think the thing that is broken


---------27:27----------
within you is not


---------27:28----------
and your diagnosis of yourself is based


---------27:32----------
upon something that is based on an


---------27:35----------
assumption or an experience that you now


---------27:37----------
try to actively ignore which is why like


---------27:38----------
nothing's gonna work


---------27:41----------
right doesn't mean that you can't get


---------27:42----------
better doesn't mean that you can't go on


---------27:43----------
a date doesn't mean you can't find love


---------27:45----------
and get married or


---------27:46----------
you know sleep with a bunch of women if


---------27:47----------
that's what you want to do like whatever


---------27:48----------
floats your vote


---------27:50----------
what i'm saying is that like something


---------27:52----------
about what doesn't seem to be working


---------27:53----------
and i think that's because you're like


---------27:54----------
solving the wrong problem


---------27:56----------
because all of this is laid on the


---------27:58----------
foundation that alex


---------28:00----------
isn't good at what


---------28:05----------
alex isn't good with people socializing


---------28:08----------
yep here's the crazy thing i don't


---------28:11----------
actually accept that as true


---------28:14----------
i don't accept that as true for a minute


---------28:16----------
because i think


---------28:17----------
that is not something that


---------28:20----------
in a sense is true it's not about you


---------28:22----------
it's about the way that people


---------28:24----------
treated you you had like


---------28:28----------
second graders telling you that you


---------28:29----------
don't fit in


---------28:32----------
and you may not have fit in it's not


---------28:34----------
untrue right because you didn't fit in


---------28:35----------
and they did believe


---------28:38----------
so it's like sort of true like you're


---------28:39----------
not an idiot but like i don't accept


---------28:42----------
that conclusion


---------28:43----------
that you formed before you turned 13.


---------28:47----------
and my sense is that if we can change


---------28:49----------
that conclusion if you can look at


---------28:51----------
yourself in the mirror


---------28:52----------
and not cringe at what you see because


---------28:54----------
like that's the [ __ ] problem like


---------28:58----------
whatever that thing is within you


---------29:00----------
like any time you approach or sarge a


---------29:02----------
girl


---------29:03----------
you can come up with all these [ __ ]


---------29:04----------
techniques but as long as that


---------29:07----------
rot is inside you i don't think


---------29:11----------
this is gonna work


---------29:15----------
what do you think about that yeah i


---------29:18----------
think


---------29:19----------
you know that definitely makes sense


---------29:21----------
like trying to work on like the um


---------29:24----------
at deeper levels yep good


---------29:28----------
i i think so so alex i i respect you


---------29:31----------
immensely


---------29:32----------
what do you think about that


---------29:36----------
um yeah thanks do you have any idea


---------29:40----------
first of all do you believe me


---------29:44----------
i mean i believe you why would i respect


---------29:52----------
you


---------29:57----------
i mean like i'm just like being like


---------29:59----------
open and like honest


---------30:00----------
yep that's certainly a part of it what


---------30:06----------
else


---------30:18----------
oh what could be


---------30:21----------
i'm sorry you said you don't know what


---------30:22----------
it could be


---------30:25----------
like what could it be yeah that's a


---------30:27----------
question right so now we get to another


---------30:29----------
important question i'm going to tell you


---------30:30----------
in a second but like


---------30:34----------
i want to notice i'm not sure if this is


---------30:36----------
just awkward and i'm putting you in a


---------30:38----------
weird situation but like


---------30:40----------
i'm trying to get a sense of whether you


---------30:42----------
can gauge


---------30:43----------
someone when someone looks at you what


---------30:45----------
do they see


---------30:46----------
what do you think


---------30:55----------
um and it's kind of like cartoon like


---------30:59----------
i like a hard question like what do you


---------31:01----------
mean yeah so so it's a very hard


---------31:04----------
question


---------31:06----------
so i i i wonder if on some level


---------31:10----------
when other people look at you what you


---------31:12----------
assume


---------31:13----------
is what they see is what you see when


---------31:16----------
you look in the mirror


---------31:18----------
which is someone who's like on the


---------31:20----------
surface doing a good job but underneath


---------31:22----------
is kind of cringy


---------31:24----------
is that how people see you


---------31:28----------
i mean it's a possibility that they


---------31:30----------
could see that yep it is a possibility


---------31:33----------
what do you think they see


---------31:39----------
do you know


---------31:43----------
i might and i kind of feel like at first


---------31:46----------
they like


---------31:46----------
just seemed like no real guy but they


---------31:48----------
like try talking to me like


---------31:51----------
yeah they yeah like once they start


---------31:53----------
talking to me like they might see


---------31:54----------
someone's just like cringy yep right so


---------31:57----------
so i'm gonna say what i said earlier


---------32:00----------
and try to map it on to what you said on


---------32:02----------
the surface


---------32:03----------
they see a normal guy and underneath


---------32:07----------
is cringy so you can pass for a normal


---------32:10----------
dude


---------32:11----------
until you start interacting right and


---------32:14----------
then what i do is i


---------32:15----------
i have this gold statue and i scratch


---------32:19----------
the gold a little bit and hold on a


---------32:20----------
second that's not gold underneath


---------32:22----------
looks like gold on the outside looks


---------32:24----------
normal


---------32:25----------
but underneath scratch it a little bit


---------32:28----------
engage with a little bit


---------32:30----------
and inside is alex cringy


---------32:36----------
and so that's not what i see


---------32:40----------
i can see because i i don't think that's


---------32:42----------
actually what


---------32:43----------
they see i think that's what you think


---------32:45----------
they see


---------32:47----------
and you think you're cringy and


---------32:49----------
therefore


---------32:50----------
they see cringy


---------32:53----------
i see a guy who tries i see a guy who's


---------32:57----------
smart


---------32:58----------
i see a guy who's dedicated and who's


---------33:00----------
trying to make himself a better person


---------33:04----------
and i tend to judge the pua scene so


---------33:08----------
apologies for that that may not


---------33:10----------
be fair of me but at the end of the day


---------33:12----------
i see a dude who [ __ ] gives a [ __ ]


---------33:15----------
and tries to make his life a little bit


---------33:17----------
better than it is


---------33:18----------
i see a dude who says hey this is a


---------33:20----------
problem that i have and i'm not willing


---------33:22----------
to accept it i want to change it


---------33:25----------
and mad respect man i can get behind you


---------33:28----------
a hundred percent for that


---------33:30----------
open and honest and all that [ __ ] like


---------33:32----------
you know balls of steel for coming on


---------33:34----------
stream and all that stuff is there too


---------33:35----------
but at the end of the day alex i'm in


---------33:37----------
your corner because i think you're


---------33:39----------
trying to become better than what you


---------33:40----------
are


---------33:41----------
and you're not taking it taking it


---------33:43----------
laying down


---------33:44----------
you're not like saying oh woe is me


---------33:46----------
you're saying like i'm going to try to


---------33:48----------
do something about it


---------33:51----------
but i don't know if you see that in


---------33:53----------
yourself do you


---------34:01----------
i mean i mean maybe like i mean to the


---------34:04----------
to a degree yeah but i also like kind of


---------34:06----------
like see someone like


---------34:10----------
like who's like basically like a hard


---------34:12----------
case


---------34:13----------
i guess that makes any sense yep


---------34:16----------
makes a lot of sense


---------34:20----------
not quite hopeless but damn near close


---------34:25----------
does that make sense


---------34:29----------
i'm good yeah so i'm going to say it in


---------34:33----------
a different way


---------34:34----------
you're a guy who's not willing to give


---------34:37----------
up despite the fact that you're hopeless


---------34:40----------
does that make sense


---------34:45----------
um yeah it does yep so let's be honest


---------34:48----------
because i think you think you're


---------34:49----------
hopeless


---------34:50----------
but you're not willing to accept it


---------34:55----------
hard truth to face yeah that's


---------34:59----------
how does it feel to hear that that's


---------35:01----------
true


---------35:08----------
and feels good it's


---------35:12----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] weird though right here


---------35:14----------
i


---------35:15----------
am telling you alex you're a guy who has


---------35:18----------
no hope


---------35:19----------
and you're like that feels like


---------35:22----------
i think that how does it work man


---------35:27----------
i don't know it's weird


---------35:30----------
what are you feeling right now


---------35:35----------
i feel pretty good okay what does that


---------35:38----------
mean pretty good


---------35:44----------
um


---------35:52----------
kind of like uh pretty happy like pretty


---------35:54----------
relieved i guess


---------35:55----------
yeah right so so can i toss out a word


---------35:58----------
do you feel


---------35:59----------
unburdened


---------36:02----------
less heavy i'm not trying to put words


---------36:05----------
in your mouth but it seems like


---------36:06----------
yeah less time yeah yeah yeah less


---------36:09----------
heavier


---------36:09----------
definitely a good one yep okay so


---------36:12----------
alex on the one hand i don't want to


---------36:14----------
lead you and on the other hand sometimes


---------36:16----------
you know i've been doing this a little


---------36:18----------
bit for a little while now so sometimes


---------36:20----------
i can


---------36:21----------
guess based on how people are feeling is


---------36:23----------
it okay if i sometimes


---------36:24----------
prompt you with words if you can't find


---------36:26----------
the right one until we find what you're


---------36:27----------
feeling


---------36:30----------
that's all right okay so now alex we


---------36:33----------
come to a really


---------36:34----------
difficult fork in the road


---------36:38----------
so the question is so i i said earlier


---------36:40----------
that i'm going to respect your choice


---------36:42----------
not to talk about your upbringing but it


---------36:45----------
is my belief that that's


---------36:47----------
the foundation of all this [ __ ]


---------36:50----------
so i'm going to give you a choice i


---------36:53----------
think it would be productive to talk


---------36:55----------
about and at the same time i want to


---------36:56----------
respect you it doesn't have to be now it


---------36:58----------
doesn't


---------36:59----------
could be different place different


---------37:01----------
person whatever but i think that's where


---------37:02----------
the money is


---------37:04----------
and i wanted to explain to you you know


---------37:06----------
why i was asking about that


---------37:08----------
or we can talk about you know the


---------37:10----------
experience of dating coaching


---------37:13----------
pickup artists nlp


---------37:16----------
you know what it's like to work with


---------37:18----------
seven coaches what kind of stuff you


---------37:19----------
wanted to talk about i think both of


---------37:21----------
those


---------37:21----------
would be very educational i think one


---------37:24----------
is going to be for twitch and one is


---------37:26----------
going to be for you


---------37:28----------
and so i leave that to you


---------37:33----------
well which one do you uh i think i


---------37:36----------
should do like


---------37:37----------
if you want me to talk about the


---------37:40----------
upbringing stuff i could try to


---------37:42----------
like do a little bit more if that's what


---------37:44----------
you want


---------37:47----------
if not then i can also talk about your


---------37:48----------
stuff that like either way is good


---------37:51----------
yeah so so i i do think we should talk


---------37:53----------
about k through eight because what i


---------37:55----------
want is to help you so every time when i


---------37:59----------
stream with someone


---------38:00----------
i try to help the person that i'm


---------38:01----------
talking to the most and that's


---------38:04----------
my true north and at the same time


---------38:08----------
you know i want to respect your


---------38:09----------
boundaries but like i really think that


---------38:10----------
like because like you said


---------38:12----------
the day you walked in to ninth grade


---------38:16----------
you already knew there was a


---------38:18----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------38:20----------
and everything that you've built on that


---------38:23----------
assumption


---------38:25----------
is like your strategy for life and when


---------38:27----------
every you've built this


---------38:29----------
beautiful skyscraper on a false


---------38:31----------
foundation


---------38:33----------
and so anything that you try to do to


---------38:35----------
fix anything


---------38:36----------
in that skyscraper is just based on a


---------38:39----------
fundamentally flawed


---------38:40----------
foundation and i think that if you can


---------38:44----------
okay okay i'll talk about it


---------38:47----------
okay so what is up it's very like um


---------38:50----------
like like one of the things that they


---------38:52----------
call me is like um like a [ __ ]


---------38:54----------
okay


---------38:58----------
and and what what what would make them


---------39:01----------
say that


---------39:06----------
i mean i was i mean to be fair like


---------39:10----------
a k through like seventh grade


---------39:14----------
i mean i wasn't the best student but by


---------39:16----------
starting like the eighth grade


---------39:18----------
then into high school like i actually


---------39:19----------
became like uh


---------39:21----------
like a straight a student and actually i


---------39:24----------
don't think it has anything


---------39:25----------
to even do with grades like they just i


---------39:27----------
think it was basically like


---------39:31----------
and i just like felt very shy and stuff


---------39:33----------
and


---------39:34----------
and like i'd say the best word to do is


---------39:38----------
like maybe like social incomes like


---------39:40----------
maybe


---------39:41----------
sure and like maybe they perceived that


---------39:43----------
as being like less intelligent


---------39:45----------
sure like even though i wasn't really


---------39:46----------
left intelligent i was actually you know


---------39:48----------
a very good student


---------39:49----------
yeah and so they just saw something


---------39:53----------
about you and they they chose to pick on


---------39:55----------
you


---------39:56----------
and then how did you feel about yourself


---------39:59----------
when they would call you these things


---------40:02----------
do you remember


---------40:08----------
i mean definitely like very a terrible


---------40:10----------
like


---------40:11----------
i also felt like very alienated like


---------40:13----------
back then like we had like


---------40:16----------
like back then it was actually very


---------40:17----------
small school


---------40:19----------
like one time i decided not to like sit


---------40:21----------
with them


---------40:23----------
and yeah that felt very awkward because


---------40:24----------
sitting by myself so then i had to go


---------40:26----------
back to scene with him


---------40:28----------
just so i could like be seen with other


---------40:29----------
people yeah


---------40:32----------
like does that like kind of like answer


---------40:34----------
the question beautifully


---------40:35----------
alex beautifully


---------40:40----------
i think you share you share a lot


---------40:43----------
with a very small story what i see is a


---------40:47----------
kid who's stuck


---------40:49----------
[ __ ] either way right


---------40:52----------
either you like sit with the abuse


---------40:56----------
and you're alienated with them or you're


---------40:59----------
alienated by yourself


---------41:02----------
but what i see is a child who is


---------41:05----------
has an inescapable truth that either way


---------41:08----------
you're alienated


---------41:11----------
does that make sense


---------41:15----------
um yeah it makes uh perfect sense and so


---------41:18----------
then you learned


---------41:19----------
how to act right so i'm also hearing


---------41:23----------
something really important there which


---------41:24----------
is that like


---------41:26----------
when you were hanging out when you went


---------41:27----------
back the next day and sat at the table


---------41:32----------
what was that like can you tell us


---------41:36----------
tell us a story alex you're a very good


---------41:38----------
storyteller


---------41:40----------
can you just tell us a story about you


---------41:42----------
know being in elementary school


---------41:44----------
just something that jumps out about like


---------41:47----------
maybe feeling alienated or feeling fake


---------41:51----------
well basically um it was like 15


---------41:53----------
different guys versus one


---------41:56----------
so in that regards i was like a little


---------41:58----------
bit like


---------41:59----------
intimidated because like are they gonna


---------42:01----------
like mess with my food and stuff


---------42:03----------
like it wasn't that like i wasn't tough


---------42:05----------
or anything


---------42:06----------
but i feel like one guy against like 15


---------42:09----------
people like obviously


---------42:11----------
i'm not going to lose no matter what


---------42:14----------
yeah and what did you do because you


---------42:17----------
were going to lose no matter what


---------42:33----------
yeah basically not even like try


---------42:37----------
interesting what would trying look like


---------42:48----------
um what do i look like exactly i mean


---------42:53----------
i mean kind of hard to say but


---------43:03----------
and i just like didn't know what to do


---------43:04----------
like


---------43:10----------
okay


---------43:13----------
so i respectfully disagree with


---------43:15----------
something you said a little earlier


---------43:18----------
so 15 versus one what's the point in


---------43:21----------
trying


---------43:22----------
feels hopeless right


---------43:26----------
it's impossible feel familiar


---------43:30----------
we talked about that before oh yeah


---------43:34----------
and here's the crazy thing i don't think


---------43:36----------
you you gave up on trying


---------43:37----------
i think you tried anyway


---------43:41----------
because like that's what sitting back at


---------43:43----------
the table is the second day


---------43:45----------
giving up is moving by yourself


---------43:49----------
and then going back and sitting with


---------43:50----------
them even though they bully you


---------43:53----------
that's not giving up that's


---------43:56----------
trying in the face of hopelessness


---------43:59----------
what do you think about that


---------44:03----------
yeah i think that makes perfect sense so


---------44:06----------
this is who you are and this is what i


---------44:08----------
respect about you


---------44:10----------
because you're a guy who says [ __ ] it


---------44:14----------
right even though it's painful and i


---------44:15----------
make it sound glorious and the movies


---------44:17----------
make it sound glorious


---------44:18----------
the truth is that it's horribly painful


---------44:20----------
and is scarring and traumatic


---------44:24----------
but you tried anyway


---------44:27----------
and then you said i didn't know what to


---------44:29----------
do


---------44:31----------
now let me ask you something alex when


---------44:34----------
it comes to approaching women


---------44:36----------
would you that feeling of like being


---------44:39----------
different


---------44:40----------
and being hopeless and not knowing what


---------44:43----------
to do


---------44:44----------
do you carry that with you when you


---------44:46----------
approach a woman


---------44:48----------
um yeah precisely it's also part of the


---------44:50----------
reason


---------44:51----------
also part of the reason why i have to


---------44:54----------
stick to these like


---------44:56----------
dumb routines yeah but the dumb routines


---------44:59----------
don't seem like they're working right so


---------45:00----------
we'll get to those in a second


---------45:02----------
but here's the problem like i i don't


---------45:04----------
know how else to say this alex but


---------45:07----------
the things that hold you back today and


---------45:09----------
that you carry with you


---------45:11----------
are your words precisely


---------45:14----------
what you felt years ago and so here's


---------45:18----------
the really cool thing


---------45:20----------
if you deal with those feelings this


---------45:22----------
entire skyscraper


---------45:23----------
is going to come tumbling down


---------45:28----------
your problems with women i know this


---------45:30----------
sounds [ __ ]


---------45:32----------
in a sense will vanish


---------45:35----------
because they're not problems with women


---------45:38----------
they're problems with you the reason


---------45:42----------
that i think women reject you is because


---------45:44----------
when they scratch beneath the surface


---------45:48----------
what they see is what you are and as


---------45:51----------
long as you believe that that's what you


---------45:53----------
are


---------45:53----------
that's what they're going to see


---------45:57----------
and so occasionally you may find someone


---------45:59----------
who has like a lot of compassion


---------46:01----------
and who may pity you but that's not


---------46:03----------
going to be a healthy relationship


---------46:07----------
and it's just not gonna and those women


---------46:10----------
get turned off by the pickup artist kind


---------46:12----------
of approach like the chad approach


---------46:14----------
sarge like they got turned off by that


---------46:16----------
kind of stuff


---------46:18----------
you know like you know i mean i think so


---------46:22----------
much of what you say about like what you


---------46:24----------
feel today


---------46:26----------
i think was born a long time ago and now


---------46:28----------
i'm gonna tell you why i think it's


---------46:30----------
bizarre that you feel


---------46:32----------
relief when basically if you take


---------46:35----------
what i say to you out of context i sound


---------46:37----------
like a complete [ __ ]


---------46:40----------
i'm saying no man you don't have a


---------46:42----------
little bit of hope you're [ __ ]


---------46:43----------
hopeless


---------46:45----------
right like and then and then it's like


---------46:48----------
how do you feel when i say that


---------46:49----------
because that's a mean thing to say right


---------46:52----------
and and yet you feel really because


---------46:55----------
here's the thing


---------46:56----------
i think what we're doing is we're


---------46:58----------
sitting with that feeling and i'm not


---------46:59----------
rejecting you


---------47:02----------
because what happened is you used to be


---------47:04----------
awkward and people used to punish you


---------47:06----------
for it


---------47:07----------
and what feels relieving what feels


---------47:10----------
heavy is like you know like there's a


---------47:12----------
part of you that has been


---------47:14----------
beaten over and over and over again and


---------47:17----------
so


---------47:17----------
flinches whenever you face these


---------47:20----------
feelings or these thoughts


---------47:23----------
and it can feel very relieving when you


---------47:25----------
say something that you used to get


---------47:27----------
beat for and someone doesn't beat you


---------47:30----------
like oh [ __ ]


---------47:36----------
huh


---------47:38----------
what do you think about that


---------47:43----------
that makes uh perfect sense okay


---------47:53----------
can i think for a second sure


---------47:56----------
now i don't know where to go i feel like


---------47:59----------
i blew my load way too early


---------48:01----------
because usually this happens at the end


---------48:03----------
and someone pries oh my god


---------48:06----------
okay so it makes perfect sense so i


---------48:07----------
think we've figured something out


---------48:09----------
another question is what we do about it


---------48:11----------
do you have questions by the way


---------48:15----------
uh not at all actually like


---------48:19----------
yeah definitely


---------48:22----------
i hope helps a lot how does it help


---------48:28----------
yeah well now i know like basically like


---------48:31----------
let's do a


---------48:32----------
focus on i definitely


---------48:35----------
i fix all the inner stuff yep


---------48:39----------
how do you do that


---------48:46----------
how do i do that i mean


---------48:52----------
yeah yeah so basically like yeah like


---------48:54----------
rebuilt like the foundation on like how


---------48:56----------
i


---------48:58----------
like see myself like the stuff like i


---------48:59----------
got taught like back then


---------49:01----------
i basically like declutter that yep


---------49:05----------
so this is the first thing that i wrote


---------49:08----------
i don't know if you can see this can you


---------49:10----------
read that


---------49:14----------
external solution plus internal


---------49:17----------
problems yeah so external solutions to


---------49:21----------
internal problems


---------49:23----------
this is the first thing that i wrote


---------49:26----------
this is your problem


---------49:30----------
you look to dating coaches and websites


---------49:33----------
and videos and things like that


---------49:35----------
to fix what's inside


---------49:38----------
and that's why it doesn't [ __ ] work


---------49:42----------
because it's just like you're putting


---------49:44----------
all of your energy in the opposite


---------49:46----------
direction


---------49:48----------
here's the crazy thing alex i don't


---------49:50----------
think you have a problem talking to


---------49:51----------
women


---------49:53----------
the even crazier thing is that you agree


---------49:57----------
do you say i used to be shy but i'm not


---------49:59----------
anymore i can actually go up and talk to


---------50:00----------
women


---------50:02----------
the problem is what you show them


---------50:05----------
and what you show them is what you are


---------50:09----------
and on the surface you can maintain a


---------50:11----------
front for some amount of time but


---------50:12----------
eventually the scratch beneath the


---------50:14----------
surface


---------50:14----------
and they see something rotten on the


---------50:16----------
inside


---------50:19----------
and this is like this is what the entire


---------50:22----------
anyway yeah i think the whole pickup


---------50:25----------
artist like approach is like


---------50:26----------
based on this fundamental misnomer and


---------50:29----------
the thing is it works for some people


---------50:30----------
right like


---------50:31----------
you get some kinds of outcomes and if


---------50:33----------
you roll the dice enough you're gonna


---------50:34----------
get people to like


---------50:35----------
hook up with you but my overwhelming


---------50:37----------
experience talking to people who have


---------50:38----------
done all this pickup artist stuff


---------50:40----------
is that like one in ten seems to do like


---------50:42----------
way better


---------50:43----------
but nine out of ten don't seem to get


---------50:46----------
much out of it


---------50:48----------
i don't know if you would agree or


---------50:49----------
disagree with that


---------50:55----------
i think it definitely makes sense yeah


---------50:59----------
so like i i think i think this comes


---------51:01----------
this starts alex with like


---------51:03----------
if you believe


---------51:07----------
that you're an alien


---------51:10----------
when you interact with another human


---------51:12----------
being they're gonna be able to sense


---------51:14----------
that


---------51:14----------
especially women and by especially


---------51:18----------
there's


---------51:18----------
actually data that suggests that their


---------51:20----------
brains are somewhat different and don't


---------51:22----------
overread into this crap


---------51:23----------
by all means but human beings are


---------51:26----------
empathic


---------51:27----------
and oftentimes men are conditioned to be


---------51:30----------
less empathic


---------51:31----------
and women are not conditioned in the


---------51:33----------
same way i think a lot of it is


---------51:34----------
conditioning


---------51:37----------
and so on some level they pick up what


---------51:40----------
you have underneath the surface


---------51:42----------
and then something about this entire


---------51:45----------
thing sounds super artificial to me


---------51:48----------
the approach


---------51:50----------
[Music]


---------51:54----------
and it's like you're like it's like a


---------51:55----------
bombing one it's like


---------51:57----------
you know and then the girl gives you the


---------52:00----------
number and then ghosts you it's like


---------52:02----------
like i'd say that what you got to do


---------52:04----------
is like have a conversation with someone


---------52:05----------
don't try to get laid just like


---------52:07----------
go out and meet people don't try to pick


---------52:10----------
up women


---------52:10----------
just meet people and that's what


---------52:14----------
terrifies you because like that's what


---------52:15----------
you did when you were in kindergarten


---------52:17----------
it's like you tried to just have friends


---------52:20----------
and boy did you get burned and so it's


---------52:23----------
way


---------52:23----------
easier when you stop thinking about them


---------52:25----------
as people and start thinking


---------52:26----------
about them as what term do they use


---------52:32----------
i can't say that again what term well


---------52:34----------
what how do they refer to women


---------52:36----------
in the circles that you like the target


---------52:41----------
like um yeah that's definitely one of


---------52:42----------
them like sometimes we call them like hb


---------52:45----------
eight or nine which stands for like hot


---------52:46----------
babe nine


---------52:48----------
yeah right so like like here's the thing


---------52:49----------
like you dehumanize them


---------52:52----------
because then alex the molding


---------52:56----------
so you your brain has this idea that


---------52:58----------
like when i interact with humans


---------53:00----------
they treat me like [ __ ]


---------53:04----------
and if i don't treat them like humans


---------53:06----------
then that previous programming doesn't


---------53:08----------
apply here


---------53:09----------
it's a whole new ball game does that


---------53:12----------
make sense at all or not so much


---------53:17----------
that definitely makes sense right so


---------53:18----------
then you're playing a game


---------53:20----------
it's a game it's not about like me being


---------53:22----------
a human and them being human


---------53:24----------
it's like i'm an avatar of a chad and


---------53:27----------
they are the hp


---------53:28----------
8 or 9. and so it's like a story it's


---------53:31----------
like a role play


---------53:32----------
and like the cool thing about stories is


---------53:34----------
we get to be


---------53:35----------
people that we're not


---------53:38----------
and so it's very appealing what i would


---------53:42----------
love though is if you could just be


---------53:43----------
yourself and be okay with that because i


---------53:45----------
don't think you're a [ __ ] up man


---------53:47----------
you're 20 years old you've got plenty of


---------53:49----------
time bro trust me


---------53:56----------
okay questions other questions


---------54:01----------
um not really that yeah definitely uh


---------54:06----------
cleared a ton a ton of things up for me


---------54:08----------
thanks


---------54:09----------
yeah you're very welcome um i'm torn a


---------54:12----------
little bit between so i've got a couple


---------54:13----------
we've got a couple options one is we


---------54:14----------
still have some time do you want to


---------54:16----------
continue talking


---------54:18----------
yeah definitely okay so here's here are


---------54:20----------
two or three options one is we can talk


---------54:22----------
a little bit about practicalities so how


---------54:24----------
does one go about the process of


---------54:26----------
cluttering


---------54:27----------
but i do find myself i kind of like


---------54:30----------
derailed you from you know talking about


---------54:33----------
the videos and the pickup artists and


---------54:34----------
the dating coaches


---------54:35----------
which i think people are curious about


---------54:37----------
i'm still curious about those


---------54:39----------
so i i mean can we still talk about that


---------54:43----------
and that that philosophy and approach


---------54:45----------
okay


---------54:46----------
so um you said you started talking about


---------54:49----------
oh you said you started watching lots


---------54:51----------
and lots of videos


---------54:52----------
so can you tell us about those videos


---------54:56----------
um yes um i have like a


---------55:00----------
ton of those programs probably like a


---------55:03----------
terabyte


---------55:04----------
to be honest like that much um


---------55:07----------
if i had to go back to the very first


---------55:09----------
program i watched


---------55:12----------
yeah i was basically like a guy


---------55:15----------
interviewing like a


---------55:17----------
bunch of women and then like telling us


---------55:20----------
like how to like


---------55:22----------
like get like that specific grown stuff


---------55:26----------
and like there are also like other um


---------55:29----------
programs


---------55:30----------
like when i watched last year it was a


---------55:35----------
i guess i focused on mindsets and that


---------55:38----------
they're like these other


---------55:40----------
i mean there are a lot of different


---------55:41----------
programs like uh nlp


---------55:43----------
programs are


---------55:47----------
yeah those are those are those ones are


---------55:49----------
probably like


---------55:50----------
the creepier ones because they rely on


---------55:53----------
you


---------55:54----------
basically like spitting up these


---------55:57----------
so-called language patterns


---------56:01----------
um which relies on using your like


---------56:02----------
hypnotic language like like one of the


---------56:04----------
examples like they used


---------56:06----------
like it like if a girl had like some


---------56:08----------
sort of pendant


---------56:10----------
like you go up to her and the guy was


---------56:12----------
really talking for like three minutes


---------56:14----------
straight


---------56:16----------
like like as the opener and it doesn't


---------56:19----------
make any sense like


---------56:21----------
like if i just went up to a random one


---------56:23----------
start talking to her about about like


---------56:25----------
her pendant for like three


---------56:26----------
consecutive minutes like she would just


---------56:29----------
leave


---------56:31----------
i don't know if so they're also like


---------56:33----------
we're also


---------56:35----------
i told you i'm saying what did i think


---------56:37----------
that's gonna do


---------56:40----------
um it's basically you're trying to like


---------56:43----------
use these so-called triggers


---------56:46----------
like these psychological triggers like


---------56:50----------
like use like methods such as like the


---------56:53----------
um fractionation and stuff


---------56:55----------
i just can you explain that to me please


---------57:00----------
a fractionation


---------57:04----------
oh man i i forgot like the best


---------57:06----------
definition for it


---------57:07----------
but i'd say more than like the


---------57:09----------
implementation


---------57:11----------
of using in in language it's like


---------57:15----------
it's like kind of like a roller coaster


---------57:16----------
language like you're saying something


---------57:18----------
that kind of like evokes


---------57:21----------
like negative feelings at first but then


---------57:22----------
you like say something that invokes like


---------57:25----------
positive feelings and then


---------57:27----------
like it's it's like not just a straight


---------57:29----------
line because


---------57:30----------
because women supposedly find just the


---------57:33----------
same emotion repeatedly like being


---------57:35----------
a boring thing but if you have like


---------57:37----------
these mixed feelings it makes you sound


---------57:39----------
more interesting


---------57:41----------
that's so i mean those were i mean those


---------57:44----------
are the most technical ones but they're


---------57:45----------
also like books


---------57:47----------
um i'm just like trying to just give you


---------57:51----------
like a quick summary of like


---------57:52----------
yeah i appreciate that like i think it's


---------57:54----------
it's pretty it's really helpful alex


---------57:55----------
thank you


---------57:58----------
so are you mentioned books


---------58:02----------
um yeah there are like a ton of books as


---------58:04----------
well


---------58:07----------
any any kind of takeaways from the book


---------58:09----------
can you help me understand what kind of


---------58:10----------
stuff they talk about or what they cover


---------58:16----------
i mean the books


---------58:20----------
i mean like a book in a program can like


---------58:23----------
kind of


---------58:24----------
teach the same thing mindset wise i


---------58:26----------
guess


---------58:27----------
i feel like a pro the advantage with


---------58:31----------
like video programs that can


---------58:34----------
like you know hear people like like


---------58:36----------
giving examples like


---------58:38----------
they're like saying the actual things we


---------58:40----------
also have this thing called like


---------58:41----------
infield like video footage where like


---------58:44----------
you're seeing


---------58:46----------
basically the mentor like like applying


---------58:49----------
to the


---------58:50----------
so-called uh principles like


---------58:53----------
like into real life basically who's we


---------58:57----------
said we have this thing called infield


---------58:59----------
video footage who's we


---------59:05----------
oh yeah that pick up yeah community


---------59:08----------
okay can you tell me about that


---------59:11----------
community


---------59:17----------
i mean i mean i mean obviously the good


---------59:21----------
thing is about that we're like just here


---------59:23----------
to improve ourselves like really


---------59:26----------
i mean the only for the most part the


---------59:28----------
most negative thing is


---------59:30----------
obviously bad advice like what the most


---------59:33----------
common


---------59:33----------
one the most common advice i see that's


---------59:35----------
like pretty bad is just


---------59:38----------
at least i realize that even more right


---------59:39----------
now is definitely they always say oh no


---------59:41----------
you just have to approach


---------59:42----------
like just have to like keep approaching


---------59:45----------
like thousands


---------59:46----------
of women like there's like there's this


---------59:50----------
one a giant company that advocates like


---------59:55----------
like you have to approach like at least


---------59:56----------
a thousand girls in order to like get


---------59:58----------
decent


---------60:02----------
okay i mean that that makes sense no


---------60:06----------
practice makes perfect


---------60:09----------
i mean it does but it didn't really work


---------60:12----------
for me


---------60:15----------
you've approached a thousand women


---------60:20----------
i've i've approached uh 300


---------60:23----------
holy [ __ ] dude that's a lot


---------60:28----------
that's got to be yeah tough


---------60:33----------
to get rejected 300 times


---------60:38----------
something i mean yeah i mean i was


---------60:40----------
especially like


---------60:42----------
i mean i was definitely uh pretty


---------60:44----------
nervous like doing it at first


---------60:47----------
but then you kind of like just get used


---------60:49----------
to it


---------60:51----------
like you get desensitized basically yeah


---------60:55----------
you seem like a desensitized kind of


---------60:56----------
dude


---------60:59----------
what do you think about that


---------61:04----------
can i share with you why i think you're


---------61:05----------
getting


---------61:07----------
why i think you're doing that it's


---------61:09----------
actually kind of wondering that


---------61:10----------
yep um so i think a lot of times


---------61:14----------
you can't describe what you're feeling


---------61:18----------
but when i put words to it you can say


---------61:20----------
yeah that's it


---------61:23----------
right so that suggests to me that like


---------61:24----------
you've


---------61:26----------
you just don't quite know like you sort


---------61:29----------
of can face the feeling but you don't


---------61:31----------
really have like


---------61:32----------
you're it's almost like you're


---------61:33----------
colorblind when it comes to looking


---------61:35----------
within yourself


---------61:36----------
which is what i think gov is someone


---------61:37----------
who's desensitized but with


---------61:39----------
a little bit of help you can learn what


---------61:40----------
it is that you're feeling


---------61:42----------
and the interesting thing is that so


---------61:45----------
that then that begs the question how do


---------61:47----------
i know what you're feeling


---------61:49----------
if you don't know what you're feeling


---------61:50----------
how do i know what you're feeling and


---------61:52----------
that turns out that just like women


---------61:54----------
you actually signal a lot more stuff


---------61:57----------
than you realize


---------62:00----------
and if you've got a good receiver on the


---------62:01----------
other end i see the color inside you


---------62:03----------
you just don't skin but you're still


---------62:06----------
giving it off because it's not like i'm


---------62:07----------
psychic or something right


---------62:08----------
you're actually giving it off quite


---------62:09----------
strongly so like you tell a story


---------62:13----------
like that story about the cafeteria was


---------62:14----------
beautiful i mean it's a terrible story


---------62:16----------
like awful to listen to but it was


---------62:20----------
beautiful in terms of like there's


---------62:21----------
so much color and meaning and feeling


---------62:26----------
in that story


---------62:31----------
i'm sorry did you want to jump in i


---------62:33----------
wasn't quite sure


---------62:35----------
i know i was just listening to you but


---------62:36----------
yeah that i feel like


---------62:38----------
makes a perfect sense yeah


---------62:42----------
um okay so so there there are


---------62:46----------
videos coaches the pickup artist


---------62:48----------
community and so when did you start


---------62:51----------
coaching when i started coaching


---------62:56----------
that was and my first coach was um


---------62:59----------
senior year in high school okay and how


---------63:03----------
did you decide to


---------63:04----------
seek out a coach


---------63:08----------
i definitely dissatisfaction with where


---------63:11----------
i currently have meds


---------63:15----------
dissatisfaction meaning what


---------63:18----------
what were you dissatisfied with i was


---------63:22----------
just satisfied that


---------63:24----------
you know i wasn't like i couldn't


---------63:27----------
socialize i


---------63:28----------
was also like also dissatisfied with the


---------63:32----------
fact that i


---------63:32----------
couldn't get any women or they're


---------63:35----------
particular so you know


---------63:40----------
oh yeah definitely were you in love


---------63:48----------
i know i definitely had a uh huge


---------63:51----------
case of uh like one nitis with this girl


---------63:54----------
for like


---------63:55----------
like at least four years but what


---------63:58----------
constitutes being in love like


---------64:00----------
i'm not really sure what that means what


---------64:03----------
is


---------64:03----------
also kind of like


---------64:08----------
it's basically where yeah there's like


---------64:11----------
this one girl like


---------64:15----------
i mean i guess in your terms like you


---------64:17----------
could call like being in love but i


---------64:18----------
don't know it's like


---------64:22----------
basically you're only focused on like


---------64:23----------
one woman pretty much


---------64:27----------
when you say your terms who is the you


---------64:34----------
i just meant like like you said like was


---------64:36----------
i in love


---------64:37----------
like i don't really know what kazu was


---------64:39----------
being loved like maybe i


---------64:41----------
just had a huge crush on her but one


---------64:43----------
nidus


---------64:45----------
it basically plays like you're


---------64:48----------
overthinking about this


---------64:49----------
one girl for like way too long i think


---------64:51----------
that's probably like


---------64:52----------
like the better definition for it do you


---------64:55----------
know what the


---------64:55----------
the suffix itis means


---------65:00----------
itis means like inflammation yeah


---------65:04----------
its interesting right so what we


---------65:07----------
call love you call a disease


---------65:12----------
oh that's right


---------65:15----------
so like uveitis is like


---------65:18----------
inflammation of the uvea rhinitis


---------65:22----------
allergic rhinitis do you know what


---------65:24----------
allergic rhinitis means


---------65:29----------
inflammation of


---------65:32----------
like like an allergic reaction yep it


---------65:35----------
means allergies


---------65:36----------
it's the colloquial problem right


---------65:40----------
so rhinitis means nose so when you have


---------65:43----------
like seasonal allergies as your nose is


---------65:45----------
stopped up


---------65:46----------
we develop our own terminology to


---------65:48----------
separate ourselves from the rest of


---------65:50----------
society and we call it allergic rhinitis


---------65:53----------
and we feel smarter than everyone else


---------65:55----------
by doing so


---------65:56----------
but i think i never appreciated until


---------65:58----------
this moment that


---------66:00----------
what some society calls love it sounds


---------66:03----------
like the pickup artist


---------66:04----------
community treats like a disease


---------66:08----------
so what is so what i just sounds like a


---------66:10----------
bad thing


---------66:13----------
like in the pickup artist community how


---------66:15----------
do they describe one itis what do they


---------66:17----------
say about it


---------66:22----------
and i'm not saying like the pickup bars


---------66:23----------
community is bad or anything like


---------66:25----------
like like it's like we're going to sense


---------66:27----------
that we are like out here to improve


---------66:29----------
ourselves but yeah yeah but when idiots


---------66:31----------
in particular


---------66:34----------
owen itis


---------66:39----------
i guess like we have like these red uh


---------66:42----------
pillish like views like on women like we


---------66:46----------
um like if we focus on one girl


---------66:50----------
i guess another things could be bad like


---------66:51----------
number one


---------66:54----------
um yeah we should number one like we


---------66:55----------
should have in a


---------66:57----------
we should have like an abundance of


---------66:59----------
women


---------67:01----------
to talk about like there's like always a


---------67:03----------
lot more women


---------67:05----------
and number two like i guess at least in


---------67:08----------
my perspective if you're like


---------67:12----------
like always focus on one woman if you're


---------67:14----------
like extremely nervous


---------67:15----------
like maybe you'd be like less likely to


---------67:17----------
get her or something


---------67:20----------
okay i mean i guess like one night is


---------67:22----------
basically like limits


---------67:24----------
like you're


---------67:27----------
like it basically limits you because


---------67:30----------
there's like


---------67:30----------
a ton of other women in the sea so i'd


---------67:32----------
say that's basically why the reason why


---------67:34----------
it's a bad thing because


---------67:35----------
like you should have abundance and you


---------67:37----------
should


---------67:39----------
i know your options like if a girl


---------67:40----------
doesn't you know like you then


---------67:43----------
i mean you should learn to deal with


---------67:46----------
that and


---------67:47----------
having one nightis i guess could be like


---------67:51----------
like you're not like you're still too


---------67:53----------
attached to her basically like


---------67:54----------
just don't become attached to one person


---------67:57----------
but what if i


---------67:58----------
i really like her though


---------68:04----------
i feel like


---------68:08----------
i mean if you really like her yeah


---------68:09----------
basically


---------68:12----------
i try to like interact with her but if


---------68:15----------
it doesn't work out though


---------68:19----------
i mean bad thing with keeping the one


---------68:22----------
nice like


---------68:23----------
it's gonna be too attached it's gonna


---------68:24----------
like prevent you from seeing the other


---------68:26----------
options


---------68:28----------
i i think that attachment leading to


---------68:30----------
suffering is not something that


---------68:32----------
is new right so there's


---------68:35----------
potentially the original if we say that


---------68:37----------
that's a hallmark of the red pill


---------68:39----------
community


---------68:40----------
you know who is the founder of the red


---------68:41----------
pill community


---------68:43----------
who also preached that attachment leads


---------68:45----------
to suffering


---------68:47----------
you should let go of attachment


---------68:51----------
any idea


---------68:56----------
there's this guy named buddha


---------69:00----------
buddha he agrees for what that's worth i


---------69:04----------
don't know if he'd like agree with the


---------69:05----------
rest of it but


---------69:06----------
the general principle that being overly


---------69:08----------
attached to something


---------69:09----------
is what causes suffering is like


---------69:10----------
something that he's been saying for a


---------69:12----------
couple thousand years


---------69:15----------
um okay so so it sounds like you


---------69:18----------
had one itis for a girl how do you what


---------69:21----------
do you think about that now


---------69:27----------
honestly i feel like i was a little


---------69:30----------
creepy for


---------69:31----------
liking her because i barely even


---------69:33----------
interacted her


---------69:34----------
like i like i did


---------69:38----------
i mean like technically i did but


---------69:43----------
i don't know it it just is what feels


---------69:45----------
creepy about that


---------69:51----------
like i i know it's like like usually


---------69:58----------
you're supposed to like someone if


---------69:59----------
you've like talked to them


---------70:02----------
like for quite a bit i mean obviously


---------70:05----------
doctor i mean like at least a little bit


---------70:07----------
but


---------70:09----------
yeah yeah so


---------70:12----------
um alex i think that's actually a really


---------70:14----------
important point do you mind if i ask you


---------70:16----------
a few more questions about that just to


---------70:18----------
illustrate a couple of things


---------70:21----------
sure so help me understand like


---------70:24----------
you know if you haven't interacted with


---------70:26----------
her much and and


---------70:29----------
you know what did you think about her


---------70:32----------
and where did those thoughts come from


---------70:34----------
because your situation is not unique


---------70:36----------
right


---------70:39----------
like i myself caught one itis for


---------70:42----------
someone when i was


---------70:43----------
16 years old and saw this person


---------70:47----------
once and like i still remember the


---------70:50----------
moment that i saw her which was that i


---------70:52----------
was walking by a picnic table


---------70:55----------
and she was walking in the opposite


---------70:56----------
direction with one of our friends


---------70:58----------
and i remember feeling like i got


---------71:00----------
punched in the chest by like an elephant


---------71:04----------
and i still remember that moment i


---------71:05----------
caught some really bad one-itis


---------71:07----------
that's the best way i can describe it


---------71:10----------
and so how how does that happen


---------71:12----------
what happens like what did you think


---------71:14----------
about her and what is that one night is


---------71:15----------
based on


---------71:20----------
i mean i mean i guess i like


---------71:23----------
kind of like notice like things about


---------71:25----------
her


---------71:27----------
i mean i mean that like personality wise


---------71:30----------
i mean i also thought she was very


---------71:31----------
beautiful but yeah


---------71:34----------
like you know she just like kind of


---------71:36----------
seemed


---------71:37----------
like she'd be like my type or something


---------71:40----------
what was it about


---------71:48----------
i mean i guess there's like one thing


---------71:49----------
about personality can't really


---------71:53----------
i mean kind of hard to describe to be


---------71:55----------
honest


---------71:57----------
which i mean she was also like very


---------71:58----------
sweet


---------72:01----------
how did you know she was sweet


---------72:06----------
it's just like something to pick up on


---------72:08----------
you know


---------72:11----------
explain that to me how do you pick up on


---------72:13----------
it


---------72:21----------
um and it's like


---------72:26----------
kinda hard to describe


---------72:33----------
what does it feel like thinking about


---------72:34----------
her and talking about her


---------72:47----------
i guess it feels kind of what feels good


---------72:50----------
about it


---------73:00----------
i'm not sure okay


---------73:06----------
i i wonder if it can just feel good to


---------73:09----------
acknowledge what you have on the inside


---------73:15----------
does that make sense like just calling


---------73:18----------
it what it is


---------73:19----------
not saying it's good not saying it's bad


---------73:23----------
but i i notice you know your face is


---------73:25----------
changing a little bit like you like when


---------73:27----------
you talk about her like you start to


---------73:29----------
grin


---------73:29----------
this yeah it is


---------73:33----------
yeah um do you feel the what is coming


---------73:38----------
back


---------73:38----------
as we talk about her


---------73:44----------
i mean maybe like a tiny bit but


---------73:48----------
because you did say that you had it for


---------73:49----------
four years so it sounds like you're over


---------73:51----------
it now


---------73:57----------
i mean yeah i'd say so yeah


---------74:01----------
and so you said red pill can you tell us


---------74:03----------
what that means


---------74:07----------
i mean i mean i guess it's


---------74:13----------
i wish i'd use like red pillow described


---------74:15----------
god use it to like describe what it is


---------74:24----------
i mean i kind of think that's where it


---------74:27----------
comes from like just like a


---------74:28----------
way of thinking i'm i'm not really


---------74:32----------
that much identified with like different


---------74:35----------
pills


---------74:36----------
okay and


---------74:39----------
but can you explain the general concept


---------74:41----------
behind red pill


---------74:44----------
i think i think blue pill is just like


---------74:54----------
is it blue pose just like what everyone


---------74:55----------
else is


---------74:57----------
um a red pill would probably come like a


---------75:00----------
simp or something


---------75:01----------
i guess okay a red pill


---------75:06----------
could be identified with the guys


---------75:10----------
like or you know like actively trying


---------75:12----------
not to get women


---------75:13----------
and then the black pill are just the


---------75:14----------
guys like completely given up


---------75:17----------
okay so so red pillars don't try to get


---------75:20----------
women


---------75:22----------
i said they i said they do oh they do


---------75:24----------
and blue pills


---------75:26----------
do try to get women or don't try to get


---------75:27----------
women


---------75:32----------
i mean okay blue pill i say


---------75:35----------
um believing like this uh like courting


---------75:39----------
like courting stuff like you have to


---------75:42----------
like quote a woman like


---------75:44----------
take her out on like three dates before


---------75:46----------
like you can even


---------75:48----------
you know do stuff with her


---------75:51----------
yeah okay so so if you're in love you're


---------75:54----------
a blue pillar


---------75:55----------
and if you have one itis you're a red


---------75:56----------
pillar


---------76:00----------
i mean probably okay thanks for


---------76:04----------
clarifying i'm not i'm not i'm not the


---------76:06----------
most familiar with it


---------76:07----------
with the pills but i think that's very


---------76:09----------
general concepts


---------76:10----------
okay so it sounds like you're more


---------76:12----------
familiar with the pickup artist


---------76:13----------
scene


---------76:16----------
um yeah definitely okay so how did you


---------76:19----------
find


---------76:20----------
a coach


---------76:23----------
yeah definitely um that first one


---------76:26----------
definitely uh online


---------76:29----------
epis i taught me to go like coach by


---------76:33----------
coach


---------76:33----------
like i had seven like different coaches


---------76:36----------
yep so let's talk about the first one


---------76:39----------
what was how did you find them and what


---------76:41----------
did they teach you


---------76:47----------
okay well the first one uh believe it or


---------76:50----------
not


---------76:51----------
um that one was a girl


---------76:55----------
a girl dating coach uh the other six


---------76:57----------
weren't but


---------76:58----------
it's what she taught me like i mean


---------77:01----------
don't get me wrong like she was very


---------77:03----------
nice like she tried to help


---------77:05----------
oh yeah how i found i found her like


---------77:07----------
this kind of websites


---------77:09----------
it's like you submit your form and then


---------77:12----------
like don't get you wrong she was trying


---------77:14----------
to help what does that


---------77:16----------
mean i mean she was trying to help with


---------77:18----------
stuff she taught was like


---------77:19----------
like you know this is what a question is


---------77:21----------
this is what a statement is like


---------77:23----------
like stuff that's like everyone like


---------77:25----------
already knows


---------77:28----------
okay


---------77:30----------
trying to teach like like basically


---------77:33----------
common sense


---------77:34----------
like okay so it sounds like it wasn't


---------77:38----------
that helpful


---------77:40----------
i don't a second one


---------77:44----------
that basically um found the same way but


---------77:48----------
it was uh


---------77:49----------
basically like how's it


---------77:53----------
okay so the last one like it was like a


---------77:56----------
small company that had like different


---------77:57----------
dating coach they just assigned me to


---------77:59----------
one


---------77:59----------
dating coach the second one it was just


---------78:03----------
the guy owned his own website so it's


---------78:04----------
basically like justin


---------78:06----------
and what he did was that he made me keep


---------78:09----------
like this um


---------78:10----------
a journal to like record my interactions


---------78:14----------
then i would basically discuss it with


---------78:17----------
him


---------78:18----------
like on skype and actually take me


---------78:21----------
some pretty interesting advice to be


---------78:23----------
honest


---------78:24----------
can you give us an example of


---------78:25----------
interesting advice


---------78:29----------
i can recall one of them like uh


---------78:32----------
recalling like uh telling stories


---------78:34----------
like he gave me like this metaphor


---------78:37----------
of like a newspaper you've got like the


---------78:39----------
article the headline


---------78:42----------
like i like i basically um when i'm


---------78:46----------
talking to the girl like i you know i


---------78:48----------
say like


---------78:49----------
like the interesting line to like kind


---------78:52----------
of spark or interest i go into explain


---------78:53----------
it and the problem i just did


---------78:55----------
was i would just say oh hey i did this


---------78:57----------
and i did this


---------78:59----------
and basically i would only it would only


---------79:01----------
last like like two or three senses but


---------79:04----------
basically did it like you know we got


---------79:07----------
the


---------79:08----------
art article um you know to grab your


---------79:10----------
attention they got


---------79:12----------
you know actually telling like a real


---------79:13----------
story basically


---------79:16----------
okay okay the third one the third one


---------79:20----------
oh my god that one was the most


---------79:23----------
uh expensive one yeah


---------79:26----------
it was uh three thousand dollars for


---------79:29----------
that one it was a basically


---------79:30----------
a uh three month coaching program


---------79:34----------
and they did it like i did get


---------79:36----------
individual


---------79:37----------
individualized coaching uh by the main


---------79:41----------
coach


---------79:41----------
but it was also like in a group-like


---------79:43----------
setting


---------79:45----------
where like we interacted on this


---------79:47----------
platform with


---------79:48----------
actually all these other students like


---------79:51----------
doing the coaching program


---------79:54----------
and another interesting thing was that


---------79:55----------
we had these missions


---------79:57----------
where an example of mission would be it


---------79:59----------
could be related to getting women like


---------80:02----------
get a phone number from a girl or


---------80:06----------
um ask a girl to help


---------80:10----------
pick clothes for you or something uh go


---------80:13----------
on an incident with a girl is another


---------80:14----------
one


---------80:14----------
we also had like more confidence-based


---------80:16----------
ones such as


---------80:18----------
like breakdance in public


---------80:21----------
yes i was so i basically like asked


---------80:23----------
someone to record me like


---------80:24----------
break dancing in the mall i mean dude


---------80:30----------
yeah that's cool man


---------80:34----------
yeah i mean i mean it definitely did


---------80:36----------
help with confidence


---------80:38----------
i literally it was just like all of


---------80:40----------
these


---------80:42----------
i was really like that's [ __ ] awesome


---------80:43----------
bro you know how to break


---------80:45----------
it yeah


---------80:50----------
that's really cool anyway keep going so


---------80:52----------
this is the 30 000 of them


---------80:56----------
to help some with confidence yeah that


---------80:59----------
yeah that program cost me three thousand


---------81:01----------
dollars that was the most expensive one


---------81:03----------
i mean a lot of other things like advice


---------81:05----------
would just give out was honestly


---------81:07----------
stuff i already knew from youtube like


---------81:08----------
take cold showers


---------81:10----------
and stuff how does that help and


---------81:16----------
um i mean i guess it could like


---------81:19----------
strengthen your will a little


---------81:21----------
when i say well i don't mean like low


---------81:22----------
power but


---------81:24----------
just like enduring i guess it could be


---------81:26----------
like


---------81:28----------
similar to approaching like like it


---------81:30----------
could compare to like jumping in the


---------81:32----------
pool but also you have this


---------81:33----------
a thing where like we um


---------81:37----------
like you did like individualized


---------81:38----------
sessions but i also kind of had like


---------81:40----------
group online sessions like um like we


---------81:43----------
did a video chat on skype where


---------81:46----------
like there was a segment where like the


---------81:48----------
main coach actually brought his girl out


---------81:50----------
to interact with her


---------81:54----------
and yeah i would basically get like one


---------81:57----------
or two minutes on the timer to


---------81:59----------
like try to start a conversation with


---------82:03----------
her like talk to her


---------82:05----------
yeah basically more like observational


---------82:09----------
otherwise but what made me


---------82:13----------
like very mad though was that i was


---------82:16----------
literally on my last group session


---------82:20----------
and i i could barely even like hold a


---------82:23----------
conversation for like


---------82:24----------
10 seconds and the guy was like oh my


---------82:27----------
god


---------82:28----------
like you dude so awesome alex like did


---------82:31----------
so well and that was like literally


---------82:32----------
after like three months


---------82:35----------
like like i know it's i know


---------82:38----------
like i know he was like trying to be


---------82:40----------
nice to me and stuff but like he also


---------82:43----------
it just wasn't very honest you know


---------82:46----------
like i was still obviously struggling a


---------82:48----------
lot


---------82:51----------
and i know and the biggest thing i got


---------82:53----------
from that program is i


---------82:54----------
of course i gained a lot of confidence


---------82:55----------
but i kind of you know expected a lot


---------82:57----------
more


---------82:58----------
and then hold on a second what made you


---------83:01----------
i know that


---------83:06----------
i mean like feels like kind of


---------83:11----------
i mean like i literally it was like


---------83:14----------
my last my very last session like after


---------83:17----------
three months


---------83:20----------
like i like skill wise i didn't really


---------83:23----------
improve that much


---------83:24----------
and he and like he saw that like i could


---------83:28----------
like i was doing so pathetic like trying


---------83:30----------
to talk to


---------83:33----------
you know this girl on the video tracks


---------83:35----------
and


---------83:36----------
kiss girl


---------83:40----------
yeah to simulate the approach but like


---------83:42----------
he was it was like kind of like


---------83:45----------
like being fake you know like and and


---------83:48----------
after that's


---------83:49----------
like after the chat he was like trying


---------83:50----------
to like get me on a sale to pay


---------83:54----------
thousands of more dollars to continuous


---------83:56----------
coach and i was like no


---------83:59----------
how did that make you feel


---------84:02----------
yeah very mad what were you mad at


---------84:12----------
i kind of like i kind of like expecting


---------84:16----------
more you know


---------84:17----------
i think it's more than that


---------84:20----------
i think you felt like maybe you got


---------84:22----------
taken advantage of


---------84:28----------
it's interesting so if i can point


---------84:30----------
something out to you


---------84:32----------
this is the first time in an hour and


---------84:36----------
25 minutes or so that you've used


---------84:39----------
a word that describes an emotion


---------84:48----------
is that's true i maybe i missed one


---------84:50----------
earlier


---------84:52----------
but usually when i when i ask you about


---------84:54----------
emotions or when we talk about emotions


---------84:56----------
your answer is i don't know and then if


---------84:57----------
i help you out some you can you'll say


---------84:59----------
yeah that's what it feels like


---------85:00----------
but man like you i like go back and


---------85:03----------
watch the vod dude like you can see it


---------85:04----------
in your face


---------85:05----------
like something he said the next one


---------85:08----------
three thousand dollars like we knew


---------85:09----------
something was wrong and what you it


---------85:12----------
sounds like you


---------85:13----------
like he was trying to squeeze you for


---------85:15----------
more money is that what it felt like


---------85:18----------
like he's giving you all this false


---------85:19----------
praise and then be like oh yeah like


---------85:22----------
you're doing great like all you need


---------85:24----------
is three more months of coaching just a


---------85:27----------
few thousand dollars more and you're


---------85:28----------
going to get to where you want to go bro


---------85:31----------
you're on the right path


---------85:37----------
now alex you mind if i ask like so so


---------85:39----------
like when you worked with let's say the


---------85:41----------
fourth coach or the fifth


---------85:42----------
coach or the sixth coach or the seventh


---------85:44----------
coach did you ever tell them by the way


---------85:46----------
i've


---------85:46----------
worked with four coaches before and i


---------85:48----------
haven't really gotten anywhere


---------85:52----------
i i did and what how did they respond to


---------85:55----------
that


---------86:00----------
the one after the third coach he was


---------86:02----------
like yeah man i


---------86:04----------
am the real dude and and the guy after


---------86:07----------
that


---------86:08----------
it was like it was like okay yeah


---------86:12----------
um well that oh that's okay let's


---------86:16----------
and i guess they weren't like too


---------86:20----------
so as many of them weren't like too


---------86:24----------
surprised really to be honest


---------86:27----------
sorry i don't mean to laugh but if


---------86:29----------
they're not too surprised does that mean


---------86:31----------
that like


---------86:31----------
that happens a lot where like clients


---------86:34----------
come to them and say hey i've worked


---------86:36----------
with a bunch of coaches


---------86:38----------
and nothing has worked and they're like


---------86:39----------
no big deal man


---------86:42----------
i'm the real dude


---------86:46----------
i mean yeah yeah the next guy had a


---------86:48----------
really had an extremely big ego


---------86:53----------
okay sorry do you feel am i do you feel


---------86:55----------
like ashamed or anything if i laugh


---------86:59----------
dude no no not at all okay i'm just i'm


---------87:01----------
surprised by the absurdity of this whole


---------87:04----------
system which thank you very much by the


---------87:06----------
way for explaining some of the stuff and


---------87:08----------
shedding some light on it but i'm just


---------87:10----------
curious because it's like you know what


---------87:12----------
does the fifth dude say when you're like


---------87:13----------
hey i worked with four people


---------87:15----------
and he's like yeah give me that money


---------87:18----------
i'm different anyway sorry


---------87:23----------
okay so you were saying like so what was


---------87:25----------
yeah


---------87:26----------
i mean that was how all of them


---------87:28----------
responded like like some of them were


---------87:30----------
obviously a lot nicer than that


---------87:32----------
but that but but that reaction


---------87:34----------
definitely applied to the next one like


---------87:36----------
he was


---------87:38----------
like very awful how so what does that


---------87:41----------
mean


---------87:45----------
yeah you yeah dude that he was like very


---------87:47----------
like verbally


---------87:48----------
abusive and he would like get mad at you


---------87:50----------
like like over like the dumbest


---------87:53----------
like stuff like stuff that like doesn't


---------87:55----------
even matter and also


---------87:57----------
like i literally had like like three


---------88:01----------
sessions left and


---------88:03----------
and he was like we're done coaching and


---------88:05----------
he literally


---------88:07----------
just canceled our coaching without a


---------88:09----------
refund and why did he cancel our


---------88:11----------
coaching like he literally


---------88:12----------
like accused me of um interacting with


---------88:16----------
like a third party like i was like some


---------88:18----------
sort of


---------88:18----------
secret agent and um i actually i had a


---------88:21----------
coach who did


---------88:23----------
i had a coach later who did a coaching


---------88:25----------
strategy with him


---------88:26----------
he also like i did this product with him


---------88:29----------
so like he's known him


---------88:30----------
like he used to be best friends with him


---------88:32----------
but he was like yeah dude like


---------88:34----------
that guy is probably like that dude is


---------88:36----------
schizophrenic


---------88:38----------
like like he was like extremely the


---------88:41----------
fourth coach was just like extremely


---------88:43----------
insecure and paranoid and


---------88:51----------
i wonder what the qualifications to


---------88:53----------
become a dating co-chart


---------88:58----------
interesting okay yeah i'm sorry that


---------89:00----------
happened to you i mean


---------89:01----------
i really i mean yeah like really


---------89:04----------
obsessed me like to this day


---------89:07----------
what upsets you about it


---------89:14----------
well part of it is that he actually does


---------89:16----------
have a few like very good testimonials


---------89:19----------
and like i'd listen to them and


---------89:22----------
like it could like hear from the way


---------89:25----------
they come across like they've


---------89:26----------
like actually become like very good and


---------89:28----------
charismatic


---------89:31----------
and i've actually found out like months


---------89:33----------
after taking the coach


---------89:34----------
that there were other guys who had like


---------89:37----------
plenty of other guys there like


---------89:38----------
had the exact same experience as me


---------89:42----------
the gulf of reddit but yeah i just


---------89:50----------
like i just didn't know how to like like


---------89:52----------
deal like deal with it


---------89:53----------
to deal with him it doesn't sound like


---------89:56----------
many people do


---------89:58----------
sounds like a hard guy to deal with


---------90:01----------
maybe another one of those situations


---------90:03----------
where maybe he's got internal problems


---------90:05----------
that he's dealing with externally


---------90:06----------
by yelling at people who give him money


---------90:08----------
for coaching


---------90:16----------
so that was he was coach number five


---------90:18----------
ford


---------90:21----------
four what about five six and seven any


---------90:25----------
anything stand out there


---------90:31----------
number five i mean it was actually


---------90:33----------
generally a nice guy


---------90:36----------
i mean he wasn't surprised but not in


---------90:37----------
like my cocky way like yeah i am the


---------90:40----------
real dude


---------90:42----------
like um that guy


---------90:45----------
like i did like he did a coaching pay by


---------90:49----------
my month


---------90:52----------
so it wasn't like an entire like three


---------90:55----------
month package


---------90:57----------
and like like his style was like a lot


---------91:02----------
more um


---------91:03----------
technical stuff like he made me do like


---------91:05----------
a lot of writing


---------91:06----------
pretty nice dude but uh by the time the


---------91:09----------
summer hits


---------91:12----------
and i just um i couldn't afford it


---------91:15----------
anymore


---------91:16----------
and some time has passed i have found


---------91:18----------
this


---------91:20----------
other coach who uh yeah he was the one


---------91:24----------
who


---------91:24----------
actually did the coaching our tradex


---------91:27----------
with the other guy we did a program with


---------91:29----------
him it was like best friends with


---------91:32----------
the fourth guy and yeah he was


---------91:36----------
a pretty good dude


---------91:41----------
and i've also um another one like after


---------91:44----------
that


---------91:45----------
uh his main focus was on mindsets


---------91:49----------
and stuff it's also more um


---------91:53----------
it does individualize sessions but it


---------91:56----------
also kind of like doesn't like a group


---------91:57----------
based


---------91:58----------
uh cyanozole but without learning


---------92:04----------
so so alex let me ask you something if


---------92:07----------
someone is like


---------92:08----------
struggling to find so let's


---------92:11----------
you you have a fair amount of experience


---------92:13----------
how you feel


---------92:14----------
you okay i feel pretty good


---------92:18----------
okay okay i've been holding this i've


---------92:20----------
been holding this stapler


---------92:22----------
to the to the do you want to switch


---------92:24----------
hands


---------92:25----------
don't know i feel i think i feel okay


---------92:27----------
talk about willpower


---------92:29----------
hold the stapler in your headphone jack


---------92:30----------
for like an hour and a half


---------92:34----------
um so let me ask you a couple questions


---------92:37----------
so let's say like so you've been through


---------92:39----------
this stuff for a while so let's say that


---------92:41----------
i'm a 17 year old guy in high school


---------92:45----------
who feels like an alien amongst my peers


---------92:48----------
and doesn't know how to talk to girls


---------92:51----------
what would you recommend to me


---------92:56----------
yeah definitely uh focus on the inner


---------92:59----------
issues


---------93:01----------
like especially good place to look like


---------93:03----------
like in my situation was like what


---------93:04----------
happened to me in my


---------93:05----------
childhood like um


---------93:09----------
i'm confused so you're telling me that


---------93:11----------
that what we talked about like an


---------93:12----------
hour ago is like what you're gonna share


---------93:14----------
with them you're not gonna share with


---------93:16----------
them anything that you've learned from


---------93:17----------
like


---------93:17----------
seven dating coaches


---------93:21----------
are you just playing nice or do you


---------93:23----------
actually think that


---------93:26----------
i say that again so i'm confused because


---------93:29----------
like you you seem to be talking about


---------93:31----------
in my perception what we talked about


---------93:34----------
but do you actually think that that's


---------93:36----------
the answer i was expecting you to say


---------93:38----------
something relating to like


---------93:39----------
what you learned from like seven dating


---------93:41----------
coaches


---------93:42----------
but that's not the answer that i'm


---------93:44----------
hearing unless you learn that from them


---------93:45----------
as well


---------93:47----------
i was trying to like tell you like the


---------93:49----------
answer like what i learned from you


---------93:51----------
but do you think that that's the best


---------93:53----------
advice for the 17 year old not what


---------93:55----------
you've learned from the dating coaches


---------94:00----------
or your advice don't worry i mean i'm


---------94:02----------
don't pick the thing just because i said


---------94:03----------
it i'm genuinely curious like what would


---------94:05----------
you offer them


---------94:08----------
and if it is look at yourself then


---------94:10----------
that's cool


---------94:13----------
i mean it's not just look at yourself


---------94:15----------
like i just


---------94:17----------
yeah okay so what i learned from the


---------94:19----------
seven gaming coaches


---------94:21----------
is like yeah definitely like be very


---------94:23----------
careful for like what you pay for


---------94:27----------
like i'd say um like a few stuff out


---------94:29----------
there is honestly pretty valuable


---------94:32----------
like one of them uh was like free


---------94:34----------
association like it had


---------94:36----------
helps you like practice your verbal


---------94:38----------
skills and stuff


---------94:42----------
i'm just saying like don't yeah i get


---------94:45----------
definitely like what you taught me


---------94:48----------
like an hour ago like definitely do that


---------94:50----------
first


---------94:51----------
but yeah you can also like yeah do the


---------94:54----------
other things i learned from day coach


---------94:55----------
like


---------94:55----------
yeah the free association stuff


---------94:59----------
i mean yeah they're i mean few obvious


---------95:02----------
things like they taught like you know


---------95:04----------
dress well


---------95:08----------
yeah so so it seems like there are there


---------95:10----------
are some practical things that you'd


---------95:11----------
share with them


---------95:13----------
yeah yeah definitely like there's yeah


---------95:16----------
definitely


---------95:16----------
some practical things but also like


---------95:19----------
obviously the mental stuff


---------95:21----------
yeah cool man


---------95:24----------
um anything that we sort of didn't


---------95:28----------
cover today that you wanted to talk


---------95:29----------
about or


---------95:31----------
any questions for me


---------95:36----------
any questions for you


---------95:41----------
i don't know well i got like


---------95:45----------
it's yeah i mean i'm not trying to


---------95:48----------
artificially shut things down i just


---------95:49----------
want to make sure that


---------95:50----------
we do have time because i i know i've


---------95:52----------
kind of been steering


---------95:54----------
and i want to give you a chance if you


---------95:56----------
do want to share anything


---------95:58----------
i'm getting the sense that's sort of


---------96:00----------
like talking about the remainders of the


---------96:01----------
details of the dating coaches feels kind


---------96:03----------
of redundant to me


---------96:04----------
is there something from those that you


---------96:06----------
want to share


---------96:09----------
like i mean like can you like be more


---------96:11----------
specific though


---------96:12----------
yeah so so um you know i'm


---------96:16----------
i'm let me put it this way like it


---------96:17----------
sounds like there are a couple of


---------96:19----------
important experiences but i felt like we


---------96:20----------
sort of got those from you


---------96:22----------
in terms of dating coaching is there


---------96:24----------
something else that you feel like is


---------96:26----------
important to share or lessons that you


---------96:28----------
learn from dating coaching


---------96:34----------
okay let me think oh yeah oh yeah


---------96:38----------
definitely


---------96:38----------
one of them is uh know what you want


---------96:42----------
okay like it could be like a bunch of


---------96:45----------
things like


---------96:46----------
you want a relationship do you


---------96:48----------
throughout the month


---------96:49----------
just want to um


---------96:53----------
like gain some experience at first and


---------96:54----------
uh don't be afraid to uh communicate


---------96:56----------
that


---------96:58----------
and another thing i guess about mindset


---------97:01----------
is um


---------97:02----------
like do not uh seek for your approval


---------97:09----------
and um


---------97:13----------
it's pretty good stuff don't be uh also


---------97:16----------
don't be outcome dependents agree with


---------97:20----------
all three of those things


---------97:22----------
but but i have a slightly different


---------97:24----------
twist on them can i share that with you


---------97:25----------
alex


---------97:27----------
all right so like the first thing is if


---------97:30----------
we're talking about not being outcome


---------97:32----------
dependent


---------97:35----------
that sort of clashes with the idea of


---------97:37----------
like getting laid in the approach


---------97:40----------
right because it's all about outcomes


---------97:42----------
you're targeting you're not sitting with


---------97:44----------
another human being and just seeing like


---------97:45----------
where this goes


---------97:47----------
it's like i'mma try to get laid that's


---------97:49----------
an outcome


---------97:52----------
does that make sense it is so so i i


---------97:55----------
think there's some


---------97:56----------
i hear that's okay um


---------97:59----------
there's something really i think uh


---------98:03----------
i think you're closing yourself off by


---------98:05----------
like


---------98:06----------
approaching 300 women instead of just


---------98:10----------
like


---------98:10----------
being you and i think that that's scary


---------98:12----------
to you because like


---------98:14----------
you learned a long time ago that being


---------98:16----------
you is not something that's


---------98:18----------
that people like you can switch hands


---------98:20----------
you can let go of the stapler and just


---------98:22----------
mute yourself if you want is that easier


---------98:24----------
and take a break i want you to hand


---------98:26----------
cramp


---------98:28----------
okay i'm doing a different way now feels


---------98:29----------
good okay okay


---------98:32----------
but i i mean if if i had to give you


---------98:34----------
some kind of advice alex which i try to


---------98:36----------
avoid


---------98:37----------
at all costs um it would say just like


---------98:40----------
just


---------98:41----------
be with people like don't worry so much


---------98:43----------
about like the dating and stuff like


---------98:44----------
that


---------98:45----------
unless you have one itis in which case


---------98:47----------
i'd say go for it bro


---------98:49----------
and honestly like like i


---------98:53----------
i know i mean i i know that one is can


---------98:56----------
get you into trouble and i do think that


---------98:57----------
there's a lot to be said for sort of


---------99:00----------
because you said that you didn't


---------99:01----------
interact with this girl much but we can


---------99:03----------
sort of form


---------99:04----------
fantasies of people in our mind


---------99:08----------
and i do think that that's a problem


---------99:11----------
right


---------99:11----------
that's not actually who the person is


---------99:14----------
it's just the fantasy that you build in


---------99:16----------
your mind


---------99:17----------
and i think it's really interesting how


---------99:19----------
quickly that happens and how hard it is


---------99:21----------
to realize that this is not a real


---------99:23----------
person that i'm falling in love with


---------99:25----------
this is my idea of a person she would be


---------99:28----------
like this and it would be like this


---------99:30----------
and it would be like this but at the


---------99:33----------
same time bro


---------99:34----------
don't give up on love because like


---------99:38----------
i mean you know i think if you look at


---------99:40----------
stories throughout the history of


---------99:41----------
humanity


---------99:42----------
like one itis is pretty [ __ ] epic man


---------99:46----------
do i think it's damaging do i think


---------99:48----------
people get obsessive is it problematic


---------99:50----------
does it help you not grow absolutely


---------99:54----------
i don't think that you should sacrifice


---------99:57----------
yourself


---------99:58----------
for the sake of someone that you have


---------100:00----------
one itis for


---------100:02----------
and at the same time like don't give up


---------100:04----------
man


---------100:05----------
i'd say with this particular girl if you


---------100:07----------
run across her again and like


---------100:09----------
try to have a conversation with her and


---------100:10----------
like maybe ask her out


---------100:12----------
i'm not trying to like throw you back


---------100:14----------
into the throes of juanitas but


---------100:17----------
you know if if life gives you a chance


---------100:19----------
i'd say take a shot man


---------100:22----------
and in the meantime just try to be human


---------100:24----------
i don't think


---------100:25----------
i i i recognize that you have a feeling


---------100:28----------
inside you that


---------100:29----------
you are an alien amongst humans i don't


---------100:31----------
think you're as much of an alien as you


---------100:33----------
you feel you are deep down inside i know


---------100:37----------
you


---------100:37----------
know you're not but that feeling is


---------100:39----------
there and recognize that that's just a


---------100:40----------
feeling


---------100:41----------
it's like a hold over it's a scar


---------100:44----------
from what happened to you when you were


---------100:47----------
younger and we have scars from the past


---------100:49----------
but they're not


---------100:50----------
actually like the same wounds right they


---------100:52----------
heal and they leave a mark but like


---------100:54----------
you're actually a pretty cool guy


---------100:56----------
and it's like i mean you're just kind of


---------100:58----------
a chat if you know how to break dance


---------101:00----------
and you've got eight thousand dollars


---------101:01----------
lying around for dating coaching like i


---------101:02----------
think you're actually in a pretty good


---------101:04----------
spot


---------101:07----------
you know and so the last thing that i'd


---------101:09----------
say alex is like like


---------101:11----------
give people the gift of who you are


---------101:16----------
let them get to know you and


---------101:19----------
and if they don't like what they see


---------101:21----------
that's that's up to them


---------101:24----------
but right now what i see is that you try


---------101:26----------
to be someone that you're not


---------101:28----------
you try to advertise yourself as is


---------101:30----------
someone that you're not


---------101:33----------
you try to advertise yourself based on


---------101:36----------
what a lot of other people have told you


---------101:37----------
hey here's how you advertise yourself


---------101:40----------
but here's the thing about this whole


---------101:41----------
like pickup artist methodology


---------101:44----------
when you try something on 300 women it


---------101:46----------
doesn't work


---------101:47----------
i'm really confused as a scientist how


---------101:50----------
you think that's an effective method


---------101:53----------
right and if all of these people are


---------101:55----------
saying hey you got to do this with a


---------101:57----------
thousand women before you get the hang


---------101:58----------
of it like what


---------102:00----------
maybe you're doing it wrong you know


---------102:02----------
it's like


---------102:04----------
hey man like you gotta cook like a


---------102:07----------
thousand


---------102:08----------
bowls of pasta before it's out of it's


---------102:10----------
like hold on a second man


---------102:14----------
maybe you should try cooking it in water


---------102:16----------
instead of sticking gets straight into a


---------102:17----------
dry pot like maybe you're doing


---------102:18----------
something wrong


---------102:21----------
and what i found works alex


---------102:24----------
and and maybe this is arrogant for me to


---------102:26----------
say is just be yourself


---------102:28----------
and then like let them decide right like


---------102:31----------
because


---------102:32----------
women are the deciders in the sexual


---------102:33----------
marketplace


---------102:35----------
so advertise your wares and let them


---------102:37----------
pick don't be someone that you're not


---------102:38----------
and don't try to be something that


---------102:40----------
you think you should be


---------102:43----------
like if you want to grow as a human


---------102:44----------
being grow as a human being and and like


---------102:46----------
the


---------102:47----------
women who are interested in that will


---------102:48----------
show up and those are probably the ones


---------102:50----------
that you want you don't want a relation


---------102:51----------
uh


---------102:52----------
this also presumes that you want a


---------102:53----------
relationship but i think relationships


---------102:55----------
built on false pretenses don't end up


---------102:58----------
well


---------102:59----------
you've shown me enough that that makes


---------103:01----------
me think that there's something there


---------103:02----------
that's like


---------103:03----------
worth you know something within you


---------103:06----------
that's worth something i think there's


---------103:07----------
gold


---------103:08----------
there's like gold on the outside


---------103:11----------
lead in the middle and then gold


---------103:13----------
underneath


---------103:15----------
and so just get to that part like just


---------103:17----------
be who you are man because you seem like


---------103:18----------
a resilient


---------103:20----------
driven you know like thoughtful guy


---------103:24----------
who knows how to break dance and has a


---------103:27----------
pretty sweet place


---------103:29----------
your place looks pretty cool man oh


---------103:32----------
thanks man


---------103:34----------
any last thoughts or questions before we


---------103:36----------
wrap up or switch to meditation


---------103:42----------
um no questions but yeah i definitely


---------103:44----------
would like to thank you uh for the help


---------103:46----------
sure when do i get my chat yeah i


---------103:50----------

---------103:54----------

---------103:56----------
this service


---------103:59----------

---------104:03----------
found it useful


---------104:05----------
um do you do you feel like meditating


---------104:10----------
um sure okay do you have any experience


---------104:13----------
with meditation


---------104:16----------
i mean i do it like like an hour over an


---------104:19----------
hour a day


---------104:20----------
oh wow do you want to tell us what you


---------104:23----------
do


---------104:24----------
look at this chad thundercock right here


---------104:30----------
like what i do with a meditation yeah


---------104:34----------
you want to teach us


---------104:39----------
yeah basically what i do is i like um


---------104:41----------
first i uh


---------104:42----------
observe my thoughts for like uh 40


---------104:45----------
minutes and then i go into like


---------104:48----------
a uh like a visualization related


---------104:52----------
practice


---------104:53----------
and also some days like like after i do


---------104:56----------
that meditation


---------104:58----------
i go um do this other


---------105:02----------
like hypnosis related thing


---------105:06----------
right before bed okay


---------105:13----------
let me think about what i want to teach


---------105:15----------
you so basically what my focus is is i


---------105:17----------
i really just do it to like help gain


---------105:19----------
more reports like


---------105:20----------
my subconscious mind


---------105:25----------
would okay what does that mean rapport


---------105:27----------
with your subconscious mind


---------105:31----------
[Music]


---------105:33----------
and i don't really meditate like just


---------105:35----------
like stop thinking just like


---------105:37----------
just like become more aware of like


---------105:41----------
fewer parts of yourself like you get a


---------105:42----------
thought like like you just watch it like


---------105:44----------
i've also


---------105:45----------
also like listened to a lot of like uh


---------105:47----------
eckhart tolle


---------105:49----------
that cartel was good yep so yeah


---------105:53----------
stuff like that okay so let me think


---------105:55----------
about what do we want to teach you


---------106:02----------
okay let me ask you a question so i see


---------106:03----------
that you have a mirror


---------106:06----------
in by your bed do you have a portable


---------106:10----------
mirror


---------106:12----------
okay so i i've got a good idea so for


---------106:14----------
those of y'all at home if you guys have


---------106:17----------
a phone a camera or a mirror


---------106:21----------
so you you see my face


---------106:24----------
right uh


---------106:28----------
alex you see my face oh yeah yeah okay


---------106:31----------
so this is what i want you to do okay so


---------106:34----------
i want you guys to get your phone ready


---------106:35----------
what we're gonna do is just look at


---------106:36----------
ourselves


---------106:38----------
and just watch what happens when you see


---------106:40----------
yourself


---------106:42----------
okay so i want you to look for i'm going


---------106:45----------
to ask you


---------106:46----------
in a second do you see a big version of


---------106:48----------
yourself don't do it yet


---------106:50----------
so what i want you to notice alex is


---------106:53----------
that there's going to be


---------106:55----------
a reaction and just try to find it


---------106:58----------
so now make yourself bigger can you do


---------107:01----------
that can you see yourself


---------107:03----------
i can like see my face yeah so so like


---------107:06----------
make like maximize it


---------107:09----------
or like you know look in a cell phone


---------107:10----------
camera or something like yeah right


---------107:12----------
and maximize the screen yeah so can you


---------107:15----------
see like a big version of your face


---------107:18----------
yeah speaker okay so just look at it


---------107:22----------
and tell me what you see


---------107:25----------
you don't have to tell me just just


---------107:26----------
notice what you see


---------107:28----------
i try to find that cringe when you look


---------107:30----------
at yourself


---------107:34----------
and notice okay so just notice that


---------107:40----------
where does that come from


---------107:46----------
you don't have to answer just notice


---------107:47----------
within yourself where does this arise


---------107:51----------
so what literally you're doing is your


---------107:53----------
eyes are just seeing a picture of a


---------107:55----------
person


---------107:58----------
that's all that it is there's no cringe


---------108:04----------
so now what i want you to do is notice


---------108:06----------
the physical form


---------108:08----------
and try to separate the physical form


---------108:11----------
from


---------108:12----------
your judgment


---------108:18----------
there's eyes there's a nose there's


---------108:20----------
headphones


---------108:22----------
there's a blue shirt a hoodie


---------108:27----------
that's what you see but your mind


---------108:30----------
adds something on to that there's a


---------108:32----------
reaction


---------108:34----------
to the physical form that you see does


---------108:36----------
that make sense


---------108:39----------
where does that reaction come from


---------108:52----------
do you have any idea you can answer if


---------108:55----------
you have a sense


---------109:10----------
where does the feeling of cringe come


---------109:12----------
from


---------109:21----------
and i kind of like feel it's um like


---------109:24----------
bubbling up from like


---------109:25----------
somewhere else yep that makes any sense


---------109:28----------
it makes a lot of sense


---------109:30----------
so try to track it to its source where


---------109:32----------
do you feel it bubbling up from


---------109:42----------
close your eyes


---------109:49----------
where is that sense coming from


---------110:15----------
all right you said all right


---------110:19----------
what did you notice


---------110:26----------
like i like kind of like became the


---------110:27----------
observer then


---------110:30----------
like i like i noticed like the uh


---------110:32----------
thought


---------110:33----------
form or like the feeling just like


---------110:34----------
appearing there i like watch it


---------110:37----------
so where does it appear from


---------110:44----------
i'm not sure like answer that like just


---------110:46----------
like i don't know where


---------110:48----------
good does it come from somewhere


---------110:59----------
i'm not sure okay good


---------111:02----------
okay alex open your


---------111:06----------
eyes take away number one


---------111:10----------
can you see me come back


---------111:13----------
okay so take away number one


---------111:17----------
first thing that you've got to


---------111:18----------
understand the feeling of cringe


---------111:21----------
does not come from your appearance it


---------111:24----------
doesn't come


---------111:25----------
from the thing that you see does that


---------111:27----------
make sense


---------111:30----------
yes ergo this is something i want you to


---------111:34----------
understand because i don't think you


---------111:35----------
really get this yet you have to feel it


---------111:37----------
in the moment


---------111:38----------
when someone sees you they don't get


---------111:41----------
something that bubbles up


---------111:44----------
the bubbling up is coming from you it's


---------111:46----------
not coming from your face


---------111:47----------
it's not an objective fact it's a


---------111:49----------
subjective feeling


---------111:54----------
once you understand this it's going to


---------111:55----------
transform your interactions with women


---------111:58----------
and other people they can't see


---------112:02----------
they can't feel the cringe


---------112:05----------
because it bubbles up from somewhere


---------112:07----------
else that they can't they literally


---------112:09----------
cannot see


---------112:09----------
it does not come from your indriyas or


---------112:11----------
your sense organs


---------112:13----------
it doesn't come from your eyes


---------112:16----------
it comes from somewhere within you


---------112:20----------
so like what you show them


---------112:23----------
is what they'll react to and then the


---------112:27----------
second thing is does it come from


---------112:28----------
anywhere at all does it truly have a


---------112:30----------
foundation


---------112:32----------
that's the second question that you need


---------112:33----------
to answer


---------112:35----------
if you can find a foundation then you


---------112:37----------
can work on it


---------112:39----------
more bizarrely if it comes from nowhere


---------112:43----------
and is sort of completely random and is


---------112:45----------
basically an


---------112:46----------
echo in your mind


---------112:50----------
of a time long past why do you let it


---------112:53----------
inform


---------112:54----------
your identity of who you are today


---------113:01----------
so either it comes from somewhere or it


---------113:03----------
doesn't these are the questions that you


---------113:05----------
need to answer


---------113:07----------
and if you do i think i think your luck


---------113:09----------
with women will change


---------113:13----------
oh definitely okay


---------113:16----------
good luck man thanks for thanks for


---------113:18----------
holding the uh


---------113:19----------
the staple for so long


---------113:22----------
oh yeah thanks thank you for uh like all


---------113:25----------
the advice


---------113:26----------
yeah man good luck seriously man i wish


---------113:29----------
you all the best


---------113:31----------
all right bye bye


---------113:42----------
