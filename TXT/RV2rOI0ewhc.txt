you know like healthy gamer is new and


---------00:02----------
it's like did


---------00:03----------
was this going to work like how on earth


---------00:05----------
would we think that this would be


---------00:06----------
successful


---------00:07----------
we wouldn't think this would be


---------00:08----------
successful it was done before


---------00:10----------
and yet we did it anyway and that's how


---------00:12----------
we started and that's what we do now


---------00:14----------
like that's where our coaching program


---------00:15----------
comes from i started streaming on twitch


---------00:17----------
and i was like okay this is what needs


---------00:18----------
to


---------00:19----------
we need to try this then people were


---------00:21----------
like dr k help me dr k


---------00:22----------
help me dr chao and i was like oh [ __ ] a


---------00:25----------
lot of people to help


---------00:26----------
can't do them all myself can i train


---------00:27----------
other people so let's try is it going to


---------00:29----------
work we don't know


---------00:31----------
let's try and so that's what we did


---------00:36----------
and then like we started off with mostly


---------00:38----------
individual coaching


---------00:40----------
and then what we realized is that like


---------00:42----------
there are


---------00:43----------
shared issues that people struggle with


---------00:46----------
and these are things like


---------00:48----------
you know people like feeling awkward and


---------00:51----------
lacking purpose and being lonely


---------00:54----------
and like not having someone to share


---------00:55----------
those feelings with and work through


---------00:57----------
those problems with


---------00:58----------
they don't have someone to help and


---------01:01----------
that's where group coaching comes in so


---------01:02----------
then we evolved group coaching


---------01:05----------
and so group coaching is about you know


---------01:07----------
personal coaching i think is really good


---------01:09----------
for people who have like a particular


---------01:10----------
issue that's very specific to them


---------01:13----------
but generally speaking what we find in


---------01:14----------
group coaching is that the issues that


---------01:16----------
you think are super specific to you are


---------01:18----------
actually shared by a whole bunch of


---------01:19----------
other people


---------01:20----------
and let's think about that because if


---------01:22----------
that wasn't true this stream would be


---------01:23----------
nowhere if this


---------01:24----------
if the people that i interviewed did not


---------01:26----------
resonate with all of our audience


---------01:29----------
the stream would be nowhere why do you


---------01:31----------
guys watch because you connect with the


---------01:32----------
person that we talk to


---------01:35----------
and the problems that you share you


---------01:37----------
don't have to fight those battles on


---------01:39----------
your own


---------01:40----------
that's why we started groups groups are


---------01:42----------
tricky they take a while to start


---------01:44----------
people are confused about how to do them


---------01:48----------
but their outcomes are very good


---------01:52----------
and they like groups kind of gain


---------01:53----------
momentum over time


---------01:55----------
right like you don't know like what in


---------01:57----------
what way you need to improve


---------01:59----------
a lot of areas of your life that need to


---------02:01----------
improve and then like other people are


---------02:03----------
gonna be the same way they're like i


---------02:04----------
don't know where to start


---------02:06----------
right like i'm i i'm not in a romantic


---------02:08----------
relationship i don't have a good job


---------02:11----------
i'm not doing well in my classes and


---------02:14----------
then like


---------02:15----------
those people help you and remember that


---------02:17----------
the real value of healthy gamer


---------02:20----------
is that it's easier to see


---------02:23----------
in someone else your problems


---------02:27----------
it's easy to look at them objectively


---------02:29----------
because when you look at someone else


---------02:30----------
with anxiety


---------02:31----------
it's like way easier to understand it


---------02:33----------
because you're not experiencing it in


---------02:35----------
that moment


---------02:36----------
so the real way that growth happens in


---------02:37----------
group is actually by


---------02:39----------
when i share an experience i benefit


---------02:42----------
some from it but then everyone else


---------02:44----------
actually benefits more


---------02:45----------
and then they share their version and


---------02:48----------
then i benefit from that and then like


---------02:49----------
what happens is each person


---------02:51----------
brings one piece of the puzzle to the


---------02:53----------
table and with a dozen of you all or 10


---------02:55----------
or all or 80 all you'll put


---------02:57----------
you'll put those puzzle pieces together


---------03:01----------
and then it's cool it's great


---------03:08----------
all right you looking good feeling good


---------03:12----------
uh-huh let's get started cool okay


---------03:16----------
don't mind if i do


---------03:20----------
um yeah so anita have you been i've been


---------03:23----------
all right yeah


---------03:24----------
busy busy busy but getting more sleep


---------03:26----------
and taking a little bit more care of


---------03:27----------
myself than i used to


---------03:28----------
so that's great i'm really happy to hear


---------03:30----------
that seriously i i think you deserve to


---------03:32----------
take care of yourself


---------03:34----------
you deserve to be cared for by yourself


---------03:37----------
and um are you wearing a hat that says


---------03:41----------
simp


---------03:42----------
yeah can you tell me about that


---------03:47----------
all right so um i


---------03:50----------
i me and uh stream elements we we


---------03:53----------
designed merch


---------03:54----------
and i was thinking to myself uh what


---------03:56----------
would be really relatable


---------03:58----------
and very appropriate for my chat and


---------04:00----------
this is how the hat happened and i just


---------04:02----------
happen to like it and i just wear it day


---------04:04----------
to day


---------04:04----------
i i i actually really love my sit pad


---------04:08----------
so yeah that's the full story i think


---------04:11----------
it's uh


---------04:11----------
it's a good way um okay so i guess i can


---------04:14----------
share this story hopefully it's not


---------04:15----------
identifiable


---------04:16----------
and if the person that i'm talking to


---------04:18----------
yeah there's no way that people are


---------04:19----------
gonna so i was talking to someone who is


---------04:21----------
yesterday i was working with someone who


---------04:24----------
was a little bit concerned about


---------04:26----------
um their hair


---------04:29----------
uh because they're kind of going bald


---------04:31----------
and the problem is


---------04:34----------
you're going bald yeah i'm losing my


---------04:36----------
hair


---------04:37----------
that's scary yeah uh it's impossible to


---------04:41----------
find out why kids are covered because


---------04:43----------
there


---------04:43----------
are like doctors and everything are


---------04:45----------
really they've got their hands full


---------04:47----------
so i guess i'll find out sometime


---------04:50----------
threw me for a loop there but let me


---------04:51----------
just finish my story real quick and then


---------04:53----------
you know we can talk about that if you


---------04:54----------
want to but um so they were feeling like


---------04:56----------
pretty anxious because they're losing


---------04:58----------
their hair and


---------04:59----------
and what what they said is that you know


---------05:02----------
like they're prominent


---------05:03----------
in like the streaming esports world


---------05:06----------
and so they can't show up one day like


---------05:07----------
even if they wanted to get a piece like


---------05:09----------
a wig like they couldn't


---------05:10----------
get one right and so


---------05:14----------
i what i suggested to them is that they


---------05:16----------
should just


---------05:17----------
show up one day with one and then in the


---------05:20----------
middle of like an interview or something


---------05:22----------
just take it off


---------05:23----------
adjust it and then just put it right


---------05:24----------
back on and just let the whole world


---------05:26----------
know that you


---------05:27----------
wear a wig but anyway we'll see if they


---------05:30----------
ever do that


---------05:32----------
um yeah i feel like owning it takes the


---------05:34----------
power out of it and nobody's committing


---------05:36----------
a crime by losing a little bit of hair


---------05:38----------
as well i think that streaming is about


---------05:40----------
being relatable and


---------05:42----------
being company to people who feel a bit


---------05:43----------
alone and there are probably plenty of


---------05:45----------
people who watch that person who are


---------05:47----------
also losing their hair


---------05:48----------
so i don't think it's gonna work against


---------05:49----------
them and i don't know why they'd be so


---------05:51----------
afraid


---------05:52----------
yeah so i mean it's a good question


---------05:55----------
right why are people afraid


---------05:57----------
and if we think about it so if we


---------06:01----------
well this is gonna get yeah let me know


---------06:05----------
if this


---------06:06----------
moves too fast for you okay anita it's


---------06:08----------
fine go for it


---------06:09----------
so i mean i'm a little bit curious so


---------06:12----------
especially being a woman i can imagine


---------06:14----------
it can feel


---------06:15----------
very distressing if you're


---------06:18----------
losing your hair


---------06:22----------
ah there's always wigs i'll be okay um


---------06:25----------
but the thing is like i know chat


---------06:28----------
latches on to you absolutely anything


---------06:31----------
um so it's not really something i want


---------06:33----------
people to get distracted by


---------06:35----------
and that's really my own concern with it


---------06:37----------
i don't have a partner i don't have


---------06:39----------
anyone around me i'm alone like 99 of my


---------06:43----------
my day


---------06:44----------
so it's not like anyone's going to


---------06:45----------
bother and i don't really look in the


---------06:46----------
mirror much so it's not something that


---------06:48----------
really scares me


---------06:50----------
um so for now i just try to make sure


---------06:52----------
people don't get distracted by it so


---------06:54----------
that


---------06:54----------
we can focus on the content really


---------06:56----------
rather than my body because people try


---------06:58----------
to focus on my body a lot during


---------07:00----------
streaming


---------07:00----------
people take clips of my ass and stuff so


---------07:03----------
like i


---------07:04----------
just try to keep people's attention on


---------07:05----------
the on the topic rather than me


---------07:08----------
um and that's the only reason why i take


---------07:10----------
any measures to really hide it


---------07:14----------
interesting um yeah i think you do a


---------07:17----------
really good job of like owning things


---------07:19----------
and making them


---------07:20----------
more acceptable to people who are


---------07:22----------
ashamed about them


---------07:24----------
uh i think that's actually one of the


---------07:25----------
really awesome things that you bring to


---------07:27----------
twitch


---------07:27----------
into this community i'm curious what


---------07:30----------
does it feel like to have people


---------07:31----------
kind of be focusing on your body and


---------07:33----------
taking clips of your ass and things like


---------07:35----------
that


---------07:36----------
i've experienced it my whole life my


---------07:38----------
whole life has basically been a struggle


---------07:40----------
to make friends with people who were


---------07:41----------
just trying to depth test me


---------07:43----------
and like seeing dying friendships


---------07:45----------
because


---------07:46----------
i see more and more signs that someone's


---------07:47----------
into me and i try to show signs that i'm


---------07:50----------
not interested back and they don't see


---------07:51----------
them because they have a bias because


---------07:53----------
they want something for me


---------07:54----------
and so chat is just making is just


---------07:56----------
another way that i relive that exact


---------07:59----------
same struggle where i'm trying to hold a


---------08:00----------
conversation about everything else and


---------08:02----------
it keeps falling back to their desire to


---------08:04----------
get their willy wet


---------08:05----------
and so i'm so used to navigating it that


---------08:07----------
i just poke humor at it now and use it


---------08:09----------
as content because i can't make it go


---------08:11----------
away i can't control how other people


---------08:13----------
feel


---------08:13----------
how they behave so in any way if i can't


---------08:16----------
control the situation or change it for


---------08:18----------
the better


---------08:18----------
i try to change its effect on me and


---------08:20----------
others and so the way i've been managing


---------08:23----------
it


---------08:23----------
is just to poke humor at it and make it


---------08:25----------
a reason for people to smile and laugh


---------08:27----------
in various ways and that's the only


---------08:28----------
thing i can really think to do about it


---------08:32----------
sounds very mature um


---------08:36----------
you know to approach it that way i'm


---------08:38----------
surprised you say so


---------08:40----------
because poking fun at people for being


---------08:42----------
attracted to me doesn't sound like an


---------08:43----------
initially like a mature premise


---------08:46----------
for any kind of content but yeah i guess


---------08:49----------
i agree with you that poking fun it


---------08:52----------
doesn't sound like that but that's why


---------08:53----------
when we dig into actually what you're


---------08:55----------
doing that does sound mature to me


---------08:58----------
right so like sort of saying hey there's


---------08:59----------
something about the world that i can't


---------09:01----------
change and people are going to be people


---------09:03----------
so i'm going to do my best to kind of


---------09:04----------
focus on what i think is important and


---------09:06----------
steer people in the right direction and


---------09:09----------
if people want to


---------09:10----------
you know focus on something physical i


---------09:12----------
can kind of just poke fun at it


---------09:14----------
and then kind of focus on what's


---------09:16----------
important that sounds pretty mature to


---------09:17----------
me


---------09:18----------
thank you i mean i think surreptitiously


---------09:21----------
i poke fun at it as well


---------09:23----------
to show people who are very


---------09:24----------
inexperienced in talking to people


---------09:26----------
they're attracted to that this doesn't


---------09:27----------
work


---------09:28----------
um i try to use like gamer-based


---------09:31----------
analogies to show people that


---------09:32----------
certain things are not okay or not fun


---------09:35----------
and not cool


---------09:36----------
like pickup lines i describe them as


---------09:38----------
when people think there are cheat codes


---------09:40----------
into women's pants that you can just say


---------09:41----------
a generic sentence


---------09:43----------
and you'll be able to sleep with someone


---------09:45----------
and that's not how people work because


---------09:46----------
they're individuals and stuff


---------09:48----------
and that when you try to use a cheat


---------09:49----------
code to get in someone's pants


---------09:51----------
you're basically saying i'm lonely and i


---------09:53----------
want to [ __ ] it's not about you


---------09:54----------
if it was about you i'd say something


---------09:56----------
specific to you that's to do with you


---------09:58----------
but i'll just say this generic thing and


---------10:00----------
hope that your panties fall off sort of


---------10:02----------
thing


---------10:02----------
and these sort of descriptions help me


---------10:04----------
to describe to people how not to hit on


---------10:06----------
people so that maybe one day they'll


---------10:08----------
successfully connect


---------10:10----------
um so i kind of seen it as an


---------10:11----------
opportunity to help people figure out


---------10:13----------
what doesn't work


---------10:14----------
so that they can lean towards what does


---------10:17----------
i need to is there


---------10:18----------
i thought i detected a note of anger


---------10:20----------
there


---------10:23----------
oh yeah i mean there's a a huge


---------10:25----------
undercurrent of frustration i want to


---------10:27----------
connect with people long term i want to


---------10:28----------
have friends i want to have


---------10:30----------
you know really fun interactions and


---------10:32----------
there's this barrage of lonely dicks


---------10:34----------
between me and all the people that are


---------10:35----------
worth hanging out with the people who


---------10:37----------
aren't trying to [ __ ] me


---------10:38----------
it happens everywhere i go and


---------10:39----------
everything i do like i've gone to social


---------10:41----------
clubs and all sorts trying to make


---------10:42----------
friends because i was desperately lonely


---------10:45----------
and then like two or three men will


---------10:46----------
latch on to me and try to talk to me


---------10:48----------
like interview me for a role in their


---------10:50----------
life i do not


---------10:50----------
[ __ ] want and they just won't leave


---------10:53----------
me alone i'll try to ditch them and go


---------10:54----------
to the bathroom i'll come out there


---------10:55----------
waiting for me


---------10:56----------
and whilst everyone else sees that i'm


---------10:58----------
talking to people they don't feel


---------10:59----------
comfortable talking


---------11:00----------
to me so all the people who don't want


---------11:01----------
to [ __ ] me don't get around to talking


---------11:02----------
to me and i'm just stuck with these


---------11:04----------
people who i know


---------11:05----------
i'm gonna disappoint and there's no


---------11:07----------
friendship there because


---------11:08----------
they're just waiting to see if i'll [ __ ]


---------11:10----------
them and i've tried so hard to make


---------11:12----------
friends with people who are attracted to


---------11:13----------
me


---------11:14----------
and been like oh make a good thing out


---------11:15----------
of this and it doesn't work out because


---------11:17----------
they get more disappointed and


---------11:18----------
uncomfortable


---------11:19----------
and it becomes too painful for them to


---------11:21----------
hang out with me so i have been lonely


---------11:23----------
and frustrated and angry


---------11:25----------
and trying ever since i was young i was


---------11:27----------
isolated and alone


---------11:29----------
and i've been trying so hard my whole


---------11:30----------
life to make long-term friends and these


---------11:32----------
friendships keep [ __ ] dying


---------11:34----------
and i've had female friends thinking


---------11:36----------
you'll be fine and they've all hit on me


---------11:38----------
too


---------11:39----------
so i don't know how to escape it and i


---------11:41----------
feel really frustrated and alone


---------11:43----------
i know there are people out there i'm


---------11:44----------
not egotistical enough to think that


---------11:46----------
it's just that everyone wants me it's


---------11:48----------
just that when other people who do


---------11:50----------
are attracted to me are pushy they kind


---------11:52----------
of barge everyone else


---------11:53----------
out of the way they kind of they kind of


---------11:55----------
inhibit my ability to spend time with


---------11:57----------
people


---------11:58----------
who actually have a genuine friendship


---------12:00----------
with no other intentions


---------12:01----------
and i want to be worth that to someone i


---------12:04----------
don't want to be just something to death


---------12:05----------
depth test i want to be a friend i want


---------12:07----------
to support people i want to see people


---------12:10----------
grow and have kids and get married i


---------12:12----------
want to be with people long term


---------12:13----------
and have a great time with them and not


---------12:15----------
just be sad all the people who come into


---------12:17----------
my life and get disappointed that i


---------12:18----------
don't have more to offer i want my


---------12:20----------
friendship to be a [ __ ] nuff


---------12:25----------
bravo


---------12:28----------
anita i think you've grown since the


---------12:30----------
first time i talked to you


---------12:32----------
really immensely


---------12:36----------
and what makes you say that


---------12:40----------
so you told me some wild stories the


---------12:42----------
first time we talked


---------12:44----------
i don't know if you remember but like i


---------12:45----------
was really confused because you would


---------12:47----------
say like


---------12:47----------
yeah people continuously fall in love


---------12:49----------
with me and it sounds like sort of like


---------12:51----------
a


---------12:52----------
like on the surface much like you know


---------12:54----------
the mature comment it can be


---------12:55----------
kind of confusing but it sort of seems


---------12:57----------
sort of narcissistic to say that right


---------12:59----------
but i don't think it was i think it's


---------13:02----------
genuinely your experience but


---------13:04----------
i can imagine people would judge you


---------13:05----------
that way um


---------13:08----------
and and you know i oh wow and


---------13:12----------
there's so much there so first of all


---------13:13----------
thank you so much for being so authentic


---------13:17----------
i i was so i i


---------13:20----------
you know you're a genius with words by


---------13:22----------
the way i don't know if you like you're


---------13:24----------
like a wordsmith


---------13:27----------
i just ran it i i don't i what what did


---------13:29----------
i say that


---------13:31----------
you said you said this is one of the


---------13:34----------
best sentences


---------13:35----------
i've ever heard or read in my life


---------13:38----------
there's a barrage of dicks between me


---------13:40----------
and


---------13:40----------
a real friendship that's such a great


---------13:43----------
sentence


---------13:45----------
it captures your experience so well


---------13:48----------
first of all i've never heard the phrase


---------13:49----------
barrage of dicks


---------13:50----------
[Laughter]


---------13:52----------
you know it's like it's a new


---------13:54----------
combination in the english language


---------13:57----------
i think it it really does such a good


---------13:59----------
job so i spend my days


---------14:01----------
practicing my words i spend my days so


---------14:05----------
if you think about human experience


---------14:07----------
human experience any human experience


---------14:09----------
that's translated into words


---------14:11----------
loses something right because i can't i


---------14:14----------
can use the word love but like


---------14:16----------
what love feels like in in four letters


---------14:19----------
l-o-v-e there's like a wide chasm


---------14:21----------
between those


---------14:23----------
yeah and what i really respect about


---------14:24----------
what you just said is like


---------14:26----------
that chasm got really really small you


---------14:29----------
know when you kind of talk about how


---------14:30----------
incredibly frustrating it is


---------14:33----------
um that you want something and that


---------14:36----------
there's all this crap getting in the way


---------14:39----------
um and yeah i mean i think it was just


---------14:42----------
very well said and i think it's an


---------14:44----------
experience that i imagine


---------14:46----------
i mean i've talked to a lot of women who


---------14:47----------
i think would resonate with that


---------14:49----------
experience


---------14:50----------
that you know they they keep on getting


---------14:53----------
blamed for friend-zoning people


---------14:55----------
but they're they get girlfriend-zoned


---------14:58----------
all the time immediately


---------15:02----------
um and so yeah i just thought it was


---------15:05----------
well said


---------15:06----------
and i think the reason you've grown is


---------15:08----------
because the first time


---------15:10----------
that i talked to you you were just


---------15:11----------
relentlessly positive and you still i


---------15:13----------
mean you're still a positive person


---------15:14----------
right like you're kind of like i can't


---------15:16----------
change other people so


---------15:17----------
i'm gonna do the best that i can to make


---------15:19----------
a world a better place like that's why


---------15:20----------
anita's awesome


---------15:22----------
and but i almost thought that you were


---------15:24----------
too positive


---------15:25----------
because you didn't give space to


---------15:27----------
yourself to feel


---------15:28----------
negative and to recognize that that's


---------15:30----------
not fair and that that's not okay and


---------15:32----------
that like


---------15:33----------
you deserve to have friends and now i


---------15:35----------
hear you getting frustrated about it


---------15:37----------
which i think is actually a step in the


---------15:38----------
right direction i think it was


---------15:39----------
subsurface anger


---------15:40----------
and now it's surface anger but that's


---------15:42----------
how we let things out


---------15:46----------
and and now it's interesting because i i


---------15:48----------
i feel like


---------15:49----------
sort of embarking on a conversation that


---------15:51----------
i very rarely do


---------15:53----------
which is to change other people so


---------15:55----------
usually we talk about you


---------15:57----------
but i i wonder if there are some things


---------15:59----------
that you could do or we could explore


---------16:04----------
let me just think about how to say this


---------16:07----------
because i get the sense that you do have


---------16:09----------
this like


---------16:10----------
moth drawn to a flame kind of thing


---------16:12----------
going


---------16:14----------
right so you've mentioned to me that


---------16:15----------
there are many people like even female


---------16:17----------
friends of yours that you'll feel close


---------16:19----------
to


---------16:19----------
who sort of wind up kind of falling for


---------16:22----------
you in a romantic way


---------16:24----------
and so there's something that tells me


---------16:25----------
that something about what other people


---------16:28----------
see in you makes them think romance


---------16:31----------
instead of friendship so


---------16:36----------
uh in response i've got two responses to


---------16:40----------
that i hope i remember them both the


---------16:42----------
first


---------16:42----------
is that um i used to go down a very self


---------16:45----------
blaming route with it a long time ago


---------16:47----------
in my early teens because i used to just


---------16:49----------
walk in the street and


---------16:50----------
guys would panhandle for sex they come


---------16:52----------
up to me like hey baby where you headed


---------16:54----------
can i go with you do you know local pub


---------16:56----------
do you want to come with me


---------16:57----------
where'd you live what's your name all


---------16:58----------
these personal details i didn't want to


---------16:59----------
give to a stranger


---------17:01----------
um usually an older stranger and i was


---------17:03----------
like this must be something to do with


---------17:04----------
me i attract these horrible people that


---------17:06----------
i don't want to interrupt my day


---------17:08----------
um i i kind of i want to so i got


---------17:10----------
changed i wore this massive


---------17:12----------
trench coat thinking everyone like when


---------17:14----------
people look at people who've been


---------17:15----------
sexually assaulted they go well what


---------17:16----------
were you wearing and as a kid i thought


---------17:18----------
that meant that if you just wore


---------17:20----------
specific clothes


---------17:21----------
no one would bother you sexually um and


---------17:23----------
i got the wrong idea from those


---------17:24----------
questions that i saw people asking


---------17:26----------
anyone who suffered sexual assault so i


---------17:28----------
was like fine i wear a trench coat


---------17:29----------
people leave me alone nobody can see my


---------17:31----------
body there'd be no reason to hit on me


---------17:33----------
and i was wrong and people still hit on


---------17:34----------
me i tried so many different approaches


---------17:37----------
i tried being rude to people and distant


---------17:39----------
and people still chased me i tried to be


---------17:41----------
friendly and warm and people still


---------17:42----------
chased me i tried everything and every


---------17:44----------
approach i could think of i i


---------17:46----------
put people down harshly i was like i


---------17:47----------
will never [ __ ] you in a million years


---------17:49----------
and that didn't work and i would have i


---------17:52----------
hospitalized


---------17:53----------
boys at school and for being too pushy


---------17:56----------
and aggressive


---------17:57----------
and they'd come out of hospital and ask


---------17:58----------
me out straight away with their cast on


---------18:01----------
like i just couldn't find an approach


---------18:03----------
and i was soft and gentle and they just


---------18:05----------
wouldn't get the message


---------18:06----------
and so like i stopped blaming myself a


---------18:08----------
long time ago for people not paying


---------18:10----------
attention


---------18:11----------
because i wasn't flirting i wasn't you


---------18:14----------
know i don't flirt with these people i


---------18:15----------
pay attention to it and i'm like why are


---------18:17----------
you getting me signals and why


---------18:18----------
when i when i avoid you because you're


---------18:20----------
hitting on me do you not get these


---------18:22----------
signals like i can avoid people and like


---------18:24----------
does she love me i'm like how


---------18:25----------
thinking like this still every time you


---------18:27----------
hit on me i go silent and walk away and


---------18:29----------
you're like


---------18:30----------
i don't know what she wants women are


---------18:32----------
just a mystery


---------18:33----------
i've even said like no just no just not


---------18:36----------
ever and they're like


---------18:37----------
is she playing hard to get what do why


---------18:40----------
don't they just say when they want me i


---------18:41----------
don't


---------18:42----------
understand women are a mystery and i


---------18:44----------
just can't [ __ ] find


---------18:46----------
the right thing to say to someone that's


---------18:49----------
beside with you because they're so


---------18:51----------
preoccupied with what they want and


---------18:53----------
they're thinking with little brain


---------18:55----------
so they don't hear sense and so i


---------18:58----------
i i've asked myself my whole life this


---------19:00----------
question


---------19:01----------
and as well people think i'm conceited


---------19:03----------
if i ever bring it up so i can't ask


---------19:05----------
people for advice


---------19:06----------
so it's like a problem that's making me


---------19:08----------
really lonely and desperate for


---------19:10----------
real friendship it's making me really


---------19:11----------
really struggle to trust people


---------19:13----------
because people say they're not attracted


---------19:15----------
to me and then spring out on me and then


---------19:16----------
break up as a friend


---------19:18----------
the minute they realize it's not going


---------19:19----------
to be anything more like i have so many


---------19:21----------
issues surrounding this i want a


---------19:22----------
fulfilling life and a fulfilling social


---------19:24----------
group


---------19:25----------
and it's destroying it even when i do


---------19:27----------
find long-term friends


---------19:28----------
who like say they're not into me and


---------19:30----------
never hit on me at all right


---------19:32----------
the minute i have more friends they get


---------19:34----------
jealous


---------19:35----------
and angry and it starts to show or like


---------19:38----------
um i'll have friends around me that are


---------19:41----------
nice


---------19:41----------
and aren't hitting on me and people


---------19:43----------
around me will assume that we're


---------19:45----------
together


---------19:45----------
and start socially assassinating them


---------19:47----------
and trying to break up that friendship


---------19:49----------
and a lot of the times it even [ __ ]


---------19:50----------
works


---------19:51----------
like there are so many situations where


---------19:53----------
even if i if


---------19:54----------
even if there's no romance at all


---------19:56----------
people's romances [ __ ] it up


---------19:58----------
and people's attraction to me [ __ ] it


---------19:59----------
up and there are people in chat right


---------20:00----------
now saying i think she's


---------20:02----------
making a big thing about being


---------20:03----------
attractive i don't feel attractive i


---------20:05----------
don't understand this at all and it


---------20:07----------
annoys the hell out of me i'm not


---------20:08----------
boasting


---------20:09----------
this suck this really [ __ ] sucks


---------20:13----------
and i'm sick of it i don't want to have


---------20:14----------
to politely navigate people's intentions


---------20:17----------
and constantly disappoint people i don't


---------20:19----------
want to feel like a disappointment


---------20:20----------
anymore i don't want to feel like my


---------20:21----------
friendship is a [ __ ] consolation


---------20:23----------
prize


---------20:24----------
i want people to just be happy with it


---------20:26----------
and like if i have to acknowledge that


---------20:27----------
people are attracted to me in order to


---------20:29----------
find the route to do so


---------20:30----------
let me do that because i'm not making it


---------20:33----------
up and i'm not boasting about it and


---------20:34----------
it's not a [ __ ] compliment that


---------20:36----------
people don't want to spend time with me


---------20:37----------
unless i [ __ ] them


---------20:38----------
that's the opposite of a compliment why


---------20:40----------
do people think i'd be proud of that


---------20:42----------
that is the


---------20:43----------
ultimate insult


---------20:58----------
i'm gonna think for a second if that's


---------21:00----------
okay


---------21:02----------
okay i didn't get to my second point but


---------21:04----------
i think that's enough


---------21:05----------
no let's hear your second point um


---------21:10----------
this what was this i had it in my brain


---------21:12----------
just for a second it's gone out the


---------21:13----------
window what was it


---------21:14----------
um firstly it's not a compliment and


---------21:17----------
people think i'm conceited and


---------21:18----------
all that stuff stuff but secondly um


---------21:22----------
i'm not oh manipulation i'm not trying


---------21:25----------
to fix anyone


---------21:26----------
um i've i'm done trying to be


---------21:29----------
responsible for other


---------21:30----------
people's lack of growth i'm not going to


---------21:31----------
try and convince people to value me


---------21:34----------
beyond sleeping with me if they can't


---------21:36----------
see past that that's their problem i'm


---------21:38----------
exhausted i used to spend so much of my


---------21:40----------
youth


---------21:41----------
supposedly being so mature for my age


---------21:44----------
and people


---------21:45----------
who have problems gravitating towards me


---------21:47----------
including partners


---------21:48----------
and they put me in charge of their


---------21:49----------
personal growth and they also blamed me


---------21:52----------
whenever they could struggle to be good


---------21:55----------
and they were like well if you were more


---------21:56----------
supportive or if you were more confident


---------21:58----------
in the bedroom maybe i wouldn't have


---------22:00----------
and all this sort of stuff and the


---------22:01----------
minute you start rushing in to help


---------22:03----------
people build on themselves in situations


---------22:05----------
where they're just


---------22:06----------
shallow [ __ ] you end up struggling


---------22:09----------
and crying and being hurt with them


---------22:12----------
taking responsibility for their [ __ ]


---------22:14----------
like i'm so done with that i'm a


---------22:16----------
grown-up i hang out with grown-ups if


---------22:18----------
they can't grow and be mature and think


---------22:20----------
past their woolies that's their problem


---------22:21----------
gonna find people who can think past


---------22:23----------
their willies


---------22:24----------
i'm not going to try and change people


---------22:27----------
not in this respect and


---------22:28----------
to be honest the times that i've changed


---------22:30----------
people the most are when i've never


---------22:31----------
tried to change them at all


---------22:33----------
just by being happy and being myself


---------22:35----------
people see solutions that they've not


---------22:36----------
tried before


---------22:37----------
from the way that i exist and i'm far


---------22:39----------
more happy with that way of helping


---------22:41----------
people


---------22:42----------
than actively trying to meddle with


---------22:43----------
their minds and their lives


---------22:45----------
most often change doesn't really happen


---------22:47----------
unless people want it to


---------22:48----------
so it has to be their idea in the first


---------22:50----------
place and honestly


---------22:52----------
i'm just so done playing therapist i was


---------22:54----------
nice to help people grow


---------22:55----------
i've definitely helped people in the


---------22:57----------
past and really enjoyed it


---------22:58----------
but i'm exhausted now i've spent my


---------23:00----------
whole life caring for my mom and caring


---------23:02----------
for other people and i just want to


---------23:03----------
work on myself and be around people who


---------23:05----------
don't need work from me that just happy


---------23:12----------
you have come a long way anita really


---------23:15----------
happy


---------23:16----------
seriously i'm really i'm thrilled to


---------23:17----------
because seriously like the first time i


---------23:19----------
talked to you it was like


---------23:21----------
other people need to come first like you


---------23:24----------
could go back and watch it


---------23:26----------
it's like other people need to come


---------23:27----------
first and anita gets


---------23:29----------
no space in anita's life


---------23:33----------
and then what i'm hearing you say is i


---------23:36----------
don't exist for you


---------23:37----------
anymore i'm done existing for you


---------23:40----------
i'm done being what you want me to be


---------23:42----------
i'm gonna start existing for myself


---------23:46----------
and there's a lot of hurt around that


---------23:47----------
too because it seems like


---------23:50----------
when you exist for yourself people don't


---------23:53----------
like it


---------23:55----------
because they like you to exist for them


---------23:58----------
i need to change me


---------23:59----------
i need to [ __ ] me i need to do this for


---------24:02----------
me take care of me help me


---------24:04----------
anita be the case for me to fix


---------24:08----------
be broken so that i can feel better


---------24:10----------
about myself and make you feel better


---------24:12----------
about yourself


---------24:14----------
and then [ __ ] me afterwards


---------24:18----------
right yeah


---------24:22----------
and it's not fair and i i hear you you


---------24:25----------
say you've tried it all


---------24:27----------
because early on people treated you a


---------24:29----------
certain way and you're like oh crap i'm


---------24:31----------
being treated


---------24:32----------
because of what i'm wearing or who i am


---------24:34----------
or how i am acting


---------24:35----------
and so you started wearing a trench coat


---------24:38----------
and you changed yourself for the sake of


---------24:40----------
other people


---------24:42----------
their immature behavior suddenly became


---------24:45----------
your


---------24:46----------
responsibility to fix on your end that


---------24:49----------
people are acting


---------24:50----------
this way towards you because of what you


---------24:52----------
wear and you're like [ __ ] that i'm done


---------24:54----------
with that i'm not responsible


---------24:57----------
for their reactions to me which is fair


---------25:00----------
so you tried to change yourself for the


---------25:02----------
sake of other people and you were like


---------25:03----------
[ __ ] that


---------25:05----------
and then what happened is


---------25:09----------
you tried the other extreme which is


---------25:10----------
that you said i'm i'm gonna stop so at


---------25:12----------
first you were like i'm gonna transform


---------25:14----------
myself i'm gonna wear a


---------25:15----------
trench coat and a hat and glasses and


---------25:18----------
then


---------25:18----------
i'm gonna change myself so that people


---------25:20----------
don't interact with me a particular way


---------25:22----------
i'm gonna stop being who i am because


---------25:24----------
when i am who i am


---------25:27----------
barrage of dicks then what happens is


---------25:31----------
you


---------25:31----------
you went the other extreme and you said


---------25:33----------
i'm not going to try to change


---------25:34----------
other people anymore because you tried


---------25:36----------
that for a while too right you tried to


---------25:38----------
rehabilitate people you tried to


---------25:40----------
transform people you try


---------25:42----------
to change people so then it's not about


---------25:43----------
changing yourself it's all about


---------25:45----------
changing


---------25:45----------
the other person help them learn a


---------25:47----------
different way


---------25:49----------
try to teach them that you are more than


---------25:52----------
an object for their lust


---------25:55----------
try to teach them be compassionate be


---------25:57----------
mature be patient


---------25:59----------
and try to change them and you're like


---------26:00----------
[ __ ] that that doesn't work either


---------26:02----------
tried to change yourself didn't work


---------26:04----------
tried to change them


---------26:06----------
didn't work and now you're here


---------26:10----------
and you're frustrated because you've


---------26:11----------
tried it all and you're smart


---------26:13----------
right so like when you say you've tried


---------26:15----------
it all i believe you and i think you


---------26:16----------
also probably came up with


---------26:18----------
pretty creative solutions


---------26:21----------
you know i don't know how many


---------26:22----------
adolescent girls i've ever seen


---------26:24----------
in trench coats but that you know just


---------26:26----------
shows us that you were probably thinking


---------26:27----------
outside the box maybe it was cottman


---------26:28----------
where you were


---------26:29----------
i don't think i've ever seen like a


---------26:30----------
teenage girl in a trench coat


---------26:32----------
yeah i i was pretty much the only one


---------26:36----------
right so you you did a lot of outside of


---------26:38----------
the box thinking


---------26:39----------
you're pretty smart and you've tried


---------26:41----------
everything under the sun


---------26:44----------
and you're frustrated and absolutely so


---------26:47----------
because for a while you didn't put


---------26:48----------
yourself forward first and now you're


---------26:50----------
trying to put yourself first


---------26:52----------
and it's and you gotta let me know if i


---------26:54----------
say this too much okay because i just


---------26:55----------
love the phrase now


---------26:56----------
it's a barrage of dicks


---------27:00----------
right and so now it's kind of like okay


---------27:03----------
so like what do we do about this


---------27:05----------
like what do we do for you anita how can


---------27:07----------
we help you


---------27:08----------
find friendships i think part of is


---------27:12----------
boundaries because


---------27:13----------
i i don't


---------27:17----------
so a lot of the people around me are


---------27:18----------
people who are trying to get in a


---------27:20----------
relationship with me and it's a pattern


---------27:22----------
they'll hit on me a little bit hit on me


---------27:24----------
a little bit and i'll go that's really


---------27:25----------
sweet of you to be so nice


---------27:27----------
um and that i'll try so hard to be


---------27:30----------
accepting but at the same time there's a


---------27:32----------
new thing


---------27:32----------
as he am i allowed to acknowledge that


---------27:34----------
this feels like he's hating on me am i


---------27:36----------
allowed to


---------27:37----------
is that thing i can do because it feels


---------27:39----------
conceited to jump to conclusions


---------27:41----------
so i give them the benefit of the doubt


---------27:42----------
and go maybe this person is just being


---------27:44----------
nice


---------27:45----------
maybe i can still hold hope that people


---------27:48----------
can just be nice for the sake of it but


---------27:50----------
there's a pattern and i'm already


---------27:51----------
recognizing it and people are commenting


---------27:54----------
on it and going i think this person


---------27:55----------
likes you i think this person likes you


---------27:57----------
and just like uh i don't wanna i don't


---------27:58----------
wanna face it i don't wanna


---------28:00----------
because if if this is real if this is


---------28:02----------
what's happening then i'm going to lose


---------28:03----------
a friend


---------28:04----------
and it doesn't matter what situation no


---------28:06----------
matter what angle i take it from


---------28:08----------
i'm going to lose a friend and then ah


---------28:10----------
um


---------28:11----------
it gets to the point where i have to


---------28:12----------
have the discussion thank you for all


---------28:14----------
these things but i just want you to know


---------28:15----------
and don't take this personally


---------28:17----------
um a lot of people do this and it's


---------28:19----------
because they're interested in me and


---------28:21----------
in case you're interested in me i'm not


---------28:23----------
looking for a relationship right now i


---------28:25----------
don't i don't make it impersonal i'm


---------28:27----------
just like i'm not looking to date anyone


---------28:28----------
i'm not interested in anyone right now


---------28:30----------
rather than directing it directly at


---------28:32----------
them i'm not going to like these are all


---------28:33----------
the reasons i'd never [ __ ] you because


---------28:35----------
that's really mean and unnecessary


---------28:37----------
um and usually the response is oh i


---------28:38----------
didn't like you anyway it's not like


---------28:40----------
that i'm just being nice to you okay


---------28:42----------
and then from there they carry on doing


---------28:45----------
it


---------28:45----------
and the most common pattern i get is


---------28:48----------
people pretending they're not hitting on


---------28:49----------
me until it hits


---------28:50----------
until it sticks they're like um no means


---------28:53----------
no until it means yes


---------28:55----------
it's how people take that they still


---------28:56----------
hold out hope unless i crush them and


---------28:58----------
even if i crush them sometimes they hold


---------29:00----------
out hope


---------29:01----------
and so i'm in this horrible position


---------29:03----------
where it's not appropriate


---------29:05----------
to be cruel or direct anyway it's not


---------29:07----------
like i could just explode and go


---------29:09----------
you gave me some stuff and i just want


---------29:10----------
you to know i'd never [ __ ] you in a


---------29:12----------
million years it's not okay to do that


---------29:14----------
but the gentle approach doesn't work and


---------29:16----------
it's really frustrating i'm trapped and


---------29:18----------
they keep pushing and pushing and doing


---------29:20----------
all the stuff i know


---------29:21----------
is love bombing and i don't know how to


---------29:23----------
say stop and it doesn't stop and i just


---------29:26----------
end up


---------29:26----------
really unhappy and uncomfortable all the


---------29:29----------
time it's happened to me with roommates


---------29:30----------
it's happened to me with friends it's


---------29:32----------
happened to me


---------29:32----------
so many people and they push and push


---------29:35----------
and they want to take more and more they


---------29:37----------
want to take more of my time and they


---------29:38----------
guilt trip me if i don't spend time with


---------29:40----------
them if i don't play games with them


---------29:41----------
they're pushing and like they they want


---------29:44----------
to talk all the time they know i'm busy


---------29:46----------
they get angry at me if i don't message


---------29:48----------
back and tell them about my day


---------29:50----------
like they start to want more and more


---------29:52----------
and more and it makes me more and more


---------29:53----------
uncomfortable


---------29:54----------
and i pull back more and more and more


---------29:55----------
because everyone around me knows


---------29:57----------
i'm busy i struggle to keep up with


---------29:59----------
messages and even these people who hit


---------30:01----------
on me know this


---------30:02----------
but they still pressure me and it really


---------30:05----------
it's such a struggle because i don't


---------30:06----------
want to hurt their feelings and i enjoy


---------30:07----------
their friendship and i don't want to


---------30:08----------
have to push them away


---------30:10----------
but they're pulling pulling pulling so


---------30:12----------
much that the only thing i have left to


---------30:14----------
do is push


---------30:15----------
and so this friendship starts to get


---------30:16----------
ruined in increments i start to dislike


---------30:19----------
spending time with them and feel


---------30:20----------
uncomfortable


---------30:21----------
and i feel guilty about it and like i


---------30:23----------
can't say anything because they're being


---------30:24----------
nice to me


---------30:25----------
and then eventually i have to let them


---------30:26----------
down and the first time i let them down


---------30:28----------
they won't accept it ever nobody ever


---------30:30----------
does


---------30:30----------
no matter how i approach it whether i'm


---------30:32----------
direct or soft they don't


---------30:34----------
acknowledge i've said no and they keep


---------30:37----------
pushing and pushing after


---------30:38----------
and they start doing weird [ __ ] this is


---------30:40----------
where the weird territory starts to


---------30:41----------
happen like waiting for me to be really


---------30:43----------
drunk to try and kiss me


---------30:45----------
and things like this you know all this


---------30:47----------
stuff that gets dodgy


---------30:48----------
and this is where things really bad


---------30:50----------
things have started to happen to me as


---------30:51----------
well from people who just


---------30:53----------
don't take no for an answer and the


---------30:55----------
problem with that is that they're


---------30:56----------
usually really nice people


---------30:58----------
usually they're people no one would ever


---------30:59----------
suspect of being weird and creepy


---------31:02----------
but it gets like that and i feel like


---------31:04----------
it's my


---------31:05----------
fault for not just deleting them from my


---------31:07----------
life sooner


---------31:08----------
and i should have done it earlier and


---------31:10----------
earlier and early i knew they were


---------31:11----------
hitting on me i knew they weren't


---------31:13----------
listening to me


---------31:14----------
and it happened so [ __ ] much and it


---------31:15----------
happens with nice guys that everybody


---------31:17----------
likes that are deep in my friendship


---------31:18----------
groups and people i don't feel like i


---------31:20----------
can challenge


---------31:21----------
and it's so hard and awkward and risky


---------31:23----------
and terrifying


---------31:25----------
and i've had like so much happen to me


---------31:28----------
um


---------31:28----------
because i just don't know how to


---------31:30----------
navigate this and set boundaries and i


---------31:32----------
want


---------31:32----------
friends as well i keep holding out hope


---------31:34----------
that maybe they'll just give up


---------31:36----------
and they'll accept my friendship and


---------31:37----------
they never [ __ ] do


---------31:39----------
so the worst case scenario is sexual


---------31:41----------
assault but the best case scenario is


---------31:43----------
the friendship


---------31:44----------
dies because they're disappointed and it


---------31:46----------
hurts too much to hang out with me


---------31:48----------
and there is no middle ground and there


---------31:49----------
is nothing fun about this and i keep


---------31:51----------
getting my heart broken by people that i


---------31:53----------
try to connect with


---------31:54----------
over and over again


---------31:58----------
that sounds terrible


---------32:01----------
it's hard it's awkward it's risky


---------32:05----------
it's terrifying


---------32:10----------
i get the sense


---------32:13----------
oh it's like sort of like this history


---------32:15----------
repeating itself this like inevitability


---------32:19----------
i kind of imagine that like you see you


---------32:20----------
know a bright


---------32:22----------
like a little spot in the distance and


---------32:24----------
it's like


---------32:25----------
the the light of a train and no matter


---------32:28----------
what you do inevitably that light grows


---------32:30----------
and grows and grows and grows and grows


---------32:32----------
until that train is like


---------32:34----------
bearing down on you and that there's


---------32:37----------
there's a lot of just


---------32:39----------
there's a lot of like just fate


---------32:43----------
in what you're saying that like no


---------32:46----------
matter what you do whether you change


---------32:47----------
yourself whether you change people


---------32:49----------
whether you try to set boundaries and


---------32:50----------
you're a dick to people


---------32:52----------
or you're nice to people like there's


---------32:54----------
just this inevitability of like you know


---------32:56----------
the moon coming crashing down onto earth


---------32:58----------
no matter what you do


---------32:59----------
there's an incredible gravity to what


---------33:01----------
you're describing


---------33:04----------
that's what i'm hearing from you that's


---------33:06----------
what i'm feeling from you


---------33:10----------
is that how it feels yeah but i keep


---------33:13----------
trying i keep holding out hope and i


---------33:14----------
think that's what's got me into so many


---------33:16----------
bad situations is that


---------33:17----------
i keep holding out hope that maybe i'm


---------33:19----------
just paranoid or maybe i'm just you know


---------33:22----------
like and then i let it continue for way


---------33:24----------
too long because i'm either


---------33:26----------
telling myself it's not okay to


---------33:27----------
acknowledge it's happening i shouldn't


---------33:28----------
be so full of myself not everyone


---------33:30----------
fancies you anita


---------33:31----------
um or like i try to push them away and


---------33:34----------
it doesn't work


---------33:35----------
yeah that's what i was about to say it's


---------33:36----------
like it seems like you're damned if you


---------33:38----------
do damned if you don't


---------33:40----------
it's like either you're mean to them and


---------33:42----------
then it ruptures the friendship or


---------33:43----------
you're kind to them and they start


---------33:45----------
pushing boundaries and wait until you're


---------33:46----------
drunk


---------33:49----------
so anita i have two options for you okay


---------33:51----------
i'd love to try to help you with this


---------33:53----------
i do think that you can be helped by the


---------33:55----------
way um


---------33:57----------
and and oddly enough the reason that i


---------33:59----------
have hope is because there's a pattern


---------34:02----------
so in my experience where there's a


---------34:05----------
pattern there's room for understanding


---------34:07----------
and once there's understanding then you


---------34:08----------
can change


---------34:10----------
we certainly see a pattern here um


---------34:13----------
so let me start by this i've got two


---------34:15----------
options for you


---------34:16----------
one is the smart option it's the logical


---------34:19----------
option


---------34:20----------
the other is the shot in the dark it's


---------34:22----------
the thing that's more likely to be wrong


---------34:24----------
but may actually be potentially helpful


---------34:27----------
but the chances of that are


---------34:29----------
very low you want to go for the shot in


---------34:31----------
the dark


---------34:32----------
or the more reliable thing


---------34:36----------
let's just talk about both because for


---------34:39----------
me i've tried so many options and failed


---------34:41----------
that you know


---------34:42----------
which one first that's right


---------34:45----------
i'm curious about the shot in the dark


---------34:47----------
okay so there's a lot of negative space


---------34:49----------
in this conversation


---------34:51----------
okay and what i mean by negative space


---------34:53----------
is you're talking a lot about one thing


---------34:56----------
and what we're what i'm i'm hearing a


---------34:59----------
conspicuous absence that actually once


---------35:01----------
i mention it hopefully this makes sense


---------35:05----------
to people and i don't really know that


---------35:06----------
this is where the money is in fact


---------35:08----------
you're pointing really really hard in


---------35:10----------
one direction


---------35:12----------
with where your problem is and what you


---------35:13----------
want and what i'm noticing is that the


---------35:15----------
harder you drive in one direction the


---------35:17----------
more you're moving away from something


---------35:19----------
else


---------35:19----------
that seems like the very opposite of


---------35:21----------
where the answer is


---------35:24----------
so that is this do you want a romantic


---------35:28----------
relationship


---------35:34----------
i don't know


---------35:37----------
i don't know i mean i've been on the odd


---------35:41----------
date here and there


---------35:42----------
that's not worked out um


---------35:45----------
so i think there is a part of me that


---------35:47----------
wants to but


---------35:49----------
i'm also really really really happy on


---------35:51----------
my own and i do


---------35:52----------
so much better in life on my own i'm


---------35:54----------
much happier on my own


---------35:55----------
and so um you know it feels like


---------36:00----------
i'm content where i'm at but if the


---------36:02----------
right person comes along i'm happy to


---------36:04----------
you know bring someone into my life um


---------36:08----------
but unfortunately a lot of the people


---------36:09----------
that are attracted to me are not very


---------36:11----------
healthy or good for me like a lot of


---------36:13----------
these people uh graphic i


---------36:15----------
tend to a lot of people who are very


---------36:18----------
um dark in their behavior


---------36:21----------
tend to gravitate towards me and so


---------36:24----------
yeah i've been on a few dates they


---------36:26----------
didn't work out and


---------36:28----------
that's about as far as it's gone i've


---------36:29----------
been i've been alone for quite a while


---------36:31----------
now


---------36:32----------
okay so i'm gonna repeat back


---------36:35----------
your answer as i heard it


---------36:39----------
and i want you to tell me whether you


---------36:41----------
answered the question so i asked you do


---------36:43----------
you want a relationship


---------36:45----------
and you started off by saying i've been


---------36:47----------
on a few dates


---------36:48----------
it tends to not work out well


---------36:51----------
i'm somewhat content and if the right


---------36:53----------
person comes along


---------36:55----------
i'd think about it but generally


---------36:58----------
speaking


---------36:59----------
the wrong person comes along did you


---------37:02----------
answer my question


---------37:10----------
yeah i think i don't know if the right


---------37:12----------
person comes along then sure


---------37:13----------
is is is an answer i'd say that's the


---------37:17----------
closest thing to the answer


---------37:19----------
right so i think it's interesting


---------37:21----------
because you said i don't know and then


---------37:23----------
you kind of talked about your


---------37:24----------
experiences


---------37:28----------
and i wonder where there's whether


---------37:31----------
there's value so like i'm just going to


---------37:32----------
ask you the question again


---------37:34----------
do you want a relationship


---------37:44----------
no i don't think i do why not


---------37:54----------
i think if you'd asked me this question


---------37:56----------
like a month or two ago i


---------37:57----------
said yeah i want a relationship because


---------37:59----------
i was trying


---------38:01----------
even and i i think i've settled into a


---------38:04----------
mentality very recently where i'm just


---------38:06----------
like


---------38:06----------
this is actually pretty awesome like


---------38:10----------
ah i'm noticing more and more that i'm


---------38:13----------
making


---------38:13----------
room for myself to read to learn


---------38:16----------
to do stuff for my stream to spend time


---------38:19----------
with animals and you know really


---------38:21----------
grow and do all the stuff i've wanted to


---------38:23----------
do and made excuses not to


---------38:25----------
and i feel like i'm discovering what i'm


---------38:28----------
capable of


---------38:29----------
all over again i did that when i started


---------38:31----------
doing animal rescue work and it was


---------38:32----------
really dangerous and scary and i


---------38:34----------
pushed through a lot of fear and did a


---------38:35----------
lot of stuff that made me feel great i


---------38:37----------
was like wow i'm capable of a lot more


---------38:38----------
than i thought and


---------38:39----------
i feel like being alone especially


---------38:42----------
in lockdown and not really seeing anyone


---------38:45----------
i've really


---------38:47----------
enjoyed it just just having some space


---------38:49----------
and time to


---------38:50----------
actually attend to stuff my own needs


---------38:53----------
for once


---------38:54----------
and not think about pleasing anyone and


---------38:57----------
you know all this messy stuff with


---------38:59----------
boundaries and people hitting on me i've


---------39:01----------
enjoyed the respite


---------39:02----------
from it and i don't i don't think i need


---------39:06----------
anyone in my life right now


---------39:07----------
and i think it'd be bad to ha


---------39:10----------
i feel like if you have holes and you're


---------39:12----------
lonely if you should fill it with your


---------39:14----------
own [ __ ] i don't think that you should


---------39:15----------
get with someone because you have needs


---------39:16----------
i think you should get with someone


---------39:17----------
because


---------39:18----------
you're happy and you have some extra


---------39:19----------
time and love to give someone


---------39:21----------
available um rather than it just being


---------39:24----------
like i need someone because i'm bored


---------39:26----------
i'm scared i'm alone i need someone to


---------39:27----------
love me because i don't love my


---------39:28----------
myself i think i'm in a good position to


---------39:30----------
have a partner but because i'm in a good


---------39:32----------
position to have a partner


---------39:33----------
i don't actually need one


---------39:37----------
um once again a lot of wisdom


---------39:40----------
anita a lot of wisdom coming from you


---------39:42----------
today


---------39:45----------
thanks that no i i don't think i want a


---------39:49----------
relationship and


---------39:50----------
and yeah i'm perfectly happy living my


---------39:53----------
own life


---------39:56----------
okay i'm gonna


---------40:00----------
just think about what you said for a


---------40:01----------
second if that's okay


---------40:17----------
so here's what i'd say so i think that i


---------40:19----------
love your answer


---------40:21----------
right so you're you're learning to be


---------40:23----------
with yourself


---------40:25----------
you've prioritized other people over you


---------40:27----------
whether they be your mom


---------40:28----------
the animals that you take care of your


---------40:30----------
bunny your gigantic bunny you have a


---------40:32----------
gigantic bunny still


---------40:34----------
yeah he's been compared to me


---------40:36----------
[Laughter]


---------40:37----------
um you know the random friends that you


---------40:40----------
know lean on you for support and stuff


---------40:42----------
you're learning how to be with yourself


---------40:43----------
i do think it's very


---------40:44----------
like it's like one of these profound you


---------40:47----------
know


---------40:48----------
um statements where you're kind of like


---------40:50----------
i don't need someone and that's why in a


---------40:52----------
sense


---------40:52----------
maybe i'm ready because i i can be with


---------40:55----------
myself


---------40:57----------
yeah i think that there's a lot of merit


---------40:58----------
there i i wonder


---------41:01----------
on some level whether there's something


---------41:04----------
under the surface there too


---------41:05----------
i think it's maybe not worth digging


---------41:07----------
into but there


---------41:08----------
there's still i'm getting an


---------41:10----------
undercurrent of like something left


---------41:12----------
underneath there i don't think we need


---------41:14----------
to get into it but i'm curious whether


---------41:16----------
you know if we end up talking again like


---------41:18----------
a couple months from now or things like


---------41:19----------
that or if you actually do wind up


---------41:21----------
actually i think this becomes relevant


---------41:23----------
if you wind up in a relationship


---------41:25----------
that you want maybe there are other


---------41:27----------
feeling i'm just getting the sense that


---------41:28----------
there are some feelings there that are


---------41:30----------
left unaddressed


---------41:31----------
um and it sort of makes sense and i'm


---------41:33----------
i'm glad that we could move you from an


---------41:35----------
i don't know to a no


---------41:37----------
because i think it's important to kind


---------41:38----------
of like map that out


---------41:40----------
because the implication of everything


---------41:42----------
you've been saying is that you don't


---------41:43----------
want a romantic relationship right


---------41:44----------
you're saying like


---------41:45----------
i want friendships i want people who


---------41:47----------
want me for me i actually don't want to


---------41:49----------
like you've been saying this whole time


---------41:50----------
i don't want a


---------41:51----------
romantic relationship which is why it


---------41:53----------
sounds kind of weird that like maybe i


---------41:54----------
just went out there and asked the


---------41:55----------
question but just to confirm like let's


---------41:57----------
be clear


---------41:58----------
that you don't want one


---------42:02----------
and then the reason why not is that that


---------42:04----------
you're basically working on yourself for


---------42:06----------
now


---------42:07----------
and you're learning to prioritize the


---------42:09----------
things that you've neglected


---------42:12----------
in the pursuit of taking care of other


---------42:13----------
people anita is taking some much needed


---------42:16----------
me time


---------42:18----------
right and that's fantastic i can support


---------42:21----------
that


---------42:22----------
any questions about that or do you want


---------42:24----------
to talk further about this or should we


---------42:25----------
switch gears


---------42:27----------
to the more important part


---------42:30----------
that's good what's the more important


---------42:32----------
part so here's the thing anita


---------42:35----------
let's let's just assume for a second


---------42:37----------
that everything that you said


---------42:38----------
is exactly as you said it okay that you


---------42:41----------
are someone who


---------42:44----------
seems to attract men


---------42:47----------
and women and they sort of continuously


---------42:50----------
fall for you


---------42:51----------
and want everything from sex to


---------42:54----------
love in a deep meaningful soulful


---------42:56----------
relationship


---------43:00----------
so the first question is are you is that


---------43:03----------
different from most people's experiences


---------43:06----------
yes or no what do you think


---------43:10----------
it's not very different from my mom's


---------43:11----------
experiences my mom gets this a lot too


---------43:14----------
and i've watched her struggle with it


---------43:16----------
her whole life from a young age


---------43:18----------
guys used to bump heads trying to kiss


---------43:20----------
her hand at the same time and


---------43:22----------
they get so distracted by her they'd get


---------43:24----------
caught in the bus doors and be dragged


---------43:26----------
by buses and things like


---------43:27----------
uh there were always women who were


---------43:28----------
trying to tear her down and socially


---------43:30----------
sabotage her because


---------43:31----------
they're jealous that their boyfriend


---------43:32----------
fancied her and things like this my


---------43:34----------
mom's always had people


---------43:35----------
stalk her and things like this she had


---------43:37----------
like a herd of stalkers one of them


---------43:39----------
carved her a wooden dildo


---------43:41----------
we now use it as a self-def defense


---------43:43----------
stick if in case of emergency which is


---------43:45----------
hilarious


---------43:46----------
um but there have been yeah my mom's the


---------43:48----------
only person i know in my life


---------43:50----------
cues like this to you but me and her


---------43:52----------
temperament and the way we engage with


---------43:54----------
people is so different my mom is very


---------43:55----------
blunt


---------43:56----------
very noble [ __ ] and after everything


---------43:58----------
she's gone through


---------43:59----------
i don't blame her like i'm a lot more


---------44:02----------
gentle with people


---------44:03----------
um like my mom i confide in her about it


---------44:06----------
i'm like what do i do and she gives me


---------44:08----------
really good


---------44:08----------
advice sometimes because she's


---------44:09----------
experienced so much of it but at the


---------44:11----------
same time she's like


---------44:12----------
i would make this recommendation but


---------44:15----------
you're too much of a nice person


---------44:16----------
like sometimes she's like i the way that


---------44:18----------
i'd approach this


---------44:20----------
you wouldn't do and so i often end up


---------44:22----------
feeling stuck in situations because i


---------44:24----------
know that her


---------44:24----------
approach is a lot more let's say direct


---------44:28----------
and angry sometimes um


---------44:31----------
yeah just kind of d i'm gonna restate my


---------44:34----------
question and i'm going to repeat the


---------44:36----------
answer that i heard


---------44:37----------
is it is it a normal experience or


---------44:40----------
abnormal experience to have


---------44:42----------
people continuously want you


---------44:45----------
fall in love with you etc and you said


---------44:47----------
well it seems similar to my mom's


---------44:49----------
experience


---------44:51----------
right and then you went on to point out


---------44:53----------
some differences between your mom fine


---------44:55----------
so fine so that you and your mom share


---------44:57----------
an experience cool that's actually a


---------44:58----------
really important data point that we'll


---------45:00----------
visit in a second


---------45:01----------
is it a normal or abnormal experience


---------45:03----------
compared to other people


---------45:09----------
uh i mostly hang out with dudes and i


---------45:11----------
don't know any of them who go through


---------45:12----------
this except one i know one dude who goes


---------45:14----------
through this


---------45:15----------
so most of the people i know don't go


---------45:16----------
through this okay so


---------45:18----------
i would say that you know if you talk to


---------45:20----------
women on the internet


---------45:22----------
many of them will say that some of this


---------45:23----------
behavior is common


---------45:25----------
um and and so we've had streams about


---------45:28----------
that but


---------45:29----------
i also have never met anyone


---------45:32----------
who has been unable to find friends or


---------45:35----------
have


---------45:36----------
their friendships including their female


---------45:37----------
friendships continuously wrecked by


---------45:40----------
whatever this is


---------45:42----------
so in this sense i think you're an


---------45:43----------
outlier right so we're going to approach


---------45:45----------
this scientifically


---------45:46----------
and we're going to start by forget about


---------45:47----------
psychology and all that kind of crap and


---------45:49----------
like


---------45:49----------
do you want a relationship oh my god


---------45:52----------
what's going on inside you do you put


---------45:54----------
yourself first you put yourself second


---------45:55----------
like forget about all that


---------45:56----------
let's look at it and look at it


---------45:58----------
scientifically so first thing is like


---------46:00----------
is this are you an outlier right and


---------46:03----------
what would you say yes or no


---------46:07----------
i'm actually unsure i i would want a


---------46:10----------
larger sample of


---------46:12----------
of women's experiences before i could


---------46:14----------
say


---------46:15----------
okay because i know it's uncommon among


---------46:17----------
men and they're the people that i mostly


---------46:19----------
hang out with i have some female friends


---------46:21----------
throughout the past but


---------46:22----------
most of them i lost to this situation as


---------46:25----------
well


---------46:26----------
that i'm in so let me ask you this or


---------46:29----------
is it a common experience for human


---------46:31----------
beings to be unable to make friends


---------46:36----------
yes not just not for this reason it's


---------46:38----------
hard for early adults to make friends


---------46:40----------
but for this reason probably it's


---------46:42----------
unusual maybe


---------46:43----------
i don't know i am actually genuinely


---------46:45----------
unsure that's totally fine so so


---------46:48----------
i'd say you're an outlier


---------46:51----------
so the word like so anita you're a siren


---------46:54----------
you know what a siren is guys remember


---------46:55----------
this [ __ ]


---------46:57----------
i do yeah right so what's your


---------46:59----------
understanding of what a siren is or what


---------47:01----------
what do you


---------47:02----------
she sits on the rocks and she sings


---------47:04----------
beautiful songs and men


---------47:06----------
you know see men get enchanted and they


---------47:09----------
crash their ships


---------47:10----------
on the rocks sound like you


---------47:17----------
i think the difference between me and a


---------47:18----------
siren is intent


---------47:20----------
absolutely completely agree but like


---------47:23----------
like


---------47:23----------
when i see you and i hear your your


---------47:26----------
story


---------47:27----------
it sounds to me like a siren right like


---------47:28----------
there's like something weird


---------47:30----------
you have some musk or there's something


---------47:33----------
going on with you


---------47:34----------
where like people are drawn to you and


---------47:36----------
they start out as like


---------47:38----------
you're you've tried everything in in the


---------47:40----------
books right so like let's think about it


---------47:41----------
scientifically you've tried to be an


---------47:43----------
[ __ ]


---------47:43----------
you've tried to be nice you've tried to


---------47:44----------
set boundaries you've tried to


---------47:46----------
you know be very clear with people and


---------47:48----------
say i'm not interested in this


---------47:50----------
you've tried to just be friends you've


---------47:52----------
tried to fix people


---------47:53----------
you've tried to change yourself and none


---------47:55----------
of it's working which tells me that


---------47:57----------
there's some kind of siren song


---------47:59----------
so then we say like okay so if none of


---------48:02----------
that stuff is working then like why are


---------48:04----------
these people drawn to you


---------48:06----------
because what i'm hearing is that people


---------48:07----------
are drawn to you it's not even like


---------48:09----------
something you're doing


---------48:10----------
right if you think about a siren song


---------48:12----------
sure there's intent and they want to


---------48:13----------
crash


---------48:13----------
and so maybe not a great example but


---------48:16----------
what i'm noticing is like the word


---------48:18----------
it's not that you're doing something


---------48:19----------
you're not luring them


---------48:22----------
they are drawn to you


---------48:26----------
does that make sense like i'm just


---------48:27----------
observing this based on what you're


---------48:29----------
saying


---------48:30----------
[Music]


---------48:32----------
and i think there's an inhibiting factor


---------48:34----------
of like


---------48:35----------
i don't see myself the way that these


---------48:37----------
people do and it's difficult to try and


---------48:39----------
understand it


---------48:40----------
because i don't feel particularly


---------48:42----------
attractive or interesting i don't feel


---------48:43----------
like i'm the kind of person that's worth


---------48:45----------
making this much fuss about


---------48:47----------
like in my situation if i fell for


---------48:50----------
someone


---------48:50----------
and they didn't reciprocate they they


---------48:52----------
didn't want to be with me


---------48:54----------
and they were saying no a lot i wouldn't


---------48:56----------
keep trying i wouldn't go man you're


---------48:58----------
making noises as if you have a choice


---------49:00----------
but you'll like me eventually i can


---------49:02----------
earn it like yours your attention can be


---------49:04----------
a reward if i'm just


---------49:06----------
epic enough you know and i just i just i


---------49:09----------
wouldn't think like that if i have to


---------49:10----------
try to get someone to like me i'll move


---------49:12----------
on to someone who actually likes me


---------49:13----------
effortlessly


---------49:15----------
i don't understand why people think that


---------49:17----------
it's worth being degraded and pushed


---------49:19----------
away


---------49:19----------
and just being rejected over and over


---------49:22----------
for me


---------49:23----------
i'm not neurotypical i'm a pain in the


---------49:25----------
ass like most of my friends have to


---------49:27----------
enjoy the odd slap


---------49:28----------
or a smack or like punch or whatever


---------49:31----------
because of my tics


---------49:32----------
and you know they're very patient and


---------49:34----------
tolerant and i can't see how


---------49:35----------
having to tolerate someone who's not


---------49:37----------
allowed and brash and annoying and


---------49:39----------
embarrassing to be around like


---------49:41----------
the kind of ticks i have like we'll be


---------49:43----------
playing chess in a calf


---------49:44----------
and stuff and i'll be like do you like


---------49:45----------
dick and before they've even answered


---------49:47----------
i'll be like he likes dick


---------49:48----------
and just shouting to everyone else in


---------49:50----------
the in the room like people have to be


---------49:51----------
so patient with me


---------49:53----------
and i can't see any reason why this


---------49:55----------
happens and it feels wrong to ask and go


---------49:57----------
why do you like me why are you willing


---------49:59----------
to go through all this


---------50:00----------
why are you willing to put up with all


---------50:02----------
of this why is it worth putting up with


---------50:04----------
the rejection


---------50:05----------
me not liking you why is it worth


---------50:07----------
putting up with my condition


---------50:09----------
and i'm i feel like a very bland and


---------50:11----------
mediocre woman do you know how many


---------50:12----------
brunettes with brown eyes like small


---------50:16----------
you know there's no i'm a very average


---------50:18----------
looking person here in the uk


---------50:19----------
it doesn't it doesn't feel like i the


---------50:21----------
way that people are


---------50:26----------
nothing that makes sense to me nothing


---------50:29----------
that feels usable


---------50:31----------
or changeable what's their answer


---------50:40----------
the most common one is that there isn't


---------50:42----------
anyone like me


---------50:49----------
what do you think about that


---------50:52----------
that literal [ __ ] one what do i do


---------50:55----------
with that


---------50:56----------
everyone's unique it's the most generic


---------50:57----------
aspect of any living being ever we all


---------51:00----------
have unique experiences we all have


---------51:02----------
unique personalities


---------51:04----------
we're all individuals i literally can't


---------51:07----------
do anything about


---------51:08----------
that


---------51:09----------
[Laughter]


---------51:11----------
it doesn't help me at all


---------51:16----------
how does it make so sure you can't do


---------51:18----------
anything about it


---------51:20----------
how does it make you feel


---------51:23----------
defeated why


---------51:26----------
what's defeated because if they could


---------51:30----------
give me an


---------51:30----------
answer that i could use to change the


---------51:32----------
direction this


---------51:33----------
the shipwreck if we're gonna go with the


---------51:35----------
siren analogy okay it's actually a good


---------51:37----------
one right because it ends up as a


---------51:38----------
shipwreck


---------51:40----------
yeah and it's like i'm not singing


---------51:42----------
because i want the seamen to come and


---------51:44----------
crash


---------51:44----------
on the rocks i'm singing because i'm


---------51:46----------
alone and i want to enjoy something and


---------51:48----------
have fun and be myself i'm singing


---------51:49----------
because i like the song


---------51:51----------
not because i like them they're the ones


---------51:52----------
throwing themselves at me


---------51:54----------
and the only other option is to sit


---------51:56----------
there silently


---------51:57----------
alone and not be myself which would make


---------52:00----------
me miserable


---------52:01----------
and so i i kind of feel like i want to


---------52:04----------
sing my song i want to be myself i just


---------52:06----------
don't want it to be


---------52:08----------
a shipwreck for everyone around me and


---------52:11----------
none of the answers i'm getting are


---------52:13----------
helping me avoid it


---------52:19----------
i'm gonna need to think about that is


---------52:21----------
that cool


---------52:32----------
someone just said wait till you're in


---------52:33----------
your 30s i am in my 30s


---------52:36----------
[Laughter]


---------52:44----------
owned


---------52:52----------
[Laughter]


---------52:53----------
people always like oh it must be so hard


---------52:56----------
people liking you all the time boo hoo


---------52:58----------
and no one empathizes with me


---------53:00----------
but the thing is as well i had this


---------53:01----------
illusion that it was all going to end


---------53:03----------
it's kind of tragic how as well


---------53:05----------
because when i was like 9 or 10 like i


---------53:07----------
would go to like


---------53:09----------
parties and stuff and like people's


---------53:12----------
people who were had wives in the next


---------53:15----------
room


---------53:15----------
were hitting on me in their 40s and i


---------53:18----------
thought and this and it was creepy and


---------53:19----------
uncomfortable and what i learned from it


---------53:21----------
was


---------53:22----------
oh there are a lot of dudes who crave


---------53:24----------
young people


---------53:25----------
like when i'm a young teenager when i've


---------53:28----------
just hit puberty and stuff this is gonna


---------53:29----------
be a problem


---------53:30----------
but when i'm a grown-up people won't


---------53:32----------
even like me even if i get a husband


---------53:34----------
they won't even like me and i'll be free


---------53:36----------
and i watch this go on and on and on for


---------53:38----------
my mom she's now 50


---------53:40----------
and it's still the same problem and i'm


---------53:42----------
losing hope because i'm 30 and i have


---------53:44----------
more people doing this to me than ever


---------53:53----------
okay man there's just so much here okay


---------53:57----------
hmm so many directions let me try to let


---------54:00----------
me try to tie one thing up


---------54:02----------
just something for you to think about so


---------54:04----------
here's what i see i see like


---------54:06----------
as a scientist i'm making observations


---------54:08----------
and what i see is that your


---------54:09----------
you and your mom seem to be sirens of


---------54:12----------
some sort


---------54:13----------
right so the interesting thing is that


---------54:14----------
the fact that there's something going on


---------54:16----------
here and it's not just the way of the


---------54:18----------
world and there's something either that


---------54:19----------
you were doing


---------54:21----------
or exuding that


---------54:24----------
causes people or influences people to


---------54:27----------
react to you in the way that they do


---------54:29----------
i think the fact that your mom does it


---------54:31----------
or it's happening to your mom


---------54:33----------
makes it more likely that there's


---------54:35----------
something going on here


---------54:36----------
right so either it's genetic or it's


---------54:38----------
like behavioral


---------54:40----------
and because we internalize the


---------54:42----------
mannerisms of our parents


---------54:45----------
right so so like you know my kids do


---------54:48----------
some of the things that i do and it's


---------54:49----------
kind of like


---------54:50----------
it's weird because i'm kind of academic


---------54:53----------
and then you know my kids will sometimes


---------54:54----------
be like academic with me


---------54:56----------
it's kind of bizarre but like we pick


---------54:57----------
things up from our family


---------54:59----------
so i think you've picked something up or


---------55:01----------
there's some sort of genetic pheromone


---------55:02----------
kind of business going on


---------55:04----------
where like we can sort of accept that in


---------55:06----------
a bizarre way in


---------55:08----------
in sort of an outlier way that men and


---------55:10----------
women even


---------55:11----------
so that's the real thing right it's like


---------55:12----------
you can have female friends


---------55:15----------
who will fall in love with you and


---------55:16----------
become sexually attracted to you as well


---------55:19----------
and so there's something going on here


---------55:20----------
so if there's a phenomenon that is an


---------55:22----------
outlier


---------55:24----------
it's my experience as both both a


---------55:26----------
scientist and a clinician


---------55:27----------
that there's a pattern there there's


---------55:29----------
like some kind of like order to that


---------55:31----------
and if we try to look at it we may find


---------55:33----------
something


---------55:35----------
with me so


---------55:38----------
and i'm going to toss out one thing


---------55:39----------
which maybe i've talked to you about


---------55:40----------
before but i think


---------55:42----------
one potential hypothesis because i've


---------55:44----------
seen this in women before


---------55:45----------
so i worked with a few women who are you


---------55:48----------
know


---------55:49----------
the men just seem to be like


---------55:52----------
drawn to them like moths to a flame


---------55:56----------
and what i tend to find actually is that


---------55:59----------
some of these women i think


---------56:01----------
you know this is going to sound kind of


---------56:02----------
weird but i'm going to use some


---------56:03----------
terminology from like


---------56:05----------
the system of like yoga and the hindu


---------56:07----------
tradition


---------56:08----------
because i think it captures


---------56:11----------
it's a way of describing the world that


---------56:13----------
i think we don't really have good words


---------56:15----------
or concepts in the west


---------56:18----------
so in in the tradition of yoga or more


---------56:22----------
specifically


---------56:22----------
tantra tantra they sort of


---------56:25----------
talk about a feminine energy and so that


---------56:28----------
like if you think about the capacity


---------56:30----------
to create life like comes from women it


---------56:32----------
doesn't come from men


---------56:33----------
so the male contribution is generally


---------56:35----------
speaking minimal


---------56:37----------
and that like if you really think about


---------56:38----------
like you know


---------56:40----------
creating a new organism is primarily


---------56:42----------
something that women do


---------56:44----------
men don't do and so they sort of


---------56:47----------
equate this to like this kind of


---------56:49----------
feminine energy


---------56:50----------
which is also like sort of maternal in


---------56:53----------
nature and if we kind of think about


---------56:54----------
like


---------56:55----------
anthropology and sort of the idea of


---------56:57----------
like maternal figure ads


---------57:00----------
like figures and sort of like feminine


---------57:02----------
energy like maternal energy


---------57:04----------
we can even think about it like you know


---------57:06----------
we call earth a mother


---------57:08----------
right so it's like mother earth and so


---------57:10----------
like that which gives life and that


---------57:12----------
which sustains us you can kind of look


---------57:14----------
at it


---------57:14----------
in a literary fashion you can look at it


---------57:16----------
sort of in an energetic fashion which is


---------57:19----------
kind of how the east looks at it my


---------57:21----------
sense is that you have an


---------57:23----------
energy right because it's weird it's


---------57:25----------
like it's not just in your behaviors


---------57:27----------
it's not


---------57:28----------
if we look at it scientifically we can


---------57:30----------
say it's not the way you look because


---------57:32----------
you look


---------57:32----------
average it's not what you wear because


---------57:34----------
you've changed that so you've adjusted


---------57:36----------
all of these variables and despite


---------57:40----------
any of those variables being adjusted it


---------57:41----------
makes no difference


---------57:43----------
therefore those variables are not those


---------57:46----------
are independent


---------57:47----------
of whatever this thing is and the best


---------57:50----------
the best words i can give you is that


---------57:52----------
you've got a particular energy


---------57:54----------
and i've seen this before because


---------57:55----------
sometimes what happens is like you're


---------57:57----------
just this authentic person


---------57:59----------
and that's the answer that you get when


---------58:01----------
you ask people why are you in love with


---------58:02----------
me and they say


---------58:03----------
you're just you right so there's


---------58:06----------
something incredibly pure


---------58:08----------
about like what you give off to other


---------58:11----------
people


---------58:12----------
and so i think that that frankly a lot


---------58:14----------
of men are are so


---------58:16----------
starved for authenticity


---------58:19----------
and acceptance and like you accept them


---------58:21----------
as a pure friend


---------58:23----------
right like you don't think about them in


---------58:25----------
loss


---------58:26----------
in terms of lust you don't think about


---------58:28----------
them in terms of rejecting them for


---------58:30----------
being a romantic partner or accepting


---------58:32----------
them for a romantic partner


---------58:34----------
you treat them for who they are and you


---------58:36----------
want just a pure friendship


---------58:38----------
with nothing else on the line and that


---------58:41----------
kind of like


---------58:42----------
authenticity and almost like maternal


---------58:44----------
acceptance


---------58:46----------
right it's almost like you're like a mom


---------58:48----------
who's like you just be you and i'll


---------58:49----------
accept you for who you are


---------58:51----------
all of your flaws i've tried to fix


---------58:53----------
people and that [ __ ] doesn't work


---------58:54----------
so i'm not gonna do that anymore i'm


---------58:56----------
just gonna take you for who you are and


---------58:58----------
we can hang out from time to time


---------59:00----------
i won't judge you i won't fall in love


---------59:02----------
with you i won't expect you to buy me


---------59:03----------
dinner


---------59:04----------
i won't do any of that i'm just going to


---------59:05----------
be me and you're just going to be you


---------59:08----------
and it's going to be cool and we're


---------59:09----------
going to hang out we're going to have a


---------59:10----------
good time


---------59:13----------
and there's something incredibly


---------59:14----------
refreshing about that because that's not


---------59:16----------
the world we live in


---------59:18----------
right the world that we live in is one


---------59:19----------
of judgment


---------59:21----------
and you're not good enough and i want


---------59:23----------
you to be this and i should be more of


---------59:24----------
this and i should be less of this


---------59:27----------
social media i should be taller i should


---------59:30----------
make more money i'm on tinder and i'm


---------59:33----------
five eight and they're all these


---------59:34----------
profiles that say if you're under six


---------59:36----------
feet no need to apply


---------59:38----------
and along comes anita


---------59:41----------
and anita accepts me for who i am


---------59:44----------
and then this is kind of unfortunate for


---------59:46----------
you but then what happens is like these


---------59:48----------
dudes get confused


---------59:50----------
and what i mean by that is that like uh


---------59:54----------
my gender often times doesn't


---------59:57----------
understand what we feel and we've


---------60:00----------
actually been


---------60:01----------
conditioned to like equate some things


---------60:05----------
like


---------60:05----------
pure acceptance with a romantic


---------60:07----------
relationship


---------60:08----------
because yeah i i agree with you but i


---------60:11----------
found a different path to the same


---------60:13----------
conclusion


---------60:14----------
a while back you see for me i don't


---------60:16----------
really believe in femininity and


---------60:18----------
masculinity i think that if we deny that


---------60:20----------
um men are nurturing and caring then why


---------60:23----------
do we let them be fathers like i think


---------60:25----------
paternity is a thing i think that


---------60:27----------
the differences between the male and


---------60:28----------
female brain are usually socially


---------60:30----------
conditioned because


---------60:32----------
we live in a society that benefits um


---------60:35----------
from financially from


---------60:36----------
diverting 50 of labor to an unpaid group


---------60:40----------
and if you make um nurturing and


---------60:42----------
expectation


---------60:44----------
you get free caring for the elderly and


---------60:46----------
young you get free nurses you get you


---------60:48----------
get to pay them a lower wage yeah this


---------60:50----------
is your job you're a woman you're


---------60:51----------
supposed to take care of people


---------60:52----------
they become the therapists and the


---------60:54----------
cleaners and the people who just


---------60:55----------
maintain [ __ ] in the home


---------60:57----------
if 50 of the workforce is an unpaid or


---------61:00----------
lower paid group and


---------61:01----------
particularly all the fields that women


---------61:03----------
dominate are on a low paid


---------61:05----------
then you know it benefits society i


---------61:07----------
noticed that pattern but then there were


---------61:08----------
loads of studies that reinforced it if


---------61:09----------
you put people in a submissive


---------61:11----------
permission position tell them they're


---------61:13----------
not as good or lower than


---------61:14----------
some sort of way they immediately adopt


---------61:16----------
feminine traits


---------61:17----------
regardless of their gender so they'll


---------61:19----------
start grooming


---------61:20----------
taking care of people sucking up to


---------61:22----------
people it's it's a thing that people put


---------61:24----------
into a group of submission dude not


---------61:26----------
specifically a female


---------61:28----------
thing i've read lots of studies by


---------61:30----------
neuroscientists who are saying like the


---------61:31----------
differences between the male and female


---------61:33----------
brain are being over represented and


---------61:34----------
that you know i don't think it's because


---------61:36----------
women are naturally nurturing


---------61:38----------
i think that it's because we don't tell


---------61:39----------
dudes it's okay to feel


---------61:41----------
from a young age we point them and go


---------61:42----------
big boys don't cry shut up


---------61:44----------
this is beneath you only women do this


---------61:46----------
but you're strong you're better you're a


---------61:47----------
man you don't cry you don't emote and we


---------61:49----------
don't give dudes the


---------61:50----------
permission or the space to explore their


---------61:52----------
feelings and verbalize them from a young


---------61:54----------
age and a lot of people grow up going i


---------61:55----------
don't know how i feel sometimes i feel


---------61:56----------
angry sometimes i feel lust and these


---------61:58----------
are the two


---------61:59----------
most represented male emotions in media


---------62:02----------
they beat up their problems and they


---------62:03----------
[ __ ] all the women and so we give


---------62:04----------
permission to be honey and we give


---------62:06----------
permission to be angry or in control but


---------62:08----------
we don't give permission to be


---------62:09----------
vulnerable we don't give permission to


---------62:10----------
self-assess to talk about feelings and a


---------62:12----------
lot of people there's much more suicide


---------62:14----------
among men


---------62:15----------
than women and when you listen to them


---------62:17----------
they're saying i didn't have room to


---------62:18----------
speak


---------62:18----------
i didn't i felt like people would call


---------62:20----------
me a [ __ ] i didn't have room to be


---------62:22----------
vulnerable i thought i had to be a


---------62:23----------
protector


---------62:24----------
and so when you put men in this position


---------62:26----------
in their friend groups if you talk about


---------62:27----------
your feelings you're a [ __ ] and people


---------62:29----------
are scared to speak up


---------62:30----------
and from that position that's so


---------62:33----------
socially conditioned


---------62:34----------
position um when you make a friend who


---------62:38----------
lets you talk about your feelings when


---------62:39----------
you make a friend who isn't vying for


---------62:41----------
dominance when you make a friend who


---------62:42----------
doesn't expect you to be a man


---------62:43----------
they expect you to be yourself you see


---------62:45----------
it as a form of intimacy


---------62:47----------
and the thing is that's so different to


---------62:49----------
a female friendship because when i'm


---------62:50----------
with girls


---------62:51----------
we talk about our feelings and our


---------62:53----------
dreams we're allowed to be vulnerable


---------62:55----------
nobody cares nobody judges in that


---------62:56----------
environment it's fine


---------62:58----------
and so when women take that level of


---------63:00----------
friendship that they've grown up being


---------63:01----------
used to


---------63:02----------
and do that with a dude they're like


---------63:03----------
i've never had this before this person


---------63:05----------
cares what i have to say they're


---------63:06----------
invested in my feelings they don't judge


---------63:08----------
me


---------63:08----------
and it's a unique kind of friendship and


---------63:10----------
to a woman this looks like friendship


---------63:12----------
into a dude this looks like a form of


---------63:13----------
intimacy they've never experienced


---------63:15----------
before and so it feels like a higher


---------63:17----------
level of closeness than a friendship and


---------63:19----------
i've seen this happen a thousand times


---------63:21----------
even with other people's friendships


---------63:22----------
i've seen that mistake and i know it i


---------63:24----------
know it exists


---------63:25----------
i know that king of the hill without it


---------63:27----------
is such a relief and that friendships


---------63:29----------
where you get to be


---------63:29----------
have a break where you're not judged and


---------63:31----------
you are loved and you do have


---------63:33----------
a space to talk about who you are and


---------63:34----------
discover who you are some people like i


---------63:36----------
didn't know who i was or i didn't know


---------63:37----------
how i felt about things until i met you


---------63:39----------
giving guys space to be themselves


---------63:41----------
unjudged is a


---------63:42----------
really favorite thing of mine tell guys


---------63:44----------
they're beautiful compliment the way


---------63:45----------
they look because they don't hear it


---------63:46----------
enough that sort of thing


---------63:48----------
but i make it clear from the beginning


---------63:49----------
that i do this with all of my friends i


---------63:51----------
do it to other friends in front of them


---------63:52----------
so they know it's not floating


---------63:54----------
i also talk about how it gets


---------63:55----------
misconstrued as flowing so they know


---------63:57----------
that this is a thing


---------63:58----------
and they'll still overestimate the way


---------64:01----------
they feel around me


---------64:02----------
and assume i feel it too even if i start


---------64:04----------
avoiding them when they try to indulge


---------64:06----------
it


---------64:06----------
and so look i've communicated about this


---------64:08----------
aspect i'm not gonna drop the way i'm


---------64:10----------
friends with people i think it's


---------64:11----------
important to show people that they can


---------64:13----------
be supported whether no matter what


---------64:15----------
dangly doodads they got going on in


---------64:16----------
their pants


---------64:17----------
i'm gonna treat a dude the same way i


---------64:18----------
treat a woman and that's fine and i'll


---------64:20----------
let them know it


---------64:20----------
often gets misconstrued and if they


---------64:22----------
still misconstrue it that's [ __ ] on


---------64:24----------
them but i swear to god i make sure they


---------64:26----------
have all the information there and they


---------64:27----------
still do it


---------64:29----------
and like i've literally told every male


---------64:31----------
friend ever that i have to tell guys to


---------64:33----------
stop hitting on me


---------64:34----------
and that if i want to be with someone


---------64:36----------
i'll make it known first


---------64:37----------
and i hate it when people hit on me and


---------64:40----------
they still do it


---------64:45----------
okay so then let me ask you a question


---------64:49----------
so if you make things crystal clear for


---------64:52----------
them


---------64:53----------
what effect do you think that has


---------64:57----------
on all the societal stuff you talked


---------64:59----------
about


---------65:00----------
none i don't try to change that no no


---------65:03----------
but like you're saying


---------65:04----------
they've been conditioned right and so


---------65:07----------
you tell them hey


---------65:08----------
i'm just gonna be like friends with you


---------65:10----------
this is something


---------65:11----------
we discuss things that are emotionally


---------65:14----------
sensitive i do it with all my friends


---------65:16----------
i'm gonna do it with you too because


---------65:18----------
that's who i am


---------65:20----------
and then they discuss their emotions you


---------65:23----------
guys become


---------65:24----------
an intimacy of a different kind


---------65:27----------
and then what do you ex how do you


---------65:29----------
expect them to respond


---------65:33----------
well the thing is i


---------65:36----------
expect them to see it as friendship


---------65:38----------
because i've laid down how i am friends


---------65:40----------
with people


---------65:41----------
and they know this is how i interact


---------65:43----------
with people great


---------65:45----------
right so so i'm going to give you an


---------65:46----------
example that's sort of like a bizarre


---------65:48----------
counter example so sometimes


---------65:51----------
i work with men and women who


---------65:55----------
and unfortunately i think this is harder


---------65:58----------
sometimes on women but you'll


---------65:59----------
they'll have friends with benefits right


---------66:02----------
and then like


---------66:04----------
oftentimes what happens is people will


---------66:06----------
be crystal clear at the beginning and


---------66:08----------
they'll say like hey we're just friends


---------66:10----------
and from time to time we're going to


---------66:11----------
have like sexual relations


---------66:14----------
we're going to be friends with benefits


---------66:15----------
but i don't want to date you i'm going


---------66:18----------
to be super transparent


---------66:19----------
i'm not in love with you and then both


---------66:22----------
people agree


---------66:25----------
and then oftentimes what happens is like


---------66:27----------
one person catches feelings


---------66:31----------
right and then like the other person


---------66:32----------
gets kind of frustrated because they're


---------66:34----------
like hey we talked about this ahead of


---------66:36----------
time


---------66:38----------
like we said this was just friends and


---------66:39----------
benefits we had a conversation about it


---------66:41----------
i was very clear that i'm not interested


---------66:43----------
in a relationship


---------66:45----------
and then the other person is now pushing


---------66:47----------
for a relationship


---------66:50----------
does that scenario make sense to you or


---------66:53----------
i mean


---------66:53----------
i know that you tend to be in the


---------66:55----------
opposite kind of yeah


---------66:57----------
see what i see there is that you don't


---------66:59----------
choose how you feel


---------67:01----------
and that if you put yourself repeatedly


---------67:03----------
in a situation that people do often feel


---------67:05----------
in love that it happens


---------67:07----------
and the the sad thing about emotions is


---------67:09----------
they can escape


---------67:10----------
logic like you can understand how


---------67:12----------
something works


---------67:13----------
and still end up feeling it sure


---------67:16----------
absolutely right so as you said if you


---------67:19----------
put yourself in a situation that people


---------67:21----------
usually feel loved then like logic can


---------67:24----------
kind of go out the window


---------67:26----------
and and you know the emotions can start


---------67:29----------
to take over


---------67:30----------
so if we look at your relationships


---------67:32----------
where you're emotionally intimate with


---------67:33----------
people and you kind of explain to them


---------67:35----------
for the get-go hey this is what this is


---------67:37----------
this is not what this is and then you do


---------67:39----------
something that is


---------67:40----------
they've that men are sort of conditioned


---------67:43----------
to feel a particular way because usually


---------67:47----------
that kind of emotional intimacy comes


---------67:48----------
hand in hand with a relationship


---------67:51----------
then we can kind of see the result


---------67:54----------
right just like you said it's sort of


---------67:56----------
like you you're putting yourself in this


---------67:57----------
situation


---------67:59----------
where or they're putting themselves in a


---------68:01----------
situation where even though you've


---------68:02----------
explained things


---------68:04----------
all that logic which may be on some


---------68:05----------
level they understand can kind of go out


---------68:07----------
the window once they start catching


---------68:09----------
feelings because that's what we're


---------68:10----------
talking about right


---------68:11----------
is that they become really really


---------68:12----------
irrational with the way that they start


---------68:14----------
relating to you


---------68:16----------
and so i think that there's something to


---------68:18----------
be understood here now i'm not saying


---------68:20----------
that you need to


---------68:21----------
change the way that you interact with


---------68:23----------
your friends because you're allowed to


---------68:25----------
be you


---------68:26----------
but i i can sort of see like i think if


---------68:28----------
there's a pattern here there's


---------68:30----------
there's got to be a reason for it


---------68:33----------
yeah right and and now we get to to what


---------68:36----------
you said


---------68:37----------
earlier which is sort of like i don't


---------68:39----------
know what to do about it right because


---------68:41----------
you're not willing to compromise some


---------68:43----------
things and this gets back to the idea of


---------68:45----------
like


---------68:46----------
self blame for attraction and


---------68:48----------
responsibility for attraction and things


---------68:50----------
like that


---------68:50----------
and and this is where i i think you have


---------68:52----------
to be really really careful anita


---------68:54----------
because i think


---------68:56----------
there's something going on here which i


---------68:57----------
don't even think we've touched on and


---------68:59----------
i'm not sure what it is


---------69:02----------
there's some part of me that honestly


---------69:04----------
thinks that given your upbringing


---------69:07----------
there is some part of you so when you


---------69:09----------
when you have a child


---------69:11----------
whose needs are not met


---------69:14----------
right and what i mean by that is that


---------69:16----------
like it's not that anyone was abusive


---------69:18----------
towards you or anything like that but


---------69:19----------
that


---------69:20----------
literally like there was someone in your


---------69:23----------
household who demanded a lot of your


---------69:25----------
attention and you had to become a mother


---------69:27----------
very early


---------69:29----------
right and so when you have a situation


---------69:32----------
like that i'm not sure if any of this


---------69:34----------
actually applies to you because i


---------69:35----------
i can't actually detect it i'm just


---------69:37----------
letting you know oftentimes what i see


---------69:40----------
is that like there's a there's a


---------69:42----------
starving


---------69:43----------
for affection or there's a starving for


---------69:46----------
love or there's a starving for something


---------69:49----------
that that child carries with them


---------69:51----------
and i suspect that the thing that we may


---------69:53----------
be missing here


---------69:55----------
is that in some way you were starved for


---------69:58----------
what the people are giving you


---------70:00----------
because i think the really crazy thing


---------70:02----------
is that anytime i see a behavior in


---------70:04----------
someone


---------70:04----------
that seems really really harmful and


---------70:07----------
maladaptive


---------70:08----------
there's usually a damn good reason for


---------70:10----------
it


---------70:12----------
well here's the thing my response to


---------70:15----------
that though


---------70:16----------
is that i think i've already taken that


---------70:18----------
part of the journey


---------70:20----------
because when i was a kid first up we had


---------70:23----------
a we had like my mom had boyfriends


---------70:26----------
who'd come in and out of my


---------70:27----------
life i had like a father figure for a


---------70:29----------
while but he would snap


---------70:30----------
he would turn from he was in our lives


---------70:33----------
for nine years


---------70:35----------
i i was glad we pushed my


---------70:38----------
like we were pushed away from my dad i


---------70:40----------
was happy with that decision i was


---------70:41----------
surprised they stayed alone


---------70:42----------
together as long as they did i saw his


---------70:44----------
impact on other people that he ended up


---------70:46----------
raising i'm really glad


---------70:48----------
that we stepped away from him i do not


---------70:49----------
crave a father figure i did not crave a


---------70:51----------
father figure i was glad of the space


---------70:53----------
i've been escaping people my whole life


---------70:55----------
usually people were very dangerous


---------70:57----------
i used to go and break out of my house


---------70:59----------
in childhood and just go walking in the


---------71:01----------
graveyard at like 3am just to be away


---------71:03----------
further away no one was bothering me


---------71:05----------
just to be further away from humans


---------71:06----------
i was very comfortable even though i was


---------71:09----------
lonely


---------71:10----------
being away from people and pretty much


---------71:12----------
seeing them as a threat


---------71:13----------
and then i did feel very lonely for a


---------71:15----------
while and agrophobic and scared and sad


---------71:17----------
and alone


---------71:18----------
and i got in a chain of relationships


---------71:20----------
one for a year


---------71:21----------
one for six years another for six years


---------71:24----------
and so


---------71:24----------
i coped by putting all of my needs on


---------71:26----------
one person and it was very codependent


---------71:28----------
and unhealthy in a multitude of ways and


---------71:30----------
it made me put up with a lot of abuse


---------71:31----------
that i didn't and shouldn't have needed


---------71:33----------
to


---------71:34----------
um i came out of that developing a sense


---------71:36----------
of self proving to myself what i'm


---------71:37----------
capable of and looking for just


---------71:39----------
friends and in this whenever i make


---------71:41----------
friends with people


---------71:42----------
i don't crave attention i'm not the kind


---------71:44----------
of person who immediately reacts to dms


---------71:47----------
and needs to know what they say now i'm


---------71:48----------
not the kind of person who chases people


---------71:50----------
i never chase after people i'm kind of


---------71:53----------
really lazy friend when it comes to


---------71:55----------
arranging things and seeing people


---------71:56----------
i cannot see someone in months and still


---------71:58----------
feel good that i know them


---------71:59----------
and so i don't pursue people and i don't


---------72:01----------
feel particularly desperate for


---------72:02----------
attention


---------72:03----------
um and so from that perspective i don't


---------72:06----------
feel like these people fulfill a need


---------72:08----------
i the only need i have now is i want


---------72:10----------
platonic friendships i


---------72:12----------
i kind of feel like i don't need the


---------72:14----------
attention and i feel very very


---------72:15----------
comfortable without it i spend a lot of


---------72:17----------
time alone and i don't get bored of it


---------72:19----------
or desperate for affection or attention


---------72:21----------
but i do think that i did go through a


---------72:22----------
time where i had that need


---------72:24----------
and i used to seek it in relationships i


---------72:26----------
saw unhealthy how unhealthy it was i


---------72:28----------
worked through it i got over there i got


---------72:30----------
out of that situation


---------72:31----------
but with me i kind of feel as well


---------72:34----------
um i don't think that these people do


---------72:36----------
fulfill a need i feel endlessly


---------72:39----------
like they don't fulfill a need because


---------72:41----------
they are


---------72:42----------
looking to [ __ ] me and it feels too


---------72:45----------
conceited to recognize what's going on


---------72:47----------
early


---------72:48----------
so i go through this place where i they


---------72:49----------
keep pushing my boundaries


---------72:52----------
anita let me ask you a question so so


---------72:54----------
this is really helpful


---------72:55----------
do you think that's being someone who


---------72:58----------
continuously needs to be


---------73:00----------
[ __ ] and and being really frustrated


---------73:04----------
does that feeling of who you are fulfill


---------73:07----------
any kind of need


---------73:11----------
what you mean what it's a weird ass


---------73:14----------
question


---------73:14----------
yeah absolutely so not their behavior


---------73:18----------
okay but their behavior makes you feel


---------73:22----------
like a particular kind of person


---------73:29----------
right so you feel a particular way


---------73:32----------
when they treat you a certain way right


---------73:36----------
and that way that way feels painful


---------73:39----------
yeah right i know it sounds really weird


---------73:43----------
really really weird i'll give you an


---------73:44----------
example in a second does


---------73:46----------
feeling that way feel


---------73:50----------
comfortable or right to you in some way


---------73:55----------
it feels familiar and i know that people


---------73:58----------
tend to do this awful dance with things


---------74:00----------
that feel familiar and if it's not


---------74:02----------
really what they want


---------74:03----------
yep it's called a life trap people get


---------74:06----------
trapped in a pattern of behavior where


---------74:08----------
they don't want it but they've known it


---------74:09----------
their whole lives and don't know how to


---------74:10----------
be anything else


---------74:12----------
and this is why people who were sexually


---------74:13----------
abused as children are more likely to


---------74:15----------
end up becoming sex workers


---------74:16----------
even if it's a very painful thing for


---------74:18----------
them and they don't really want to be


---------74:19----------
there it's so familiar that it ends up


---------74:21----------
being a life trap


---------74:22----------
and this is one example of many people


---------74:24----------
who relive something


---------74:25----------
freud recognized it as repetition


---------74:27----------
compulsion and it's one of the few


---------74:28----------
things that he


---------74:30----------
threw out there and it actually stuck um


---------74:32----------
he was wrong about a lot of things but


---------74:33----------
repetition compulsion is still something


---------74:35----------
that therapists recognize and work


---------74:36----------
around and you know


---------74:38----------
point out in people to this day and i


---------74:40----------
knew about this from a young age i read


---------74:41----------
about it when i was like nine or ten


---------74:44----------
after going through some pretty


---------74:45----------
horrendous things myself this is why i


---------74:47----------
felt like i avoided that sort of life


---------74:49----------
trap where i'd end up


---------74:51----------
in a lot of the positions that people


---------74:52----------
with [ __ ] up lives do


---------74:54----------
because i knew that there'd be a risk


---------74:55----------
factor for it and the familiarity with


---------74:57----------
it


---------74:58----------
and so i know exactly what you're trying


---------75:00----------
to point out here am i purposely


---------75:02----------
unwittingly


---------75:03----------
putting myself in positions where that


---------75:04----------
are familiar


---------75:06----------
as a trap almost like a repetition


---------75:08----------
compulsion


---------75:09----------
that's literally what i was thinking


---------75:11----------
about


---------75:13----------
because i've already explored this and


---------75:16----------
what's your sense


---------75:19----------
um so i think this was the reason why i


---------75:22----------
tried so many different approaches


---------75:24----------
at interacting with people and to loads


---------75:27----------
of different people i thought if i


---------75:28----------
hung out with people who were generally


---------75:30----------
very nice that maybe mean people


---------75:32----------
wouldn't hang out with me and you know


---------75:34----------
i wouldn't on all sorts no no but that's


---------75:37----------
why you tried to do what you do what do


---------75:38----------
you think about it though


---------75:42----------
do i think that i'm in a situation of


---------75:44----------
repetition compulsion


---------75:46----------
yes i think i would have to be able to


---------75:49----------
accurately assess


---------75:51----------
why people like me to be able to


---------75:54----------
introduce it


---------75:55----------
purposely i feel like it's difficult to


---------75:58----------
pin


---------75:58----------
i where i went with that is like can i


---------76:01----------
pinpoint a time where i try to make


---------76:03----------
people attracted to me where i've hit on


---------76:05----------
them or done things that might seem


---------76:07----------
seductive


---------76:08----------
and then looked back on it and blamed


---------76:10----------
myself and been like yeah my bad or


---------76:11----------
whatever


---------76:12----------
i can't find anything i need to suggest


---------76:15----------
okay


---------76:16----------
you're so so here's the thing so so


---------76:18----------
first of all it may not be repetition


---------76:20----------
compulsion but sure as hell sounds like


---------76:22----------
it


---------76:22----------
okay so let me let me explain to people


---------76:24----------
because [ __ ] a you were really smart


---------76:26----------
i mean i'm very impressed


---------76:28----------
so here's here's so this is why i'm


---------76:30----------
going to just lay it out for you okay so


---------76:31----------
a lot of times i have to like


---------76:33----------
like lead people to it or try to catch


---------76:35----------
him with it or something like that but


---------76:37----------
it's great


---------76:37----------
so i was absolutely leaning towards the


---------76:39----------
repetition convulsive compulsion so


---------76:41----------
let's talk about it


---------76:42----------
so the first thing is that you have a


---------76:44----------
pattern in your social interactions


---------76:45----------
right you're an outlier


---------76:47----------
your mom is an outlier so what does that


---------76:50----------
tell us so either you have something


---------76:53----------
either you know there's either there's a


---------76:56----------
cognitive bias where you're not really


---------76:57----------
an outlier


---------76:58----------
or there's something going on that


---------77:02----------
is causing people to treat you a


---------77:05----------
particular way


---------77:06----------
and then what happens is that you say


---------77:08----------
like okay if if i'm the issue then i'm


---------77:10----------
gonna change myself and you tried that


---------77:12----------
because you're a scientist at heart


---------77:14----------
right so you tried wearing a trench coat


---------77:16----------
you tried doing this you tried doing


---------77:17----------
that you tried doing this you tried to


---------77:18----------
change yourself


---------77:20----------
and then you're like [ __ ] this i'm gonna


---------77:21----------
stop blaming myself for people being


---------77:23----------
attracted to me


---------77:24----------
it's not on me it's on them then you


---------77:27----------
went the route of let me try to change


---------77:28----------
them


---------77:29----------
because that's where the problem is and


---------77:30----------
that didn't work either


---------77:32----------
right and so then you're like okay well


---------77:34----------
now i don't know what to do because no


---------77:35----------
matter what i do i find myself in the


---------77:36----------
situation


---------77:37----------
if i change myself it doesn't work if i


---------77:38----------
change them it doesn't work i'm screwed


---------77:40----------
no matter which way i do it it's


---------77:41----------
incredibly frustrating i'm incredibly


---------77:43----------
angry and then you say


---------77:44----------
okay fine so if this is the repetition


---------77:46----------
compulsion what i need to do is look at


---------77:48----------
people that i'm attracted to


---------77:50----------
whereas i think that's actually this is


---------77:53----------
where hopefully i can help you


---------77:55----------
i don't think that's the case that you


---------77:57----------
need to look at in fact i think it's the


---------77:58----------
exact


---------77:59----------
opposite of the case that you need to


---------78:00----------
look at what i would suspect


---------78:04----------
okay and this is by suspect i don't


---------78:06----------
necessarily think this is true i mean


---------78:07----------
this is a hypothesis that needs to be


---------78:09----------
tested


---------78:10----------
okay so i'm going to put it to you


---------78:11----------
plainly


---------78:13----------
i want you to find a case where you do


---------78:16----------
have a friend


---------78:17----------
where you really have a friend because


---------78:19----------
what you're telling me is that the


---------78:20----------
the relationship evolves over time right


---------78:24----------
at the beginning so sure there's the


---------78:25----------
barrage of dicks but the real


---------78:27----------
tragedy sure people dehumanize you all


---------78:30----------
they want to do is get their willy wet


---------78:32----------
whatever you want to call it


---------78:33----------
there's that camp of people but the real


---------78:35----------
tragedy anita really what


---------78:37----------
the place where my heart goes out to you


---------78:38----------
is that there are some people who don't


---------78:40----------
start out in that camp


---------78:42----------
and then suddenly they transform on you


---------78:45----------
and that's what sounds like it real


---------78:47----------
sucks a bag of dicks


---------78:49----------
right that's what's really awful is that


---------78:51----------
you have people who


---------78:52----------
are your friends and then like this


---------78:56----------
beast comes out of them where they like


---------78:58----------
turn into everyone else


---------79:01----------
the explanation i've heard is that they


---------79:02----------
had the intentions


---------79:04----------
from the start they just didn't feel


---------79:06----------
comfortable


---------79:07----------
expressing them and so


---------79:10----------
yeah i wonder how many are people that


---------79:13----------
grew


---------79:14----------
an attraction and how many people were


---------79:16----------
just playing the long game


---------79:17----------
because i've had people throw tantrums


---------79:20----------
you know the


---------79:21----------
nice guys who are like i listened to


---------79:23----------
your problems i hung out with you


---------79:25----------
i believe one time yeah and they're like


---------79:28----------
i'd like to cash in


---------79:30----------
i'd like to cash in all of those things


---------79:32----------
now yeah turning in my tickets


---------79:34----------
yeah absolutely exactly and you know you


---------79:37----------
get a lot of people who


---------79:39----------
um this is why i always get scared about


---------79:41----------
talking about demisexuality it took me i


---------79:42----------
made a video about it explaining what it


---------79:44----------
was it took


---------79:45----------
demo sexuality i'm not attracted to


---------79:49----------
people at all


---------79:50----------
i i am unreceptive to visual stimuli i


---------79:52----------
thought i was asexual for so [ __ ]


---------79:54----------
long


---------79:55----------
and it turns out that i need a


---------79:56----------
long-standing emotional connection and a


---------79:58----------
sense of familiarity


---------79:59----------
to see people through a sexual lens i


---------80:01----------
can't feel attracted to strangers i've


---------80:03----------
never had a crush on a celebrity


---------80:04----------
nothing it just does not work lady boner


---------80:07----------
does not happen to porn


---------80:08----------
nothing turns out that there is a group


---------80:10----------
of people like this there are people


---------80:11----------
most people are capable of crushing


---------80:13----------
we're not i have never felt attracted to


---------80:15----------
anyone i didn't know and it's usually


---------80:17----------
people i've only known for a few years


---------80:18----------
that i've ever been able to see


---------80:20----------
in a sexual way or be attracted to ever


---------80:22----------
and so this is called demisexuality so


---------80:24----------
that people can connect with people


---------80:25----------
who are like this too because it kind of


---------80:28----------
feels alien in a society where tinder


---------80:30----------
exists and you look at people's face


---------80:32----------
and you swipe and you know whether or


---------80:34----------
not you want to sleep with them based on


---------80:35----------
that one trait alone from the start


---------80:37----------
and so a lot of people a lot of people


---------80:39----------
are lacking that and i just am lacking


---------80:41----------
it it's dead i don't know what happened


---------80:43----------
i was just born without the ability to


---------80:44----------
just be attracted to strangers


---------80:46----------
just can't um and you wouldn't think


---------80:48----------
that was a unusual thing plenty of


---------80:50----------
people oh i prefer


---------80:51----------
a connection too but you can watch porn


---------80:54----------
and you can like have


---------80:55----------
a celebrity crush and [ __ ] like you are


---------80:57----------
capable of a superficial attraction


---------80:59----------
i'm just not and um it comes with trials


---------81:02----------
and tribulations


---------81:03----------
but i'm so scared about talking about it


---------81:06----------
because it makes people play the long


---------81:07----------
game


---------81:08----------
so like i when i make new friends with


---------81:10----------
guys and stuff i don't say it


---------81:12----------
i don't talk about it and you know


---------81:14----------
people ask me what i look for in a man


---------81:16----------
all the time


---------81:16----------
in chat and i'm just like why would it


---------81:18----------
tell you what to pretend to be to get


---------81:20----------
close to me


---------81:21----------
like i'm so wary about it but um


---------81:25----------
yeah i do have to wonder like it's so


---------81:27----------
hard i know where you're trying to lead


---------81:28----------
me here


---------81:29----------
and i've thought about it too um where


---------81:32----------
am i trying to lead you


---------81:34----------
well you're trying to lead me down the


---------81:37----------
well what makes


---------81:37----------
people suddenly be attracted to me


---------81:39----------
during a friendship and it's so hard to


---------81:41----------
collate the data on whether that's


---------81:43----------
actually the problem


---------81:44----------
or if a lot of people disguise their


---------81:46----------
attraction to me and wait


---------81:47----------
because they know it takes a long time


---------81:49----------
for me to know whether i'm attracted to


---------81:51----------
anybody in the first place


---------81:53----------
um and so it's very very difficult for


---------81:55----------
me to assess reliably


---------81:57----------
at all whether or not it's true that


---------81:59----------
friends fall in love with me


---------82:01----------
or people just play the long game so i


---------82:03----------
think i think that's


---------82:04----------
that's actually like a great answer


---------82:07----------
because that tells us i think where the


---------82:09----------
darkness


---------82:10----------
and potentially where the answer is


---------82:13----------
right so like you're saying it's hard


---------82:15----------
for you to assess and i think that's


---------82:16----------
exactly why you're in this situation


---------82:18----------
because


---------82:19----------
i one of the hypotheses so there's a


---------82:21----------
number of hypotheses right


---------82:23----------
and and i would say that given


---------82:25----------
everything


---------82:26----------
about your history


---------82:29----------
this reeks of something like repetition


---------82:31----------
compulsion or


---------82:33----------
something like pheromones and i tend to


---------82:36----------
put more stock in the former than the


---------82:38----------
latter


---------82:38----------
and what i'm really really curious about


---------82:41----------
i would love to see if there are


---------82:42----------
interactions that you have with people


---------82:45----------
who are potentially friends which you


---------82:47----------
unwittingly push into a weird space


---------82:53----------
right and that may be something as


---------82:55----------
simple as someone who is actually could


---------82:57----------
be a friend of yours


---------82:59----------
you or like it could be like a weird


---------83:01----------
kind of selection bias where you say


---------83:03----------
you're not really good at keeping up


---------83:05----------
with friends and so there may be like


---------83:07----------
let's say that there are 10


---------83:09----------
people that you encounter and you're not


---------83:11----------
good at keeping up with friends so the


---------83:13----------
ones that would actually end up being


---------83:14----------
friends


---------83:15----------
you sort of don't keep up with and who's


---------83:17----------
left are the people who are secretly


---------83:19----------
obsessed


---------83:21----------
yeah that that is something that has


---------83:23----------
been running a theory of mine for a


---------83:25----------
while


---------83:26----------
right so that's why um yeah because um


---------83:30----------
yeah people who wake up every day and


---------83:32----------
ask how you're doing in the morning and


---------83:33----------
say good night at night


---------83:35----------
like most of my friends aren't like that


---------83:36----------
but the people who are interested in me


---------83:37----------
will try to talk to me every single day


---------83:39----------
even if they don't always cry


---------83:41----------
yeah so so so i mean there are a lot of


---------83:44----------
things going on here which i think like


---------83:46----------
like whether wittingly or unwittingly


---------83:48----------
like


---------83:49----------
their influences and this is kind of


---------83:51----------
what i was saying where i'm not saying


---------83:52----------
that you should blame yourself for like


---------83:54----------
being in this situation


---------83:55----------
sort of it's not really about blame it's


---------83:57----------
about recognizing that


---------83:58----------
if there's a pattern in your life


---------84:01----------
thinking about it critically looking at


---------84:03----------
it critically which clearly you've done


---------84:05----------
a shitload of


---------84:06----------
and i think that's why i mean it's


---------84:08----------
amazing anita how far you've come


---------84:10----------
given the hand that you were dealt and


---------84:13----------
and that's what actually frankly is so


---------84:14----------
gratifying


---------84:15----------
to me about having this conversation is


---------84:17----------
because i've seen people who are at


---------84:19----------
every stage of where you are but i've


---------84:21----------
never actually seen someone at this


---------84:22----------
stage


---------84:23----------
i've seen people who are in the six-year


---------84:25----------
codependent relationship because their


---------84:26----------
mother was sick


---------84:27----------
when they were growing up and they


---------84:28----------
learned how to be like a mother at a


---------84:30----------
young age i've seen that


---------84:32----------
right i've seen it right so you've been


---------84:34----------
all of those things and now you're in


---------84:36----------
this really weird


---------84:37----------
kind of situation where unfortunately


---------84:39----------
one of the real challenges in life is


---------84:41----------
that


---------84:41----------
when we solve the as we solve problems


---------84:44----------
they start to get more and more subtle


---------84:47----------
right so you've done a lot of personal


---------84:48----------
growth you've developed a lot of


---------84:50----------
confidence


---------84:50----------
you've tried to change yourself for


---------84:52----------
other people you've tried to change


---------84:53----------
other people you figured out know that


---------84:54----------
stuff works


---------84:55----------
so now we're getting to this yoga talks


---------84:57----------
a lot about this that like


---------84:58----------
the most difficult problems to solve are


---------85:00----------
the subtlest


---------85:03----------
and i think what we're really dealing


---------85:04----------
with is like really really small stuff


---------85:06----------
probably in the early stages of your


---------85:09----------
potential friendships


---------85:11----------
where either there's a selection bias or


---------85:13----------
you steer things a certain way


---------85:15----------
or there are like unconscious reactions


---------85:18----------
that you have that cause you to deviate


---------85:20----------
towards the familiar


---------85:24----------
right and then there's also like really


---------85:25----------
really simple epidemiologic stuff which


---------85:27----------
is like you're a twitch streamer


---------85:29----------
so you're gonna attract a certain kind


---------85:31----------
of person


---------85:33----------
but what i'm hearing from you is that


---------85:34----------
doesn't seem to be that big of a deal


---------85:35----------
because it sounds like you have a lot of


---------85:36----------
interactions outside of twitch and stuff


---------85:38----------
like that and you


---------85:39----------
should run into normal people but


---------85:42----------
and the last thing is that you do use


---------85:43----------
the word friend so it sounds like you


---------85:44----------
actually have friends


---------85:46----------
which has been confusing me for a while


---------85:48----------
so i have my editor i've known him for


---------85:50----------
10 years


---------85:51----------
he's amazing he's never hit on me ever


---------85:54----------
um he's always gone for a different kind


---------85:57----------
of person which has been oddly


---------85:58----------
comforting to me


---------85:59----------
um we've done a lot of rescue work


---------86:01----------
together but we don't have a close


---------86:03----------
friendship


---------86:04----------
and a behavior well we do in some ways


---------86:06----------
but not most so


---------86:07----------
what i consider a close friendship is


---------86:09----------
someone i spend a lot of time with


---------86:10----------
and i find it really really difficult to


---------86:12----------
do that with people one of the reasons


---------86:13----------
why i'm under invested in friendships


---------86:15----------
is because if i feel like i spend too


---------86:17----------
much time with someone that


---------86:19----------
it can fall apart like you give more


---------86:21----------
room for mistakes for misunderstandings


---------86:23----------
for


---------86:24----------
bitterness this sort of stuff so if you


---------86:26----------
hang out with someone once every couple


---------86:28----------
of months you play a few games with them


---------86:29----------
here and there


---------86:30----------
they are at the right distance where


---------86:32----------
they can't get over invested in the


---------86:33----------
friendship and start hitting on you


---------86:35----------
but you can't you also don't actively


---------86:38----------
annoy them and if you are mildly


---------86:39----------
annoying


---------86:40----------
like once or twice you won't happen


---------86:42----------
loads and loads in a week and you lose


---------86:44----------
them so i do hope people ask that


---------86:45----------
distance


---------86:46----------
yeah but i mean that's what i'm [ __ ]


---------86:47----------
talking about that like that's that's


---------86:49----------
like this is what i'm talking about like


---------86:51----------
you know this [ __ ]


---------86:52----------
right and you're like why don't i have


---------86:54----------
friends and you're like it's because i


---------86:55----------
hold people at a distance because i'm


---------86:56----------
afraid if they get too close


---------86:58----------
then then they're gonna fall in love


---------87:00----------
with me


---------87:04----------
i have a few i have a handful of friends


---------87:06----------
that i've known for years and i love


---------87:08----------
them deeply


---------87:09----------
and i feel like it's partly because i've


---------87:11----------
kept them at just the right distance


---------87:13----------
i feel like i get to hang out with them


---------87:15----------
really love those days i spend with them


---------87:17----------
do you want to spend more time with them


---------87:20----------
no because then awful things might


---------87:22----------
happen


---------87:24----------
okay so see that's where so so you do


---------87:26----------
this thing a lot where i sometimes


---------87:27----------
ask you what you want and instead of


---------87:29----------
answering what you want you talk about


---------87:31----------
what's gonna happen


---------87:35----------
true but that those are


---------87:39----------
there is what you want and there is


---------87:40----------
what's gonna happen


---------87:42----------
absolutely but i'm just saying it's


---------87:44----------
important for you to not


---------87:45----------
conflate the two i'm not disputing that


---------87:49----------
that's what's going to happen because


---------87:50----------
that's been your experience


---------87:52----------
but i suspect that something around this


---------87:54----------
realm of stuff right like


---------87:56----------
if you have a pattern that repeats in


---------87:58----------
your life


---------88:00----------
are you responsible for it like should


---------88:03----------
you blame yourself if men are attracted


---------88:05----------
to you and change what you wear and


---------88:06----------
stuff like that like i don't want to go


---------88:08----------
down that road but


---------88:09----------
at the same time i do feel that as a


---------88:11----------
human being you have some degree of


---------88:13----------
agency and control over your life


---------88:15----------
and in fact here your story i think


---------88:18----------
exemplifies that principle that you


---------88:20----------
were a particular way and you started to


---------88:22----------
make changes in the way that you treated


---------88:24----------
yourself you started to make changes in


---------88:26----------
the kinds of people that you hung out


---------88:27----------
with


---------88:28----------
and you're no longer in codependent


---------88:29----------
relationships with arguably abusive


---------88:31----------
people


---------88:33----------
and the next step i think is one of


---------88:35----------
subtlety where you found that okay


---------88:37----------
you keep people at arm's length and


---------88:39----------
they're kind of friends for a while and


---------88:40----------
if you're too emotionally intimate with


---------88:42----------
them too quickly


---------88:43----------
they tend to fall in love with you and


---------88:44----------
some of them play the long game and what


---------88:46----------
not and what not and what not all that i


---------88:47----------
think is perfect


---------88:48----------
but i think you just keep on moving in


---------88:50----------
that direction keep on paying attention


---------88:52----------
to yourself and try to


---------88:53----------
accelerate a friendship a little bit


---------88:56----------
more and be


---------88:57----------
careful because i suspect that sometimes


---------89:00----------
so there's there's old pattern territory


---------89:04----------
which is like emotionally intimate


---------89:05----------
friendships


---------89:06----------
and then there's new safe friendships


---------89:08----------
which are kind of


---------89:10----------
temporally distant or geographically


---------89:13----------
distant or emotionally distant in like


---------89:15----------
drips and drops at regular intervals


---------89:18----------
that doesn't


---------89:18----------
cross the line into the old familiar


---------89:21----------
territory


---------89:22----------
but i think the closer you get to that


---------89:24----------
border and the more you pay attention to


---------89:26----------
yourself


---------89:27----------
there's no [ __ ] way anita that if you


---------89:29----------
don't explore this more


---------89:31----------
you're not going to learn something


---------89:32----------
valuable i just don't buy that the one


---------89:35----------
thing that i have


---------89:36----------
absolute confidence in is that if you


---------89:38----------
understood the repetition compulsion at


---------89:40----------
the age of nine


---------89:41----------
and you grew up with your mom and then


---------89:44----------
you had a toxic amount of positivity


---------89:47----------
and self-deprecation and putting other


---------89:49----------
people first and then you show up


---------89:51----------
a few months later pissed at the whole


---------89:52----------
world that's an immense amount of growth


---------89:55----------
i think if you just keep yeah i don't


---------89:57----------
know


---------89:58----------
i think it's hard from this session to


---------90:00----------
really understand


---------90:02----------
what is a jump and what's not i i kind


---------90:04----------
of feel like


---------90:06----------
so i do think that my generosity is real


---------90:09----------
i do think that my


---------90:11----------
urge to connect with others and be


---------90:12----------
beneficial to others is real i don't


---------90:13----------
think it's an


---------90:14----------
issue i don't think that just because i


---------90:16----------
grew up a carer that altruism isn't


---------90:18----------
[ __ ] real


---------90:19----------
i don't think that it's a flaw with me i


---------90:21----------
don't think that i'm deranged i don't


---------90:22----------
think that i donated a thousand pounds


---------90:24----------
to you because i'm hot potatoing


---------90:25----------
other people's generosity i think that


---------90:27----------
there's something intrinsic in all of us


---------90:29----------
that feels


---------90:30----------
good when we do good and it doesn't have


---------90:32----------
to benefit us directly i think that's


---------90:34----------
real in people that have suffered just


---------90:35----------
as much as people you haven't i think


---------90:37----------
it's real in me even though i had a


---------90:38----------
[ __ ] up childhood i don't think it's a


---------90:40----------
symptom i think it's an aspect


---------90:42----------
and a positive aspect of me and i think


---------90:45----------
that


---------90:45----------
the more that you i i know it's very


---------90:47----------
easy there is this risk when you're a


---------90:49----------
therapist


---------90:50----------
that you draw false correlations


---------90:52----------
sometimes because you're so used to this


---------90:54----------
pattern and i do it myself even though


---------90:56----------
i'm not


---------90:56----------
being a therapist to others but one of


---------90:58----------
the common things is like


---------90:59----------
a lot of therapists who receive children


---------91:02----------
who've been


---------91:03----------
put into foster care or have been you


---------91:05----------
know have lost both their parents


---------91:07----------
they they tend to think that people


---------91:08----------
who've lost both their parents tend to


---------91:10----------
be criminals or have issues


---------91:12----------
or people who know about when it is


---------91:14----------
people who've been abused in childhood


---------91:16----------
they think that it unanimously makes


---------91:17----------
people abuses because most of the people


---------91:19----------
who come to them


---------91:19----------
are people who have negative results


---------91:22----------
from that childhood experience


---------91:24----------
but the people who grow up to be healthy


---------91:26----------
the people who grow up to be great


---------91:27----------
and the people who have grow up without


---------91:29----------
issues and you know get past it


---------91:31----------
never show up at a therapist door so


---------91:33----------
they never see them


---------91:34----------
and so there's this idea that a higher


---------91:36----------
percentage of people who have childhood


---------91:38----------
trauma have issues


---------91:40----------
than actually do because believe it or


---------91:42----------
not sometimes people go through hard


---------91:43----------
[ __ ]


---------91:44----------
and you know what are you hearing me say


---------91:47----------
i'm hearing you say that this is somehow


---------91:50----------
my fault that this is a psychological


---------91:53----------
phenomenon


---------91:54----------
that my generosity is the result of


---------91:55----------
being a carer and b have not having my


---------91:57----------
needs met and that the reason why people


---------91:59----------
fall in love with me


---------91:59----------
is because i'm just repeating some


---------92:01----------
traumatic cycle


---------92:03----------
but at some point i've got to stop


---------92:04----------
taking responsibility for other people's


---------92:06----------
problems and i'm definitely


---------92:08----------
not the only [ __ ] woman who gets hit


---------92:10----------
on and says no one doesn't get hurt


---------92:12----------
because a dude's thinking more about his


---------92:14----------
dicks than his dick than the way he's


---------92:16----------
affecting the people that he's attracted


---------92:17----------
to


---------92:18----------
i definitely think that is something


---------92:19----------
that i've experienced and it's part of


---------92:21----------
it too


---------92:22----------
but also i think that if i keep on


---------92:25----------
switching my behavior i'm constantly


---------92:27----------
adjusting myself so i don't trigger


---------92:29----------
you know the weak wills of some people


---------92:32----------
male or female


---------92:33----------
that i won't have any room to be my


---------92:34----------
[ __ ] self because i'm so preoccupied


---------92:36----------
with how people are reacting to me


---------92:38----------
and how what they might or might not do


---------92:40----------
that i won't be able to just enjoy


---------92:42----------
connecting with people and being myself


---------92:44----------
so i think there has to be room for the


---------92:46----------
idea


---------92:47----------
that maybe not all of it is me because


---------92:49----------
other people do experience this too


---------92:51----------
there is a problem with men respecting


---------92:52----------
boundaries and thinking the friend zone


---------92:54----------
is a zone


---------92:55----------
and not just no like people call it cute


---------92:57----------
zones so they can be all creepy and go i


---------92:59----------
don't have to listen to this i can make


---------93:00----------
you like me


---------93:01----------
because it's just a cute little zone i'm


---------93:03----------
in and i can step out of it not consent


---------93:05----------
or anything


---------93:06----------
i'm not a weirdo ignoring your consent


---------93:08----------
i'm so sorry


---------93:09----------
these conversations i'm seeing in chat


---------93:11----------
and i'm just kind of exploding a little


---------93:13----------
bit because everyone's like


---------93:14----------
you just don't understand biology dudes


---------93:16----------
can't be friends with women or


---------93:17----------
you you need to change this about you


---------93:19----------
you're just whining about being


---------93:20----------
attractive oh boo hoo i don't sympathize


---------93:22----------
[ __ ] you


---------93:23----------
and i'm so tired of being hated and i'm


---------93:25----------
blamed when people hit on me when people


---------93:27----------
[ __ ] try to feel me up when i'm drunk


---------93:29----------
and [ __ ] i'm so tired of being blamed


---------93:32----------
when other people do this stuff because


---------93:33----------
they ignore what i'm saying


---------93:35----------
and i'm so tired of adjusting myself


---------93:38----------
being this


---------93:38----------
being that being cold being soft being


---------93:41----------
warm being friendly


---------93:43----------
[ __ ] punching people in the face i'm


---------93:44----------
tired of wearing this wearing that i'm


---------93:46----------
tired of being held responsible for the


---------93:48----------
way that people behave when the truth of


---------93:50----------
the matter is that my no is not a zone


---------93:52----------
that you get out of it's a [ __ ] no


---------93:56----------
so let me clarify so you're saying


---------94:00----------
that i'm saying that this is your


---------94:04----------
fault and that you create this because


---------94:06----------
of some psychological thing that


---------94:08----------
happened in your childhood


---------94:09----------
that your altruism is a reaction


---------94:12----------
to some sort of psychological trauma


---------94:15----------
that's what you're you're hearing me say


---------94:19----------
it is sometimes i feel like you're


---------94:21----------
directing me to a sense of


---------94:22----------
responsibility for other people's


---------94:24----------
actions when we don't control them


---------94:25----------
and it's not always because i'm


---------94:27----------
attracting people i am thinking the


---------94:28----------
roots that you've


---------94:29----------
you're taking me i've spoken to


---------94:31----------
therapists in the past


---------94:32----------
and i've talked about how i interact


---------94:34----------
with people i've talked about why i've


---------94:36----------
talked about why with people that i've


---------94:37----------
stopped being friends with


---------94:39----------
i've had very sober cold conversations


---------94:41----------
with people who turned into [ __ ]


---------94:43----------
creeps


---------94:43----------
and gone why did this happen i don't


---------94:45----------
want it to happen again


---------94:47----------
and and i have also talked to therapists


---------94:49----------
about why


---------94:50----------
and what i hear from you sometimes is


---------94:52----------
that you're diagnosing


---------94:53----------
not just my altruism but other people's


---------94:57----------
disrespect of my boundaries which i'm


---------94:58----------
far too accommodating of i let it go on


---------95:00----------
for too long and that's on me i know it


---------95:02----------
is


---------95:02----------
but i do give clear signs that people


---------95:04----------
should listen to along the way


---------95:05----------
and i do think that it's not just me i


---------95:07----------
do think that there are things that


---------95:09----------
other people have to take responsibility


---------95:10----------
for too and it's something it took me a


---------95:12----------
long time to recognize


---------95:14----------
yeah so uh just curious so thank you for


---------95:16----------
clarifying that


---------95:17----------
and i i apologize for conveying that


---------95:20----------
sentiment so i just want to make sure i


---------95:22----------
want to apologize appropriately so i


---------95:24----------
want to make sure


---------95:25----------
i understand what am i diagnosing you


---------95:27----------
with


---------95:31----------
so you see it as a repetition compulsion


---------95:34----------
that there's some aspect of my behavior


---------95:36----------
that traps me specifically in this loop


---------95:39----------
that this there is an active aspect of


---------95:42----------
my behavior


---------95:43----------
that makes people behave in a way that


---------95:45----------
they shouldn't


---------95:49----------
okay so i actually


---------95:53----------
i agree with some of that so let me try


---------95:56----------
to clarify and then you let me know if


---------95:58----------
an apology is appropriate


---------96:00----------
i'm happy to because i i this


---------96:02----------
conversation just took a turn that was


---------96:04----------
really not where i was intending to go


---------96:06----------
and if i made a mistake i'm more than


---------96:08----------
happy to apologize for it i just really


---------96:09----------
want to understand what that mistake is


---------96:11----------
so the reason i brought up the


---------96:13----------
repetition compulsion with you is so let


---------96:15----------
me walk you through my reasoning and


---------96:16----------
then you let me know whether an apology


---------96:18----------
is appropriate or not


---------96:20----------
so generally speaking human beings tend


---------96:22----------
to encounter


---------96:23----------
common situations in life right like we


---------96:25----------
run into the same problems over and over


---------96:27----------
and over again


---------96:29----------
and here's what i heard you say so i


---------96:32----------
heard you say that you run into this


---------96:34----------
problem over and over and over again and


---------96:35----------
it's hard for you to make friends


---------96:37----------
because they don't respect your


---------96:38----------
boundaries and sometimes you're overly


---------96:39----------
accommodating and things like that


---------96:41----------
fine i accept that i accept that you're


---------96:44----------
in the situation that you're in


---------96:46----------
i accept that it's very difficult for


---------96:47----------
you to make friends i accept that people


---------96:50----------
start with friendship and then ask for


---------96:52----------
more i accept that


---------96:54----------
you have tried to change yourself to


---------96:56----------
accommodate them right


---------96:58----------
you've tried to transform yourself to


---------96:59----------
control their behavior


---------97:01----------
and that's not fair to you and that's


---------97:02----------
not the right answer which i agree


---------97:04----------
completely


---------97:05----------
you've also tried to change them which


---------97:08----------
isn't your [ __ ] responsibility


---------97:09----------
because it's their job to change


---------97:11----------
themselves


---------97:12----------
you're not responsible for changing some


---------97:14----------
someone else i completely agree with


---------97:16----------
that and so then we end up with this


---------97:20----------
reality right because that's what you're


---------97:21----------
telling me anita is that


---------97:23----------
irrespective of you trying to change


---------97:24----------
yourself and irrespective of you trying


---------97:26----------
to change other people


---------97:27----------
you're [ __ ] stuck and people don't


---------97:29----------
respect you they don't respect your


---------97:30----------
boundaries


---------97:31----------
either they're just looking to get their


---------97:33----------
wheelie wet or they're playing the long


---------97:35----------
game or


---------97:36----------
at the end of the day they start out as


---------97:37----------
friends and then something happens and


---------97:39----------
then even though you've been crystal


---------97:40----------
clear


---------97:40----------
you wind up in this situation


---------97:44----------
we on the same page there is there


---------97:47----------
anything


---------97:48----------
about that that you think i have done


---------97:49----------
wrong or unfair


---------97:51----------
or that i should apologize for


---------97:54----------
so far no not in that aspect


---------97:58----------
of the parts that i think issue with


---------97:59----------
were the parts where


---------98:01----------
you start using words like at some point


---------98:02----------
you have to take responsibility for


---------98:05----------
you know this pattern and those sorts of


---------98:07----------
words where it's still


---------98:08----------
my fault that some people can't respect


---------98:11----------
boundaries because this is amount to


---------98:12----------
stuff that's very very serious that most


---------98:14----------
people know is wrong regardless of my


---------98:16----------
behavior i could cartwheel down the


---------98:18----------
street naked


---------98:19----------
and i still don't deserve to be


---------98:20----------
assaulted and stoked


---------98:24----------
yeah so so let me let me try to add some


---------98:27----------
nuance to that


---------98:28----------
and if that still feels like it's wrong


---------98:30----------
to you please let me know


---------98:32----------
okay so here's here's the challenge so


---------98:35----------
i'm stuck


---------98:36----------
between a rock and a hard place because


---------98:37----------
as a human being


---------98:39----------
i accept that you are who you are and i


---------98:42----------
think you should accept yourself for


---------98:43----------
yours


---------98:44----------
yourself i also accept that


---------98:47----------
i don't control other people's behavior


---------98:49----------
and i'm not responsible for other


---------98:51----------
people's behavior


---------98:54----------
and so then the question becomes what is


---------98:56----------
my role in life


---------98:58----------
what do i control what is the part of my


---------99:01----------
life that i have agency over


---------99:04----------
and what i find is that the more that


---------99:06----------
people accept


---------99:09----------
that you do have some influence in it


---------99:13----------
right like at the end of the day if i


---------99:14----------
find myself in a situation


---------99:16----------
over and over and over again i would


---------99:19----------
hope


---------99:20----------
and part of what i absolutely try to do


---------99:24----------
is to help people understand that you


---------99:26----------
have some power to change this


---------99:28----------
because anita if there's one [ __ ]


---------99:30----------
thing that you've demonstrated to me


---------99:31----------
it's that you have the power to change


---------99:33----------
your life


---------99:35----------
think about where you grew up think


---------99:37----------
about the co-dependent relationships you


---------99:38----------
have


---------99:39----------
think about where you are now think


---------99:40----------
about all the way you've come what do


---------99:42----------
you think you think other people did


---------99:43----------
that


---------99:44----------
you did that right the person that you


---------99:48----------
were started to shine through


---------99:51----------
and you helped her out i don't think


---------99:53----------
that i think your altruism is


---------99:55----------
absolutely genuine i think it's part of


---------99:57----------
what makes you amazing


---------99:58----------
i think you're incredibly authentic and


---------100:01----------
i think it confuses the [ __ ] out of some


---------100:03----------
people


---------100:03----------
who have been societally conditioned in


---------100:06----------
a bad way


---------100:06----------
i don't think that's your fault i don't


---------100:09----------
think you should change who you are


---------100:11----------
and at the same time i have to


---------100:13----------
acknowledge and i really do believe that


---------100:16----------
you have


---------100:16----------
some agency over your situation


---------100:20----------
i don't think that woe is me is like


---------100:23----------
like absolutely woe is you but if anyone


---------100:26----------
has the capacity to


---------100:28----------
navigate this tricky [ __ ] it's you


---------100:32----------
and i do believe that you have some


---------100:34----------
power here that you have some control


---------100:36----------
here and i think when i say that


---------100:39----------
what either consciously or unconsciously


---------100:42----------
i'm signaling or what you're receiving


---------100:44----------
is that it's your fault


---------100:46----------
and that's a really tricky place to be


---------100:48----------
in right because like


---------100:50----------
if we accept that we have power to


---------100:52----------
change something


---------100:54----------
then it becomes in a sense our fault


---------100:57----------
so i think that your interpretation of


---------100:59----------
my words is sort of inappropriate


---------101:01----------
it's just not meant to be blame it's


---------101:03----------
just like you can't have agency without


---------101:05----------
responsibility the two come hand in hand


---------101:09----------
and and the emotional response


---------101:12----------
that i got from you which i've seen


---------101:14----------
emotions come which i think is


---------101:15----------
completely authentic


---------101:16----------
and and now i'm not trying to like oh


---------101:18----------
you emotionally responded therefore


---------101:19----------
you're wrong so like don't take it that


---------101:21----------
way but


---------101:21----------
i think there's something really


---------101:22----------
important there right i don't know what


---------101:24----------
it is


---------101:25----------
and what i'm really trying to say is


---------101:26----------
that there's a road forward i have to


---------101:29----------
hope like so when any time i sit with


---------101:30----------
someone anita


---------101:31----------
i don't part of what i try really hard


---------101:34----------
to do part of what i try to have


---------101:35----------
agency and control over in myself is to


---------101:37----------
hope that your situation can get better


---------101:41----------
and in what ways can your situation get


---------101:43----------
better like how like and that's why i


---------101:45----------
talk about the [ __ ] psychological


---------101:46----------
[ __ ]


---------101:47----------
because i think you already understand


---------101:49----------
this stuff and i think that you're a


---------101:51----------
human too


---------101:52----------
and what i see is that you've exhausted


---------101:54----------
a lot of really good options


---------101:56----------
you try to change the way that you dress


---------101:58----------
you try to fix other people and neither


---------101:59----------
of them worked


---------102:00----------
so i think there's something in the


---------102:01----------
middle there right that that and we kind


---------102:04----------
of see it in your patterns of friendship


---------102:05----------
that either people get overly invested


---------102:07----------
in your friendship


---------102:08----------
or you keep them at arm's length and


---------102:10----------
that makes me


---------102:11----------
sad because that's not what you want


---------102:14----------
you want something between those two


---------102:16----------
things


---------102:18----------
right and so then the question is what


---------102:21----------
i'm encouraging you to do and what i'm


---------102:22----------
really saying that you should do


---------102:24----------
is over here is safety but emotional


---------102:27----------
distance and over here is intimacy and


---------102:30----------
people misconstruing what you say


---------102:31----------
there's something there in the middle


---------102:34----------
and as you move towards something in the


---------102:36----------
middle i want you to really understand


---------102:38----------
and if this is something that you take


---------102:39----------
issue with please let me know


---------102:41----------
as you navigate that tightrope in the


---------102:43----------
middle i absolutely believe you have


---------102:45----------
some control over how that turns out


---------102:49----------
yeah someone in chat is saying something


---------102:52----------
really interesting about this


---------102:54----------
and i don't normally talk i don't


---------102:56----------
normally bring it up but someone's


---------102:56----------
saying i think the


---------102:57----------
disconnection here is partially as a


---------102:59----------
result of the implied


---------103:01----------
dynamic default dynamic associated with


---------103:03----------
therapy therapists specialize in


---------103:05----------
individual problems but what anita seems


---------103:06----------
to be struggling with is more of a


---------103:08----------
societal problem


---------103:09----------
that being that men are rarely


---------103:10----------
discouraged from overstepping their


---------103:12----------
boundaries


---------103:13----------
i don't think dr k is going to uh i


---------103:15----------
don't know


---------103:16----------
zooming too fast he's going to going out


---------103:19----------
of his way to downplay that factor in


---------103:21----------
this conversation


---------103:22----------
but is his profession and i do think


---------103:24----------
there is an intersection here between


---------103:26----------
the fact that


---------103:27----------
this is not something that is entirely


---------103:29----------
controllable or influenced


---------103:30----------
uh easy to influence because there is a


---------103:33----------
societal


---------103:34----------
aspect at play and it is impossible for


---------103:37----------
it to be


---------103:38----------
consistent as well because the


---------103:40----------
overstepping of boundaries can vary so


---------103:41----------
much


---------103:42----------
this is why i was looking for patterns


---------103:43----------
so i could interrupt the path


---------103:45----------
absolutely so so i think that person is


---------103:48----------
spot on and this is frankly why the deck


---------103:50----------
is stacked against you and this is why i


---------103:52----------
think that you haven't figured it out


---------103:53----------
already


---------103:55----------
right because it there is like finding


---------103:57----------
that balance is


---------103:59----------
really hard because there is this


---------104:00----------
societal conditioning


---------104:02----------
and that's what i was like the whole


---------104:03----------
maternal shakti thing that i was kind of


---------104:05----------
talking about is like this idea that


---------104:06----------
i think you are giving someone an


---------104:08----------
authentic version of yourself


---------104:10----------
and they've been conditioned to


---------104:12----------
interpret that a different way which is


---------104:14----------
not your fault


---------104:15----------
and i don't think you should change who


---------104:16----------
you are i think who you are is awesome


---------104:20----------
and what i'm saying is that in the


---------104:21----------
middle there


---------104:24----------
it behooves you to think about


---------104:27----------
this psychological [ __ ] like the


---------104:28----------
repetition compulsion because one of two


---------104:31----------
things is gonna happen


---------104:33----------
on the one hand shirt maybe i'm judging


---------104:35----------
you and i'm saying oh this is the


---------104:36----------
repetition component blah blah blah


---------104:37----------
freud blah blah blah blah blah blah blah


---------104:39----------
this is what's going on with you anita i


---------104:41----------
have it all figured out i don't give a


---------104:42----------
[ __ ] about that i don't give a [ __ ]


---------104:43----------
about figuring it out


---------104:44----------
what i'm saying is if there's any


---------104:45----------
mileage to be picked up there


---------104:48----------
to get you in the direction that you


---------104:49----------
want to go if there's even one percent


---------104:51----------
of the repetition compulsion


---------104:53----------
that lets you walk that tightrope


---------104:54----------
[ __ ] look at it


---------104:56----------
and rather than me analyzing it you're


---------104:58----------
the one who used the phrase repetition


---------104:59----------
compulsion so i'm like


---------105:00----------
damn right anita see if that's what's


---------105:02----------
going on


---------105:04----------
i can't give you answers anita i can't


---------105:06----------
give you conclusions


---------105:07----------
the most i can do is give you hypotheses


---------105:10----------
yeah and there's something here


---------105:13----------
where i think that you should be


---------105:16----------
authentic


---------105:18----------
you should be who you are and you've got


---------105:20----------
the deck stacked against you in terms of


---------105:21----------
societal conditioning


---------105:23----------
and i choose to hope


---------105:26----------
that you don't have to be trapped in


---------105:28----------
this situation together and that you can


---------105:30----------
move one step closer to that midpoint


---------105:33----------
and i think doing so is going to involve


---------105:36----------
looking at not the drastic


---------105:37----------
sets of your behavior but really


---------105:39----------
studying how you interact with people


---------105:42----------
because i think any relationship is a


---------105:45----------
two-way street


---------105:48----------
i i i also know that first-person


---------105:50----------
perspective it's very easy to miss


---------105:52----------
things that the


---------105:53----------
person perspective would get far more


---------105:55----------
easily um it's like my aim is terrible


---------105:58----------
when i'm first person but when i'm third


---------105:59----------
person in a shooter i can suddenly


---------106:01----------
actually connect with the with the


---------106:03----------
headshots and click heads


---------106:05----------
and so i think i i've asked my closest


---------106:07----------
friends who are with me when things have


---------106:09----------
happened and gone


---------106:10----------
did i do anything to make him think that


---------106:12----------
i'm attracted to him did i do


---------106:14----------
anything to make him think that this was


---------106:15----------
okay and


---------106:17----------
so far the resounding aspects that i


---------106:20----------
i i don't miss this i see it but i don't


---------106:23----------
know how to avoid it


---------106:24----------
it's like they were saying well he


---------106:26----------
pushed boundaries here and here and here


---------106:29----------
and normally i'd have gotten pissed off


---------106:31----------
punched him kicked him away you know


---------106:32----------
kicked him to the curb


---------106:33----------
and you were forgiving like you did


---------106:38----------
yeah see that's that's one of the things


---------106:40----------
that really really frustrates me because


---------106:42----------
i think like that


---------106:43----------
the problem there is that i don't


---------106:46----------
if you're a forgiving person like i


---------106:48----------
think that's a good thing


---------106:51----------
right i'm looking for option c which is


---------106:53----------
not for you to be less forgiving


---------106:55----------
or for him to not put like i i i want


---------106:57----------
you to continue to be who you are and


---------106:59----------
find


---------107:00----------
some road through this and i completely


---------107:02----------
agree with you with the first person


---------107:03----------
third-person stuff


---------107:04----------
so i think actually what you've got to


---------107:05----------
figure out anita is why this happens to


---------107:07----------
your mom


---------107:09----------
yeah well well when i look at my mom


---------107:12----------
because i thought about that too


---------107:13----------
and i look at my mom and she's very very


---------107:16----------
capable


---------107:16----------
so like everything about her is just


---------107:19----------
genuinely admirable and awesome and


---------107:21----------
there are aspects of it that don't apply


---------107:22----------
to me


---------107:23----------
for example pretty much most of her


---------107:24----------
boyfriends have been gay like


---------107:26----------
completely gay like never had a


---------107:28----------
girlfriend before or after her


---------107:30----------
um and the


---------107:33----------
thing is like she has her own life chaps


---------107:35----------
and things like that and she's helped me


---------107:36----------
learn to escape a lot of bad things


---------107:38----------
um just by learning from the lessons of


---------107:40----------
her life i'm grateful for her failings


---------107:42----------
as much as her


---------107:43----------
like positives just because it's helped


---------107:44----------
me to grow in many ways


---------107:46----------
and navigate the world um but like so


---------107:49----------
i'm not gonna fault her


---------107:50----------
for them i can understand how she ends


---------107:51----------
up in some of the situations she's in


---------107:53----------
but i also think that she's just


---------107:55----------
generally a brilliant woman


---------107:56----------
she really is she's very impressive in


---------107:58----------
many many different ways she looks young


---------108:00----------
for age she's very beautiful


---------108:02----------
um she's like really unique she's like


---------108:04----------
this goth and she has like really great


---------108:05----------
makeup and really great personality and


---------108:07----------
she's interested in all these cool


---------108:08----------
things


---------108:09----------
she's a fantastic artist she's a


---------108:10----------
scientist she's a photographer she was a


---------108:12----------
dancer


---------108:13----------
and she aced all of those things and she


---------108:15----------
has a myriad of


---------108:16----------
she was a kickboxer and she competed


---------108:18----------
against men and won things because she


---------108:20----------
was very very good at it


---------108:21----------
everything she tries her hand at she's


---------108:23----------
amazing at and to this day she's really


---------108:25----------
crippled by a very very debilitating


---------108:26----------
illness


---------108:27----------
and she still finds ways to create


---------108:29----------
beautiful things and do


---------108:30----------
very impressive things she's just very


---------108:33----------
very amazing in every respect and a lot


---------108:34----------
of guys don't just look at her and think


---------108:38----------
i like her they think i want to be her


---------108:40----------
this is why so many gay guys like her as


---------108:42----------
well because they don't just


---------108:43----------
like her they want to be her she is the


---------108:46----------
if they could be a woman they would be


---------108:47----------
her


---------108:47----------
sort of thing and so there's a lot of


---------108:49----------
admiration involved and i've


---------108:51----------
noticed that because i see it on twitch


---------108:53----------
chat a lot um


---------108:55----------
a lot of guys don't have to be


---------108:57----------
attractive they can be very average and


---------108:58----------
be huge on this platform they don't have


---------109:00----------
to be attractive


---------109:02----------
um and the thing is when guys are young


---------109:05----------
they're not taught to relate to women


---------109:06----------
nobody dresses up as princess leia when


---------109:08----------
they're kids no dudes are allowed to


---------109:10----------
dress as women it has a stigma attached


---------109:12----------
to it


---------109:12----------
and so when people aspire to be us


---------109:14----------
they're usually women


---------109:16----------
other women and not a lot of dudes


---------109:17----------
actually relate to us as if what they


---------109:18----------
want to aspire to be like us because


---------109:20----------
there's


---------109:21----------
some sort of mental block there where


---------109:22----------
admiration equals attraction


---------109:24----------
and so usually with me people don't


---------109:26----------
usually relate to me they aspire to be


---------109:28----------
with me when they see positive traits


---------109:29----------
about me they confuse it with attraction


---------109:31----------
rather than just relating to you or


---------109:33----------
taking inspiration from another human


---------109:34----------
being it's a trap that a lot of female


---------109:36----------
streamers


---------109:36----------
fall into but we get heavily policed for


---------109:38----------
behavior that big


---------109:39----------
male streamers don't men can be toxic


---------109:42----------
and it can be fun to watch but when


---------109:43----------
women are toxic nobody wants to be


---------109:45----------
with a woman who is toxic so it's not as


---------109:48----------
entertaining because it puts you


---------109:49----------
off them whereas if you found us


---------109:51----------
generally relatable


---------109:53----------
if you were trying to relate to us


---------109:55----------
rather than possess us


---------109:56----------
these things wouldn't get an entirely


---------109:59----------
different reaction


---------110:00----------
from the audience and so i see it


---------110:02----------
manifest a lot in twitch i see it as a


---------110:04----------
very very big thing


---------110:05----------
and so a lot of people don't just a


---------110:08----------
confusion with admiration and attraction


---------110:10----------
i see and so and so a lot of guys


---------110:13----------
conflate


---------110:13----------
admiration with attraction if the person


---------110:15----------
they admire happens to ha


---------110:17----------
have female genitalia it's very very


---------110:19----------
difficult to separate the two


---------110:20----------
and so when it's the opposite sex or the


---------110:23----------
sex that you're attracted to


---------110:24----------
and so a lot of people admire my mother


---------110:26----------
and so they conflate that with


---------110:28----------
attraction it becomes attraction because


---------110:29----------
that's how men are comfortable admiring


---------110:31----------
women


---------110:32----------
they're not encouraged from a young age


---------110:33----------
to admire women from an aspirational


---------110:35----------
perspective


---------110:36----------
and my mom is very very admirable in


---------110:38----------
every sense of the word are you


---------110:39----------
she's i don't know i don't admire me


---------110:44----------
but my mom's just like different let's


---------110:47----------
just think about what you're saying


---------110:48----------
right like so what i'm like if i put so


---------110:51----------
i'm going to


---------110:51----------
create a constellation out of the stars


---------110:54----------
that you laid so this could be my


---------110:55----------
interpretation


---------110:56----------
so you let me know if this is fair or


---------110:57----------
unfair okay so i'm interpreting


---------110:59----------
something here


---------111:01----------
so people can conflate admiration with


---------111:04----------
attraction


---------111:05----------
so you're saying that your mom is very


---------111:06----------
admirable i asked you


---------111:09----------
why why does this happen to your mom and


---------111:10----------
then you went on on this thing about


---------111:12----------
admiration and attraction fine


---------111:14----------
okay cool let's accept that so therefore


---------111:17----------
the reason that people


---------111:18----------
you know bump heads when they try to


---------111:20----------
kiss your mom's hand is because they're


---------111:21----------
conflating admiration with attraction


---------111:24----------
and now what's happening is you're


---------111:25----------
talking about twitch and then you segue


---------111:26----------
to twitch and you segue to you know


---------111:28----------
double standards between


---------111:29----------
female streamers and male streamers


---------111:31----------
totally get that


---------111:33----------
and so that now what what i'm if i kind


---------111:35----------
of put that consolation together because


---------111:37----------
those are parts of the same conversation


---------111:39----------
which started from the question of why


---------111:41----------
are people attracted to your mom


---------111:43----------
and what i would piece together is that


---------111:46----------
part of the reason that people are


---------111:47----------
attracted to you


---------111:48----------
is because they admire certain qualities


---------111:49----------
about you


---------111:51----------
and then they conflate those with


---------111:52----------
attraction


---------111:56----------
i don't i don't know if that's true i


---------112:00----------
i don't i don't really see myself as a


---------112:02----------
very admirable person


---------112:04----------
right so so like let's think about that


---------112:08----------
right so like i don't know okay so i'm


---------112:09----------
gonna try to be


---------112:11----------
okay so i asked you a question why are


---------112:14----------
people attracted to your mom


---------112:16----------
and you said they conflate admiration


---------112:18----------
with attraction


---------112:19----------
and then you talked about twitch and


---------112:21----------
then you were like


---------112:22----------
you know like people anyway so


---------112:26----------
i think there are a lot of qualities


---------112:27----------
about you that are very admirable and if


---------112:29----------
you're confused about why people


---------112:31----------
are attracted to you and why this keeps


---------112:33----------
happening like my point is that this


---------112:35----------
confusion can be understood


---------112:37----------
right like your confusion about why this


---------112:39----------
pattern happens i believe as a scientist


---------112:41----------
generally speaking


---------112:42----------
if you look into patterns you can find


---------112:43----------
answers that is also a fault of my


---------112:45----------
profession


---------112:46----------
because my profession is filled with


---------112:48----------
unfalsifiable hypotheses


---------112:51----------
right so i can dig into like whatever


---------112:53----------
kind of theory i want to


---------112:54----------
and you can say whatever you want to and


---------112:56----------
i can still convince myself that i'm


---------112:58----------
right and you're wrong


---------112:59----------
that you're just in denial that's that's


---------113:01----------
the trump card of the therapist


---------113:02----------
my patient is in denial right so i have


---------113:06----------
to watch out about that cognitive bias


---------113:07----------
which is why i'm laying it out to you


---------113:09----------
and i'm trusting you and you because you


---------113:11----------
[ __ ] come this far you haven't done


---------113:12----------
this [ __ ] with my help


---------113:14----------
the best i can do is give you hypotheses


---------113:16----------
and then like the person that you


---------113:18----------
are that has gone from where you were


---------113:20----------
when you were a kid to the person that


---------113:22----------
you are now i have faith that person can


---------113:24----------
figure that [ __ ] out if i can help him


---------113:25----------
out a little bit


---------113:26----------
great so here's the last thing i'll


---------113:29----------
leave you with


---------113:29----------
okay maybe the reason that it's


---------113:32----------
confusing that people are attracted to


---------113:34----------
you is because you don't see


---------113:36----------
what they find admirable you don't see


---------113:39----------
yourself as admirable which whereas they


---------113:41----------
find you is very admirable


---------113:43----------
maybe you're actually a really admirable


---------113:45----------
person


---------113:47----------
right maybe maybe you can talk about


---------113:49----------
your mom and how she creates art and


---------113:50----------
this kind of stuff and you have some


---------113:51----------
kind of standard in your mind whatever


---------113:54----------
but that if i were to tell you and and i


---------113:56----------
was gonna sound weird but like let's


---------113:57----------
just lay this out right you're an


---------113:58----------
authentic person


---------113:59----------
you genuinely care about people you go


---------114:02----------
out of your way to try to help people


---------114:04----------
you care about animals you oftentimes


---------114:06----------
put other people ahead of yourself


---------114:09----------
you're intelligent you think about


---------114:11----------
societal problems


---------114:12----------
you're self-reflective you're a streamer


---------114:14----------
on twitch you're charismatic


---------114:16----------
when people attack you with toxicity you


---------114:18----------
respond with humor


---------114:20----------
you wear a hat on your head that says


---------114:22----------
simp you joke about being bald


---------114:25----------
and then normalize that experience for


---------114:27----------
other people


---------114:29----------
you take something that is one of the


---------114:30----------
most shame inducing things in the world


---------114:32----------
for men


---------114:33----------
let alone women if you want to talk


---------114:34----------
about double standards there talk about


---------114:36----------
baldness


---------114:38----------
and then you scratch your head when


---------114:41----------
people think you're admirable


---------114:51----------
well thank you i don't think there's a


---------114:54----------
lot of women


---------114:55----------
room for women to see themselves as


---------114:57----------
admirable i think it's very very


---------114:58----------
difficult because


---------115:00----------
there are songs about how the most


---------115:02----------
attractive thing about a woman is when


---------115:03----------
she doesn't know she's attractive


---------115:05----------
there are bits in tv shows and sitcoms


---------115:08----------
find a girl with low self-esteem because


---------115:10----------
they'll do more in the bedroom


---------115:11----------
people don't like women who have good


---------115:12----------
self-esteem the minute you ever try to


---------115:15----------
like yourself people try to rip it from


---------115:17----------
you constantly and call it narcissistic


---------115:18----------
and


---------115:19----------
conceited we'll chisel and carve a


---------115:21----------
beautiful statue of a woman


---------115:23----------
and we'll call it beautiful but if we


---------115:24----------
put a mirror in our hand we'll call it


---------115:26----------
narcissism we'll call it


---------115:28----------
vanity that same statue because she's


---------115:30----------
admiring the same view everybody else is


---------115:32----------
it's so difficult to build any


---------115:34----------
self-esteem in this environment


---------115:35----------
and i think a lot of guys are very


---------115:37----------
heavily intimidated by the idea that


---------115:39----------
someone might know their worth


---------115:40----------
because a lot of people are insecure and


---------115:43----------
they think if you like yourself


---------115:44----------
you'll realize that you deserve better


---------115:46----------
than me and i've seen that and i've had


---------115:49----------
men


---------115:49----------
say it to me i've had my i've battled


---------115:51----------
with my self-esteem my whole life


---------115:53----------
and it's very very difficult to even


---------115:55----------
look for long enough to come to any


---------115:57----------
conclusions because it feels dangerous


---------115:59----------
everyone will hate me if i ever admire


---------116:01----------
myself this is a scary


---------116:03----------
line of thought i don't know how to


---------116:05----------
compliment myself i don't know how for


---------116:06----------
it


---------116:07----------
how it can be okay i don't know if this


---------116:09----------
is a safe thing to talk about


---------116:11----------
let's change the subject because


---------116:12----------
everyone compliments you but nobody


---------116:14----------
wants you to believe it


---------116:15----------
and people get offended and take it back


---------116:17----------
if you ever do if you ever want proof of


---------116:19----------
this there are whole compilations of


---------116:20----------
women accepting compliments on the


---------116:22----------
internet where guys like oh i didn't


---------116:23----------
know you were full of yourself


---------116:24----------
i take it back you know and so


---------116:28----------
i i don't know if it's something that i


---------116:30----------
am ever


---------116:31----------
not gonna find confusing because i don't


---------116:33----------
live


---------116:34----------
in a world and a space where it's safe


---------116:36----------
for me to ever admire myself


---------116:38----------
i don't think it's comfortable to sit


---------116:39----------
and think about myself positively i'm


---------116:42----------
really i feel panicked when i do um you


---------116:45----------
know


---------116:45----------
like when you're in a in a stealth game


---------116:48----------
and


---------116:49----------
slowly you get more and more noticed


---------116:51----------
like you're off in the distance


---------116:52----------
and the npcs can't quite see you yet but


---------116:55----------
there's like a rumple pack letting you


---------116:56----------
know that you're about to be seen and


---------116:57----------
you need to hide


---------116:58----------
and if you stand still long enough um


---------117:01----------
everyone panics and knows you're there


---------117:03----------
and starts attacking you


---------117:04----------
i feel that little rumble pack warning


---------117:06----------
emotionally


---------117:07----------
anytime i try to think about anything


---------117:10----------
positive about myself


---------117:12----------
and i know where it comes from and i see


---------117:14----------
it in other women and i don't think it


---------117:16----------
could be remedied


---------117:16----------
i don't think i'm in a position to ever


---------117:19----------
not find this confusing because it's not


---------117:21----------
safe for me to be okay with myself


---------117:24----------
to have any self-esteem let alone


---------117:27----------
compliment myself


---------117:28----------
and i know that's an issue which makes


---------117:30----------
it really hard to assess what you're


---------117:32----------
putting


---------117:32----------
towards me you're asking me to see and


---------117:35----------
assess


---------117:35----------
any positive attributes of myself and


---------117:38----------
i'm saying that emotionally in society


---------117:40----------
society i'm not in a position to do so


---------117:43----------
if this is the answer it's going to be


---------117:44----------
the hardest hurdle of my life to ever


---------117:46----------
clear because i have to accurately


---------117:48----------
and comfortably see positives in myself


---------117:52----------
and it's just really [ __ ] scary and


---------118:04----------
hard


---------118:06----------
so anita you've put me in an interesting


---------118:08----------
position


---------118:10----------
you've put me in a position where having


---------118:12----------
faith in you


---------118:13----------
burdens you


---------118:17----------
right because my instinctual answer is


---------118:21----------
i'm glad you understand it my


---------118:24----------
instinctual answer is


---------118:26----------
if i have faith that you can do it is it


---------118:28----------
going to be hard absolutely is society


---------118:30----------
running against you


---------118:32----------
absolutely are you do you live in a


---------118:35----------
world where you're not allowed to do


---------118:36----------
that absolutely


---------118:37----------
i won't disagree with any of those


---------118:39----------
things and now we get to the


---------118:41----------
the bias of an individual person


---------118:45----------
a psychiatrist versus a sociologist


---------118:48----------
so the person in your chat was spot on


---------118:53----------
so my experience has been


---------118:56----------
that if you want to change the world


---------118:58----------
this is just mine i'm not saying it's


---------119:00----------
the only way to do it my way of trying


---------119:02----------
to change the conditioning of the world


---------119:04----------
has been through self-reflection


---------119:08----------
walk this journey yourself and then just


---------119:10----------
let other people watch


---------119:12----------
and there's a part of me that says it's


---------119:13----------
scary it's hard it's insensitive


---------119:16----------
of me to say just try anyway because if


---------119:19----------
it's too hard it's too hard


---------119:20----------
if you're never going to be able to do


---------119:22----------
it then that's cool that's


---------119:24----------
fine i accept that if you choose that


---------119:26----------
you don't want to try i accept that too


---------119:30----------
what i don't accept is that it's going


---------119:32----------
to be impossible for you


---------119:34----------
because anita if there's one thing


---------119:36----------
you've demonstrated to me it's that


---------119:37----------
you've defied the impossible


---------119:38----------
you've done a lot of things that i've


---------119:40----------
talked to a lot of women


---------119:42----------
who say this is impossible


---------119:45----------
i've talked to a lot of women in abusive


---------119:47----------
unhealthy codependent relationships and


---------119:49----------
literally


---------119:49----------
you know why they don't leave


---------119:53----------
because it's impossible to leave yeah


---------119:57----------
people feel trapped absolutely


---------120:00----------
and so who am i gonna who am i gonna put


---------120:02----------
my money i'm gonna put my


---------120:03----------
money on [ __ ] you because you felt


---------120:07----------
trapped before and you've come out of it


---------120:09----------
again and again and again


---------120:13----------
and trying to ask your question yeah go


---------120:14----------
home go for it


---------120:17----------
how do you balance self-esteem because


---------120:19----------
this is something that i think a lot of


---------120:21----------
people would benefit


---------120:22----------
a lot of people that are watching us


---------120:23----------
right now are going to be the


---------120:24----------
demographic for twitch is


---------120:26----------
american dudes in i.t most of them are


---------120:28----------
people that


---------120:29----------
you know are not going to relate to the


---------120:32----------
issue of me


---------120:34----------
having too many people fall in love with


---------120:36----------
me but what they are going to relate to


---------120:38----------
i think this benefits everyone listening


---------120:39----------
to you right now


---------120:40----------
is how do you reliably have self-esteem


---------120:43----------
because


---------120:44----------
people don't buy [ __ ] unless they feel


---------120:45----------
[ __ ] the whole world has a whole economy


---------120:47----------
based on making us feel inferior and


---------120:49----------
insecure


---------120:50----------
because it makes you buy [ __ ] to fix it


---------120:52----------
and solve problems that aren't really


---------120:53----------
there


---------120:54----------
we're all told from a young age we


---------120:56----------
should feel insecure


---------120:57----------
and i have the additional aspect of like


---------121:00----------
everyone's like your whole value


---------121:01----------
is to be attractive and you should try


---------121:03----------
to be attractive but if you feel


---------121:04----------
attractive will hate you and that's


---------121:06----------
unattractive so you have to be


---------121:07----------
attractive


---------121:08----------
and you have to be awesome and perfect


---------121:09----------
and have a great personality be fun


---------121:11----------
like computer games like me and do this


---------121:13----------
and do that right and eat loads of food


---------121:15----------
but


---------121:15----------
simultaneously stay really slim i love a


---------121:17----------
lot girl who eats so long as she's like


---------121:19----------
anorexic


---------121:20----------
um so like there are loads of double


---------121:22----------
standards that are so hard to live up to


---------121:24----------
it's so hard to feel like you're on the


---------121:25----------
right track because people criticize you


---------121:26----------
every step of the way


---------121:28----------
how do you have good self-esteem and


---------121:29----------
then if you do manage to like something


---------121:31----------
about yourself


---------121:32----------
you hold on to it in a world that just


---------121:34----------
hates you if you ever acknowledge it


---------121:40----------
it's a very good question it's the right


---------121:43----------
question which is more important


---------121:45----------
because i think that applies to everyone


---------121:47----------
here i don't i barely know anyone who


---------121:49----------
genuinely is like [ __ ] yeah i'm awesome


---------121:56----------
can i think about that for a second it's


---------121:58----------
a hard question answer


---------122:08----------
okay anita so i don't know if i can


---------122:10----------
answer the question generally but i


---------122:11----------
think i can answer it for you


---------122:15----------
so the first thing is that i think


---------122:18----------
you're actually well on your way


---------122:20----------
you are walking the path that in my


---------122:24----------
experience leads to self-esteem


---------122:27----------
which is in the first phase denial right


---------122:30----------
like


---------122:30----------
oh i'm not angry other people are more


---------122:33----------
better than i am things like that i'm


---------122:35----------
i'm using psychological terms that can


---------122:36----------
be judgmental but just a


---------122:38----------
if you go back and watch our first


---------122:39----------
interview it was like i'm not worth it


---------122:42----------
right and now you're saying something


---------122:44----------
else which is that i do deserve this and


---------122:45----------
it's


---------122:46----------
frustrating that i'm not getting it


---------122:50----------
and and to me you feel very different


---------122:52----------
today than the first time we talked


---------122:56----------
because you are so much more


---------122:57----------
transparently angry


---------123:00----------
right which i think is actually great


---------123:03----------
and i i think that


---------123:05----------
i actually i i don't know how to say


---------123:07----------
this i think you're going to find your


---------123:08----------
way there because you're saying


---------123:09----------
all of the things that i think people


---------123:11----------
need to do because you're saying that


---------123:13----------
i've been alone and i feel


---------123:15----------
it's fantastic i get to be with myself i


---------123:17----------
get to prioritize myself


---------123:19----------
you're building self-esteem with each


---------123:21----------
one of those steps


---------123:22----------
you're saying i'm going to do what i


---------123:24----------
want to do you're learning how to not


---------123:26----------
give in to other people's boundary


---------123:28----------
violations because they're not right for


---------123:30----------
you


---------123:32----------
right because you used to let people


---------123:34----------
trample you and now you're like


---------123:35----------
frustrated because you tell them to go


---------123:37----------
[ __ ] themselves and you end up with


---------123:38----------
you know terminating the relationship


---------123:40----------
and then you feel really sad and


---------123:42----------
frustrated


---------123:42----------
but at least you're drawing that


---------123:43----------
boundary right you can't draw that


---------123:46----------
boundary


---------123:46----------
unless you have some esteem for yourself


---------123:49----------
because you used to put them ahead of


---------123:51----------
you and you just let them cross all over


---------123:53----------
it


---------123:53----------
but you stopped doing that so i think


---------123:56----------
that the bizarre thing


---------123:57----------
is you say how do i have self-esteem i


---------123:59----------
don't have it


---------124:01----------
and this is the part of me where now i


---------124:02----------
get to be real arrogant i think you have


---------124:04----------
more


---------124:05----------
more self-esteem than you realize it's


---------124:07----------
just so [ __ ] foreign to you you don't


---------124:08----------
know what it looks like


---------124:10----------
true it's not consistent yet there are


---------124:12----------
still people who cross my boundaries and


---------124:13----------
i still flounder a bit it's not


---------124:15----------
it's fully there yet i'm still


---------124:18----------
struggling


---------124:19----------
but i am i have an idea of like that


---------124:21----------
this is unacceptable


---------124:23----------
and that's new so what i said is that


---------124:25----------
you're on the path


---------124:28----------
right and i think if you keep doing what


---------124:31----------
you're doing


---------124:32----------
you'll get there right because i


---------124:35----------
i have faith in the person who has


---------124:37----------
brought you this far


---------124:40----------
because she's in your corner and she's


---------124:42----------
caring about you she learned how to care


---------124:44----------
about herself


---------124:46----------
she learned how to put herself above


---------124:49----------
other people


---------124:50----------
right and that person also willingly


---------124:53----------
puts other people ahead of her


---------124:54----------
it's not like a good thing or a bad


---------124:56----------
thing like you can be genuinely


---------124:58----------
altruistic it's totally fine


---------125:02----------
and i i think that as you learn to


---------125:04----------
continue to navigate yourself as you


---------125:06----------
start to look at your relationships more


---------125:08----------
closely


---------125:08----------
as you start to navigate what agency you


---------125:11----------
do have in relationships


---------125:13----------
i think that self-esteem will grow


---------125:18----------
and you you still accept what i say


---------125:21----------
about you as a compliment you say


---------125:23----------
thank you the question is do you believe


---------125:26----------
i'm right


---------125:43----------
i have a mental block there like i keep


---------125:45----------
trying to access the thought and it


---------125:47----------
shuts down


---------125:48----------
okay right so that's what we need to


---------125:50----------
work on


---------125:52----------
yeah we'll work on it we'll work on it


---------125:54----------
it takes time


---------125:56----------
it takes time and if you can't accept it


---------125:59----------
as true like sure i mean


---------126:01----------
you know that i accept that you don't


---------126:03----------
accept it and i'm going to continue


---------126:05----------
thinking that about you and i'm going to


---------126:07----------
continue feeling that way about you


---------126:09----------
even if you don't accept it for yourself


---------126:12----------
well thank you right because you don't


---------126:14----------
get to control my feelings


---------126:18----------
i get to feel about you the way that i


---------126:20----------
want to


---------126:21----------
and you get to respond to that however


---------126:23----------
you want to you get to say


---------126:25----------
i'm never going to talk to you again


---------126:26----------
because it makes me uncomfortable and


---------126:28----------
you get to do that that's your line in


---------126:30----------
the sand to draw


---------126:36----------
well thanks well at the very least


---------126:37----------
you've identified the


---------126:39----------
bits because usually these mental blocks


---------126:40----------
where every time i try to access the


---------126:42----------
thought it doesn't let me


---------126:43----------
i've had that before you start having


---------126:44----------
with anger things like that


---------126:46----------
um or i'm telling you yeah go ahead i'm


---------126:49----------
sorry


---------126:50----------
no tell me dude you feeling angry is


---------126:53----------
like i'm so happy for you


---------126:55----------
and even i'm telling it's it's coming


---------126:58----------
out you got to clean out that trash


---------127:00----------
right you got to take it out of the


---------127:01----------
trash can


---------127:03----------
and it'll come out and you you're


---------127:05----------
entitled to that anger because you've


---------127:07----------
had to deal with this [ __ ] for so long


---------127:10----------
and let you know just let like feel that


---------127:12----------
baby just feel it


---------127:15----------
and let yourself be wronged because


---------127:17----------
that's what's happened


---------127:19----------
right but you can't know that you're


---------127:21----------
being wronged unless you


---------127:23----------
on some level know that you deserve the


---------127:26----------
right


---------127:28----------
and so that seed of self-esteem is


---------127:30----------
already there


---------127:35----------
a lot of people blame women in abusive


---------127:37----------
relationships why didn't you leave and


---------127:38----------
it's like


---------127:39----------
if if people are raised to never know


---------127:42----------
that they can expect respect or what


---------127:43----------
respect looks like


---------127:45----------
how do they even know they're being


---------127:46----------
wronged a lot of people in abusive


---------127:48----------
relationships don't know


---------127:49----------
that it's wrong and so yeah


---------127:52----------
so i think yeah you're right there and i


---------127:55----------
i think


---------127:55----------
yeah it's a hard place place to be this


---------127:58----------
is really difficult to do live there are


---------128:00----------
lots of people who get like a tiny


---------128:01----------
snippet of the conversation and let them


---------128:02----------
buy it


---------128:03----------
fill in the rest they like arrive for


---------128:05----------
like two minutes and they judge


---------128:07----------
there are lots of armed chairs


---------128:08----------
psychologists who come up with [ __ ]


---------128:10----------
lots of sexist [ __ ] about men like


---------128:12----------
men just can't be friends with women and


---------128:14----------
women are this and men can't be that too


---------128:17----------
like i believe in men men can be decent


---------128:18----------
people


---------128:19----------
and friends and yeah no i i don't have


---------128:22----------
this awful stereotype that men can't be


---------128:23----------
friends with women and [ __ ] i


---------128:25----------
i wouldn't be friends with men if i


---------128:27----------
thought that it was a thing that they


---------128:29----------
were just too


---------128:30----------
primal to do so like i think i have a


---------128:32----------
little bit more faith in men than twitch


---------128:34----------
chat does but i'm still being called


---------128:36----------
lots of awful things like a man hater


---------128:38----------
right now which is very odd it's so


---------128:40----------
difficult to have these sorts of


---------128:42----------
conversations live i'm getting so much


---------128:44----------
judgment


---------128:44----------
and it's so funny like it'll bounce


---------128:46----------
between she's so wrong she doesn't


---------128:47----------
understand basic biology and there'll be


---------128:49----------
people


---------128:50----------
going could you fart for me between it


---------128:52----------
all


---------128:54----------
it takes a lot of practice to be very


---------128:55----------
calm and kind of


---------128:57----------
um indifferent to all of the weird


---------129:01----------
weirdness of twitch jet so any of the


---------129:04----------
last thing i'll leave you with


---------129:06----------
is that i want i commend you for


---------129:09----------
having this conversation right it's an


---------129:13----------
important conversation that the haters


---------129:15----------
are gonna hate


---------129:16----------
whatever but i think that there are a


---------129:18----------
lot of people out there who are really


---------129:19----------
listening


---------129:20----------
and hearing something that they need to


---------129:22----------
hear


---------129:23----------
second thing is i want you to cut


---------129:25----------
yourself some slack


---------129:27----------
if those people get to you


---------129:31----------
right because it is hard to deal with


---------129:34----------
and you deserve to not be perfect


---------129:36----------
you deserve to feel judged you deserve


---------129:39----------
to feel weak


---------129:40----------
you deserve to feel all of those things


---------129:42----------
even if they aren't true i don't think


---------129:43----------
they're true


---------129:44----------
but social media and the internet does


---------129:47----------
that to us they make us feel small and i


---------129:49----------
think one of the biggest problems that


---------129:50----------
we


---------129:51----------
run into is that we judge ourselves for


---------129:54----------
being weak when we're allowed to be weak


---------129:56----------
and so we beat ourselves up for letting


---------129:58----------
them affect us


---------130:00----------
and then suddenly we're on the same team


---------130:02----------
with them


---------130:03----------
they're beating us up and we're beating


---------130:04----------
ourselves up so don't be on that team


---------130:07----------
and if you are on that team that's okay


---------130:10----------
that's just how we're conditioned


---------130:14----------
yeah good luck to you thank you i feel


---------130:17----------
like we didn't get enough time to answer


---------130:18----------
people's questions


---------130:19----------
i'm sorry yeah i know i i i'm i know we


---------130:23----------
didn't get enough time and i'm so glad


---------130:26----------
because i i think that this conversation


---------130:28----------
i don't know how other people are what


---------130:29----------
other people are going to think about it


---------130:30----------
but


---------130:31----------
i think your your growth has been really


---------130:33----------
remarkable


---------130:35----------
and and i mean you may not see it you


---------130:38----------
may not feel it i know that you're


---------130:39----------
feeling


---------130:40----------
potentially more negative emotion than


---------130:42----------
the first time we met but like it's just


---------130:43----------
part of the journey


---------130:45----------
right because now you know you're angry


---------130:47----------
because you deserve more than what


---------130:48----------
people are giving you


---------130:50----------
and that like that's the [ __ ] essence


---------130:52----------
of self-esteem


---------130:53----------
when you know what you're worth anger is


---------130:56----------
a hopeful emotion it's when you don't


---------130:57----------
stand for how things are and you hope


---------130:59----------
that they can be better i mean


---------131:00----------
anger would be useless but anger if it


---------131:03----------
wasn't that


---------131:03----------
anger is why women have the right to


---------131:05----------
vote anger is why


---------131:07----------
so many slaves were freed like anger is


---------131:09----------
when we


---------131:10----------
don't like how things are and we want it


---------131:11----------
to change i understand that it's a


---------131:13----------
positive thing when used


---------131:14----------
maturely i i was writing off everything


---------131:17----------
every bit of anger as


---------131:19----------
immature and i yeah i do think that


---------131:23----------
oh oddly anger is something people


---------131:25----------
deserve to feel not in a malicious way i


---------131:27----------
don't feel like you deserve to be angry


---------131:28----------
fool


---------131:28----------
i mean you know yeah like the way you


---------131:30----------
said it i think you said it's beautiful


---------131:32----------
people deserve to feel


---------131:33----------
vulnerable and angry and all those


---------131:35----------
things they have the right


---------131:37----------
you made me cringe a little bit i hope


---------131:39----------
you let yourself be angry in an immature


---------131:41----------
way too


---------131:42----------
[Laughter]


---------131:46----------
don't be a perfect version of yourself


---------131:53----------
true true yeah okay i'm glad you called


---------131:56----------
that one yeah just it's you gotta be


---------131:59----------
careful


---------132:00----------
yeah yeah you get to be inappropriately


---------132:03----------
angry you get to just have a bad day


---------132:05----------
because people are mistreating you and


---------132:06----------
take it out on other people you should


---------132:08----------
apologize afterward but you get to feel


---------132:10----------
that way


---------132:12----------
i'll try not to either yeah try not to


---------132:15----------
try not to but don't beat yourself up if


---------132:17----------
you slip up from time to time


---------132:18----------
because it's a process it's a journey


---------132:20----------
cool


---------132:21----------
yeah definitely i'm sorry if i did that


---------132:24----------
with you i mean i'm under a lot of


---------132:25----------
pressure right now there are thousands


---------132:26----------
of people blaming me for the situation


---------132:28----------
i'm in right now


---------132:29----------
so it felt like a little bit much but i


---------132:31----------
hope you didn't feel disrespected during


---------132:33----------
this conversation


---------132:34----------
because i have a lot of respect for you


---------132:36----------
no i didn't feel disrespected in fact


---------132:37----------
i'm really really glad


---------132:39----------
that you shared that with me


---------132:43----------
because anita telling me that i did


---------132:46----------
something


---------132:47----------
that was not fair or judgmental is not


---------132:50----------
disrespectful


---------132:51----------
this is my whole point you get to say


---------132:54----------
i'm disrespectful if i'm disrespectful


---------132:56----------
and i have to listen to that


---------133:00----------
right it's not like i can't [ __ ] up


---------133:04----------
like you get to say that


---------133:09----------
you get to say dr k you're being an


---------133:11----------
[ __ ]


---------133:12----------
you're being judgmental and then we sit


---------133:15----------
down and we look at


---------133:16----------
like what's going on there like you get


---------133:17----------
to say that man


---------133:19----------
