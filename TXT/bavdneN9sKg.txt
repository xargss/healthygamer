---------00:01----------
Then your entire grade is based on that final paper.

---------00:04----------
You have three months to work on that paper.

---------00:05----------
When do you start working on it?

---------00:07----------
Like..

---------00:08----------
When you have two weeks left, right?

---------00:10----------
And so like..

---------00:10----------
What you want to do is you kind of think like..

---------00:12----------
Okay..

---------00:12----------
With the start of the semester you're thinking, okay..

---------00:13----------
I'm gonna work on this paper every week..

---------00:15----------
And then I'm not gonna be stressed out..

---------00:17----------
At the end of..

---------00:18----------
..of the semester.

---------00:20----------
So three months later..

---------00:20----------
I'll have it all like.. like..

---------00:21----------
Done and I'll like..

---------00:22----------
Polish it.

---------00:23----------
I'm actually gonna turn in..

---------00:24----------
..two weeks early.

---------00:25----------
Like I'm gonna just get it done and then I'm gonna relax the last two weeks.

---------00:29----------
And then it's gonna be amazing

---------00:30----------
I'm gonna get an A.

---------00:31----------
Everything's gonna be great.

---------00:33----------
And then..

---------00:34----------
Then like..

---------00:35----------
I want you guys to think about that..

---------00:36----------
So your brain is like..

---------00:37----------
"Okay.."

---------00:37----------
"Buddy.." like

---------00:38----------
"Let me.."

---------00:38----------
"Let me understand this.."

---------00:39----------
"What you're saying is that.."

---------00:41----------
"We're gonna spend three months working on something that we can finish in three days?"

---------00:46----------
Like "Why on earth would we do that?"

---------00:48----------
Like "You're dumb, man.."

---------00:50----------
Like "You're telling me that you want to work your ass off?"

---------00:54----------
"For.."

---------00:54----------
"Ten weeks.."

---------00:55----------
"And then do this paper in two weeks?"

---------00:58----------
Oh, sorry.

---------00:59----------
"You.. You're telling me that you want to work your ass off for ten weeks.."

---------01:01----------
"And then we're gonna relax for two weeks when you turn it in early?"

---------01:04----------
"or.."

---------01:05----------
"OR..!!"

---------01:06----------
"We can actually just relax for ten weeks.."

---------01:08----------
"And then.." like

---------01:09----------
"..work our asses off for two weeks and then be done with it."

---------01:13----------
Like think about that for a second, right?

---------01:16----------
So the reason that procrastination is so resistant..

---------01:19----------
To get like..

---------01:19----------
The reason we're so resistant to getting rid of procrastination..

---------01:22----------
Is because it's a really really effective solution.

---------01:26----------
Think about all of the time and pleasure..

---------01:29----------
And enjoyment..

---------01:30----------
You buy yourself by procrastinating.

---------01:33----------
Like sure..

---------01:34----------
Like..

---------01:34----------
.. you stress to yourself out for those last two weeks or three days or whatever.

---------01:38----------
But all kinds of..

---------01:39----------
Of like..

---------01:39----------
You know..

---------01:40----------
Emotions that are floating beneath the surface but like..

---------01:42----------
Think about all of the Youtube you get to watch!

---------01:44----------
Or all of the games that you get to play by procrastinating.

---------01:47----------
And then your brain is like "Dude.."

---------01:48----------
"..I don't understand why you want us to suffer for ten weeks doing 'boring' stuff that we don't want to do.."

---------01:54----------
"When we can do it in like [somewhere] between three days and two weeks instead."

---------01:57----------
" It's just dumb.."

---------01:57----------
"It's.. It's silly.."

---------01:59----------
So the first thing to understand is that procrastination is not a problem..

---------02:02----------
..it is a solution.

---------02:03----------
And it is an incredibly effective solution..

---------02:06----------
Which is why it's so prevalent.

---------02:08----------
So the things that work well tend to spread evolutionarily.

---------02:11----------
Right?

---------02:12----------
So like eyes tend to work pretty well..

---------02:14----------
Furthermore..

---------02:15----------
Two eyes tend to work better than one eye because it gives us depth perception.

---------02:18----------
And lo and behold

---------02:20----------
Most people in the world..

---------02:22----------
..have two eyes.

---------02:23----------
It's because it's so effective.

---------02:26----------
So procrastination is actually a highly efficient..

---------02:29----------
"..task completing strategy."

---------02:32----------
And if you guys don't think it's efficient, just think about this for a second..

---------02:35----------
If you can write a paper in three days..

---------02:38----------
..and..

---------02:39----------
..one semester.

---------02:41----------
Like let's say you take a class..

---------02:43----------
And you have to take like..

---------02:43----------
Let's say five classes a semester.

---------02:46----------
And you take..

---------02:46----------
You do four..

---------02:47----------
Uuuh.

---------02:48----------
Let's see..

---------02:49----------
Eight semesters..

---------02:50----------
..over the course of college..

---------02:52----------
That means you're taking 40 classes.

---------02:54----------
Right?

---------02:55----------
If you can write one paper in three days..

---------02:58----------
What that means is that..

---------03:00----------
If you wanted to you could be done with college in a 120 days.

---------03:04----------
Think about that.

---------03:05----------
You could do all the work in 120 days.

---------03:07----------
Done.

---------03:07----------
Start to finish.

---------03:09----------
Because if one..

---------03:10----------
If one day you can write a paper..

---------03:11----------
Uh, I mean..

---------03:12----------
If [for] one class you can write a paper in three days..

---------03:14----------
And then your brain is like..

---------03:15----------
This is actually only a 120 days of work

---------03:17----------
I don't need to spend..

---------03:19----------
Four years..

---------03:20----------
Which is a 1200 [days] or even more than that.

---------03:23----------
Right?

---------03:24----------
It's like 1500 days.

---------03:25----------
Why would I spend a 1,500 days doing work that you can finish in 120 days?

---------03:30----------
Your brain is like..

---------03:31----------
We only need 10% of the time that you're trying to do this in

---------03:36----------
Like that's all we need.

---------03:37----------
Think about that for a second.

---------03:39----------
So the first thing to understand about procrastination..

---------03:41----------
Is that it's an incredibly efficient..

---------03:43----------
..task completing solution.

---------03:46----------
Okay?

---------03:47----------
Now the question is like, wh[at]..

---------03:48----------
But then why does it cause us so much trouble?

---------03:51----------
And that's because we have goals..

---------03:54----------
..set in our mind.

---------03:55----------
We have fantasies about our performance.

---------03:57----------
That our brain is not..

---------03:58----------
Like doesn't..

---------03:59----------
..get behind us..

---------04:00----------
..with that.

---------04:02----------
Okay?

---------04:02----------
So like what I mean by that is like..

---------04:04----------
You know..

---------04:04----------
If you write a paper in three days..

---------04:06----------
You're gonna get like a B or C.

---------04:07----------
But what you want is an A.

---------04:10----------
But like what the brain..

---------04:10----------
The brain has trouble getting behind this idea that like..

---------04:13----------
"Okay, I could spend 10% of the work."

---------04:16----------
"I could spend 10% of effort and get a B."

---------04:19----------
"Or I could spend a 100% effort and get an A."

---------04:22----------
Your brain is like..

---------04:23----------
"That seems like kind of a bad deal to me."

---------04:25----------
Like "Why would I want to spend.."

---------04:27----------
"..fifteen hundred days.."

---------04:29----------
"..getting an A.."

---------04:30----------
"..when I could spend 120 days getting a B?"

---------04:35----------
"Or C.."

---------04:36----------
Brains like..

---------04:36----------
"That's dumb, dude."

---------04:37----------
"We can get a.."

---------04:38----------
"We can get a degree with.." like "..a straight.." like

---------04:41----------
"..2.8 average."

---------04:43----------
"Or.." like "..3.0 average and we could just work 10% of the time"

---------04:47----------
Right?

---------04:48----------
That's the first thing.

---------04:49----------
So second thing is that..

---------04:51----------
You know..

---------04:52----------
When.. when it comes to actual..

---------04:53----------
So that's the first thing to understand about procrastination.

---------04:55----------
Now..

---------04:56----------
Even if it's a solution.

---------04:58----------
There are different kinds of things that happen with procrastination..

---------05:03----------
That like cause..

---------05:04----------
So that's..

---------05:04----------
So even if we say it's a solution we still want to change that solution.

---------05:07----------
Right?

---------05:07----------
We don't.. We don't wanna accept that solution.

---------05:09----------
So the process of changing and overcoming procrastination..

---------05:13----------
We need to understand like how to change it even though it is a very efficient solution.

---------05:18----------
And the reason that there are, you know..

---------05:20----------
Thousands of like..

---------05:21----------
Videos on procrastination..

---------05:22----------
And tons of books..

---------05:24----------
And tons of blogs on procrastination..

---------05:26----------
Is that like..

---------05:27----------
One solution doesn't work..

---------05:28----------
Because I don't think procrastination is one problem.

---------05:31----------
I think it's like half a dozen problems.

---------05:34----------
So I want you guys to think about this for a second.

---------05:37----------
So let's say I'm a doctor..

---------05:39----------
And someone comes to me and they say

---------05:40----------
"I have an illness."

---------05:42----------
And then I say

---------05:43----------
"Okay, you have an illness?"

---------05:44----------
"Let me give you medicine for your illness."

---------05:46----------
And then someone else comes in and says

---------05:47----------
"Oh, I'm sick."

---------05:48----------
And then I say

---------05:48----------
"Okay, you're sick?"

---------05:49----------
"Let me give you medicine for your sickness."

---------05:51----------
And there's no specificity of diagnosis

---------05:54----------
So whether someone comes in with a heart attack..

---------05:56----------
Or depression..

---------05:57----------
Or an allergic reaction..

---------05:58----------
Or erectile dysfunction..

---------06:00----------
My treatment is all the same.

---------06:02----------
Like how good of a doctor do you think I'm gonna be?

---------06:06----------
I'm gonna be a bad doctor..

---------06:07----------
Right?

---------06:08----------
And what's the problem here is that..

---------06:10----------
We're.. we're taking something like "sickness"..

---------06:12----------
And we're not breaking it into its component parts..

---------06:14----------
Which are actually different..

---------06:15----------
And have different solutions.

---------06:17----------
So the first thing to understand about..

---------06:19----------
Next thing to understand about procrastination..

---------06:21----------
Is that there are actually multiple kinds of procrastination..

---------06:24----------
And that's why it's so hard to get rid of

---------06:26----------
Because until you understand what kind of procrastination..

---------06:29----------
What type of procastination..

---------06:31----------
..you are dealing with

---------06:32----------
There are different strategies for different kinds of procrastination..

---------06:35----------
Which is why you can read a procrastination blog

---------06:36----------
Which says

---------06:37----------
"Here are five tips to overcome procrastination."

---------06:39----------
It doesn't help you at all.

---------06:42----------
So let's start by understanding there are three different..

---------06:44----------
So today we're going to cover three different kinds of procrastionation

---------06:48----------
Those are ideal..

---------06:49----------
.."Idealistic Procrastination".

---------06:52----------
"Consequence Procrastination".

---------06:54----------
and "Operational Procrastination".

---------06:57----------
So the first one is idealistic procrastination..

---------06:59----------
And this is when..

---------07:00----------
..our brain..

---------07:02----------
..creates a particular fantasy..

---------07:04----------
..about what we want..

---------07:07----------
And our inability to..

---------07:09----------
Get that fantasy [that] keeps us from trying

---------07:12----------
So this is the procrastination of what I call

---------07:14----------
"Readiness".

---------07:15----------
So this is also "Readiness Procrastination".

---------07:17----------
This is the procrastination that..

---------07:19----------
I will do this task when I am ready to..

---------07:22----------
When I'm ready to do it.

---------07:24----------
Right? Like..

---------07:24----------
So I'll give you guys a prime example.

---------07:26----------
Before I started doing the webinar..

---------07:28----------
The reason that I hadn't done the webinars..

---------07:30----------
Because in my mind, I.. I..

---------07:32----------
..wanted to improve my handwriting..

---------07:34----------
..before I did the webinar.

---------07:36----------
I was like

---------07:36----------
"I'm gonna practice my handwriting..

---------07:37----------
"..for like one or two months or three months.."

---------07:40----------
"..and learn how to write legibly again because I'm a doctor and all of our handwriting sucks."

---------07:45----------
"And once I I'm ready to like write legibly then I'll start the webinar."

---------07:50----------
And so, I don't know if you guys..

---------07:52----------
Like.. Realize that..

---------07:53----------
"Can you take notes in your word?" 
 [Question from Twitch Chat]

---------07:54----------
Yeah. I have notes in word.

---------07:56----------
Um.

---------07:58----------
So..

---------07:59----------
Do you guys really want notes?

---------08:01----------
Hold on.

---------08:04----------
Okay, sure.

---------08:05----------
I can type this.

---------08:08----------
Okay, so the first thing.

---------08:09----------
Point number one.

---------08:13----------
Procrastination..

---------08:14----------
Let me just make sure this is

---------08:17----------
..is a solution,

---------08:19----------
[not a] problem.

---------08:21----------
Procrastination is waiting until the last minute to complete a task.

---------08:29----------
Procrastination..

---------08:31----------
..is an incredibly efficient..

---------08:35----------
..Task completion strategy.

---------08:39----------
So the key thing here is that

---------08:42----------
Procrastination is not about..

---------08:46----------
..quality,

---------08:47----------
..it's about..

---------08:49----------
..value..

---------08:50----------
..or efficiency.

---------08:53----------
And remember

---------08:53----------
Value

---------08:55----------
Equals

---------08:56----------
Effort

---------08:57----------
Sorry.

---------08:58----------
Yield divided by effort.

---------09:02----------
Okay, so that's the first thing..

---------09:03----------
So second thing is..

---------09:04----------
Procrastination..

---------09:06----------
..it's hard to fix because

---------09:10----------
..there are subtypes..

---------09:12----------
..and so we frequently..

---------09:15----------
..mis-

---------09:17----------
diagnose..

---------09:18----------
..our..

---------09:20----------
..procrastination.

---------09:22----------
So that we end up treating it incorrectly.

---------09:29----------
Okay?

---------09:30----------
That's the second thing.

---------09:31----------
So the three types..

---------09:32----------
So those are subtypes of procrastination.

---------09:33----------
Number one.

---------09:37----------
"Idealistic Procrastination"

---------09:41----------
Number two.

---------09:43----------
Uh.

---------09:48----------
Is "Avoidance .."

---------09:50----------
".. Procrastination"

---------09:51----------
And number three is..

---------09:53----------
"Operational.."

---------09:55----------
"..Procrastination

---------09:56----------
The each of these has a different thing going on in your mind..

---------09:59----------
And as a result..

---------10:01----------
..has a different..

---------10:06----------
..has a different solution.

---------10:07----------
So what is "Idealistic Procrastination"?

---------10:10----------
So first thing is..

---------10:11----------
"Idealistic Procrastination" is about a fantasy.

---------10:15----------
Okay?

---------10:15----------
So what that means is that you think like..

---------10:17----------
"I want this task.."

---------10:19----------
".. to turn out a certain way."

---------10:21----------
I want this task to dot dot dot..

---------10:25----------
And until the ta[sk]..

---------10:26----------
Until your brain figures out how to make that..

---------10:29----------
..possible.

---------10:30----------
You're not gonna do it.

---------10:31----------
So this is also a procrastination of readiness.

---------10:35----------
So what I mean by that is like..

---------10:37----------
"I'm gonna do this task when I'm ready to make it perfect."

---------10:40----------
And so think about all of the things in life that you avoid doing..

---------10:44----------
..because you're not ready to make them perfect yet.

---------10:46----------
So the example that I use for this webinar is like..

---------10:48----------
..I wanted to improve my handwriting..

---------10:51----------
..before I..

---------10:53----------
..started doing the webinar because then like my notes would be nice and clean and things like that..

---------10:57----------
And since like I'm not going to improve my handwriting

---------10:59----------
Like.. I'm not gonna do the webinar.

---------11:01----------
So in this case, like..

---------11:01----------
There was an interesting pressure from Covid and all this kind of stuff that we decided..

---------11:05----------
Okay..

---------11:05----------
Let's do our mental health bootcamp.

---------11:07----------
Let's just do it.

---------11:07----------
Even if we're gonna do a bad job..

---------11:09----------
Let's just try it and see what happens.

---------11:12----------
And so your attachment to the fantasy..

---------11:14----------
..prevents you from moving forward.

---------11:16----------
So I'm gonna ask that there's this girl I like.

---------11:19----------
I'm gonna ask her out but she's gonna say no because I'm out of shape

---------11:22----------
So let me get in shape first and then I'm gonna ask her out

---------11:25----------
You guys with me?

---------11:27----------
Like this is an "Idealistic Procrastination".

---------11:33----------
Right?

---------11:34----------
And so..

---------11:35----------
Um.

---------11:37----------
So..

---------11:38----------
..what this means is that..

---------11:39----------
Like..

---------11:40----------
If you want a 4.0 like you're not gonna..

---------11:42----------
You know..

---------11:43----------
This really leads to all kinds of weird things

---------11:45----------
Like..

---------11:45----------
Let's say you wait halfway through the semester..

---------11:48----------
And you procrastinate and you want like a 4.0 that semester..

---------11:51----------
And then you realize that you're not gonna get a 4.0..

---------11:54----------
..because you've procrastinated so much

---------11:56----------
And then instead of like shooting for the 3.0..

---------11:59----------
Since you can't have the 4.0..

---------12:01----------
It's sort of like causes you to lose any desire to do work..

---------12:04----------
..and then you end up with a 2.0

---------12:06----------
It's this really weird convoluted mental gymnastics kind of thing..

---------12:10----------
But you're so attached..

---------12:12----------
..to a particular fantasy or ideal

---------12:15----------
That you're not willing to..

---------12:16----------
Like..  do something..

---------12:17----------
..less than the ideal.

---------12:20----------
So it's sort of like this..

---------12:21----------
This attachment to an idealistic..

---------12:24----------
..outcome.

---------12:25----------
And the difficulty of obtaining that idealistic outcome..

---------12:28----------
And we'll kind of get to that in a second.

---------12:30----------
Has to do with "Operational Procrastination".

---------12:32----------
..prevents you from actually acting.

---------12:35----------
Right? Does that make sense?

---------12:37----------
Yeah, you don't even take the test.

---------12:39----------
Absolutely, right?

---------12:40----------
So you'd rather have..

---------12:43----------
..a 100% chance at an F.

---------12:46----------
Then the F..

---------12:46----------
Then the 20% chance at an A.

---------12:49----------
So you just think about that.

---------12:50----------
Like that's crazy.

---------12:53----------
You'd rather take..

---------12:55----------
..a 100% chance of an F..

---------12:58----------
..rather than a 20% chance..

---------13:03----------
..at an A.

---------13:04----------
Just think about that..

---------13:05----------
That's completely messed up.

---------13:07----------
Like it's bizarre.

---------13:09----------
But it's so true, Right?

---------13:10----------
So let's not..

---------13:12----------
Let's remember that the goal of like..

---------13:13----------
Like our..

---------13:14----------
..our boot camp here is..

---------13:15----------
.. we don't..

---------13:16----------
..care about..

---------13:17----------
..whether things are smart or dumb.

---------13:20----------
Or we don't care about..

---------13:22----------
Whether we're idiotic or our brain is stupid..

---------13:24----------
We care about what is.

---------13:26----------
So we're not going to judge that we're gonna just accept..

---------13:29----------
..that this is the way that we're wired.

---------13:31----------
And if this is the way that we're wired we can ham and haw..

---------13:34----------
..and we can get upset about it

---------13:35----------
Or we can just say like..

---------13:36----------
Okay, let's scratch our heads a little bit..

---------13:38----------
And see if this is the way that we're wired

---------13:40----------
Like let's see if we can just fix it.

---------13:42----------
Let's see if we can start from where we are and move forward.

---------13:46----------
So..

---------13:47----------
If we think about this, we'll get to..

---------13:49----------
[Thinking]

---------13:50----------
Okay, let's get those solutions, right?

---------13:51----------
So how do you deal with "Idealistic Procrastination"?

---------13:55----------
"Idealistic Procrastination"..

---------13:57----------
..if we're thinking about solutions.

---------13:58----------
The first thing is to recognize..

---------14:01----------
..that what you're chasing is a fantasy.

---------14:05----------
The solutions.

---------14:12----------
But what you need to do is learn how to step away from your fantasy or idealization.

---------14:15----------
Right?

---------14:16----------
Recognize that like, okay..

---------14:17----------
The problem is that you set a target for yourself..

---------14:19----------
..which is unrealistic.

---------14:20----------
So if you..

---------14:21----------
If you've never gotten a 4.0 if you have a 2.0 GPA..

---------14:24----------
And you start your second semester and you're like..

---------14:26----------
This semester..

---------14:27----------
..I want a 4.0

---------14:28----------
Like this semester..

---------14:29----------
..I'm gonna do it.

---------14:30----------
You start by actually letting go of that, right?

---------14:32----------
You start by saying

---------14:33----------
"Hey, Buddy."

---------14:34----------
It's like very very very unlikely..

---------14:37----------
..probably impossible..

---------14:38----------
..for me to go to it from a 2.0..

---------14:40----------
..to a 4.0

---------14:41----------
Right?

---------14:42----------
So..

---------14:44----------
..recognize you're chasing a fantasy..

---------14:48----------
And then..

---------14:49----------
This is the tricky part..

---------14:51----------
Then grieve..

---------14:52----------
..your..

---------14:53----------
..loss.

---------14:54----------
Okay?

---------14:55----------
So the solution to "Idealistic Procrastination"..

---------14:57----------
..is grief.

---------14:59----------
This is what you guys need to learn how to do..

---------15:01----------
Because your attachment..

---------15:03----------
..to the 4.0..

---------15:05----------
..is what keeps you stuck.

---------15:07----------
If you can grieve and you can say like..

---------15:09----------
Okay, that 4.0 is never gonna happen.

---------15:12----------
It's not gonna happen. I'm just not capable.

---------15:14----------
I'm not that smart.

---------15:15----------
I'm not that capable.

---------15:16----------
I'm too lazy.

---------15:17----------
I'm too undisciplined

---------15:19----------
Let me grieve that loss..

---------15:21----------
..and let me set a more realistic expectation.

---------15:23----------
Like what are you actually..

---------15:24----------
And say like..

---------15:24----------
And then aim low, right?

---------15:26----------
So say like, okay.

---------15:26----------
Let's..

---------15:27----------
..shoot..

---------15:28----------
..for a 2.1..

---------15:30----------
..this semester.

---------15:32----------
This is the cognitive process..

---------15:34----------
..that you need to do.

---------15:37----------
Like just grieve it and just let it go and be like..

---------15:39----------
Okay, well, that's it.

---------15:40----------
Screwed.

---------15:41----------
Let's shoot for a 2.1

---------15:43----------
And the cool thing about that..

---------15:45----------
"Doesn't grieving sound like giving up?"  
 [Question from Twitch Chat]

---------15:46----------
On the contrary!

---------15:47----------
G..Grieving is NOT giving up.

---------15:50----------
Grieving is actually accepting a loss and moving forward.

---------15:54----------
Right?

---------15:55----------
Like if we think about grief like when someone when a loved one passes away.

---------15:58----------
The process of grieving is accepting their loss..

---------16:02----------
..and then moving forward

---------16:04----------
Giving up is completely different.

---------16:07----------
Um.

---------16:08----------
No, you guys are that smart.

---------16:10----------
The..The all of these problems are worse for people that are smart.

---------16:13----------
Easier for people that are less smart.

---------16:15----------
Because your brain is working against you

---------16:17----------
This is what you guys have to understand..

---------16:18----------
The smarter you are the stronger your brain is..

---------16:21----------
..and the harder it is to overcome problems like procrastination

---------16:25----------
You guys get that?

---------16:27----------
It's..

---------16:27----------
It's..

---------16:29----------
Um.

---------16:30----------
Anyway.

---------16:30----------
So the solution to "Idealistic pra..Procrastination" is grieving your loss..

---------16:35----------
..or..

---------16:36----------
..letting go of your fantasy.

---------16:40----------
And we'll kind of get to this in a second..

---------16:41----------
But..

---------16:42----------
So I want you guys to think about this.

---------16:43----------
As long as you have an unrealistic fantasy.

---------16:46----------
You're never going to be able to move forward, right?

---------16:48----------
If you have a 2.0

---------16:49----------
And you don't have that.. the study skills or the habits..

---------16:53----------
or environment or intelligence to get a 4.0

---------16:56----------
If you attach yourself to that 4.0

---------16:58----------
You're never gonna be able to study..

---------17:00----------
..because like you're never gonna be able to get there.

---------17:02----------
You're shooting for something that is like impossible and therefore all its gonna leave to..

---------17:07----------
..lead to..

---------17:07----------
..is like disappointment and the lack of confidence.

---------17:10----------
Instead what you need to do is let go that fantasy and say

---------17:13----------
"Hey."

---------17:14----------
"I'm just.." like "I've gotten a 2.0 for four semesters in a row.."

---------17:17----------
"Let me see if I can at least get a 2.5"

---------17:20----------
And once you have an attainable goal because this is..

---------17:23----------
This..

---------17:25----------
..fantasy..

---------17:26----------
..it's.. it's for the most part unattainable.

---------17:30----------
You're setting yourself up for failure here.

---------17:32----------
I want you guys to really think about this.

---------17:35----------
You're setting yourself up for an equation that you're like..

---------17:37----------
..bound to fail.

---------17:39----------
And so like no wonder you're stuck in life because..

---------17:42----------
..you're playing a game that you literally cannot win.

---------17:45----------
And If you.. And you hope you win..

---------17:47----------
And that's what the fantasy is..

---------17:48----------
The more you start to fail them the bigger the fantasy becomes

---------17:51----------
And the harder becomes to achieve and the more stuck you get.

---------17:54----------
Like.. this explains why people are stuck.

---------17:56----------
Because you're not letting..

---------17:57----------
You're not willing to let go of your fantasy of progress.

---------18:01----------
And if you don't..

---------18:02----------
If you can't let go of your fantasy of your progress

---------18:04----------
You can't actually progress..

---------18:06----------
And here's the thing..

---------18:08----------
When you actually let go..

---------18:09----------
..of your fantasy.

---------18:11----------
Cool things happen.

---------18:13----------
Instead of a 2.

---------18:14----------
1

---------18:15----------
You actually get..

---------18:18----------
2.7

---------18:19----------
And then you're like..

---------18:20----------
Okay, I got a 2.7..

---------18:21----------
..let me -shoot for a 2.8 and then you get..

---------18:27----------
3.0

---------18:28----------
And then you get..

---------18:31----------
3.50

---------18:32----------
So if you guys talk to people..

---------18:35----------
Who like put their lives together?

---------18:38----------
It's not an over..

---------18:39----------
It's not an overnight thing.

---------18:42----------
Right?

---------18:42----------
It's not an overnight thing.

---------18:43----------
It's a gradual process.

---------18:45----------
How do you let go of your grief?

---------18:48----------
So we'll talk more about that.

---------18:49----------
But..

---------18:50----------
You accept right?

---------18:51----------
So you tell yourselves like..

---------18:52----------
So you're gonna have a thought that I can get a 4.0 and then you na..

---------18:55----------
..need to have another thought that says

---------18:57----------
"Hey buddy, that's realistic."

---------18:58----------
"Let's shoot for a 2.1"

---------19:00----------
You have that thought along with your thought.

---------19:04----------
So this..

---------19:06----------
So we can talk more about how to grieve..

---------19:08----------
But I want to go through a couple of other

---------19:10----------
Uh.

---------19:11----------
Types of procrastination, right?

---------19:13----------
So the second thing is "Avoidance Procrastination".

---------19:15----------
So this..

---------19:16----------
..procrastination..

---------19:18----------
..tends to be based on..

---------19:20----------
..emotions.

---------19:21----------
What I mean by this is that..

---------19:23----------
If you think about a particular task, like..

---------19:25----------
Let's say that you want to..

---------19:27----------
Um.

---------19:29----------
Ask your boss for vacation..

---------19:31----------
Like you want to go on vacation..

---------19:33----------
..but you're afraid that your boss is gonna say "No!"

---------19:35----------
Or you're afraid that your boss is gonna think you're lazy.

---------19:38----------
Or..

---------19:39----------
You're asking..

---------19:40----------
This is an example..

---------19:41----------
..I was dealing with recently.

---------19:42----------
You're asking your professor for an extension due to Covid.

---------19:46----------
And you're afraid that like..

---------19:48----------
Your professor is gonna think you're dumb..

---------19:50----------
Because you need an extension..

---------19:52----------
And so there are all kinds of like emotions ..

---------19:55----------
And you're trying to avoid that..

---------19:57----------
..emotional impact.

---------19:59----------
Right? You're trying to avoid the emotion..

---------20:01----------
..of..

---------20:02----------
..people thinking or ego..

---------20:04----------
You're trying to avoid the emotion of like..

---------20:07----------
You know..

---------20:07----------
Oh, I'm afraid that my professors gonna think I'm dumb.

---------20:10----------
I'm afraid that this is not gonna ..

---------20:12----------
..go well.

---------20:12----------
There's it's.. It's fundamentally..

---------20:13----------
It's an emotional procrastination.

---------20:16----------
So this is different from the fantasy!

---------20:18----------
You guys get that like fantasy is like..

---------20:20----------
You having an ideal in your mind of what you can accomplish if everything goes right

---------20:24----------
Man.. During Covid..

---------20:25----------
..I can't leave the house so I'm gonna learn five languages..

---------20:27----------
And I'm gonna get into shape..

---------20:28----------
And I'm gonna wake up at 7 a.m.

---------20:29----------
Every day.

---------20:30----------
That's fantasy.

---------20:32----------
And the bigger your fantasy becomes the more you're gonna procrastinate.

---------20:36----------
That's fundamentally different..

---------20:37----------
..from having an emotional barrier..

---------20:39----------
..that holds you back.

---------20:40----------
So emotions..

---------20:42----------
That..

---------20:43----------
..you try to avoid.

---------20:45----------
And this too is protective

---------20:49----------
Because your brain is now like

---------20:50----------
"Hey man." Like..

---------20:51----------
Oh..

---------20:51----------
If.. Until we..

---------20:52----------
Until we ask our boss..

---------20:54----------
We're not gonna have to feel bad.

---------20:56----------
Because our boss is gonna call us an idiot.

---------20:57----------
He's gonna call us lazy and he's gonna say

---------20:59----------
"No!"

---------21:00----------
And then I'm gonna have to call my friends and then..

---------21:03----------
I'm gonna have to tell them I can't come..

---------21:04----------
And then they're gonna be disappointed.

---------21:06----------
So that sounds terrible.

---------21:08----------
Hmm.

---------21:09----------
How about we don't do that.

---------21:11----------
So your brain is like..

---------21:12----------
"How about we don't do that?"

---------21:16----------
Right? You guys see this?

---------21:18----------
Brain is trying to help you out.

---------21:19----------
Your brain is like..

---------21:20----------
"Hey man. If this is gonna be bad for you.."

---------21:22----------
"..how about we don't do that?"

---------21:24----------
"How about we avoid.. the fear?"

---------21:29----------
Right?

---------21:30----------
And..

---------21:31----------
And.. But these are fundamentally different..

---------21:33----------
Because the solution is different..

---------21:36----------
You can sort of let go I mean letting go works really well..

---------21:39----------
So the solution to this

---------21:44----------
[angry noises]

---------21:49----------
The solution to this..

---------21:50----------
..is first..

---------21:52----------
..to recognize..

---------21:53----------
..the..

---------21:54----------
..emotion.

---------21:55----------
Actually, hold on, one second.

---------21:57----------
So another thing.

---------21:57----------
Okay.. So one of the things that I want to point out here..

---------22:00----------
So the only thing with "Avoidance Procrastination" is a lot of times we try to rationally

---------22:04----------
..justify..

---------22:05----------
..what we should do.

---------22:07----------
So we try to tell ourselves.

---------22:09----------
Oh like it's no big deal. Like..

---------22:11----------
Everyone's gonna ask for..

---------22:13----------
Everyone's going to ask for extensions.

---------22:15----------
Covid is going on like..

---------22:17----------
Who.. What kind of professor is gonna say no to anything during Covid?

---------22:20----------
Like who's gonna do that?

---------22:21----------
No one's gonna do that.

---------22:22----------
Like.. so we.. we have all these rational arguments.

---------22:25----------
Or other people like if we turn to friends or family members and we tell them

---------22:29----------
"Oh hey, I'm having trouble like doing this task."

---------22:31----------
They're like.. "Hey man, just do it."

---------22:32----------
They're not gonna say anything wrong.

---------22:33----------
Like it's gonna be fine.

---------22:34----------
We try to rationally justify..

---------22:36----------
..what we should do.

---------22:38----------
And how effective is that?

---------22:39----------
When we ra.. do rational justification.

---------22:47----------
[Happy noises]

---------22:49----------
Okay.

---------22:50----------
Um.

---------22:51----------
How rational is it?

---------22:52----------
Or how effective is it?

---------22:54----------
truth is.. it isn't..

---------22:55----------
It isn't effective, right?

---------22:56----------
And the reason for that is because we're trying to use thoughts..

---------22:59----------
..to deal with emotions.

---------23:01----------
And thoughts don't really work well at dealing with emotions.

---------23:04----------
Because it's kind of like apples and oranges

---------23:06----------
It's kind of like you're trying to..

---------23:08----------
..build something with a pen.

---------23:10----------
Right? A pen is used for drawing.

---------23:11----------
It's not used for building.

---------23:12----------
It's just.. They.. They don't connect..

---------23:14----------
So that our solution is to recognize the emotion.

---------23:18----------
So..

---------23:18----------
Ask yourself.

---------23:19----------
What is the emotion?

---------23:21----------
I am feeling or trying to avoid feeling?

---------23:27----------
Okay?

---------23:28----------
And if you guys are having trouble with that another question you can ask yourself is..

---------23:32----------
What is the consequence..?

---------23:34----------
If you can't pin down the emotion..

---------23:35----------
..I'm trying to avoid.

---------23:41----------
Okay.

---------23:42----------
And then ask yourself another question..

---------23:45----------
How would someone..

---------23:46----------
..who is in that situation..

---------23:49----------
..feel.

---------23:51----------
So this is a..

---------23:52----------
..really..

---------23:53----------
..quick

---------23:54----------
Cheat code to figure out what your emotions are.

---------23:57----------
So a lot of people have trouble answering this question.

---------23:59----------
They don't know what their emotions are. So maybe we'll talk about "Alexithymia" tomorrow

---------24:03----------
And so oa.. one thing that a lot of times like.. uh..

---------24:05----------
People who are technology savvy or gamers are..

---------24:08----------
They.. They're don't really have a whole lot of emotional empathy.

---------24:11----------
But they have good cognitive empathy.

---------24:13----------
And what does that mean?

---------24:14----------
It means that if you ask them to..

---------24:16----------
..analyze..

---------24:17----------
..a situation..

---------24:19----------
..and use reasoning to figure out what emotion someone is feeling.

---------24:23----------
They're really good at that

---------24:24----------
But if you ask them, what are you feeling they're like..

---------24:26----------
"I don't know."

---------24:27----------
They're emotionally colorblind..

---------24:29----------
..but their analytical capability..

---------24:31----------
..to..

---------24:32----------
..reason emotion is very good.

---------24:34----------
So this is a way..

---------24:36----------
..of transforming..

---------24:37----------
..emo.. like..

---------24:39----------
Inability to determine your emotions.

---------24:40----------
This is leveraging..

---------24:42----------
..your analytical capability to figure out your emotions.

---------24:45----------
So it's kind of like a..

---------24:46----------
..little bit of a cheat code.

---------24:47----------
Someone was asking

---------24:47----------
"Is there some way to productively use this?"

---------24:49----------
Absolutely.

---------24:50----------
It's all productive.

---------24:53----------
Um!

---------24:54----------
And so..

---------24:55----------
This is.. So.. If you have "Avoidance Procrastination"..

---------24:57----------
The first thing..is that you can't rationally fight against it.

---------24:59----------
But that's usually what we do.

---------25:02----------
So stop.

---------25:02----------
Don't even try to rationally fight it.

---------25:03----------
Start with the emotion.

---------25:05----------
Ask yourself.

---------25:05----------
"What is the emotion I'm feeling?"

---------25:06----------
And then you're gonna be like..

---------25:07----------
"I don't know what I'm feeling."

---------25:08----------
I.. I feel..

---------25:09----------
..bad.

---------25:10----------
And these are the answers you can come up.

---------25:12----------
Bad.

---------25:13----------
Lazy

---------25:16----------
Stupid

---------25:26----------
These are not emotions!

---------25:27----------
Guys.

---------25:28----------
They're not emotions.

---------25:30----------
Stupid is not an emotion.

---------25:32----------
Right?

---------25:33----------
But these are the only words that we can come up with..

---------25:35----------
..because we don't understand what like..

---------25:37----------
..we're emotionally colorblind

---------25:38----------
So do this practice and then recognize?

---------25:40----------
"Oh, okay.."

---------25:41----------
"So this is the negative emotion that I'm feeling."

---------25:44----------
"And then what you have to do is work on an emotional level, right?

---------25:47----------
So.. how do you co..

---------25:49----------
..and then.. and then you're like..

---------25:50----------
"Okay, well.."

---------25:50----------
[Happy noises]

---------25:51----------
Let's play through this dialog.

---------25:53----------
So then what we have to do is work on..

---------25:55----------
..emotional..

---------25:56----------
..level.

---------25:58----------
Okay?

---------25:58----------
Instead of a rational level.

---------26:00----------
And then y'all's responses

---------26:01----------
"How the.."

---------26:02----------
"..F.."

---------26:05----------
"..do I do that?"

---------26:07----------
Okay?

---------26:07----------
So I'm gonna tell you guys let's use our cognitive empathy.

---------26:10----------
Let's turn cognitive empathy..

---------26:11----------
..into emotional empathy again.

---------26:13----------
So..

---------26:14----------
..ask..

---------26:16----------
..yourself

---------26:16----------
[More happy noises]

---------26:19----------
If..

---------26:20----------
..I had a friend who..

---------26:22----------
..felt..

---------26:23----------
..X emotion.

---------26:25----------
What would I say to them?

---------26:28----------
Right?

---------26:29----------
And then..

---------26:31----------
..say that to yourself

---------26:33----------
You guys gettin this?

---------26:35----------
So this is gonna be kind of weird..

---------26:37----------
But a lot of times like..

---------26:38----------
inst[ead] like.. when you have friends..

---------26:39----------
..who are like?

---------26:40----------
"Oh, I'm afraid that she's gonna say No."

---------26:42----------
You know, what you want to say is like you don't want to say

---------26:44----------
Um.

---------26:46----------
You know, you don't want to say

---------26:47----------
"Just fucking do it. You're.. you're a retard."

---------26:49----------
"Just do it!" [Don't let your dreams be dreams.]

---------26:51----------
Like that's.. that's what you tell yourself, right?

---------26:53----------
Like you're lazy..

---------26:53----------
You're incompetent..

---------26:54----------
But the way that you talk to yourself and the way that you talk to your friends..

---------26:57----------
..is different.

---------26:59----------
So learn how to be supportive towards yourself.

---------27:01----------
Instead of being a judge..

---------27:04----------
..for yourself..

---------27:05----------
..learn to be a coach.

---------27:07----------
And what's the difference between a judge and a coach?

---------27:09----------
A coach is not someone who says

---------27:10----------
"Oh, everything is wonderful."

---------27:12----------
"You're amazing!"

---------27:13----------
A coach still acknowledges your flaws..

---------27:16----------
But then like encourages you to work on them instead of a judge who's punishing you.

---------27:19----------
A judge is like..

---------27:20----------
"You're lazy!"

---------27:22----------
Smacks his gavel.

---------27:23----------
"You.. You deserve to go to jail!"

---------27:24----------
"You don't deserve to play video games!"

---------27:26----------
"You suck at life!"

---------27:27----------
"Screw you!"

---------27:28----------
"[in] jail with you!"

---------27:29----------
And the coach is like..

---------27:30----------
"Hey buddy. I understand that you have trouble dribbling.."

---------27:32----------
"Let's practice dribbling and.."

---------27:35----------
Like.. "..if we if we work on it.."

---------27:36----------
"..you'll actually.." like..

---------27:37----------
"..get better." like..

---------27:38----------
"I believe in you."

---------27:39----------
So you need to start to like..

---------27:40----------
Instead of an angel and a demon on our shoulders..

---------27:43----------
Our generation has a judge and a coach.

---------27:45----------
Those are the two things that you have on your shoulders.

---------27:49----------
And.. And you still.. The coach isn't gonna let you slide..

---------27:51----------
He's just gonna be a little bit more encouraging.

---------27:53----------
Right?

---------27:54----------
And learn how to say this to yourself.

---------27:55----------
This is a task to..

---------27:56----------
This is also the subject of an entire video..

---------27:59----------
Or.. Or..

---------27:59----------
Day.. about like..

---------28:00----------
How to deal with emotions and how to talk to yourself?

---------28:03----------
Okay?

---------28:03----------
But remember that..

---------28:04----------
..that the main thing I'm asking you guys to really focus on right now is that..

---------28:08----------
..there are three kinds of procrastination and understand which one you're dealing with.

---------28:12----------
Because do you guys get that like..

---------28:13----------
Dealing with this one is fundamentally different from dealing with this one.

---------28:17----------
Two of them can coexist

---------28:19----------
But then you have to deal with each one, right?

---------28:21----------
Like.. Someone can come in with like a cough and a fever..

---------28:24----------
And then you want to give them something for their cough..

---------28:25----------
And you want to give them something for their fever..

---------28:27----------
but that's the effective..

---------28:28----------
That's the way that you become an effective doctor ..

---------28:30----------
As you deal with like..

---------28:31----------
..each part of the problem in and of itself.

---------28:33----------
And this is why procrastination is so hard to deal with because..

---------28:36----------
..we use 'one word' for procrastination.

---------28:38----------
But..

---------28:39----------
In fact..

---------28:40----------
It is actually a lot of different psychological like..

---------28:43----------
..patterns..

---------28:43----------
..that are all coexisting.

---------28:45----------
And that's why it's so persistent and so hard to fix.

---------28:48----------
You guys get this for a second that..

---------28:50----------
..if we had a solution to procrastination..

---------28:52----------
There wouldn't be a thousand solutions for it.

---------28:54----------
Because one thing would work..

---------28:56----------
and then like..

---------28:57----------
All of the self-help books about procrastination would..

---------28:59----------
..be useless.

---------29:00----------
Because there'd be one book about procrastination..

---------29:02----------
..that works for everyone.

---------29:05----------
So the fact..

---------29:05----------
The fact that you..

---------29:06----------
..you..

---------29:07----------
..don't.. You have all these thousands of solutions..

---------29:09----------
Means that like none of them work and that's because it's a complex problem.

---------29:12----------
But there shouldn't be one word procrastination.

---------29:14----------
It should be a dozen different books..

---------29:16----------
..about a dozen different kinds of procrastination.

---------29:20----------
So now let's go to the last one which is "Operational Procrastination".

---------29:25----------
So..

---------29:25----------
..this..

---------29:26----------
..is.

---------29:31----------
So operational procrastination..

---------29:33----------
..is our brain's..

---------29:35----------
..difficulty

---------29:37----------
..engaging..

---------29:39----------
..in..

---------29:40----------
..unclear tasks.

---------29:42----------
Okay,?

---------29:43----------
So what I mean by that is if our brain..

---------29:45----------
So this is the.. This kind of procrastination.

---------29:47----------
I'll tell it to you guys..

---------29:48----------
very quickly. Okay?

---------29:50----------
If you guys ever..

---------29:52----------
..procrastinated to do a task..

---------29:54----------
..for the first time?

---------29:56----------
And then when you do the task,.

---------29:57----------
You're like..

---------29:57----------
"Oh that.. actually I could.."

---------29:58----------
"I should have done that way earlier. It was actually really easy."

---------30:02----------
Does that ever happen to you?

---------30:04----------
Like this is the procrastination..

---------30:06----------
..that you experience.

---------30:07----------
When.. After you're done..

---------30:08----------
You tell yourself..

---------30:14----------
"Oh.."

---------30:14----------
"..that.."

---------30:15----------
"..actually.."

---------30:16----------
"..wasn't.."

---------30:17----------
"'..that.."

---------30:17----------
"'..bad.."

---------30:18----------
"..I should.."

---------30:18----------
"..have.."

---------30:19----------
"..done it.."

---------30:20----------
"..weeks.."

---------30:20----------
"..ago."

---------30:21----------
Great example of this..

---------30:23----------
You guys are doing yoga with us.

---------30:24----------
You're like "BAM!".

---------30:26----------
"Yoga is not that hard."

---------30:28----------
"I could have done that weeks ago."

---------30:29----------
"I could have done that weeks ago."

---------30:30----------
"I should have done that weeks ago."

---------30:32----------
This is "Operational Procrastination".

---------30:35----------
So now I want you guys to think about this..

---------30:38----------
This kind of procrastination..

---------30:40----------
Right?

---------30:40----------
I'm.. You guys can't see me pointing

---------30:42----------
[Laughter]

---------30:43----------
Is different from this ..

---------30:45----------
..procrastination.

---------30:45----------
Do you guys get that?

---------30:46----------
Do you guys get that "Avoidance Procrastination"?

---------30:49----------
"Idealistic Procrastination"

---------30:51----------
An "Operational Procrastination"

---------30:53----------
Create different thoughts in your head!

---------30:57----------
So like these are different things that are going on in your mind.

---------31:00----------
And so they have different solutions..

---------31:01----------
And if you guys actually start tailoring your solutions..

---------31:04----------
..to what is going on in your head..

---------31:06----------
..instead of having..

---------31:07----------
.."a" solution..

---------31:07----------
..to procrastination.

---------31:09----------
It's gonna be like night and day.

---------31:11----------
So what is "Operational Procrastination"?

---------31:14----------
Okay.

---------31:15----------
And how do we fix it?

---------31:17----------
Okay?

---------31:18----------
So this is how to recognize it..

---------31:19----------
..First of all

---------31:20----------
Alright? This is how to diagnose it.

---------31:21----------
This is the diagnostic question.

---------31:26----------
This is the diagnostic question.

---------31:29----------
And then this is the diagnostic question.

---------31:32----------
So if your mind is doing this..

---------31:35----------
Then you're dealing with fantasy..

---------31:36----------
.."Fantasy Procrastination".

---------31:39----------
If your mind is trying..

---------31:40----------
If your mind is like avoiding negative emotion..

---------31:44----------
If your mind is telling you this..

---------31:45----------
Actually this is the diagnostic question.

---------31:47----------
If this is what your mind is telling you..

---------31:48----------
..it's a different procrastination.

---------31:51----------
And this is kind of tricky but..

---------31:53----------
This.. 'cause this is after the fact..

---------31:55----------
If this feels..

---------31:57----------
..like..

---------31:57----------
You would say this after the fact..

---------31:59----------
Then it's "Operational Procrastination".

---------32:01----------
Okay?

---------32:02----------
So what do we do?

---------32:03----------
What is "Operational Procrastination"?

---------32:04----------
So the first thing is that..

---------32:07----------
When we..

---------32:07----------
..tell..

---------32:09----------
..our brain to do abstract tasks..

---------32:13----------
Our brain has difficulty, like..

---------32:16----------
Executing the abstract..

---------32:18----------
And this is a big problem for video gamers.

---------32:19----------
Okay?

---------32:21----------
So..

---------32:21----------
..abstract tasks..

---------32:23----------
..are difficult..

---------32:24----------
..or impossible..

---------32:25----------
..to execute.

---------32:28----------
I'll give you guys an example of this. Okay?

---------32:31----------
But let's say that I tell my four..

---------32:33----------
So let's say I tell my four-year-old

---------32:34----------
She's like almost..

---------32:36----------
..four and a half..

---------32:36----------
..or four and a half year old

---------32:38----------
Um.

---------32:39----------
So she's like four and a half and I tell her to clean..

---------32:41----------
..clean her room.

---------32:42----------
She goes into a room and she can kind of clean it.

---------32:45----------
Right?

---------32:46----------
If I tell my two and a half year old

---------32:48----------
"Go clean your room!"

---------32:50----------
She goes into the room..

---------32:50----------
And she stands there..

---------32:51----------
And she can't clean her room.

---------32:53----------
Why can't she clean her room?

---------32:55----------
It's because..

---------32:56----------
And then I tell her I'm like..

---------32:57----------
"Okay.." Like..

---------32:58----------
She doesn't understand..

---------32:59----------
So the four and a half year old..

---------33:01----------
..nderstands that cleaning room..

---------33:03----------
..is a set of individual tasks that are put together.

---------33:06----------
She recognizes a clean room and she recognizes a dirty room.

---------33:09----------
And she recognizes that her stuffed animals go here..

---------33:11----------
Her Legos go here..

---------33:12----------
And the chess set goes here..

---------33:14----------
And her markers go here..

---------33:16----------
Now the two and a half year old..

---------33:18----------
..can't piece that together

---------33:20----------
So I can tell the two and a half year old..

---------33:21----------
I can ask her where does the chess set go..

---------33:24----------
And..

---------33:24----------
..she says

---------33:25----------
"Okay, it goes here."

---------33:26----------
And I say "Clean up the chess set!"

---------33:27----------
And she can do that..

---------33:28----------
Then I can say

---------33:28----------
"Where do your markers go?"

---------33:30----------
And she knows where the markers go?

---------33:31----------
And I say "Clean up the markers, do that!"

---------33:33----------
"Where do your stuffed animals go?"

---------33:34----------
She knows that.

---------33:35----------
"Clean them up!"

---------33:36----------
"Do that!"

---------33:37----------
Right?

---------33:38----------
And then..

---------33:39----------
..Legos too..

---------33:40----------
So.. she can do each of the individual tasks.

---------33:43----------
But the..

---------33:44----------
But she can't..

---------33:44----------
..put the abstract picture together.

---------33:47----------
And this is a faculty that if you play video games..

---------33:50----------
You are worse at abstraction..

---------33:52----------
because what video games do..

---------33:54----------
..is they give..

---------33:55----------
..They.. They do all the chunking..

---------33:57----------
..of tasks for us.

---------33:58----------
Right?

---------33:59----------
The video game breaks it apart.

---------34:01----------
All it tells you is what's the next objective?

---------34:03----------
Okay, collect five rat tails.

---------34:05----------
Go turn this in over here.

---------34:06----------
Go do this over here.

---------34:08----------
And it takes it like how do you beat the game?

---------34:09----------
Like if you play like an RPG, like I play a lot of RPGs.

---------34:11----------
Right?

---------34:12----------
The RPG doesn't start with you at the beginning..

---------34:15----------
And says

---------34:16----------
"Okay.." Like..

---------34:16----------
"..so FF7 [Final Fantasy 7] remake is gonna come out soon.."

---------34:19----------
Just like you're if you're Cloud [Main Character]..

---------34:21----------
It doesn't say like..

---------34:21----------
"Go kill Sephirot!" [Main Villian]

---------34:23----------
It says like..

---------34:23----------
"Go do this thing.."

---------34:24----------
"..and go do this thing.."

---------34:25----------
"..and go do this thing.."

---------34:26----------
"..and go do this thing.."

---------34:27----------
"..and go do this thing.."

---------34:29----------
And it breaks it up for you.

---------34:30----------
So the more that we play video games.. the more..

---------34:33----------
..rusty..

---------34:34----------
..our abstraction..

---------34:35----------
..and operationalizing part of our brain becomes.

---------34:39----------
Because we're spending like 10 hours a day with tasks..

---------34:41----------
..that were not operationalizing.

---------34:43----------
Because the computer and game does it for us.

---------34:46----------
So we lose that faculty..

---------34:47----------
It's kind of like..

---------34:48----------
If you don't speak a language for a long time, you're gonna pfl..

---------34:50----------
You're gonna forget the language.

---------34:52----------
Right?

---------34:54----------
And so..

---------34:56----------
The the solution to "Operational Procrastination" is to recognize first of all that you're kind of..

---------35:00----------
You are like a two and a half year old instead of a four and a half year old..

---------35:03----------
And that if you think about like.. uh..

---------35:04----------
A good example of "Operational Procrastination" is..

---------35:07----------
..finding a job.

---------35:09----------
How do you find a job?

---------35:09----------
You can't find a job.

---------35:10----------
Do I walk out on the street?

---------35:12----------
And I see one lying there and I pick it up.

---------35:13----------
"Oh, look.."

---------35:14----------
"..I found a job."

---------35:16----------
No, that's dumb.

---------35:16----------
That's not.. We don't even have the right word for it, right?

---------35:19----------
Finding a job is not something you do.

---------35:20----------
You don't like walk down the street. You're like "Oh."

---------35:23----------
"Oh, there's a job!"

---------35:23----------
" Oh look, I got one."

---------35:25----------
We don't use the right verb.

---------35:26----------
Why do we use the word..

---------35:28----------
.."find" to get a job?

---------35:29----------
Like that's not..

---------35:31----------
It's because..

---------35:32----------
..we don't

---------35:33----------
We take this super abstract task and we assign..

---------35:36----------
..one crappy word to it

---------35:38----------
Whereas actually finding a job is like a super complicated thing, right?

---------35:41----------
It's making a resume.

---------35:43----------
It's polishing a resume.

---------35:44----------
"Do I make a resume?"

---------35:45----------
"Do I make a CV?"

---------35:46----------
"What font do I use?"

---------35:47----------
"What color do I use?"

---------35:48----------
"How do I make my margins?"

---------35:49----------
What if my resume looks fat?

---------35:51----------
Like.. What if my resume looks empty?

---------35:53----------
Right? Then we kind of get into this procrastination..

---------35:56----------
"Oh my god! My resume is empty.."

---------35:57----------
There's a little bit of "Avoidance Procrastination".

---------36:00----------
People who are reading this are gonna think it sucks..

---------36:02----------
"Oh my god!"

---------36:04----------
Right?

---------36:05----------
So it's..  it's making a resume.

---------36:06----------
That's something you can do.

---------36:09----------
Opening up Microsoft Word.

---------36:10----------
That's something you can do.

---------36:12----------
Those are tasks.

---------36:14----------
So the solution to a..

---------36:15----------
..to "Operational Procrastination"..

---------36:17----------
As many people sort of figured out..

---------36:19----------
..is..

---------36:19----------
..to actually..

---------36:20----------
..operationalize it for you.

---------36:21----------
So what I'd suggest is you..

---------36:22----------
..sit down with a piece of paper..

---------36:24----------
and you actually write out all.. as many steps as you can.

---------36:28----------
..to completing the task.

---------36:31----------
So.. in.. in..

---------36:32----------
If you guys are having trouble with this what I'd say, so..

---------36:34----------
Take..

---------36:36----------
..an abstract task..

---------36:38----------
And chunk it up

---------36:41----------
If you guys are having trouble with where to start..

---------36:43----------
This is another key thing, right?

---------36:44----------
So.. like.. How do I make a resume?

---------36:46----------
Don't start with the resume!

---------36:47----------
Start at the end!

---------36:49----------
Okay.

---------36:52----------
[Tea Cup?]

---------36:53----------
So..

---------36:53----------
..accept..

---------36:54----------
..a job offer.

---------36:56----------
Right?

---------36:58----------
So just think about this, okay?

---------36:59----------
So we accept a job offer.

---------37:02----------
Receive a job offer.

---------37:06----------
Interview.

---------37:08----------
Apply.

---------37:11----------
So then actually we can even say this.. so like..

---------37:14----------
Follow-up..

---------37:16----------
..post..

---------37:17----------
..interview with thank you notes.

---------37:20----------
Interview..

---------37:22----------
Apply..

---------37:23----------
..for job..

---------37:25----------
..(s)

---------37:27----------
How many do we need to apply..

---------37:30----------
..for..

---------37:33----------
..Interview?

---------37:35----------
What are our chances..

---------37:37----------
..of..

---------37:38----------
..an interview?

---------37:41----------
Hey, for this.. Before we interview we need to..

---------37:45----------
Dry-clean our suit..

---------37:48----------
Have hair shave..

---------37:53----------
Okay.

---------37:54----------
In order to apply for a job we have to find jobs to apply for.

---------37:59----------
How are we going to find jobs?

---------38:00----------
Okay, we can use Monster.com or online sites.

---------38:06----------
Use Craigslist..

---------38:09----------
We can..

---------38:10----------
..ask people we know.

---------38:13----------
How we get..

---------38:14----------
Now things are getting tricky so how do we know..

---------38:17----------
..we know which jobs.

---------38:20----------
..to apply for?

---------38:22----------
Okay?

---------38:23----------
So..

---------38:25----------
I'm gonna do a video about how to get the job of your dreams which is essentially operationalizing.

---------38:30----------
You guys get this?

---------38:33----------
So this is what you need to do.

---------38:37----------
Then what this does.. is like..

---------38:38----------
Like.. You can do this, right?

---------38:41----------
Can you get a job today?

---------38:42----------
No!

---------38:44----------
But you can dry-clean your suit cut your hair and shave today.

---------38:49----------
Like..

---------38:50----------
..that you can do..

---------38:51----------
And then something cool starts to happen..

---------38:54----------
As you start to check these off..

---------38:56----------
How do you think you feel about yourself?

---------39:02----------
Hmm?

---------39:05----------
It's pretty..

---------39:05----------
Start to feel good, right?

---------39:06----------
Like you're like..

---------39:07----------
"Oh I applied for five jobs today."

---------39:09----------
"Got my hair did."

---------39:11----------
Got an interview.

---------39:13----------
And the more that you kind of abstract..

---------39:15----------
You operationalize your..

---------39:17----------
..your abstract thing.

---------39:18----------
Hold on.

---------39:18----------
Oop.

---------39:19----------
Okay.

---------39:21----------
The more you operationalize your..

---------39:22----------
..your abstract thing like the..

---------39:24----------
..the easier it becomes and the better you feel about yourself.

---------39:28----------
And then the other really really cool thing about this is if you're thinking about..

---------39:32----------
Applying for a job..

---------39:33----------
And you apply for "a" job..

---------39:35----------
And you get an interview..

---------39:36----------
And..

---------39:37----------
You.. don't get the job.

---------39:38----------
You feel crushed.

---------39:40----------
But if this..

---------39:41----------
So I want you guys.. I don't know how to say this.

---------39:44----------
So if you have a bunch of..

---------39:46----------
..check boxes.

---------39:48----------
Okay?

---------39:49----------
That are successes.

---------39:51----------
And you don't get one job after one interview..

---------39:54----------
You're less likely to be crushed at it

---------39:57----------
Whereas if you apply for one job and get one interview..

---------40:00----------
And you don't make it part of this abstract large process.

---------40:03----------
That involves all of these steps..

---------40:05----------
Then all.. all you have is failure..

---------40:07----------
But if you don't get one job in this process

---------40:09----------
It's like..Who the fuck cares like you have..

---------40:11----------
You have all these different things that you're doing..

---------40:13----------
Like you're still succeeding at all of them. "Okay.."

---------40:15----------
"No big deal.." like..

---------40:16----------
"..one interview."

---------40:17----------
So like that's why..

---------40:18----------
You know..

---------40:18----------
..you're..

---------40:20----------
How many it's like..

---------40:21----------
Like.. this is part of the process right here.

---------40:24----------
How many do we need to get an interview?

---------40:26----------
Where our chances of getting an interview?

---------40:28----------
You become way more resistant..

---------40:31----------
..to despair..

---------40:32----------
..when you do this process.

---------40:34----------
Because you start to remove yourself from an equation..

---------40:36----------
You have lots and lots of successes in there..

---------40:38----------
..so you don't need to worry about a singular failure

---------40:41----------
Right? And so this is how you move forward. This is how you deal with procrastination

---------40:42----------
And this.. So this is how you move forward.

---------40:44----------
This is how you deal with procrastination.

---------40:51----------
Okay, good.

---------40:52----------
So we're gonna do a couple..

---------40:54----------
Actually uh.. We're gonna have to do meditation

---------40:55----------
So unfortunately..

---------40:56----------
..we don't have time for questions now.

---------40:58----------
So we're gonna go ahead and do meditation.

---------41:01----------
'cause then I gotta go.

---------41:03----------
Okay.

---------41:05----------
You know, I'll sort out my technical difficulties for tomorrow.

---------41:09----------
Okay?

---------41:10----------
So let's think about what kind of um..

---------41:12----------
[Slapping Noises]

---------41:20----------
You guys wanna do something new?

---------41:23----------
Let's do something new.
