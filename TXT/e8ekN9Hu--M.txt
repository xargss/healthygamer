---------00:00----------
right do you like see how that if I'm


---------00:01----------
trying to make something happen I'm the


---------00:03----------
one who's exerting the power you presume


---------00:05----------
that you have the control to make


---------00:07----------
someone love you otherwise you wouldn't


---------00:08----------
[ __ ] do it you actually have the


---------00:10----------
control they don't have the control what


---------00:12----------
you're terrified of is giving them the


---------00:15----------
capacity to not love you do you see that


---------00:17----------
the control is actually in your hands


---------00:20----------
not in theirs and that's why it's so


---------00:23----------
[ __ ] frustrating because the control


---------00:25----------
isn't actually in your hands but in your


---------00:27----------
mind that's what you're trying to do


---------00:28----------
like just think about it for a second


---------00:30----------
I'm trying to make someone love me I


---------00:33----------
can't do that


---------00:36----------
I have I would screen share my desktop


---------00:39----------
but I have deep brocco lactic as well I


---------00:41----------
just picked that up like a week ago


---------00:43----------
Galactic's a lot of fun man yeah how are


---------00:46----------
you where are you handling kovin um it's


---------00:53----------
interesting because like I feel like I


---------00:56----------
saw a lot of this like coming not kovat


---------01:00----------
specifically but I just knew there was


---------01:02----------
gonna be some type of scenario that was


---------01:03----------
gonna be kind of like catastrophic if


---------01:06----------
that sounds weird I kind of just yeah


---------01:08----------
I've felt that way for a while and so


---------01:10----------
like when this finally happened I wasn't


---------01:14----------
very surprised and I don't know I didn't


---------01:17----------
it wasn't really any shock for me kind


---------01:20----------
of like when it went along with it just


---------01:22----------
fine I'm introverted as is so I don't


---------01:25----------
have a problem with not leaving the


---------01:27----------
house for extended periods of time so I


---------01:29----------
don't know things that other people


---------01:32----------
don't know


---------01:35----------
mm I think I pick up on things that


---------01:39----------
other people don't pick up on the clues


---------01:42----------
are all there just some people can't


---------01:44----------
interpret them I feel like so you were


---------01:47----------
feeling like you kind of had a sense


---------01:48----------
that something was gonna happen and that


---------01:50----------
was sort of based on logic


---------01:52----------
interpretation of information and kind


---------01:54----------
of subconscious processing I are they


---------01:59----------
both Lee without getting too political I


---------02:00----------
was just looking at the state it's like


---------02:01----------
where we're going as a country got and


---------02:03----------
yeah it's just like so you're not like a


---------02:06----------
seer no no no no no that's this pointing


---------02:12----------
I mean there is definitely like a vibe


---------02:14----------
that I felt but but I definitely tied it


---------02:18----------
to like logic and reason right I would


---------02:20----------
you why'd you type to logic and reason


---------02:23----------
why do I attach it to a logic why do you


---------02:26----------
tell why do you tie your vibes to logic


---------02:28----------
and reason Oh


---------02:30----------
note the the I know what you're saying


---------02:32----------
you know the chicken didn't come before


---------02:34----------
the egg usually so I don't like to say


---------02:39----------
that I justify the way I feel with logic


---------02:44----------
sure but but the problem I don't know I


---------02:48----------
okay well I could be wrong we're getting


---------02:51----------
so maybe we can circle back to that yes


---------02:56----------
hmm yeah so sometimes I think just I'll


---------02:59----------
kind of share one or two thoughts about


---------03:01----------
that I think we underestimate where our


---------03:05----------
sources of knowledge like where we get


---------03:07----------
knowledge from and yeah I feel like I'm


---------03:10----------
aware of like being skeptical of where


---------03:13----------
I'm pulling my information from cuz I'm


---------03:15----------
very I feel like I have a lot of like


---------03:17----------
meta thinking that I've kind of like had


---------03:19----------
for a very long time which I'm huh kind


---------03:22----------
of ties into like anxiety and everything


---------03:24----------
that I heard I feel with people but I


---------03:26----------
just feel like I'm picking up a lot of


---------03:28----------
information that a lot of other people


---------03:30----------
don't in usual situations yeah so I just


---------03:34----------
think it's interesting that we default


---------03:36----------
to assuming that we're picking up that


---------03:38----------
information through things logic where


---------03:42----------
actually that in and of itself is not


---------03:43----------
logical right that we attribute the


---------03:47----------
sources of information to things like


---------03:49----------
rationalization or subconscious


---------03:50----------
processing but like what is that how do


---------03:52----------
we observe some conscious process


---------03:54----------
exactly yeah and that's I feel like


---------03:56----------
that's exactly what I was trying to say


---------03:58----------
is that I can't I am very open to the


---------04:02----------
idea of like where my being a seer sure


---------04:11----------
right anyway yeah so what are we talking


---------04:15----------
about today oh gee um so I know that the


---------04:20----------
sex Edition is probably gonna be like a


---------04:22----------
big thing on the hot list smoking


---------04:25----------
marijuana I definitely want to touch on


---------04:28----------
that but I don't know there's a lot of


---------04:30----------
different things that I have going off


---------04:31----------
with me my but basically I've been like


---------04:43----------
depressed for like the last I'd say at


---------04:46----------
least three or four years and and


---------04:51----------
everything is kind of tied together I


---------04:53----------
used to have a really good sense of


---------04:56----------
self-worth okay I feel like that got


---------04:59----------
deteriorated over time from


---------05:01----------
kind of going through these relationship


---------05:02----------
cycles okay


---------05:04----------
every single time I went through like


---------05:06----------
one of these little relationships and


---------05:08----------
everything like that it would kind of


---------05:09----------
just fire all the control afterwards if


---------05:11----------
there was like a breakup or whatever I


---------05:14----------
kind of I kind of noticed that I'm going


---------05:17----------
through these patterns what's the


---------05:19----------
pattern get into a relationship invest


---------05:26----------
emotionally very deeply after that's


---------05:34----------
done like that if we go our separate


---------05:41----------
decided to be to say that I'm kind of a


---------05:46----------
very emotional person


---------05:48----------
what's contradictive about that because


---------05:51----------
usually with people who are like the I


---------05:53----------
feel like the stereotype for someone


---------05:55----------
that's like very promiscuous or it could


---------05:59----------
be interpreted as promiscuous could be


---------06:00----------
like they're very callous they don't


---------06:02----------
care about people's connections or what


---------06:04----------
they're doing to the people around them


---------06:06----------
I feel like I'm very very focused on the


---------06:10----------
consequences of my actions


---------06:11----------
all the time so sounds exhausting


---------06:16----------
it is and I can't really turn it off


---------06:19----------
very well what do you mean it serviced


---------06:21----------
on the consequences of your actions


---------06:23----------
help us understand so I feel like from a


---------06:31----------
Rick a really early age I I saw like the


---------06:35----------
effects of like like basically going


---------06:42----------
through your life without analyzing or


---------06:44----------
being aware of like the the things


---------06:46----------
you're doing to the people around you I


---------06:47----------
I had like my father was kind of


---------06:50----------
basically the model of like what I


---------06:52----------
didn't want to become how so well okay


---------06:57----------
so my my dad and my mom were never


---------07:03----------
married I'm from a military family so


---------07:08----------
everyone is in the Navy my mom wasn't a


---------07:10----------
Navy my dad was in a Navy my stepdad was


---------07:12----------
in the Navy but


---------07:14----------
way they they basically met didn't you


---------07:17----------
know didn't get married or anything like


---------07:19----------
that my dad like got dishonorably


---------07:21----------
discharged from the military for drugs


---------07:24----------
back then it was like he was on the


---------07:26----------
hospital floors he was a nurse as well


---------07:28----------
but I think he was like doing liquid


---------07:30----------
cocaine but anyway blog story sure he


---------07:33----------
went through like rehab and everything


---------07:35----------
like that and my mom got pregnant with


---------07:36----------
me and then he left and did his own


---------07:39----------
thing and it's kind of left us you know


---------07:42----------
to our own devices over the years and so


---------07:48----------
and so I kind of just kind of wanted to


---------07:51----------
make sure like I always took into


---------07:53----------
account other people in my life so I


---------07:57----------
didn't want to become like him and what


---------08:01----------
is he like um so I would characterize my


---------08:11----------
dad is being kind of scared of his


---------08:14----------
emotions and probably good at ounce of


---------08:17----------
like some toxic masculinity thrown in


---------08:20----------
there I feel like he's done a lot of the


---------08:27----------
same mistakes that I've made in my life


---------08:29----------
but like he was not aware enough to


---------08:31----------
realize what he was doing and so that


---------08:36----------
now his life has kind of come back full


---------08:38----------
circle and these things that he's done


---------08:40----------
in the past they're kind of like


---------08:42----------
starting to haunt him I feel like he's


---------08:45----------
getting older and I think he's kind of


---------08:47----------
realizing that so og you said that you


---------08:49----------
didn't want to be like him why write


---------08:52----------
about him did you know well I didn't


---------08:54----------
want to not take into account other


---------08:56----------
people's lives that I'm ruining like so


---------09:00----------
ruin me basically my mom's been like


---------09:04----------
pretty scarred from it from like four


---------09:07----------
she's still like you know like you can


---------09:10----------
see certain things about people that


---------09:12----------
change over time and like obviously I


---------09:14----------
wasn't alive to see the change but like


---------09:16----------
I know it's affected my mom very


---------09:18----------
profoundly and then like what does the


---------09:21----------
fact of your mom very profound it's just


---------09:27----------
I feel his disregard for taking to


---------09:37----------
account like other people's feelings I


---------09:40----------
shouldn't do that by just carrying only


---------09:45----------
about himself being selfish I don't know


---------09:47----------
does that look like so you're giving me


---------09:51----------
conclusions all right you're saying like


---------09:53----------
he didn't care about people's feelings


---------09:55----------
but I'm like what how do you how do I


---------09:57----------
know like what did he do or not do right


---------10:00----------
right so I mean okay so the relationship


---------10:03----------
my mom did everything for my dad like


---------10:06----------
really took care of him when everyone


---------10:08----------
else kind of abandoned him is that what


---------10:11----------
was going on in his life that everyone


---------10:12----------
abandoned him basically getting


---------10:15----------
dishonorably discharged from the


---------10:16----------
military


---------10:17----------
it was pretty scandalous everyone that


---------10:21----------
he was on the floor with that was in on


---------10:23----------
them passing out drugs on the hospital


---------10:26----------
floor basically went to like federal


---------10:29----------
prison except for him and I have


---------10:31----------
suspicions that maybe I don't know that


---------10:36----------
he didn't go to then he didn't go to


---------10:38----------
federal prison because he bribed people


---------10:39----------
out or something is that one of the


---------10:43----------
things that you also don't want from him


---------10:48----------
you don't want to be a rat oh I don't


---------10:51----------
particularly care about that facet of it


---------10:54----------
and so after he was dishonorably


---------10:57----------
discharged how did he meet your mom wait


---------10:59----------
he didn't know your mom already at that


---------11:00----------
point yes no no no they were together


---------11:03----------
while they were in the military and like


---------11:06----------
they weren't married but that happened


---------11:09----------
you're gonna have to excuse me I'm like


---------11:10----------
I'm really like jittery right now I'm


---------11:11----------
kind of like really really nervous I


---------11:13----------
don't know if you can tell yeah we can


---------11:15----------
tell help me understand yeah why do you


---------11:16----------
feel nervous what do you think is going


---------11:18----------
on well let's try what do you feel just


---------11:21----------
uh well it's just a lot of pressure just


---------11:25----------
the topic and this the whole thing is


---------11:30----------
kind of helped me understand what


---------11:32----------
pressure you feel um I worry about


---------11:37----------
talking this openly about these very


---------11:40----------
intimate


---------11:40----------
in my life and I worry about it coming


---------11:42----------
full circle obviously I'm not using my


---------11:45----------
but like I'm a I am a nurse and so like


---------11:49----------
I've just you know my interactions with


---------11:52----------
that the community is interesting I


---------11:57----------
losing my license or you know just


---------12:01----------
appearing to be so dysfunctional in a


---------12:04----------
way that like it they could come and


---------12:07----------
haunt me essentially I understand that


---------12:11----------
you're afraid and I'm wondering whether


---------12:14----------
maybe the first thing that we should do


---------12:16----------
is help you with that fear right because


---------12:20----------
I'm in auditioning i I don't want you to


---------12:22----------
be like like keeping this fear at bay


---------12:24----------
over the course of the next hour sure


---------12:27----------
like I just don't think like that's good


---------12:29----------
that sounds like it's painful to me and


---------12:31----------
I don't want you to suffer


---------12:32----------
sure and and so is it okay if we try to


---------12:35----------
kind of address that for a moment okay


---------12:40----------
so the first thing is how would talking


---------12:42----------
like this how would this lead to losing


---------12:45----------
your license um I don't know this is


---------12:49----------
marijuana it gets involved like things


---------12:51----------
are very very in the gray area as far as


---------12:54----------
like what can be done legally sure to


---------12:57----------
people you know and so maybe we


---------12:59----------
shouldn't talk about marijuana sure


---------13:03----------
that's fine too


---------13:04----------
would you would that how would that help


---------13:06----------
your fear if at all


---------13:09----------
well I still want to talk about things I


---------13:12----------
think I'm just trying to I'm getting


---------13:14----------
comfortable at all it's just um I think


---------13:17----------
that as we go on I'll get more


---------13:18----------
comfortable yeah yeah but dude I don't


---------13:22----------
want you to lose your license because


---------13:24----------
you came on stream like that would be a


---------13:26----------
royal [ __ ] right now so just context


---------13:30----------
like I I'm at a point where I'm pretty


---------13:33----------
much a I I don't care anymore so it's


---------13:38----------
I'm moving into a different career just


---------13:40----------
that sounds really bad I'm I'm in


---------13:42----------
actively a full-time student in college


---------13:44----------
right now just moving towards a


---------13:46----------
different career and that's for a


---------13:48----------
different there's like yeah there's a


---------13:50----------
lot going on in my life


---------13:52----------
it's there's a lot so it sounds like


---------13:54----------
you're pretty overwhelmed and you're


---------13:55----------
dealing with a lot yeah is it too much


---------14:01----------
um I would say so what makes it feel


---------14:09----------
like it's too much I feel like I can't


---------14:18----------
get ahead I I feel for like every feel


---------14:22----------
like I'm treading water and I'm going


---------14:25----------
nowhere and I'm getting tired of


---------14:28----------
treading water not in the the I know how


---------14:30----------
that sounds but like I don't feel like


---------14:33----------
I'm getting anywhere all the I just feel


---------14:36----------
like all the advantage and disadvantages


---------14:38----------
are weighted against me


---------14:41----------
sure I mean the way I live right now is


---------14:45----------
not ideal I'm living in like a five not


---------14:49----------
even five hundred square foot like


---------14:51----------
studio apartment with my mom and like my


---------14:55----------
cats dying


---------14:56----------
I can't Scott cancer


---------15:05----------
yeah


---------15:12----------
is everything it's just very hard right


---------15:14----------
now and like it sounds really bad but


---------15:16----------
like this Kovach thing is just like I


---------15:18----------
don't even like that I don't even feel


---------15:20----------
like that's even messing with me like


---------15:22----------
I'm just dealing with all these other


---------15:24----------
things that have gone on with my life


---------15:27----------
like I lost I don't know I've lost a lot


---------15:30----------
and this is like basically what a lot of


---------15:33----------
my problems with sex and everything


---------15:35----------
comes from this because once I get into


---------15:37----------
these these spirals like I get to a


---------15:41----------
point where I just don't care to what


---------15:44----------
I'm doing to the people around me um and


---------15:49----------
then you become like your dad


---------15:51----------
yes and so there's a lot of


---------15:53----------
self-loathing that goes with it because


---------15:56----------
you're becoming the very thing that you


---------15:58----------
don't want to be yes you don't want to


---------16:02----------
do what other people what he did to you


---------16:04----------
and your mom yes and you can't stop nope


---------16:21----------
you know this is gonna sound kinda


---------16:22----------
random but maybe I'm trying to cut the


---------16:24----------
tension a little bit because I can see


---------16:26----------
you're Stern I wonder what it feels like


---------16:29----------
to become a vampire what kind of vampire


---------16:35----------
the Bram Stoker vampire or are we


---------16:38----------
talking like Twilight vampire I wouldn't


---------16:40----------
want to be a twilight vampire vampire


---------16:45----------
but I mean what I'm hearing you say oh


---------16:48----------
oh gee is that your ear you can feel


---------16:50----------
yourself becoming a monster


---------16:52----------
yes and you can't stop the


---------16:54----------
transformation yeah I I really do like


---------16:59----------
it sounds really weird but I I try my


---------17:02----------
best to be the best person that it can


---------17:04----------
be and I feel because I don't know I


---------17:10----------
feel like I'm working against that and


---------17:13----------
so like again feeds into that that


---------17:16----------
self-loathing


---------17:17----------
you're working against what being that


---------17:19----------
I'm working yes yeah okay sorry what I'm


---------17:24----------
seeing from you og is that you know I


---------17:26----------
think you seem exhausting to me yes yep


---------17:32----------
and you say you've been depressed for


---------17:34----------
three or four years I mean I'm sure that


---------17:35----------
a psychiatrist somewhere could diagnose


---------17:37----------
you with depression but what it feels


---------17:39----------
like is that you've been fighting for a


---------17:41----------
long time and you're just getting worn


---------17:43----------
down yep and it can be very very hard to


---------17:49----------
fight and struggle and get up every day


---------17:52----------
and try to shift the mountain of


---------17:57----------
[ __ ] that your life has become and


---------18:01----------
what I'm envisioning is a guy who wakes


---------18:03----------
up every day walks outside of his house


---------18:05----------
or 500 foot studio apartment with living


---------18:08----------
with your mom and outside your door is a


---------18:11----------
gigantic mountain and then you do your


---------18:13----------
work for the day which is pushing


---------18:15----------
against the mountain yep trying to get


---------18:18----------
it to move and then after a day of


---------18:21----------
pushing and pushing and pushing in the


---------18:23----------
mountain not going anywhere you go back


---------18:24----------
to your 500 foot studio apartment where


---------18:27----------
you live


---------18:27----------
your mom and you go to bed and then you


---------18:30----------
wake up the next day and then you walk


---------18:33----------
outside and you start pushing against


---------18:35----------
the mountain and it's not right it seems


---------18:40----------
like an exercise in futility it seems


---------18:42----------
like there are parts of you that say


---------18:44----------
that you have to try you have to change


---------18:46----------
you have to do better you have to do


---------18:48----------
more and then you walk outside and


---------18:50----------
there's just this [ __ ] mountain


---------18:51----------
sitting there and you know that you have


---------18:54----------
to move it and so you start pushing and


---------18:56----------
pushing and pushing but it doesn't go


---------18:59----------
anywhere and you feel stuck and you feel


---------19:03----------
like you're not making progress but you


---------19:04----------
don't want to be the guy who gives up


---------19:06----------
because your dad did that too


---------19:09----------
yep and that's I feel like that's a big


---------19:13----------
problem that I have is I can't let go I


---------19:15----------
can't let go of things it's really hard


---------19:18----------
for me too what is it that you feel like


---------19:20----------
you should let go what is it that you


---------19:21----------
hold on to I feel like sometimes like I


---------19:27----------
feel like I need to be able to give up


---------19:30----------
on things that I'm working on like I


---------19:32----------
wish that I could give I know it sounds


---------19:35----------
really cathartic or like saying uh well


---------19:37----------
but I mean I wish that I could give


---------19:38----------
myself a break but you know I'm not


---------19:46----------
quite sure how important this is oh gee


---------19:48----------
but you make a lot of comments about how


---------19:50----------
way how the things you say sound a


---------19:53----------
certain way have you noticed that yep I


---------19:57----------
did now you pointed it out I do notice


---------20:00----------
it now yeah what do you think is up with


---------20:03----------
that


---------20:12----------
why would you need to tell us that what


---------20:15----------
you're saying is not cathartic because


---------20:18----------
that's basically what you're doing I


---------20:20----------
have this bad habit of always trying to


---------20:24----------
be in other people's heads bad eyes all


---------20:27----------
the time


---------20:28----------
okay so that's fine but why is it


---------20:30----------
important for you to correct the


---------20:33----------
perception than other people have


---------20:35----------
I yeah I don't want to be seen a certain


---------20:37----------
way I I feel like I'm very probably way


---------20:42----------
too much in tuned with caring about what


---------20:45----------
other people think yeah how do you want


---------20:49----------
to be seen today you know I'm to the


---------20:54----------
point where I don't want to focus on how


---------20:57----------
I want to be seen I just care about how


---------20:59----------
I want to see me because that's I feel


---------21:01----------
like that's what matters how do you see


---------21:03----------
you exhausted yeah pretty bad person are


---------21:14----------
you a monster I I wonder like it makes


---------21:20----------
me think like with everything that's


---------21:21----------
happened to me that like I wonder if


---------21:24----------
there's like a breaking point and every


---------21:27----------
person and it doesn't matter it's just


---------21:29----------
across the board I wonder if there's


---------21:30----------
breaking points and people where it


---------21:32----------
doesn't matter like there's a point at


---------21:34----------
which everyone cracks are you broken um


---------21:38----------
I don't know I keep on breaking over and


---------21:41----------
over again so I don't know if there's a


---------21:43----------
state of it I don't know what's the


---------21:46----------
original thing to get put back in


---------21:48----------
together


---------21:49----------
yeah I mean you're laughing about that


---------21:52----------
but that sounds [ __ ] terrifying to me


---------21:53----------
yeah you know what I'm hearing is a guy


---------21:56----------
who's been broken time and time and time


---------21:58----------
again to where like you know the first


---------22:00----------
time something breaks you can take the


---------22:01----------
pieces and you can kind of like fit and


---------22:03----------
back together right yep but what I'm


---------22:06----------
hearing from you is that you've been


---------22:07----------
shattered beyond all recognition like


---------22:10----------
literally that's what you're saying that


---------22:12----------
you've been broken so much that we don't


---------22:14----------
even know what you're supposed to be


---------22:16----------
anymore


---------22:18----------
yeah maybe


---------22:22----------
um sorry I have my sense of humor is a


---------22:26----------
little off good I'm glad so it's how I


---------22:32----------
won in one bright point I've seen so far


---------22:34----------
actually there are a lot of bright


---------22:35----------
points about you but it's the one that


---------22:37----------
the it's the easiest to pick out so tell


---------22:41----------
us about this whole cycle about


---------22:45----------
relationships and getting into a


---------22:47----------
relationship and investing emotionally


---------22:50----------
um I I think I just give my all that's


---------22:58----------
it like that's the best way I can


---------22:59----------
describe it is I just I I feel almost


---------23:03----------
like powerful when I'm in relationships


---------23:05----------
because I feel like I could do anything


---------23:07----------
that I was ever required to do to make


---------23:10----------
things work like in like for example one


---------23:18----------
of my relationships I stopped what I was


---------23:22----------
doing I dropped out of college well I


---------23:25----------
didn't drop out of college but long


---------23:27----------
story short I was I had a really shifty


---------23:30----------
living situation with with my friends


---------23:35----------
but they blew our rent money on drugs


---------23:37----------
and so we were getting evicted and so I


---------23:41----------
was talking to this one girl and she


---------23:44----------
said to come to Tennessee and that you


---------23:47----------
know I could live with her and it would


---------23:48----------
be great and that I can go to school


---------23:50----------
over there and so I dropped everything


---------23:53----------
I've sold like everything I could to fit


---------23:55----------
everything in my car went across the


---------23:56----------
nation to try and make things work and


---------23:58----------
after like two and a half years of like


---------24:01----------
toiling out in the Sun doing manual


---------24:03----------
labor to like make things work it didn't


---------24:08----------
work out and it's ironic because I I'm


---------24:13----------
still in touch with that woman and the


---------24:17----------
she had the exact same thing happened to


---------24:19----------
her or it's actively going on and so


---------24:21----------
it's it's weird I don't look at the


---------24:23----------
exact same thing where you're in a


---------24:27----------
relationship with someone where you love


---------24:28----------
them and they could care less so used so


---------24:35----------
I wear in this relay you said that last


---------24:41----------
last I understood you moved across the


---------24:43----------
country to be with her for Tennessee


---------24:45----------
y'all were together for two and a half


---------24:46----------
years I didn't hear anything you were


---------24:49----------
doing manual labor out in the Sun and I


---------24:52----------
didn't hear anything about love like one


---------24:55----------
person loving and one person not caring


---------24:59----------
I mean I loved her and I was willing to


---------25:03----------
work as hard as I could to make things


---------25:05----------
work but I it's like a tug-of-war where


---------25:08----------
someone's not pulling on the other side


---------25:10----------
if you don't have that tension things


---------25:11----------
just fall apart like like I put in this


---------25:15----------
a much effort you reciprocate you should


---------25:17----------
at least match my effort it was always


---------25:19----------
like a black hole of me throwing


---------25:21----------
emotional investment just into whatever


---------25:25----------
you know it is so why were you guys


---------25:28----------
together for two and a half years then


---------25:29----------
um well things were okay in the


---------25:34----------
beginning there was a point of which you


---------25:36----------
know there was tension on that rope that


---------25:39----------
metaphorical rope and you know she tried


---------25:42----------
and I tried and you know things were


---------25:44----------
fine and as time went like to keep


---------25:48----------
things short and brief like I'm very one


---------25:51----------
political or I'm of one political


---------25:54----------
mindset and she's of the other and that


---------25:56----------
caused a lot of friction so and then


---------25:59----------
yeah okay so the first thing is I don't


---------26:02----------
think you necessarily need to keep


---------26:03----------
things brief okay right so so like and


---------26:07----------
because let me just explain to you for


---------26:09----------
example why I'm a little bit curious


---------26:11----------
about the situation because on the one


---------26:13----------
hand you say that there's kind of this


---------26:14----------
relationship of you throwing love into a


---------26:16----------
black hole you're not being reciprocated


---------26:18----------
and on the other hand I'm hearing that


---------26:20----------
like essentially the source of y'all's


---------26:22----------
problems is a political disconnect yeah


---------26:26----------
but there was a lot that happened


---------26:31----------
beforehand


---------26:32----------
I sorry I'm like I was very


---------26:35----------
self-conscious about time I to go into a


---------26:39----------
little bit deeper so she had a really


---------26:45----------
traumatic experience growing up she


---------26:49----------
she you know she had basically got raped


---------26:52----------
and she imprinted a lot of the things


---------26:56----------
like she would have flashbacks and then


---------26:59----------
she would imprint essentially that


---------27:02----------
trauma on to me so like that resulted in


---------27:06----------
like a whole bunch of number of weird


---------27:08----------
wonky things having to be done and


---------27:11----------
worked within the relationship like what


---------27:14----------
like basically we just didn't have sex


---------27:16----------
anymore because she imprinted those


---------27:18----------
experiences on her onto me and like I


---------27:21----------
was like okay that's fine


---------27:23----------
we we won't have sex anymore but I was


---------27:26----------
like that


---------27:27----------
I was so willing to keep the


---------27:29----------
relationship like alive and yeah and I


---------27:34----------
don't know the point at which like she


---------27:37----------
stopped caring but like that's basically


---------27:40----------
when things got really bad because once


---------27:44----------
we broke up


---------27:45----------
I know I'm hopping around a lot there's


---------27:48----------
just so much towards the end I was still


---------27:51----------
in nursing school and I had like six


---------27:54----------
months left of nursing school and she


---------27:58----------
decided to still see other people while


---------28:01----------
we were still living together and


---------28:16----------
so it was really hard I I finished


---------28:21----------
nursing school I passed I did my boards


---------28:24----------
uh-huh but that's a blanket man it was


---------28:28----------
it was really hard was it when fully


---------28:34----------
active with the people she was seen


---------28:36----------
while y'all were living together yes and


---------28:38----------
like that was the most frustrating thing


---------28:41----------
about it because that scenario like


---------28:45----------
frustrating in that there the thing that


---------28:48----------
I can't stand the most is when like


---------28:51----------
hypocrisy and like I will hold myself to


---------28:54----------
like a huge high standard to make sure


---------28:56----------
that I am NOT a hypocrite and anything


---------28:58----------
that I try to anyway so yeah like


---------29:02----------
essentially she had told me that this


---------29:04----------
experience in her life and affected her


---------29:06----------
in such a way that she couldn't have sex


---------29:08----------
with me anymore


---------29:08----------
and there was this disconnect and that


---------29:12----------
she was seeing other people


---------29:13----------
hey in the house or whatever and like


---------29:17----------
I'm still living there and then be like


---------29:21----------
it kind of just feels like why would it


---------29:23----------
be acceptable to see other people in


---------29:27----------
this way when this is the dynamic that


---------29:30----------
you like I don't know it I wasn't my fit


---------29:33----------
feel that she isn't having sex with you


---------29:36----------
when y'all are together and she's right


---------29:39----------
that was it was [ __ ] awful


---------29:42----------
that's it and like that went on for six


---------29:45----------
months I would be like on the phone with


---------29:47----------
my my best friend at the time like day


---------29:50----------
in day out just like in tears it's like


---------29:52----------
this is [ __ ] terrible like but I got


---------29:58----------
out of it I think someone feels about


---------30:00----------
themselves after an experience like that


---------30:02----------
I feel like [ __ ] and like I think that


---------30:05----------
like well I know personally that my


---------30:12----------
self-worth was severely damaged from


---------30:15----------
that experience and because it calls


---------30:19----------
into question for me like what I put up


---------30:23----------
with and what I didn't have to put up


---------30:26----------
with


---------30:27----------
and that I didn't advocate for myself


---------30:30----------
and a way to protect myself and so I


---------30:34----------
should've oh gee you're doing two things


---------30:37----------
right one is that that hurts your


---------30:39----------
self-worth because I can imagine that


---------30:40----------
you're kind of feeling like what's wrong


---------30:43----------
with me right like why is this woman


---------30:46----------
like who I'm giving so much into the


---------30:49----------
relationship and she's not willing to


---------30:52----------
have sex with me because of this made-up


---------30:54----------
trauma [ __ ] and I'm hyper I mean I


---------30:57----------
have no idea what was real and what


---------30:58----------
wasn't or anything I'm not saying that


---------31:00----------
she wasn't right traumatized but I can


---------31:03----------
imagine that if I were in your shoes I


---------31:04----------
would feel like something about that is


---------31:06----------
[ __ ]


---------31:07----------
right so I think you call it ever


---------31:08----------
accuracy my mind formula formulates that


---------31:11----------
as something that's coroner quote made


---------31:12----------
up which is unfair but it's an emotional


---------31:15----------
thought it's not a rational one right


---------31:18----------
like I mean it just sounds like [ __ ]


---------31:20----------
so you feel bad about yourself right so


---------31:22----------
like what's wrong with you and then you


---------31:25----------
do something else which is that you beat


---------31:27----------
yourself up for feeling bad about


---------31:29----------
yourself right there's a difference


---------31:32----------
between self-loathing and lack of


---------31:33----------
self-worth does that make sense


---------31:41----------
yes I feel like I have both going on no


---------31:45----------
no you have bought into the other yep


---------31:47----------
very good right so in terms of your


---------31:50----------
feeling overwhelmed so og let me just


---------31:53----------
jump in for a second okay so first of


---------31:56----------
all I think you can get better and I


---------32:00----------
think that I think that the mountain


---------32:01----------
that you're trying to move you're


---------32:04----------
actually making forward progress like


---------32:06----------
whether I just don't think that you're


---------32:08----------
able to perceive it right now so what


---------32:11----------
I'm hearing is a guy who's actually


---------32:12----------
incredibly resilient incredibly strong


---------32:15----------
incredibly smart and incredibly


---------32:17----------
reflective I'm hearing someone who I'm


---------32:20----------
talking to someone who I think is mortal


---------32:22----------
who cares about other people who wants


---------32:25----------
to be a good person and not out of


---------32:28----------
selfishness but like genuinely like


---------32:29----------
wants to be like good and successful in


---------32:32----------
kind other people and wants to be like a


---------32:34----------
force of like good and positivity in in


---------32:37----------
the P


---------32:38----------
around him yes and yes that's who you


---------32:43----------
are right and I think some things are


---------32:46----------
getting in the way of that and and our


---------32:49----------
goal here is like so the tricky thing


---------32:51----------
there is that it's hard to reconcile


---------32:54----------
being that person with hating yourself


---------32:56----------
like that's that's the real rub it's


---------32:59----------
like there's some there's a part of you


---------33:01----------
that feels like you're a piece of [ __ ]


---------33:02----------
and hates yourself because of it and


---------33:04----------
then there's a part of you that strives


---------33:06----------
to be better and like wants to be a good


---------33:08----------
person and actually you know goes bends


---------33:12----------
over backwards to accommodate people


---------33:14----------
that you care about and really just


---------33:18----------
prolongs what sounds like in some


---------33:21----------
situations like sort of toxic kind of


---------33:23----------
things which we can think about right so


---------33:25----------
so in in a bizarre way oh gee I think


---------33:29----------
that you're somewhat responsible for


---------33:31----------
your circumstances which is sort of a


---------33:34----------
double-edged sword so I think a big


---------33:36----------
problem that a lot of people have is


---------33:38----------
that they don't like you know you kind


---------33:39----------
of say when you when you look outside


---------33:41----------
you said something about that the


---------33:42----------
advantages and disadvantages are stacked


---------33:44----------
against you so that sort of makes sense


---------33:48----------
and can be comforting in some way


---------33:51----------
because it's like not our fault but it's


---------33:53----------
also kind of like doesn't give us a road


---------33:56----------
forward because then like what do we do


---------33:59----------
about that right if life is just [ __ ]


---------34:01----------
you over then like you can't really do a


---------34:03----------
whole lot about that but yeah go ahead


---------34:07----------
um and so like that's a dynamic that


---------34:10----------
I've been having to deal with it's like


---------34:12----------
I I so like to add to that stack of


---------34:16----------
[ __ ] like I lost pretty much two of


---------34:19----------
my best friends at the beginning of the


---------34:22----------
year just to get that's like a whole


---------34:26----------
nother thing but um how did you lose


---------34:28----------
your best friend how does one lose the


---------34:30----------
best friend um essentially like they got


---------34:33----------
into it a friend group that didn't


---------34:36----------
really care for me and I sent like I've


---------34:41----------
known these people for like one of them


---------34:43----------
I knew for I've known over for 15 years


---------34:45----------
and the other one I've known him but I


---------34:49----------
wasn't friends with him until about like


---------34:51----------
five years


---------34:51----------
and I've known him for 15 years - and


---------34:54----------
like the reason why I feel like I'm very


---------34:59----------
hyper concerned about what other people


---------35:01----------
think of me is because I've I lost two


---------35:03----------
of my friends essentially and two


---------35:06----------
possibly like the circumstances that I'm


---------35:08----------
in and I can't like I don't feel like


---------35:11----------
they understand or feel the like the


---------35:16----------
weight of everything that's going on in


---------35:18----------
my life and they all they see is dude


---------35:22----------
that [ __ ] you know is staying with


---------35:26----------
his mom and you know not gonna go


---------35:28----------
anywhere you know that's a that's a real


---------35:31----------
fear for me they abandoned you because


---------35:32----------
you're a loser sure that's yeah I mean I


---------35:38----------
wouldn't put it so harshly but yeah yeah


---------35:41----------
that embodies the idea perfectly though


---------35:44----------
yeah I mean that's what I'm hearing you


---------35:46----------
say you're just saying it in more words


---------35:48----------
yeah so oh gee I mean I'm kind of


---------35:54----------
noticing a pattern here it sounds like


---------35:55----------
people yeah people suck my interactions


---------35:59----------
with people that's yeah I usually feel


---------36:04----------
like I have like a an interaction where


---------36:07----------
I'm giving a lot and never receiving


---------36:09----------
yeah


---------36:10----------
so let's stand about that for a second


---------36:12----------
go ahead sorry and that kind of ties


---------36:18----------
into a lot I I might be like assuming a


---------36:22----------
lot but I'm positive that probably feeds


---------36:24----------
into like the behaviors I have around


---------36:27----------
like sex what are some of those


---------36:31----------
behaviors


---------36:33----------
um


---------36:45----------
I'm trying to think of where to start so


---------36:50----------
me being a person that's very very


---------36:53----------
concentrated on like consequences of my


---------36:55----------
actions I'm having to deal with feeling


---------37:01----------
like what are the behaviors oh it's just


---------37:10----------
ok actual verbs of what I'm was


---------37:14----------
basically going on is just like ace I'm


---------37:17----------
using okay I'm using four different


---------37:20----------
dating apps widely technically five if


---------37:22----------
you conclude if you include Facebook's


---------37:24----------
dating services and I'm basically


---------37:26----------
approaching it like a salesman


---------37:28----------
approaches like leads and sales while


---------37:31----------
using like a law of averages just to try


---------37:33----------
and you know basically go through five


---------37:35----------
different apps and go for a numbers game


---------37:40----------
approach rather than actual and


---------37:42----------
emotional and what are you looking for


---------37:46----------
um anything anything something is better


---------37:51----------
than nothing


---------37:51----------
is basically what it comes down what are


---------37:53----------
you getting what am I getting um I'm


---------37:57----------
getting interesting like interactions


---------38:00----------
with people I would never normally


---------38:01----------
interact with I'm getting sex I'm


---------38:05----------
getting like an emotional temporary like


---------38:10----------
an emotional band-aid I feel like it's


---------38:12----------
the best way to describe it


---------38:13----------
so what happens when you have sex it


---------38:17----------
it's basically a different form of drug


---------38:20----------
for me my problems


---------38:22----------
tend to just evaporate out of my head


---------38:24----------
and I don't think about those things


---------38:26----------
anymore and I'm kind of free for that


---------38:29----------
time and that that's kind of the reason


---------38:31----------
why I smoke so much is that it puts me


---------38:34----------
into like a mental state of which I


---------38:36----------
don't feel burden


---------38:37----------
anxiety or like the pain of like


---------38:40----------
everything that's going on around me


---------38:41----------
is that why you consider yourself


---------38:43----------
addicted to sex no it's the the


---------38:48----------
frequency it's the number of people and


---------38:51----------
it gets very out of hand the worse


---------38:54----------
things are for me and that given the


---------38:56----------
situation so like like the relationship


---------38:58----------
cycles


---------38:59----------
and everything that I go through it gets


---------39:01----------
particularly bad can you walk


---------39:08----------
so when I went to Tennessee and that


---------39:11----------
didn't work out and you know [ __ ] was


---------39:14----------
hitting the fan and I was in nursing


---------39:15----------
school and like everything was just like


---------39:17----------
putting that downward force on me like I


---------39:20----------
had to just have some type of like


---------39:23----------
escape and so again like I know anything


---------39:26----------
from everything okay I felt like I just


---------39:32----------
needed to be away from so I'm in my


---------39:35----------
second okay sure so I want you to I want


---------39:38----------
to explain to you why you're trying to


---------39:39----------
move mountains so what are you explore


---------39:42----------
are you running away from what hailey


---------39:47----------
no no [ __ ] don't try to be Freudian I'm


---------39:50----------
asking you I asked you like what were


---------39:52----------
you trying to get away from him what was


---------39:54----------
your answer everything okay


---------39:58----------
how do you fix that fixing my


---------40:02----------
circumstances around me no I'm asking


---------40:04----------
you how do you fix everything oh let's


---------40:10----------
say I come to you oh gee and I'm your


---------40:12----------
friend I'm the one best friend that


---------40:14----------
didn't abandon you I'm gonna say oh yes


---------40:17----------

---------40:19----------
I don't know how can I help


---------40:24----------
what's going on well so what's going on


---------40:26----------
is everything is going wrong yeah it


---------40:29----------
doesn't sound like you're very you know


---------40:31----------

---------40:33----------
you help me fix everything


---------40:34----------
no I see what you're saying what am i


---------40:37----------
saying that I need to if I want to make


---------40:41----------
change in my life I needed to approach


---------40:43----------
it in a systematic way an organized way


---------40:46----------
instead of just saying everything is


---------40:48----------
wrong there there's no way to solve


---------40:50----------
everything I need to actually probably


---------40:52----------
maybe have a plan of attack


---------40:54----------
maybe sure so I think you're even you're


---------40:57----------
you're moving you're moving way too fast


---------40:59----------
buddy


---------41:00----------
you're on the highway already so I'd say


---------41:02----------
the first thing is like if you're even


---------41:04----------
moving one step ahead of where I am so I


---------41:06----------
think the first thing to understand is


---------41:07----------
that like if you're if everything it


---------41:09----------
like so if we just listen to what you've


---------41:11----------
said today


---------41:12----------
okay your cat has cancer you live in a


---------41:15----------
studio apartment you're addicted to sex


---------41:17----------
you're making a career change so


---------41:19----------
obviously something with the nursing was


---------41:20----------
not working out yeah that was a whole


---------41:23----------
nother story to the shirt yeah so so and


---------41:26----------
what what you feel is overwhelmed right


---------41:29----------
because every dimension of your life


---------41:31----------
you're getting [ __ ] like your friends


---------41:33----------
are abandoning you your cat is dying you


---------41:36----------
know interesting that you chose to be a


---------41:38----------
nurse with all this business with your


---------41:39----------
father and and I don't even know what's


---------41:41----------
going on there yeah yeah they're


---------41:44----------
everyone's nurses in my family yeah my


---------41:47----------
stepdad my mom and my dad we're all


---------41:49----------
nurses it's like I don't know it felt


---------41:51----------
like can I keep talking yes yes sir I'd


---------41:54----------
like you to just try to listen if that's


---------41:56----------
okay so I think the issue here is that


---------41:59----------
like when you look at your life I think


---------42:01----------
it makes sense because you look at your


---------42:02----------
life and you see a life where they're


---------42:04----------
like there's like good evidence that


---------42:05----------
everything around you is kind of falling


---------42:07----------
apart but the challenge is that like


---------42:10----------
everything is not something that you can


---------42:11----------
fix right so like I understand that


---------42:14----------
you're talking about a plan of attack


---------42:15----------
we're not even there yet let's first


---------42:17----------
understand that the reason that you


---------42:19----------
can't move a mountain is because you


---------42:20----------
you've made a monolith of all of your


---------42:23----------
problems and so no wonder because like


---------42:26----------
you wake up every day in your mind ask


---------42:28----------
to self the question okay what's wrong


---------42:30----------
because that's what our mind does our


---------42:31----------
mind tries to help us out and then your


---------42:34----------
mind is like well everything is wrong


---------42:36----------
so there's the problem-solving part of


---------42:38----------
your mind that's like okay oh gee what's


---------42:39----------
wrong and then oh gee says everything is


---------42:41----------
wrong and then the mind is like okay how


---------42:43----------
do I fix that and oh jeez like I'm not


---------42:44----------
sure and then your mind doesn't know


---------42:46----------
what to do and then then you're sitting


---------42:49----------
with this like sense of like


---------42:51----------
impossibility of like fixing everything


---------42:53----------
in your life and then you end up coping


---------42:57----------
right so when when anytime I see someone


---------43:00----------
that has multiple addictive behaviors I


---------43:02----------
don't think about addiction as the


---------43:05----------
diagnosis I think about it as a symptom


---------43:08----------
so in your case what you're addicted to


---------43:11----------
is avoidance right so like whether you


---------43:15----------
get that through a substance or a sexual


---------43:17----------
relationship or video games or whatever


---------43:21----------
are reading a warhammer book


---------43:24----------
the other tricky thing here is that like


---------43:25----------
there's a spectrum of something like


---------43:27----------
when you when it's not that bad we call


---------43:29----------
it coping and when it is bad we call it


---------43:32----------
addiction but I think it's it's


---------43:35----------
artificial that these things are binary


---------43:37----------
it's like they're on a spectrum so the


---------43:40----------
question is like what are you running


---------43:41----------
away from and and when you say


---------43:44----------
everything like I don't think that's


---------43:46----------
something you can fix I think if you try


---------43:48----------
to solve everything in your life and


---------43:50----------
everything being wrong is the problem


---------43:52----------
you're gonna feel this way for the rest


---------43:54----------
of your life it's an issue of conception


---------43:57----------
of what your problems are


---------43:59----------
and I think if the core of it is anyway


---------44:05----------
I'm gonna pause for a second so any


---------44:07----------
thoughts about that um I I would say


---------44:19----------
that that when I said everything I feel


---------44:26----------
like it's just the way it it's


---------44:28----------
describing my feelings I feel it yes and


---------44:32----------
like I don't rationalize it in my head


---------44:35----------
as like I can't win or that you know I'm


---------44:40----------
not attacking my problems like I can do


---------44:42----------
something about this problem like I


---------44:43----------
don't look at it as one big giant I try


---------44:47----------
not to so let me jump in for sex which


---------44:49----------
is exactly why I think a plan of attack


---------44:51----------
is not your problem so you're saying


---------44:54----------
that if I'm gonna if I feel like


---------44:56----------
everything is the problem in my head I


---------44:57----------
don't actually think everything is a


---------44:59----------
problem I recognize that my cat is dying


---------45:01----------
I don't have friends on making career


---------45:02----------
changes because the interesting thing is


---------45:04----------
that oh gee you actually seem very


---------45:06----------
adaptive to me right so like I think you


---------45:10----------
the plan of attack is actually not where


---------45:12----------
you're you're missing out you're saying


---------45:14----------
you're assuming that I'm saying you need


---------45:17----------
a plan of attack no I don't think you


---------45:18----------
need a plan of attack because you've


---------45:19----------
demonstrated so you say you kind of


---------45:21----------
talked about this relationship where you


---------45:23----------
moved across country right to be with


---------45:25----------
this woman you spent two and a half


---------45:27----------
years with her and then you described


---------45:28----------
you six months of a period of time where


---------45:30----------
she's [ __ ] other dudes and she won't


---------45:32----------
wouldn't [ __ ] you for two and a half


---------45:34----------
years and the troll part of me was like


---------45:35----------
how the [ __ ] can you be a sex addict if


---------45:37----------
you


---------45:37----------
not having sex in a relationship but you


---------45:39----------
know I didn't say that right right right


---------45:40----------
and so I mean while that was going on


---------45:43----------
like I was going on my little like to


---------45:46----------
talk back about the behaviors if I had


---------45:48----------
to like describe like what that was like


---------45:50----------
it was like like three days out of the


---------45:53----------
week I saw three different women and I


---------45:56----------
was just going through apps like it like


---------46:00----------
an addict sure like that's so so my


---------46:03----------
point is that like so this looks like a


---------46:05----------
bad scenario right like everything that


---------46:08----------
I just described seems like a bad


---------46:09----------
scenario but I actually think there's a


---------46:11----------
lot of good stuff here so let me here


---------46:13----------
like this I know this is gonna sound


---------46:14----------
weird but so the first thing is that you


---------46:16----------
were in a situation where you took


---------46:18----------
drastic changes and just didn't sit


---------46:20----------
there so you decided to like up and move


---------46:23----------
and try to make something of your life


---------46:25----------
you moved across country you know you


---------46:28----------
sold whatever you needed to you took


---------46:30----------
drastic steps I think a lot of the


---------46:32----------
people that watch twitch and watch our


---------46:33----------
stream wish they could do what you did


---------46:36----------
they feel stuck because they're the ones


---------46:38----------
that don't ever move out they don't move


---------46:40----------
across countries they there aren't


---------46:42----------
they're talking to a girl but they don't


---------46:44----------
have the balls to actually try to make


---------46:46----------
it work so the first thing is that


---------46:48----------
you're adaptive and you're willing to


---------46:49----------
make change which i think is a huge plus


---------46:51----------
the second thing is that you try for two


---------46:53----------
and a half years to make this


---------46:54----------
relationship work like I know a lot of


---------46:56----------
people that are like I'm not gonna get


---------46:58----------
laid I'm done in six months right or


---------47:01----------
even three weeks or three day night I


---------47:04----------
really did love her and that's like so


---------47:07----------
we'll get to that all that crap in a


---------47:09----------
second do it my point though is that


---------47:10----------
like once again you're your so this is a


---------47:13----------
guy who's adaptive willing to make


---------47:15----------
drastic changes willing to like it


---------47:18----------
doesn't give up easily right and then


---------47:22----------
also like even though things are really


---------47:24----------
really bad like manages to finish


---------47:25----------
nursing school even though you're living


---------47:27----------
with someone who won't [ __ ] you and will


---------47:29----------
[ __ ] other dudes and you mean like you


---------47:32----------
managed to not drop out like what the


---------47:34----------
[ __ ] man that's amazing


---------47:36----------
I shall OTT of your other streams and


---------47:39----------
like I don't remember your guests name


---------47:42----------
but like I really resonated with his


---------47:44----------
situation and that like well I think you


---------47:48----------
were talking about how like there's an


---------47:50----------
inevitable fee


---------47:51----------
that you're gonna run into failure right


---------47:55----------
and I'm kind of getting in there I


---------47:58----------
procrastinate like sure well do terrible


---------48:02----------
terrible and I just feel like as I'm


---------48:05----------
going further in academia like I'm


---------48:08----------
getting that reality check the further I


---------48:10----------
go guys and what as if I don't change


---------48:13----------
something about my behaviors I will not


---------48:15----------
be able to keep so so my points it no G


---------48:19----------
about sharing all these positive things


---------48:21----------
is I think you actually demonstrate


---------48:23----------
through your history that you're pretty


---------48:25----------
good at developing a plan of attack


---------48:28----------
that's not where your problem is so I


---------48:32----------
don't think your solution is to get


---------48:33----------
better at a plan of attack because I


---------48:35----------
just think just take any one thing let's


---------48:37----------
just take the one thing about moving to


---------48:38----------
Tennessee you wake up one day and you


---------48:41----------
realize that you're you're drug addict


---------48:43----------
roommates have used all your rent money


---------48:45----------
for drugs and you're being evicted I


---------48:47----------
would just fall apart and roll around on


---------48:51----------
the ground outside for about a few days


---------48:53----------
before I even know what no what to do


---------48:55----------
and you start plan of attack I can't


---------48:58----------
take all this stuff to Tennessee where


---------49:00----------
am I gonna go what are my options okay


---------49:01----------
Tennessee there's something there that I


---------49:03----------
could make work I can't make life into


---------49:06----------
life


---------49:06----------
lemons into lemonade right and then


---------49:09----------
you're like I can't take all my [ __ ]


---------49:10----------
because I only have a car so I have to


---------49:12----------
sell some [ __ ] it's not leaving on the


---------49:14----------
side of the road it's actually some so


---------49:16----------
you made a little bit of money you sold


---------49:17----------
some stuff like there are all kinds of


---------49:19----------
problems you could and then you move


---------49:20----------
across country you move in with her


---------49:22----------
she has trauma okay plan of attack how


---------49:24----------
are we gonna do that we're gonna be a


---------49:25----------
good boyfriend we love her we're gonna


---------49:27----------
support her we're not gonna pressure and


---------49:28----------
her into sex we're gonna try to make


---------49:30----------
this work plan of attack all right now


---------49:33----------
we're breaking up there's something


---------49:35----------
going on


---------49:35----------
she used to be emotionally invested in


---------49:37----------
the relationship there's no more tension


---------49:39----------
in the rope she's not emotionally


---------49:41----------
invested in the relationship things are


---------49:42----------
not working out we're gonna break up you


---------49:44----------
guys break up okay now she's [ __ ]


---------49:45----------
other dudes plan of attack what am I


---------49:47----------
gonna do I'm gonna [ __ ] other chicks


---------49:49----------
right plan of attack is not your problem


---------49:52----------
your problem is not that like this is a


---------49:55----------
monolith that needs to be broken down


---------49:56----------
there actually that's your problem is


---------49:58----------
that you need to change the perception


---------50:00----------
that everything is wrong in your life


---------50:02----------
because it is the perception that


---------50:04----------
everything is wrong in your life that is


---------50:06----------
making you feel overwhelmed because


---------50:08----------
you're actually really good at managing


---------50:09----------
problems


---------50:10----------
that's the bizarre thing you actually


---------50:13----------
have a bizarre amount of forward


---------50:16----------
momentum and change in adaptation in


---------50:18----------
your life I know it doesn't feel that


---------50:21----------
way to you but it's which is fair so my


---------50:27----------
point is that like this needs to start


---------50:29----------
with your feelings not with your attack


---------50:31----------
not with your actions you don't need to


---------50:34----------
be doing things differently you need to


---------50:36----------
be feeling things differently because


---------50:38----------
you're actually it sounds like you're


---------50:39----------
you manage you just manage really really


---------50:41----------
well man so so like and now we get to


---------50:45----------
like where do these feelings come from


---------50:47----------
right so we can talk about you know the


---------50:49----------
sex addictive behaviors and I'm sure


---------50:51----------
that that may be titillating but in my


---------50:53----------
mind like I don't I don't know that like


---------50:55----------
diving down into the way in which you


---------50:57----------
like or you know on five dating apps


---------51:00----------
like I'm sure that's worthwhile to talk


---------51:03----------
about but I don't think that like


---------51:04----------
spending an hour talking about the way


---------51:07----------
in which you use dating apps is gonna


---------51:09----------
help you yeah right


---------51:13----------
so like if we're really here so now we


---------51:15----------
have a fork in the road which is like do


---------51:17----------
we want to satisfy the voyeurism of


---------51:18----------
twitch at and and you know like like do


---------51:21----------
we have a conversation about like how do


---------51:23----------
you get laid because people like how the


---------51:25----------
[ __ ] I wish I don't find dating apps


---------51:28----------
right listen up to it right so that's


---------51:31----------
absolutely a conversation that we can


---------51:34----------
have but I mean I think at the end of


---------51:36----------
the day I try to do live streaming as if


---------51:39----------
I'm having a conversation with one


---------51:40----------
person and I try to help that person


---------51:42----------
it's like my biggest question for you og


---------51:46----------
is how many people have told you or have


---------51:53----------
demonstrated to you that you're not good


---------51:55----------
enough ooh that one hurts a lot a lot I


---------52:03----------
don't know that feeling would definitely


---------52:05----------
drive deep in probably feeling like the


---------52:08----------
way I do about my dad is definitely like


---------52:10----------
I wasn't good enough to you know have


---------52:15----------
those types of like father/son


---------52:16----------
interactions or to have enough


---------52:18----------
like investment into my life that you


---------52:20----------
know so if you're not I want you to I


---------52:23----------
want to ask you something when when your


---------52:25----------
ex-girlfriend when you started to feel


---------52:28----------
like you weren't good enough for her


---------52:30----------
how hard did you try oh my [ __ ] oh [ __ ]


---------52:35----------
no I like we tried very hard


---------52:43----------
I don't know out okay so so how how


---------52:45----------
overwhelmed so the the harder you tried


---------52:49----------
if I were to draw a graph where the


---------52:52----------
x-axis is trying hard in the y-axis


---------52:55----------
sorry the x-axis is let me think about


---------53:04----------
this


---------53:07----------
so let me just ask the question in a


---------53:09----------
different way yeah the more that you


---------53:12----------
feel you felt like inadequate or that


---------53:14----------
you weren't good enough you tried harder


---------53:17----------
right yeah and and when you were trying


---------53:21----------
really really hard how overwhelmed did


---------53:24----------
you feel I felt like I was always like


---------53:29----------
pushing against a wall all the time


---------53:32----------
right so like this is gonna sound really


---------53:35----------
bizarre and I hope this makes sense your


---------53:37----------
problem oh gee is that you're pushing


---------53:41----------
against a wall and that's futile and so


---------53:44----------
I want you to just think about this the


---------53:45----------
problem isn't that you're unable like


---------53:48----------
the problem is it that you're weak the


---------53:50----------
problem is that you're pushing against


---------53:51----------
something that is immovable your


---------53:55----------
solution is not to like get stronger so


---------53:59----------
you can push the mountain the solution


---------54:00----------
is to stop trying to push them out like


---------54:06----------
I don't know if you know how to


---------54:08----------
translate that into your actual life but


---------54:10----------
do you see what I'm saying you're


---------54:11----------
setting up a situation where futility is


---------54:15----------
the only result but just let's just


---------54:17----------
think about this so you feel like you're


---------54:19----------
not good enough so you try extra hard


---------54:20----------
and the harder you try the more


---------54:23----------
overwhelm do you feel in the more


---------54:24----------
powerless you feel the funny thing is


---------54:28----------
that that feeling like you wouldn't feel


---------54:30----------
overwhelmed or powerless if you weren't


---------54:32----------
pushing does that make sense like


---------54:37----------
there's there's a futility like you just


---------54:39----------
think about this the harder you try


---------54:41----------
you're like giving everything and you're


---------54:43----------
giving everything and you're giving


---------54:44----------
everything and nothing is working and


---------54:46----------
nothing is working and nothing is


---------54:48----------
working and everything is wrong in your


---------54:50----------
life and there's nothing you can do and


---------54:51----------
you wake up every day and it's just a


---------54:53----------
slog and you can't take it anymore


---------54:55----------
you've been doing this for years and


---------54:56----------
you've been trying and trying and trying


---------54:58----------
and all of your effort is futile you're


---------55:00----------
worthless it's a whole big mess of


---------55:02----------
worthlessness and it starts with you


---------55:06----------
trying because just imagine this for a


---------55:10----------
second if you didn't try then are your


---------55:15----------
actions futile


---------55:18----------
I see what do you see explain it to us I


---------55:25----------
[Applause]


---------55:27----------
think what you're talking about


---------55:30----------
is that if I set an expectation of win


---------55:33----------
or fail if I don't have expectations of


---------55:38----------
winning or failing and trying is kind of


---------55:41----------
like implied into you know conquering


---------55:43----------
whatever it is that I'm trying to


---------55:47----------
approach but if I get rid of the


---------55:51----------
expectation then there is no there is no


---------55:55----------
struggle that's not exactly where I was


---------55:57----------
going from it I think this is a this is


---------55:59----------
a problem of you watching too much of


---------56:00----------
our content it's a little bit of a joke


---------56:04----------
so I'm glad you've learned a lot yeah


---------56:06----------
but I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to


---------56:09----------
like actually mold it a little bit more


---------56:10----------
what I or what I want you to understand


---------56:12----------
is that you were setting up a problem


---------56:14----------
for yourself that you cannot win right


---------56:19----------
sure and so like this is what this is


---------56:21----------
what exhausts frustrates and makes


---------56:23----------
people want to give up is you set


---------56:25----------
yourself up against an unsolvable


---------56:27----------
problem and then you try a lot and then


---------56:30----------
you like feel like a failure over and


---------56:32----------
over again even though like the game is


---------56:34----------
[ __ ] rigged the problem is that not


---------56:36----------
that life sets the advantages and


---------56:38----------
disadvantages against you that are like


---------56:40----------
against you it's that you're setting


---------56:43----------
you're setting yourself up for absolute


---------56:46----------
failure and and the problem is that when


---------56:50----------
you set yourself up for absolute failure


---------56:51----------
you give forth absolute effort and you


---------56:54----------
love a hundred and ten percent and you


---------56:57----------
try a hundred and ten percent and you


---------56:58----------
put up with all kinds of [ __ ] that is


---------57:01----------
really like unreasonable to put up with


---------57:03----------
whether it's like yeah I mean I don't


---------57:06----------
don't even get me started there there's


---------57:08----------
all kinds of weird signs that like


---------57:10----------
there's just like there's a pattern of


---------57:13----------
like people [ __ ] you over right yes


---------57:16----------
the thing is like I don't think you're


---------57:18----------
that dumb I think it's because you set


---------57:20----------
yourself up for people [ __ ] you over


---------57:22----------
because you give in too much into the


---------57:25----------
relationship when you should say I


---------57:27----------
shouldn't try to push against this wall


---------57:29----------
anymore


---------57:29----------
you try to make her love you when


---------57:32----------
that's not something you can do right


---------57:35----------
right I learned that yes yes but I don't


---------57:40----------
think you did so like you learned


---------57:43----------
actually what you learned is that you


---------57:45----------
can't make her love you but you're sure


---------57:47----------
as hell gonna try the next person and


---------57:49----------
you're sure as hell gonna try the next


---------57:51----------
person and you've been learning this


---------57:54----------
lesson over and over and over again with


---------57:57----------
individual people but you haven't


---------57:59----------
learned it in general because you tried


---------58:02----------
to get your two best friends to love you


---------58:04----------
you tried to get this girl to love you


---------58:05----------
and you tried to get your dad to love


---------58:07----------
you and the reason that you try is


---------58:10----------
because you're trying to get everyone to


---------58:12----------
love you because at the core of it you


---------58:14----------
feel like you're unlovable and this is


---------58:19----------
the thing is that has to come out root


---------58:22----------
and stem right and I feel like a lot of


---------58:26----------
it is like I can't love myself like


---------58:29----------
that's something I'm really trying hard


---------58:31----------
to do is like have compassion for myself


---------58:34----------
and yeah the self-loathing right so like


---------58:38----------
not only you're unlovable


---------58:40----------
you beat yourself up for being unlovable


---------58:42----------
and all of these behaviors like do you


---------58:45----------
see the patterns of trying like putting


---------58:47----------
yourself in situations where people


---------58:49----------
essentially take advantage of you and


---------58:51----------
then you're like oh [ __ ] that I'm not


---------58:53----------
gonna let these people take advantage of


---------58:55----------
me you move across country and you let


---------58:57----------
someone else take advantage of you and


---------58:58----------
then you're like [ __ ] that I'm done with


---------59:00----------
that now you're over here and then you


---------59:02----------
let someone else take advantage of you


---------59:03----------
this pattern is actually of your own


---------59:06----------
making I don't think you're that unlucky


---------59:08----------
like this is not random chance like when


---------59:11----------
we see this pattern over and over and


---------59:13----------
over again I think you're creating it


---------59:15----------
yeah I was I feel like I was like I


---------59:18----------
couldn't quite I don't know it's like I


---------59:21----------
felt like I was responsible for a lot of


---------59:22----------
like I was like this can't just be a me


---------59:24----------
thing or it them thing I should say out


---------59:28----------
there I'm definitely a part of this


---------59:30----------
problem and I just I need to figure out


---------59:33----------
what exactly so yeah the question like


---------59:36----------
so now like what I really want you to


---------59:38----------
tunnel down is I think there are going


---------59:39----------
to be some cases where if we tunnel down


---------59:41----------
I would make this prediction that there


---------59:43----------
are some moments where you feel


---------59:46----------
unloved and someone is mistreating you


---------59:49----------
and in that moment instead of


---------59:52----------
acknowledging their mistreatment what


---------59:54----------
you do is you try to make them love you


---------59:56----------
by like giving more yep because the


---------60:04----------
thought of being unlovable is so


---------60:05----------
intolerable to you because you've been


---------60:07----------
hurt this way over and over and over


---------60:10----------
again that like that becomes the spot


---------60:12----------
that you try to protect and this isn't


---------60:14----------
something you know okay I'm gonna just


---------60:18----------
feel it's just feelings it's cool yeah


---------60:20----------
so like I want you guys to understand


---------60:22----------
this like if you have a weak point right


---------60:23----------
let's say I take an arrow to the knee


---------60:25----------
and then like the next day I take an


---------60:27----------
arrow to the knee and the next day that


---------60:29----------
I take an arrow to me what happens is I


---------60:31----------
start protecting myself like I'm going


---------60:33----------
to put like armor over my knee because


---------60:35----------
like that's where I keep on getting hit


---------60:36----------
right make sense


---------60:39----------
the problem is that the way that you try


---------60:41----------
to protect yourself from feeling unloved


---------60:46----------
is to put yourself in situations where


---------60:48----------
that are untenable and will make you


---------60:50----------
eventually feel rejected it's like


---------60:54----------
you're you're putting on armor that has


---------60:56----------
a bull's-eye on it right like you're


---------60:58----------
creating these patterns where you're


---------61:00----------
essentially letting people abuse you


---------61:02----------
like over and over and over again like


---------61:06----------
you're creating abusive relationships


---------61:07----------
for yourself you're creating situations


---------61:10----------
of abandonment what are you over and


---------61:12----------
best because instead of like the problem


---------61:14----------
here what I'm telling you og is the


---------61:16----------
problem is not not trying hard enough or


---------61:19----------
not being strong enough it's trying too


---------61:21----------
hard it's pushing against a wall that


---------61:23----------
you can't move I yes and like what a


---------61:29----------
thing that I'm afraid of too is that I


---------61:32----------
worry about what happens when I turn


---------61:34----------
that engine off beautiful that's your


---------61:37----------
[ __ ] problem that's exactly what you


---------61:42----------
need to do you need to face that fear


---------61:45----------
you need to accept that there's a


---------61:47----------
possibility that people may not love you


---------61:52----------
instead of trying to control them and


---------61:54----------
make them love you you have to accept


---------61:57----------
that maybe they don't


---------62:00----------
and this is the [ __ ] paradox thing


---------62:01----------
this is why Zen is so paradoxical when


---------62:04----------
you start doing that people will start


---------62:06----------
loving you when you accept that people


---------62:10----------
may not love you and that you can't make


---------62:13----------
them love you when you let go of that


---------62:14----------
control and you let go of that paranoia


---------62:17----------
and you're also going to stop tolerating


---------62:19----------
the abusive behavior because you're


---------62:23----------
going to say to yourself okay this


---------62:24----------
person is not treating me right I can't


---------62:26----------
make them treat me right and they don't


---------62:27----------
love me so be it therefore I don't have


---------62:30----------
to double down and invest twice as much


---------62:33----------
in the relationship Oh like I'm pushing


---------62:35----------
against this wall and it's not moving


---------62:37----------
because it's attached to a bank and the


---------62:41----------
bank is 500 like thousand square feet


---------62:44----------
and it's made of brick in cement and I


---------62:47----------
can't push it oh maybe I should stop but


---------62:50----------
that's not what you do because like when


---------62:52----------
you feel the resistance of someone not


---------62:54----------
loving you when that feeling of not


---------62:55----------
being loved arises within you you push


---------62:58----------
harder and harder and harder and harder


---------63:00----------
and harder and it doesn't cause the


---------63:02----------
mountain to move and it just leaves you


---------63:04----------
exhausted


---------63:12----------
I think you figured me out dr. kay what


---------63:15----------
does that do for you though I figured


---------63:20----------
you out fantastic


---------63:21----------
I'm gonna go have lunch now go [ __ ]


---------63:24----------
yourself and like the problem I I feel


---------63:27----------
like I feel like I come to like very


---------63:30----------
similar conclusions just I feel like


---------63:32----------
yours is your conclusion is super


---------63:34----------
eloquent and like how it compasses


---------63:36----------
everything it's just I'm like I'll get


---------63:39----------
to the point where like okay like the


---------63:41----------
problem is coming from me how do I stop


---------63:44----------
this how do I like exactly yes so how


---------63:49----------
what do you do with this man what do you


---------63:51----------
think it's hard I have to be like


---------64:01----------
willing to let go of a lot how do you be


---------64:05----------
willing to let go I'm gonna help you


---------64:11----------
don't worry my point is that everything


---------64:13----------
up until this point is worthless without


---------64:15----------
the next step you get that but I've not


---------64:19----------
helped you 1% like helping you is gonna


---------64:22----------
be binary today we can go 99% of the


---------64:24----------
road but unless we can help you with the


---------64:26----------
next step this doesn't help at all


---------64:27----------
you with me okay like showing you what


---------64:30----------
your problem is like shirred good


---------64:31----------
diagnosis proceeds good treatment but


---------64:34----------
like good diagnosis with no treatment is


---------64:36----------
worthless so there are two solutions


---------64:41----------
okay the first thing is I want you to


---------64:42----------
recognize this as it's happening and


---------64:45----------
stop pushing there are going to be


---------64:47----------
moments and I don't even I'm not I'm not


---------64:50----------
gonna say they're going to be moments


---------64:51----------
who it cuz I just don't accept this for


---------64:53----------
a second who in your life right now are


---------64:56----------
you trying to win over thank you maybe


---------64:59----------
not good


---------65:00----------
are you trying to win over myself it's


---------65:03----------
late okay I'm I don't know I'm trying


---------65:07----------
I'm really trying not to like personally


---------65:11----------
am I my goal well my challenge right now


---------65:15----------
that I'm trying to work through is just


---------65:17----------
trying to be independent because I've


---------65:19----------
you've kind of tapped into like a lot of


---------65:21----------
my codependency issues that I've had


---------65:23----------
throughout yes


---------65:25----------
and my thing is I just want to be


---------65:28----------
independent


---------65:29----------
I don't okay KITT yes I'm trying to be


---------65:32----------
independent how do you try so what do we


---------65:34----------
do what's our solution to that in that


---------65:41----------
regard um I need some source of like


---------65:44----------
love that it's not coming from external


---------65:47----------
sources like I need it correct look no


---------65:50----------
so remember that the goal here is to


---------65:52----------
stop trying right yes so you're trying


---------65:57----------
to be independent so what should you do


---------66:00----------
not care about being independent


---------66:02----------
absolutely you should accept that you're


---------66:05----------
not ready to be independent and being


---------66:08----------
independent means not relying on


---------66:10----------
external sources of love so what should


---------66:13----------
you do not care in correct


---------66:20----------
you should care you should rely on


---------66:22----------
external sources of love whatever


---------66:24----------
direction you're going in your head


---------66:25----------
right now you need to move in the


---------66:27----------
opposite direction okay yeah because


---------66:31----------
this is can I just get young thing that


---------66:34----------
I feel like I have a problem like the


---------66:37----------
reason I feel like another thing that


---------66:39----------
ties in my self-loathing into this whole


---------66:41----------
little cycle too is like hey the stigma


---------66:44----------
of everything I'm doing but be that's


---------66:55----------
okay if it's important it'll come back


---------66:58----------
sure


---------67:00----------
continue though I'll come back I'll


---------67:02----------
remember it okay so like this is exactly


---------67:04----------
my point


---------67:05----------
right so like like you're trying to be


---------67:07----------
independent and how many times have you


---------67:09----------
told yourself that uh like every day


---------67:14----------
like when are we going to like


---------67:16----------
everything's kind of like a little bit


---------67:17----------
of like avoidance right now yeah so when


---------67:20----------
did you start telling yourself that you


---------67:21----------
need to be independent as soon as my mom


---------67:24----------
probably got into the apartment that was


---------67:26----------
a correct no well it has been going on


---------67:30----------
I'm feeling predominantly that way right


---------67:32----------
now


---------67:34----------
yeah you're telling me that when you


---------67:36----------
were growing up you didn't have thoughts


---------67:38----------
that I need to get on I need to get by


---------67:40----------
without my dad because he's not going


---------67:42----------
didn't know really right I didn't feel


---------67:47----------
that way as in I felt like I had to win


---------67:51----------
him over as in like I didn't think of


---------67:53----------
how do I go about my life without this


---------67:56----------
thing I went about my life thinking how


---------67:59----------
can I get this thing and you also didn't


---------68:02----------
have I'm a little bit surprised that


---------68:03----------
actually means I'm wrong but so but you


---------68:06----------
didn't you didn't eventually conclude


---------68:08----------
that like you need to get on without


---------68:10----------
your dad like he's not gonna show up and


---------68:11----------
that you need independence um I have


---------68:21----------
done a really good job of just like out


---------68:23----------
of sight out of mind with my dad for a


---------68:25----------
lot of years now because there was a


---------68:27----------
point where he is gonna be who he is and


---------68:30----------
whatever right so that speaks to me of


---------68:32----------
independence okay right so like at some


---------68:36----------
point you gave up on him and you decided


---------68:40----------
like it seems to me like you learned how


---------68:42----------
to be independent and you had to become


---------68:44----------
independent because he wasn't [ __ ]


---------68:45----------
around like he wasn't around right


---------68:49----------
yeah anyway so I mean I think ultimately


---------68:52----------
that's not you know I so I have like my


---------68:54----------
sense


---------68:55----------
oh geez that all this crap is related so


---------68:57----------
your desire for your independence your


---------69:00----------
tendency to be codependent your hunger


---------69:03----------
for people to love you has to relate to


---------69:06----------
lists like general ID like why do people


---------69:07----------
need to feel loved by other people why


---------69:11----------
do you need to make other people love


---------69:12----------
you go ahead you ever thought yes I


---------69:14----------
remembered what I was going to say


---------69:16----------
so like the stigma was a and then B is


---------69:19----------
just like the way it makes me feel


---------69:23----------
knowing that I have to approach


---------69:25----------
something external and it can't come


---------69:27----------
from within me like everything like


---------69:30----------
these these drugs like sex and


---------69:32----------
everything like that in order to make


---------69:33----------
myself feel happy or content I have to


---------69:36----------
approach something external and it can't


---------69:39----------
something with it


---------69:41----------
this is gonna be really confusing but


---------69:43----------
like that is what you need to accept


---------69:45----------
because I know this is gonna sound


---------69:46----------
really [ __ ] weird but I want you to


---------69:48----------
really run with me for a second okay


---------69:49----------
okay when you make try to make someone


---------69:53----------
love you who is in control they are


---------69:57----------
incorrect no okay go ahead think I'm


---------70:01----------
gonna ask the question again when you


---------70:03----------
makes when you're trying to make someone


---------70:04----------
love you who is the agent that has power


---------70:07----------
where is the action it's in my desire to


---------70:15----------
want to make it happen so it's yeah it's


---------70:17----------
not even your desire your exerting


---------70:20----------
effort on another human being to make


---------70:22----------
them love you right do you like see how


---------70:25----------
that if I'm trying to make something


---------70:26----------
happen


---------70:27----------
I'm the one who's exerting the power you


---------70:29----------
presume that you have the control to


---------70:30----------
make someone love you otherwise you


---------70:31----------
wouldn't [ __ ]


---------70:32----------
do it you actually have the control they


---------70:34----------
don't have the control what you're


---------70:36----------
terrified of is giving them the capacity


---------70:39----------
to not love you do you see that the


---------70:42----------
control is actually in your hands not in


---------70:45----------
theirs and that's why it's so [ __ ]


---------70:48----------
frustrating because the control isn't


---------70:49----------
actually in your hands but in your mind


---------70:51----------
that's what you're trying to do like


---------70:53----------
just think about it for a second I'm


---------70:55----------
trying to make someone love me I can't


---------70:57----------
do that but even I'm trying to make that


---------71:01----------
implies that like I'm trying to make a


---------71:03----------
chair I'm trying to make a bowl of


---------71:07----------
noodles I'm trying to make a life for


---------71:09----------
myself I'm trying to make a light that


---------71:12----------
turns on like who's in control in all of


---------71:14----------
those statements so this is me fighting


---------71:17----------
against that metaphorical wall again yes


---------71:19----------
absolutely yes but the thing here is


---------71:21----------
that what you need to do is stop trying


---------71:23----------
to be independent stop trying to control


---------71:26----------
other people because that's still you


---------71:28----------
that's you being independent because you


---------71:29----------
are not actually in a relationship with


---------71:31----------
another human being who has thoughts and


---------71:33----------
feelings you have all of the


---------71:35----------
relationship that you're bearing on your


---------71:36----------
shoulders you're pulling the rope


---------71:38----------
entirely there's no tension on the other


---------71:40----------
side because you're owning all of that


---------71:42----------
responsibility you're taking all of that


---------71:44----------
responsibility and you're trying to make


---------71:46----------
them love you and you're pushing pushing


---------71:47----------
pushing pulling pulling pulling so much


---------71:49----------
love into the void do you see that it's


---------71:51----------
all one-sided


---------71:53----------
everything about this is one sided with


---------71:58----------
me okay when I push against the wall


---------72:02----------
does the wall push back like my physics


---------72:08----------
but I see what you're saying no it does


---------72:11----------
not it's most in your scenario it's


---------72:14----------
mostly just me exerting effort the walls


---------72:16----------
just being there yeah and actually if


---------72:18----------
you want to go like really five head you


---------72:20----------
throw in physics because you're right


---------72:23----------
that whatever you throw in no matter how


---------72:25----------
hard you try what is the result


---------72:27----------
you stay the same because this


---------72:30----------
ex-girlfriend exerts an equal and


---------72:32----------
opposite force to make sure that the


---------72:35----------
relationship doesn't move forward right


---------72:37----------
so you're actually right both cases are


---------72:40----------
true now we see why your life is futile


---------72:44----------
because you set up this like we


---------72:46----------
you're you know psychophysics


---------72:49----------
experiment where you're exerting a lot


---------72:51----------
of futility because you're trying to


---------72:53----------
control everything you are living in a


---------72:55----------
world where there is your assumption is


---------72:57----------
that there is not an equal and opposite


---------72:59----------
reaction I am making her love me there's


---------73:03----------
no agency on her her end because you


---------73:06----------
can't surrender the fact that people may


---------73:08----------
not be able to love you


---------73:11----------
once you surrender that people may not


---------73:14----------
be able to love you and furthermore that


---------73:16----------
you're not an island unto yourself that


---------73:19----------
you can't be independent right now and


---------73:21----------
that like I hate to break it to you


---------73:23----------
buddy but what you need is love like you


---------73:27----------
get that like you need someone to love


---------73:31----------
you in the way that you love them yeah


---------73:35----------
that's the way it feels essentially yeah


---------73:36----------
and so the like don't ignore your


---------73:39----------
feelings and say like just think about


---------73:41----------
this for a second you're hungry and


---------73:43----------
thirsty for love you've been hungry and


---------73:46----------
thirsty for love theoretically your


---------73:48----------
entire life right and and and every time


---------73:52----------
someone doesn't love you it hurts and so


---------73:55----------
you go and like the way to take someone


---------73:57----------
who's hungry and thirsty is we don't


---------73:58----------
tell them you need to be independent of


---------74:00----------
hunger and thirst like that's doesn't


---------74:03----------
[ __ ] work man right you need to be


---------74:07----------
loved in the way that you're gonna get


---------74:10----------
loved is by recognizing that you can't


---------74:13----------
make someone love you and then you've


---------74:15----------
gotta roll the dice and I can almost


---------74:19----------
guarantee you that for patterns as baked


---------74:22----------
in as yours are there's someone right


---------74:24----------
now in your life that you are trying to


---------74:26----------
win over and you do it every moment when


---------74:29----------
you think about how other people


---------74:31----------
perceive you because in that moment


---------74:33----------
you're not letting your you're not even


---------74:35----------
letting us judge you you're saying like


---------74:37----------
oh this like statement I know it sounds


---------74:39----------
cathartic but it's not you're trying to


---------74:41----------
control our perception even now yeah let


---------74:44----------
us think whatever the [ __ ] we want about


---------74:45----------
you let us see you for who you are and


---------74:52----------
and be let yourself be free from the


---------74:57----------
possibility that we think you're an


---------74:58----------
awful person


---------74:59----------
or that your idiotic free yourself and


---------75:01----------
we think you're a dumbass


---------75:04----------
twitch ad thinks you're a dumbass so


---------75:06----------
what let go of trying to control other


---------75:11----------
people's perceptions let go of trying to


---------75:13----------
make other people love you and once you


---------75:17----------
do that you're gonna stop investing your


---------75:19----------
energy into a futile problem and if


---------75:23----------
you've not investing your energy in a


---------75:25----------
futile problem lo and behold you may


---------75:27----------
start investing it in things that can


---------75:29----------
actually like start to bear fruit and


---------75:31----------
then like oh what the [ __ ]


---------75:34----------
we're actually like not treading water


---------75:35----------
because we're moving in a direction the


---------75:37----------
energy investment of treading water and


---------75:39----------
moving in a direction is basically the


---------75:41----------
same the problem is that like you're in


---------75:45----------
the ocean and you found an island and


---------75:47----------
you're pushing against it instead of


---------75:49----------
like actually moving somewhere else or


---------75:50----------
like getting out of the water the


---------75:53----------
analogy is falling apart at this point I


---------75:58----------
guess I understand that so very


---------76:02----------
concretely I want you to think about


---------76:04----------
your relationships and notice within


---------76:06----------
yourself like when do I feel unloved


---------76:08----------
that's what you have to tap into I yeah


---------76:13----------
it hits me really quickly you know I'm


---------76:16----------
always a big proponent of you know


---------76:18----------
actions speak more than words and like


---------76:23----------
that's the first thing I look at is like


---------76:25----------
are they behaving in a way that shows


---------76:27----------
affection now so okay yeah so now we see


---------76:36----------
like why you have relationship cycles


---------76:39----------
right because like you come in and like


---------76:42----------
when you perceive an action that's an


---------76:46----------
insult to your like self-worth you have


---------76:50----------
to emotionally invest to like balance


---------76:52----------
that I don't know if that makes sense


---------76:54----------
but like someone does something like


---------76:55----------
they don't return a text and then you


---------76:57----------
feel unloved and then like then the


---------77:01----------
cycle begins and then you have to invest


---------77:03----------
more in the relationship because you


---------77:04----------
have to get them to love you and then


---------77:07----------
they don't return another text and then


---------77:09----------
you have to get them to love you even


---------77:10----------
more do you see that like that's the


---------77:12----------
trigger


---------77:13----------
the biggest thing is that you have to


---------77:14----------
acknowledge like when they don't return


---------77:16----------
the text you have to catch it then and


---------77:18----------
there that sometimes people just don't


---------77:20----------
return texts and it's not because like


---------77:24----------
there's something wrong with you but the


---------77:25----------
problem is that you have like been hit


---------77:27----------
it like you have been hurt so many times


---------77:29----------
that your fear that you're unlovable


---------77:31----------
starts to see things in the shadows that


---------77:34----------
are not there right it's like walking


---------77:38----------
outside when it's dark outside and


---------77:39----------
seeing a rope on the ground and thinking


---------77:41----------
it's a snake it's an analogy that's from


---------77:44----------
an Ayurvedic textbook that doesn't


---------77:46----------
really translate here because we don't


---------77:48----------
have snakes in America but and we do but


---------77:50----------
anyway it's like yeah no not not in


---------77:54----------
Boston yeah but I see so let me just be


---------78:01----------
very very concrete okay so the first


---------78:03----------
thing is for you to recognize the


---------78:05----------
feeling of being unlocked and then


---------78:07----------
recognize that that feeling of being


---------78:08----------
unloved is gonna push you to engage in


---------78:11----------
certain behaviors and you have to


---------78:15----------
isolate those you have to see what they


---------78:17----------
those are and then the third thing is to


---------78:19----------
recognize that the stuff going feeding


---------78:22----------
into the feeling of aunt being unloved


---------78:24----------
may be incorrect this is a cognitive


---------78:30----------
bias right sometimes people just don't


---------78:33----------
return text that doesn't mean that they


---------78:34----------
don't think you're a good person


---------78:36----------
yes yeah I I feel like I actually with


---------78:40----------
the example of texting I feel like I you


---------78:42----------
know I'll feel the emotion and I feel


---------78:45----------
like I'm very good about catching those


---------78:46----------
already because I will rationalize it


---------78:49----------
down and I'll address it with logic like


---------78:50----------
no no no you know people are busy they


---------78:53----------
have things going on their lives that


---------78:55----------
you are not the center of their universe


---------78:56----------
you know they have you know who are you


---------79:00----------
to them whatever you know like oh you


---------79:04----------
were doing great until that last


---------79:05----------
sentence who are you to that yes you're


---------79:08----------
unlovable to them you're not worth it to


---------79:11----------
them see you are not the center of their


---------79:16----------
universe you were doing great


---------79:19----------
everything was rational until that


---------79:21----------
unlovable some scarf popped up and said


---------79:23----------
you are not worth their time


---------79:28----------
you see how that happened I hope you


---------79:31----------
guys caught it on Twitch at first couple


---------79:34----------
things were rational third thought was a


---------79:36----------
some scarf


---------79:37----------
this [ __ ] is subtle in its deep my


---------79:38----------
friend you're doing very good but it's


---------79:41----------
still trickier it's trickier than you


---------79:43----------
are I try I tried really hard to catch


---------79:46----------
it though good and so you should keep


---------79:48----------
trying


---------79:49----------
cuz it's good you you caught the first


---------79:51----------
couple but I'm not supposed to try


---------79:53----------
exactly now we get to the next thing


---------79:56----------
right which is which is when you would


---------79:57----------
don't actually wrestle when you


---------79:59----------
rationalize it you don't actually deal


---------80:00----------
with it emotionally the question that


---------80:03----------
you need to ask yourself is you know


---------80:04----------
sure you can rationalize they don't have


---------80:06----------
you know they can't be around all the


---------80:08----------
time but what does it feel like to not


---------80:10----------
be a priority for them and sit with that


---------80:12----------
feeling because then like then you throw


---------80:16----------
yourself a pity party and like don't do


---------80:18----------
that like it's okay to like not be for


---------80:22----------
someone's priority can I sit with that


---------80:24----------
feeling can I sit with the feeling that


---------80:25----------
I don't feel like a priority to them and


---------80:28----------
I don't want that to change my action I


---------80:30----------
actually don't want to try I don't want


---------80:32----------
to try to protect myself from that hurt


---------80:35----------
because that's one option right I'm not


---------80:36----------
gonna text him again [ __ ] it or I'm


---------80:39----------
gonna get I'm gonna try to get them to


---------80:40----------
love me more like don't do anything just


---------80:43----------
sit you need to not do anything notice


---------80:47----------
those feelings of rejection and just sit


---------80:49----------
with them for a while and it's gonna


---------80:51----------
feel bad it's like you ever cleaned out


---------80:56----------
a garbage disposal oh yes pretty mucky


---------81:00----------
yep so like you know the feeling when


---------81:03----------
you first put your hand into the garbage


---------81:04----------
disposal where you like almost gag yeah


---------81:08----------
and then like what happens the few


---------81:10----------
seconds after that you're like my hands


---------81:13----------
already wet might as well go the entire


---------81:14----------
yep we're right so like the first three


---------81:17----------
seconds of putting your hand into a


---------81:19----------
garbage disposal or the worst part and


---------81:21----------
then once you're in the filth


---------81:22----------
it's then you can then you're fine you


---------81:24----------
get what I'm saying yes so you need to


---------81:26----------
put your hand in the guard I mean


---------81:28----------
obviously not way it's all on or


---------81:30----------
anything right yeah but yeah but like


---------81:32----------
you need to sit in the filth which are


---------81:35----------
not ready to do and what you'll realize


---------81:36----------
is like sure it's mucky but like


---------81:38----------
after time it's not going to be that bad


---------81:40----------
right an acknowledge that your unlovable


---------81:43----------
and acknowledge that you can't be


---------81:44----------
independent and acknowledge that in


---------81:46----------
order for you to be healed you need to


---------81:48----------
be loved and then the most terrifying


---------81:51----------
thought is that that's not something


---------81:53----------
that you can guarantee and understand


---------81:55----------
that for the rest of your life there is


---------81:57----------
a chance that when you die you will


---------81:58----------
still be broken and if you can do that


---------82:02----------
then you'll start to move forward it's


---------82:09----------
it's really hard for me to like quit or


---------82:11----------
like not even quit like it's hard for me


---------82:14----------
to give up on things like yes it's


---------82:17----------
really hard you're like I I teach


---------82:20----------
martial arts on the side


---------82:22----------
I run a judo program at a university


---------82:24----------
here and like there's so much there's


---------82:29----------
there's so many times where I'll just


---------82:31----------
teach hurt like I'll be hurt like I have


---------82:33----------
a grade two sprain in my left ankle


---------82:35----------
right now and I'll still teach on it I


---------82:37----------
haven't teach taught recently because


---------82:39----------
they close down all the classes and


---------82:41----------
everything like that because of kovat


---------82:42----------
but like like I'm always I don't know


---------82:45----------
it's really there's the trying again yep


---------82:49----------
so now beautifully said so oh gee I


---------82:51----------
don't know exactly what this is gonna


---------82:53----------
look like for you but I think what you


---------82:54----------
should do is notice those things about


---------82:57----------
yourself where you don't want to give up


---------82:59----------
and then try to give up or if you can't


---------83:03----------
give up then give up on giving up and at


---------83:06----------
least accept don't try but say like oh


---------83:08----------
[ __ ] it this is not gonna work like I'm


---------83:12----------
a dumbass and I'm gonna teach on this


---------83:13----------
this messed-up ankle because I'm so


---------83:16----------
attached to this that I'm not willing


---------83:18----------
like my pride is so big that I'm not


---------83:20----------
willing to like look feel ashamed in


---------83:23----------
front of people because I have an injury


---------83:24----------
because I'm the teacher and I was


---------83:25----------
supposed to be invincible


---------83:27----------
that's this complex in my head and it's


---------83:30----------
too big of a ball for me to restrain you


---------83:33----------
can do that too or you can actually sit


---------83:37----------
out your judo class if you're injured


---------83:39----------
that's those are the reps that you need


---------83:41----------
to do you need to start by giving up


---------83:43----------
little little little things and it's


---------83:46----------
good that you notice that that's


---------83:46----------
beautiful so now you just like make


---------83:49----------
yourself as best as you can not teach


---------83:51----------
that


---------83:52----------
pseudo-class and then give up something


---------83:54----------
else and then give up something else and


---------83:56----------
then give up something else until you


---------83:58----------
ain't doing [ __ ] until you become what


---------84:01----------
twitch at is just sitting around doing


---------84:03----------
nothing all day instead of being this


---------84:06----------
trihard [ __ ] that you are you see


---------84:08----------
twitch at trying hard doesn't doesn't


---------84:11----------
pay you guys have the winning strategy


---------84:15----------
the the really sad and ironic thing is


---------84:18----------
that twitch chat tries really hard to


---------84:19----------
that's the problem is they try so so


---------84:22----------
hard and then they feel overwhelmed and


---------84:24----------
exhausted because you're trying so hard


---------84:26----------
man and it's just not working any way


---------84:31----------
thoughts or questions before we wrap up


---------84:34----------
no thank you very much for having me on


---------84:36----------
I really appreciated it I really loved


---------84:39----------
your insight into what's going on in my


---------84:42----------
life so so can you recap for us oh gee


---------84:45----------
what you understood about our


---------84:46----------
conversation today or what you think was


---------84:48----------
relevant or helpful


---------84:49----------
Waku as much as you can so understanding


---------84:57----------
I think a big thing that we talked about


---------85:00----------
was understanding what is futile because


---------85:03----------
in my life like I am approaching it in


---------85:09----------
such a way where I'm becoming the


---------85:11----------
problem because I'm not accepting that


---------85:15----------
giving up is acceptable to me and I'd


---------85:19----------
like dealing with feeling these emotions


---------85:25----------
of not being lovable


---------85:34----------
and then how do you like going like the


---------85:39----------
relationship between being unlovable and


---------85:42----------
like the freedom that it brings of like


---------85:44----------
accepting that you can go through your


---------85:46----------
life and be unlovable but at the same


---------85:48----------
time like it frees you from the burden


---------85:52----------
of trying and failing and trying and


---------85:54----------
failing and avoiding those cycles also


---------86:00----------
what else we we went over essentially it


---------86:03----------
like those cycles and depth of like


---------86:05----------
what's going on understanding that you


---------86:13----------
know someone's not going to pitch in to


---------86:16----------
the pot with their emotional investment


---------86:18----------
if you're doing all the work there if


---------86:20----------
you're that you're you know if you're


---------86:23----------
gonna just put fifty percent in if they


---------86:27----------
put fifty percent in that seems pretty


---------86:28----------
nice yeah so that's that's actually next


---------86:31----------
level [ __ ] so now like I want you to


---------86:33----------
really think about this other


---------86:34----------
relationship right this two-and-a-half


---------86:36----------
year relationship yep I think the


---------86:39----------
biggest problem with that relationship


---------86:40----------
is that you let her get away with giving


---------86:43----------
less than 50% because you wanted the


---------86:49----------
relationship to work so hard that you


---------86:51----------
gave a hundred percent and thereby you


---------86:54----------
let her off the hook if you want to feel


---------86:58----------
loved and if you want a relationship to


---------87:00----------
work out you can't do all of the work


---------87:02----------
you just can't right you've got to let


---------87:05----------
her do her part the problem is that if


---------87:07----------
you let her do her part


---------87:09----------
you're ceding control that she may not


---------87:10----------
do it and then the relationship could


---------87:12----------
fail in your seating control you see


---------87:15----------
that yes and I it's always weird because


---------87:19----------
I always feel like I'm never in control


---------87:21----------
yeah and so that's thus I'm fighting


---------87:24----------
against those invisible walls again


---------87:26----------
trying to gain back that powerlessness


---------87:29----------
yes so you've got to let yourself be


---------87:32----------
powerless yeah that's it's I don't know


---------87:38----------
there's so much other things that like


---------87:41----------
have contributed to like me being where


---------87:43----------
I am absolutely yeah and like


---------87:47----------
the good news og is that when people


---------87:49----------
have problems that are everything it's


---------87:52----------
been my overwhelming experience that if


---------87:54----------
you can you know grab this one thing


---------87:58----------
that a lot of things in your life will


---------88:00----------
come tumbling down


---------88:01----------
in terms of barriers I've seen that yeah


---------88:06----------
but beautifully point yeah my whole


---------88:09----------
thing is like I if I'm to give up I just


---------88:12----------
want to be able to do it with grace I


---------88:14----------
don't know but that's probably like ties


---------88:16----------
it into caring what other people think


---------88:18----------
beautiful see now you're getting there


---------88:20----------
you have to give up giving up with grace


---------88:25----------
you have to fail like a dumbass you have


---------88:28----------
to let yourself feel like a dumbass you


---------88:30----------
see like how ingrained it is every


---------88:32----------
thought that you have this attachment is


---------88:35----------
right behind it it's recursive man it's


---------88:38----------
like Inception you can go as many layers


---------88:40----------
as you want to and like it's always


---------88:42----------
gonna be there I want to give up with


---------88:46----------
grace


---------88:46----------
I want to fail magnificently right


---------88:52----------
because that yeah it's the implications


---------88:54----------
there it's just underneath the surface


---------88:56----------
absolutely yeah that's how it is good


---------89:01----------
yeah often yeah I say things out loud


---------89:05----------
and then I'll be like oh I didn't know I


---------89:07----------
felt that way well that makes sense you


---------89:09----------
know good that's good the other thing


---------89:11----------
that you can think about doing I don't


---------89:12----------
know if you've seen a therapist but you


---------89:14----------
should maybe see a therapist and talk


---------89:15----------
about your dad yeah that's another thing


---------89:21----------
that I'm dealing with too is just like


---------89:22----------
not not having medical insurance is


---------89:26----------
crazy but the university offers a a not


---------89:31----------
free well it is now but they were it's


---------89:34----------
like co-pays like 15 bucks it's nothing


---------89:36----------
sure but we've been I'm I've already


---------89:41----------
made progress though you got that yeah


---------89:43----------
but I could focus on that next time


---------89:46----------
so other thoughts oh gee I thought that


---------89:48----------
was a beautiful summary but if I mean I


---------89:50----------
jumped in there so I didn't yeah you


---------89:57----------
should play Final Fantasy 7 okay


---------89:59----------
it's really really good like they've


---------90:02----------
done a wonderful job you can tell like


---------90:04----------
that's something that I really like care


---------90:05----------
about nowadays it's like actually seeing


---------90:07----------
effort in video game so you can actually


---------90:10----------
see the effort saying you're like oh


---------90:11----------
there was passionate developers that


---------90:14----------
went into this game and you can see like


---------90:16----------
how passionate they were you can see


---------90:17----------
that in Final Fantasy 7 it's not just


---------90:19----------
formulaic soulless cobbled together


---------90:23----------
works by the gaming executives but a


---------90:26----------
game made by gamers I'm with you dude


---------90:29----------
for sure yeah you got like a bad


---------90:32----------
corporate takeover with video games it's


---------90:34----------
pretty terrible but no that game is


---------90:36----------
wonderful I think you'll really like it


---------90:38----------
if you play deep rock lactic that's a


---------90:40----------
really fun one too yeah yeah okay cool


---------90:44----------
man thanks for the recommendation and


---------90:46----------
good luck yeah and we're rooting for you


---------90:48----------
yes sir thank you again for having me on


---------90:51----------
I really do appreciate it Oh actually


---------90:52----------
hold on a second let me think about


---------90:53----------
meditation let's do meditation I keep on


---------90:55----------
chatter oh can I ask you yeah real quick


---------91:02----------
so with Ayurveda so I tried taking like


---------91:10----------
a lot of the Osho quizzes and everything


---------91:12----------
like that and I can't really find like a


---------91:13----------
really good one cuz I get like mixed


---------91:15----------
results but like half the time I come up


---------91:18----------
really strong on like Vata and then


---------91:20----------
other times I come up like predominantly


---------91:23----------
not pizza with the cough ah yes so I


---------91:28----------
don't know because the ones I've been


---------91:33----------
looking at lately it's been cough uh


---------91:35----------
yeah so so do you remember it have you


---------91:39----------
seen like any of the stuff that we've


---------91:40----------
done I rather did you watch the webinar


---------91:41----------
women I've watched I think I watched it


---------91:45----------
part of that I think I might watch that


---------91:46----------
one yeah so like if you guys watch that


---------91:48----------
part of it anywhere what's your question


---------91:50----------
um what would be a good way to like


---------91:53----------
tailor like cuz like my big thing I'm


---------91:56----------
ADHD too so it's like


---------91:57----------
organization is really important for me


---------91:59----------
and like I was like I've noticed there's


---------92:01----------
some things they're like oh that fits


---------92:04----------
perfectly with me and like you know with


---------92:06----------
these you know the dough shows and


---------92:08----------
everything like I


---------92:11----------
other sign yeah okay yeah I'm I'm like


---------92:15----------
for context I'm sitting down but I'm


---------92:17----------
like I know that they bring in a lot of


---------92:19----------
like body type like characteristics into


---------92:21----------
I'm like 6 foot 3 yep and like - yeah


---------92:25----------
but I'm kind of lanky at the same time


---------92:27----------
yep yeah so for those of y'all watching


---------92:30----------
it anyway so what's your question and


---------92:32----------
then before I die I just what would what


---------92:34----------
would you recommend as far as like cuz


---------92:36----------
like there's different diets that they


---------92:38----------
recommend I don't know like I'm trying


---------92:40----------
to look for like a template of like how


---------92:42----------
I can kind of organize myself yeah very


---------92:44----------
good so let's start by understanding


---------92:46----------
what you're though shot so you have a


---------92:48----------
very round face and a very sharp nose


---------92:50----------
right so you're kind of like a vodka


---------92:53----------
cough OH which like I haven't done a


---------92:55----------
great job in explaining about the


---------92:56----------
coupler because I kind of make them out


---------92:58----------
to be opposites but they're not they're


---------92:59----------
just three different axes right right so


---------93:03----------
you also have a very very classic story


---------93:06----------
for a vodka cava which is that you stay


---------93:09----------
in relationships and bad situations for


---------93:11----------
longer than you need to that's your


---------93:12----------
governess that's the down side of


---------93:14----------
resilience other people would have left


---------93:17----------
that relationship way earlier than two


---------93:19----------
and a half years but you have the


---------93:20----------
staying power to push against that


---------93:23----------
mountain for way longer than other


---------93:25----------
people do and we see the botanist


---------93:27----------
because you're not in a relationship for


---------93:29----------
10 years but you have frequent cycles of


---------93:33----------
the same thing so you have fluctuation


---------93:35----------
of like you find yourself in bad


---------93:38----------
situations very very often in in


---------93:40----------
different bad situations very very often


---------93:42----------
so we hear that from your like story


---------93:46----------
right like roommates and then this girl


---------93:49----------
and then friends who abandon you and


---------93:51----------
then switching careers and then becoming


---------93:53----------
a nurse and then like not become like


---------93:55----------
now you're in school again but that's a


---------93:57----------
whole nother but you're not you're not


---------93:59----------
full hot because you actually complete


---------94:01----------
your nursing degree you're gonna finish


---------94:03----------
school like you've got you see the


---------94:05----------
difference like this is vodka and cava


---------94:06----------
there's a lot of career changes but


---------94:08----------
they're not half-finished career changes


---------94:10----------
like bizarre and people may think that


---------94:12----------
oh at least getting a nursing degree is


---------94:14----------
better than not finishing a nursing


---------94:16----------
degree to which I would ask you like we


---------94:18----------
remember that it's not really better or


---------94:19----------
worse it's just like is it better to


---------94:21----------
fully finish a nursing degree if you're


---------94:23----------
not going to be a nurse


---------94:24----------
or better to abandon it and halfway yeah


---------94:27----------
that's a yeah so in terms of what to do


---------94:30----------
for hagatha I'd say eat warm foods of


---------94:34----------
like medium moisture make sure your


---------94:37----------
bowel movements are somewhat regular


---------94:39----------
make sure you're not constipated and you


---------94:41----------
want them to be a little bit yeah so


---------94:43----------
like warm foods is the most important


---------94:45----------
things you want to eat things that are


---------94:47----------
sour so sour fruits are gonna be very


---------94:49----------
good for you okay yeah I eat a lot of


---------94:52----------
mango as is good just naturally so-so


---------94:56----------
mango so actually you should do citrus


---------94:58----------
instead of mango so mango is kind of


---------95:00----------
creamy okay right so like you want foods


---------95:04----------
that are a little bit lighter than that


---------95:06----------
so mango actually increases Scotland


---------95:08----------
because it's like thinking creamy


---------95:10----------
pudding mango avocado these are fruits


---------95:14----------
like so pomegranate citrus those are


---------95:16----------
better tart fruits for you okay


---------95:19----------
berries also good


---------95:22----------
I mean mangoes look good for you but I


---------95:24----------
rather would say you can get a little


---------95:25----------
bit of mileage yeah there's yeah mango


---------95:28----------
and marijuana go together though yeah


---------95:30----------
yeah okay so great question and then I I


---------95:34----------
mean I need to do like more Ayurvedic


---------95:36----------
stuff about what you guys should do if


---------95:38----------
you have jobs I I love it because it's


---------95:41----------
just like I'm from the western side of


---------95:44----------
like the spectrum and how we like look


---------95:46----------
at medicine and then I see the eastern


---------95:48----------
kind of like take on it and it's not


---------95:50----------
that like I feel like oh this is very


---------95:52----------
weird and abstract and it's not true I


---------95:55----------
just feel like they have a different


---------95:56----------
context of like realizing things that


---------95:59----------
like Western medicine want because


---------96:01----------
they're they can't make the same leaps


---------96:03----------
and bounds yeah so it's just a different


---------96:06----------
kind of setup yeah and I I appreciate it


---------96:13----------
though like I like the whole the system


---------96:15----------
it's really like interesting to me


---------96:20----------
okay I have a meditation practice for


---------96:23----------
you sure ah you're gonna get you're so


---------96:26----------
screwed okay so I don't want you to sit


---------96:29----------
up straight all right okay it's gonna be


---------96:34----------
so simple and so hard so sit up straight


---------96:37----------
close your eyes and I want you to


---------96:40----------
observe your breath


---------96:51----------
so I want you to breathe three breaths


---------96:54----------
with full observation now as you observe


---------97:01----------
the breath is it changing are you


---------97:04----------
controlling it


---------97:05----------
um I follow it from like my lungs and I


---------97:11----------
feel it pass through all my Airways I


---------97:14----------
just feel it okay close close your eyes


---------97:17----------
yeah so is the rate or depth of your


---------97:21----------
breathing changing once you start to


---------97:23----------
observe it are you breathing differently


---------97:25----------
now that you're observing it yes okay I


---------97:27----------
want you to stop stop changing the


---------97:31----------
breath just observe it without changing


---------97:35----------
it


---------97:36----------
breathe exactly like you were while


---------97:39----------
we've been talking okay yeah all right


---------97:58----------
don't slow it down don't deepen it


---------98:07----------
don't make it artificially shallow see


---------98:14----------
it's really it's kind of a having a hard


---------98:16----------
time cuz I don't know if the problem is


---------98:18----------
I'm trying to breathe normally and I'm


---------98:20----------
trying something and I think that's tied


---------98:22----------
into this meditation technique I see


---------98:24----------
what you you're doing so do it close


---------98:28----------
your eyes this is really hard for me


---------98:30----------
okay


---------98:55----------
how's it working this is really hard


---------98:58----------
good that means you're doing it right


---------99:01----------
it's it's because like the first


---------99:03----------
instinct I have is to think how do i how


---------99:06----------
do I breathe normally what is my normal


---------99:07----------
breath pattern like but the problem is


---------99:09----------
it's like it's kind of like a


---------99:11----------
Schrodinger's cat thing cuz you don't


---------99:13----------
know like you'll never ya know hold on


---------99:18----------
so now let's think you're doing it right


---------99:21----------
so now tell so what first of all what's


---------99:23----------
Schrodinger's cat thing explain yourself


---------99:25----------
because I keep on cutting you off so it


---------99:27----------
it's like a talking about the observer


---------99:29----------
effect in like under like they use it


---------99:33----------
it's like an example to explain like


---------99:35----------
quantum phenomenon or shenanigans like


---------99:37----------
that but essentially the the cat inside


---------99:43----------
is in a state of like either being alive


---------99:46----------
or dead and the observer effect is view


---------99:50----------
opening that box and realizing what it


---------99:52----------
is but at the same time like you could


---------99:54----------
never know that possibility without


---------99:56----------
observing it so I think that's analogous


---------100:02----------
to this meditation exercise because I


---------100:04----------
will never truly know what my normal


---------100:07----------
breathing pattern is because in


---------100:10----------
observing it I am actually tainting the


---------100:12----------
experiment mm-hmm so what I'm hearing


---------100:16----------
from you is that you can't observe


---------100:17----------
without exerting at least a tiny bit of


---------100:20----------
control yes so what do you think and


---------100:24----------
then you were also kind of talking about


---------100:26----------
not knowing what your normal breathing


---------100:27----------
pattern is yeah because it's like I so


---------100:31----------
what what should you do about that


---------100:43----------
I kind of like one a shortcut the whole


---------100:45----------
thing and just not think about the


---------100:47----------
breathing at all okay what is that mean


---------100:50----------
that means like the because I feel like


---------100:56----------
I'll never truly be able to observe a


---------100:58----------
normal breath because that lingering


---------101:01----------
doubt of whether or not I'm exerting


---------101:03----------
control good a situation good so you've


---------101:06----------
leveled up beautifully done so now


---------101:08----------
you're ready for the second part of the


---------101:10----------
technique which you did very good so now


---------101:13----------
I'm gonna frame it for you a little bit


---------101:15----------
okay so the first is that you should do


---------101:17----------
this technique in two ways one is to sit


---------101:20----------
and do it with your eyes closed and the


---------101:23----------
second is to sneak attack it so huh like


---------101:29----------
so throughout the day see if you can


---------101:31----------
catch your breath and observe it without


---------101:33----------
it noticing that you're looking see if


---------101:37----------
you can notice it without changing there


---------101:40----------
but it's got to be a sneak attack


---------101:41----------
because if you start to observe it it's


---------101:44----------
gonna change so sneak attack it and do


---------101:48----------
both and see what you could figure out


---------101:51----------
very cool I like it


---------101:54----------
it'll reinforce that mental thought


---------101:56----------
process of being able to let go


---------101:58----------
hopefully yes yes right it'll also


---------102:03----------
reinforce the thought process of you


---------102:06----------
catching yourself throughout the day and


---------102:08----------
noticing what's going on inside you


---------102:11----------
right so it's to hold an awareness of


---------102:15----------
what you're looking for throughout your


---------102:16----------
day and once you can once you start


---------102:20----------
sneak attacking the breath and trying to


---------102:21----------
catch it here there you can also also be


---------102:24----------
on the lookout for the feeling of


---------102:27----------
unluckiness


---------102:32----------
good luck ma'am yep thank you again for


---------102:35----------
having me take care thanks for being on


---------102:39----------
here okay


---------102:58----------
all right


---------103:00----------
so I don't know if I I hope he's not


---------103:09----------
watching okay so oh gee if you're


---------103:12----------
watching you have to stop watching


---------103:13----------
actually and I won't say all right let's


---------103:17----------
see what do we want to do now do you


---------103:18----------
want to do to have time for a question


---------103:20----------
but maybe not let's see if we can hold


---------103:22----------
on see if we can oh yeah okay great hey


---------103:31----------
we have time for a question - yeah sure


---------103:35----------
let's do it let's do questions you know


---------103:41----------
yo man what's up what's up so I have to


---------103:46----------
get to kill questions so the first one


---------103:49----------
is or do we approach this situation in


---------103:52----------
different ways when we feel stuck in


---------103:55----------
life where we we should start and if we


---------104:01----------
should adopt new ways of thinking or


---------104:03----------
reflecting that's the first one so how


---------104:07----------
do you approach feeling stuck in life


---------104:10----------
yeah well so I think that depends a


---------104:14----------
little bit about how you're stuck but


---------104:17----------
I'd say the first thing you know the


---------104:19----------
takeaway from this week is that a lot of


---------104:21----------
people are not stuck because of what


---------104:23----------
life gives them but because of what they


---------104:26----------
put on themselves good right so the


---------104:31----------
first thing is like what is your


---------104:32----------
contribution to being stuck and should


---------104:36----------
you change your thinking


---------104:37----------
absolutely and oftentimes you want to


---------104:39----------
change it in kind of like the way that


---------104:42----------
like if you've been thinking that


---------104:44----------
there's this particular way to get out


---------104:45----------
of being stuck like let's say you don't


---------104:47----------
have any money and you're your thought


---------104:49----------
is like you know I need to get a job I


---------104:52----------
need to get a job I need to get a job


---------104:54----------
like if you're still stuck after having


---------104:56----------
that thought that you need to get a job


---------104:57----------
you need to maybe have a different kind


---------105:00----------
of thought so like just imagine take


---------105:01----------
getting a job off the table and asking


---------105:04----------
yourself like okay how do I get money


---------105:06----------
like if like it's not just about getting


---------105:08----------
a job like where else can I start to


---------105:10----------
move forward because if your mind has


---------105:13----------
come up with some


---------105:14----------
and those haven't worked for you is


---------105:16----------
logical as they may seem just let go get


---------105:18----------
solution okay so the second question is


---------105:26----------
oh do I make fenugreek seeds tastes


---------105:31----------
better because when I drink sometimes


---------105:34----------
seeds with water in the morning huh I


---------105:38----------
need to make look lots of effort to


---------105:42----------
drink it because it that stays yeah so


---------105:47----------
I'm sorry what was your question so


---------105:49----------
fenugreek seeds tastes bad or water


---------105:51----------
tastes good no fenugreek this bed or how


---------105:57----------
can I make it this but you can't make it


---------105:59----------
taste better


---------106:00----------
why do you want it to taste better so I


---------106:02----------
can drink it more often


---------106:05----------
why can't you drink it because it tastes


---------106:06----------
bad yeah because it's are hard to


---------106:15----------
swallow so or you soak them overnight so


---------106:20----------
they're soft yeah okay but taste my


---------106:25----------
teeth are do you chew them sometimes


---------106:29----------
okay so if you chew them they're gonna


---------106:31----------
be better but like my bigger question to


---------106:34----------
you what's your name buddy no no Sonu no


---------106:37----------
why is it that you let things that you


---------106:41----------
don't enjoy control your actions it's


---------106:46----------
already done you could be so why is it


---------106:49----------
that like something tasting bad keeps


---------106:51----------
you from doing it why can't you eat


---------106:53----------
things that taste bad yeah because I


---------106:57----------
don't know I have to think about it good


---------107:01----------
then think about it that's exactly what


---------107:02----------
I want you to do so this is I have a


---------107:04----------
meditation practice for you today you


---------107:05----------
know okay what do you have in your house


---------107:08----------
that you don't like to eat what those


---------107:11----------
things like what like doubles like it


---------107:15----------
fell that's and things like do you have


---------107:17----------
like something in your house right now


---------107:19----------
that you can go pick up and eat and put


---------107:21----------
into your mouth I think so okay


---------107:28----------
so go and eat that thing go go do it now


---------107:32----------
and then don't ask yourself yeah so like


---------107:35----------
I'm gonna tell you what to do so I want


---------107:37----------
you to ask yourself like what is it


---------107:40----------
about this that I don't enjoy and can I


---------107:42----------
do this or does the lack of enjoyment


---------107:45----------
like hold me back from doing it because


---------107:50----------
the reason that your stock may be very


---------107:52----------
very different from the reason that og


---------107:56----------
is stuck and also the same because it


---------107:58----------
sounds like you don't let yourself do


---------108:00----------
things that you don't enjoy and if you


---------108:04----------
could do the things that you don't enjoy


---------108:06----------
then you wouldn't be stuck anymore so it


---------108:09----------
is you that's holding yourself back


---------108:11----------
because you don't like something like


---------108:14----------
you're not gonna move anywhere in life


---------108:16----------
if you don't do things that you don't


---------108:18----------
like if you can free yourself of being


---------108:21----------
restricted by the things that you like


---------108:24----------
too then life becomes really really easy


---------108:27----------
yeah so go and eat and for those of you


---------108:33----------
at home I want you guys to spend as long


---------108:35----------
as you can eating things that are a


---------108:38----------
balanced diet and also the things that


---------108:40----------
you liked the least so the next time


---------108:43----------
that you make a meal or you good I mean


---------108:45----------
no one's going to restaurants nowadays


---------108:46----------
but let's say you go and pick up food


---------108:47----------
you're gonna order food right if you go


---------108:50----------
and get takeout you're gonna have


---------108:51----------
options between things that you like and


---------108:53----------
things that you don't like and the funny


---------108:55----------
thing about us is we always order the


---------108:57----------
things that we like so I want you guys


---------108:59----------
to practice ordering the things that you


---------109:03----------
don't like or eating the things that you


---------109:06----------
don't like okay and if you get good if


---------109:10----------
the things that you don't like no longer


---------109:12----------
control you then how would your life


---------109:15----------
change you know do you have any idea


---------109:17----------
yeah I think I would be morality like


---------109:24----------
and a lot of things I can take like


---------109:28----------
sometimes I I don't like to study but I


---------109:32----------
need to do it but if I could just


---------109:35----------
observe the feeling of not liking to


---------109:39----------
study I think


---------109:41----------
I could study for example good so


---------109:46----------
there's a there's actually like a pretty


---------109:48----------
extreme meditative practice called a


---------109:51----------
gory sadhana so sadhana means spiritual


---------109:54----------
practice gore means fear and aghori


---------109:58----------
means no fear so these are people that


---------110:01----------
as part of their spiritual practice do


---------110:05----------
not let fear control what they do so


---------110:09----------
they live in cemeteries practice


---------110:12----------
cannibalism in all kinds of other weird


---------110:13----------
[ __ ] they tend to be like pretty


---------110:15----------
infamous but there's like a spiritual


---------110:18----------
practice that kind of says that like if


---------110:20----------
you want control over yourself you have


---------110:23----------
to do things that you sort of find


---------110:25----------
repulsive I'm not saying that you guys


---------110:27----------
should do things that you find repulsive


---------110:29----------
but I'm saying that like think about how


---------110:31----------
bad you how much your life is restricted


---------110:34----------
by the things that you like or don't


---------110:37----------
like and if you could remove that if you


---------110:39----------
could like everything equally and


---------110:41----------
playing a video game was no different


---------110:43----------
from studying imagine what you could


---------110:45----------
accomplish yeah and if you want to start


---------110:49----------
walking that road


---------110:50----------
it starts with little little things like


---------110:52----------
ordering the food that you like the


---------110:53----------
least on the menu that's very true


---------110:59----------
good luck man ready for next


---------111:11----------
it is difficult


---------111:13----------
[Music]


---------111:15----------
hello hey time hey dr. K I was wondering


---------111:22----------
if your body can become addicted to a


---------111:25----------
certain emotion


---------111:26----------
oh that's an interesting question what


---------111:32----------
do you think well we see addiction


---------111:39----------
addiction the behavior right is usually


---------111:46----------
triggered by the lack of emotion in the


---------111:52----------
when you are young or something like


---------111:54----------
that right we're basically reacting to a


---------111:58----------
sense car so but but there is like


---------112:03----------
addiction to alcohol so we're when


---------112:07----------
people try to go cold turkey or alcohol


---------112:12----------
the the body reacts right because yeah


---------112:18----------
it needs that alcohol it has been for


---------112:22----------
functioning for so long with the


---------112:25----------
substance the body that basically needs


---------112:29----------
to stay alive so if you have been like


---------112:33----------
[ __ ] touch our co-workers or said like


---------112:36----------
that you made become addicted to that


---------112:40----------
you don't pay off that you get for the


---------112:44----------
[ __ ] talk or whatever yeah so I mean


---------112:48----------
that makes sense to me so I wouldn't


---------112:50----------
really call that an addiction but let me


---------112:54----------
just try to clarify a couple of terms so


---------112:56----------
I I think everything you said makes


---------112:57----------
sense


---------112:58----------
the first thing is that I don't think


---------112:59----------
that people use addictive behaviors when


---------113:03----------
they're not feeling anything


---------113:05----------
I think they usually use addictive


---------113:07----------
behaviors when they are feeling


---------113:08----------
something negative because the addictive


---------113:10----------
behavior takes away the feeling of


---------113:13----------
negativity so oh gee like sometimes


---------113:15----------
engages in sexual relationships or


---------113:17----------
people use substances because they feel


---------113:19----------
sad or lonely or on law


---------113:21----------
or whatever with me I think a lot of


---------113:24----------
times you aren't aware of what the


---------113:26----------
emotion is but usually I think about


---------113:28----------
addictive behaviors as making bad


---------113:31----------
emotions go away all right with me or


---------113:37----------
not with me yeah yeah it's coping quiet


---------113:42----------
yep exactly that's a great way to put


---------113:44----------
describe addiction now so then your


---------113:47----------
question is like can your body be


---------113:49----------
addicted to certain feelings and I mean


---------113:51----------
I I was kind of envisioning like sitting


---------113:54----------
in a chair like can I get addicted to


---------113:55----------
sitting in a chair I mean the short


---------113:58----------
answer is sort of like I don't know if


---------114:01----------
it's really an addiction but I think


---------114:04----------
that generally speaking the mind and


---------114:06----------
body are drawn to things that satisfy


---------114:08----------
certain needs


---------114:10----------
so shit-talking your coworkers I


---------114:12----------
wouldn't really call that an addiction I


---------114:14----------
would call that like satisfying your ego


---------114:17----------
and you could call satisfaction of ego


---------114:20----------
your addiction but that sounds like so


---------114:21----------
you can definitely have repetitive


---------114:24----------
behaviors that create common feelings in


---------114:27----------
your body I just don't know that I would


---------114:29----------
quite classify that as an addiction does


---------114:35----------
that make sense


---------114:35----------
like I think it makes sense that you


---------114:37----------
would frequently shit-talk your


---------114:39----------
coworkers because you feel better and


---------114:41----------
then you will you will seek that feeling


---------114:43----------
better over and over and over again but


---------114:45----------
in my mind like even though those two


---------114:47----------
things sound the same I feel like there


---------114:49----------
are different words to describe those


---------114:50----------
one word just hasn't been invented yet


---------114:53----------
but I think though like the mechanism of


---------114:56----------
addiction and the mechanism of ego is


---------114:59----------
being like separate neurological


---------115:00----------
pathways like there are different parts


---------115:03----------
of the brain ok but like emotions right


---------115:11----------
like they'd be a collagen right sure and


---------115:18----------
like we have so much cortisol so much


---------115:24----------
stuff so can we get it like addicted to


---------115:30----------
that cortisol level it takes behavior


---------115:35----------
to reach that that cortisol like get


---------115:39----------
stressed purpose yes sort of but once


---------115:43----------
again I wouldn't quite use the word


---------115:45----------
addiction because addiction means a


---------115:47----------
specific thing neuro scientifically so


---------115:49----------
but can you get into patterns where you


---------115:52----------
like so like there are adrenaline


---------115:53----------
junkies right so adrenaline junkies are


---------115:56----------
in a sense addicted to certain kinds of


---------115:59----------
behaviors because they like the feeling


---------116:02----------
of like adrenaline pumping through their


---------116:03----------
veins


---------116:04----------
so reward so I would call it reward


---------116:08----------
chasing as opposed to addiction because


---------116:10----------
reward chasing involves like under if we


---------116:14----------
talk about reward chasing addiction is


---------116:17----------
on you know all addictions are reward


---------116:20----------
chasing but not all reward chasing is an


---------116:22----------
addiction oh I see you know got it so


---------116:27----------
like I don't yet I mean just because I


---------116:29----------
love to play a video game


---------116:31----------
doesn't mean that I'm addicted to a


---------116:32----------
video game even though I like that


---------116:34----------
feeling like I mean I recently I've been


---------116:36----------
talking about deep rock collective cuz


---------116:37----------
that's what I've been playing because I


---------116:38----------
can play for like 25 minutes at a time


---------116:40----------
which is nice cuz I have kids but like I


---------116:42----------
like to play it I enjoy it because we


---------116:45----------
definitely have reward circuitry that


---------116:47----------
reinforces behaviors but not all reward


---------116:50----------
circuitry that reinforces a behavior is


---------116:52----------
an addiction but can people do people


---------116:55----------
want to engage in a behavior that


---------116:57----------
rewards them in a particular way whether


---------116:59----------
it be physiologic or psychological


---------117:03----------
absolutely or their hormones involved


---------117:05----------
absolutely can you get can you want to


---------117:09----------
[ __ ] talk your coworkers because it


---------117:11----------
makes you feel good like in making pumps


---------117:13----------
up your ego absolutely do people do that


---------117:15----------
kind of [ __ ] every day does it kind of


---------117:17----------
look like an addiction absolutely but I


---------117:20----------
would still say that neuroscientific Lee


---------117:22----------
the mechanisms the circuits in the brain


---------117:23----------
that are activating are different and


---------117:27----------
then the circuits that activate during


---------117:28----------
addiction okay cool thanks yeah great


---------117:33----------
question man thank you
