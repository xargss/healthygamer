---------00:00----------
if you decide okay so if religion is can


---------00:01----------
be good for my mental health but like


---------00:03----------
what if i'm not religious does that mean


---------00:04----------
i mean i need to become religious i'd


---------00:06----------
say absolutely not you do not need to


---------00:07----------
become religious


---------00:09----------
if you are you know not religiously


---------00:11----------
inclined then here are the things that


---------00:13----------
you should do all right


---------00:15----------
so parents blame mental health problems


---------00:17----------
on lack of religious faith so hello hg


---------00:20----------
community and thank you for being an


---------00:22----------
open place to discuss things good job


---------00:24----------
everyone at hg


---------00:26----------
for as long as i remember i have had


---------00:28----------
problems with my mental health it has


---------00:29----------
been especially hard during the time


---------00:31----------
where i have been away from parents to


---------00:32----------
complete studies whenever i try to have


---------00:35----------
this conversation with my parents on my


---------00:36----------
declining mental health my parents


---------00:38----------
especially my father makes it a point


---------00:40----------
that this decline has been in large part


---------00:42----------
due to me not taking my religion


---------00:44----------
seriously islam


---------00:45----------
and i should just pray and be more pious


---------00:48----------
now i understand where he's coming from


---------00:50----------
he was born during a time of war and


---------00:52----------
revolution in my country of origin and


---------00:54----------
he got to where he is despite those


---------00:56----------
circumstances through a strong spiritual


---------00:58----------
faith as a result whenever he says this


---------01:01----------
to me instead of feeling better i just


---------01:02----------
feel ashamed and guilty because i'm not


---------01:05----------
pious or mentally strong


---------01:07----------
as he is


---------01:09----------
i do admit i have some doubts and


---------01:10----------
negative feelings towards my religion


---------01:13----------
and have not been practicing my faith


---------01:14----------
much because it brings about a pain a


---------01:17----------
lot of painful memories because in my


---------01:19----------
country it was used as a tool of control


---------01:21----------
and oppression


---------01:22----------
i still don't know where i stand


---------01:23----------
regarding religion


---------01:25----------
in large part because i feel like i have


---------01:27----------
not had the time to explore what it


---------01:28----------
means to to me and to separate it from


---------01:30----------
the negative ways it's been used to


---------01:32----------
control and make people miserable


---------01:34----------
how should i reignite the threat of


---------01:36----------
discussion with my parents in a fruitful


---------01:38----------
way


---------01:40----------
sorry for the long post and thank you


---------01:41----------
for reading if you did


---------01:43----------
okay


---------01:44----------
so i think this is a really really


---------01:45----------
important post


---------01:47----------
um and there are a couple of things that


---------01:48----------
i want to start with which are actually


---------01:50----------
disclaimers of sort and just like


---------01:52----------
setting some ground rules so i


---------01:54----------
understand that religion can be quite a


---------01:55----------
divisive topic right so we touched on


---------01:57----------
one or two of those back in 2021 and i


---------01:59----------
guess we haven't learned our lesson yet


---------02:01----------
so here we go


---------02:03----------
so we're going to talk a little bit


---------02:04----------
about religion and mental health today


---------02:07----------
i want to lay out a couple of


---------02:08----------
disclaimers so the first is that i'm not


---------02:10----------
an expert on religion i'm not a


---------02:11----------
religious scholar i don't really know


---------02:13----------
you know


---------02:15----------
it's not my field of expertise


---------02:18----------
uh that being said i have spent a lot of


---------02:21----------
time exploring religion so i grew up


---------02:22----------
going to a catholic school i'm pretty


---------02:24----------
familiar with christianity and


---------02:25----------
catholicism


---------02:27----------
you know and then also like went through


---------02:28----------
my own journey i grew up hindu


---------02:31----------
but was basically agnostic or atheistic


---------02:33----------
for like most of my life


---------02:35----------
are not most now because i'm older and


---------02:37----------
then sort of rediscovered a a love for


---------02:40----------
karmic religions for lack of a better


---------02:42----------
term so this sort of includes hinduism


---------02:44----------
buddhism jainism


---------02:46----------
um eastern religions is another way to


---------02:48----------
put out once i understood what they were


---------02:49----------
actually saying


---------02:51----------
and so there may be a bias there because


---------02:54----------
i have you know explored a lot of


---------02:55----------
different religions and sort of decided


---------02:58----------
on a particular spiritual path which


---------03:00----------
suits me so apologies if it comes across


---------03:02----------
as biased in that way


---------03:06----------
and the last thing is that i think that


---------03:07----------
this is the reason i'm sort of bringing


---------03:09----------
it up is because i think that this is an


---------03:10----------
important thing to talk about because a


---------03:12----------
lot of the world is religious and what's


---------03:14----------
the relationship between religion and


---------03:16----------
mental health so i'd like to approach


---------03:18----------
this in the way that we do at other


---------03:19----------
things at hg which is like let's just


---------03:20----------
kind of like look at it pretty


---------03:22----------
critically and analytically and try to


---------03:24----------
understand does religion have a positive


---------03:26----------
impact on mental health negative impact


---------03:27----------
on mental health and if it does have a


---------03:29----------
positive or negative impact what are the


---------03:31----------
reasons for that what are the mechanisms


---------03:33----------
for it


---------03:34----------
and so i think what we'll sort of


---------03:35----------
discover is actually pretty cool okay


---------03:38----------
so the first thing that we're going to


---------03:39----------
talk about


---------03:42----------
is i know it sounds kind of weird before


---------03:43----------
we get into religion


---------03:46----------
what


---------03:47----------
improves


---------03:48----------
mental health


---------03:53----------
okay so there are all kinds of things


---------03:54----------
that contribute to your mental health


---------03:56----------
like physical health diet et cetera


---------03:58----------
but we're what we're going to start by


---------03:59----------
focusing on


---------04:01----------
is actually


---------04:02----------
something called common factors research


---------04:05----------
so


---------04:05----------
some time ago there was one form of


---------04:08----------
essentially psychotherapy


---------04:10----------
um and that form was psychoanalysis was


---------04:14----------
discovered by like freud and yung and


---------04:16----------
those people and then over time


---------04:18----------
psychoanalysis


---------04:19----------
became


---------04:24----------
psychotherapy


---------04:26----------
or psychodynamic


---------04:30----------
psychotherapy


---------04:33----------
and then like over time like we had this


---------04:34----------
group of behaviorists that developed


---------04:37----------
cognitive behavioral therapy oh no


---------04:40----------
we're lagging


---------04:42----------
and then someone who was learned cbt and


---------04:44----------
psychotherapy learned how to meditate


---------04:47----------
and they're like hey this is cool


---------04:49----------
and they developed dialectical


---------04:51----------
behavioral therapy and i can see that


---------04:52----------
we're lagging so i'm gonna just


---------04:55----------
i guess i'm just going to talk


---------04:57----------
oh no there it goes


---------04:59----------
okay


---------05:01----------
and so then what we sort of discovered


---------05:03----------
is that there's a bunch of different


---------05:04----------
types of psychotherapy right so like and


---------05:06----------
they're quite different so uh oh


---------05:08----------
so cognitive behavioral therapy is very


---------05:10----------
different from dbt because like this has


---------05:12----------
a mindfulness component psychodynamic


---------05:14----------
psychotherapy is similar to


---------05:15----------
psychoanalysis so it's like quite


---------05:17----------
different


---------05:18----------
and so people sat down and they started


---------05:20----------
to figure out okay like which one of


---------05:21----------
these is best because they're very


---------05:22----------
different in one we're talking about


---------05:24----------
your your your you know your dreams


---------05:27----------
we're anal we're doing dream analysis


---------05:29----------
like this is over here


---------05:32----------
like dream analysis is like quite


---------05:34----------
different from meditation


---------05:36----------
which is like quite different from doing


---------05:38----------
like worksheets


---------05:40----------
about your feelings


---------05:44----------
so these are all very different which


---------05:46----------
one's the best


---------05:48----------
so as people started to compare


---------05:49----------
different things


---------05:50----------
what they sort of discovered is they're


---------05:52----------
all about the same


---------05:54----------
and then that got really confusing


---------05:55----------
because it's like how is like how does


---------05:57----------
meditation offer the same benefit


---------06:00----------
as something like dream analysis like


---------06:02----------
how the hell does that even work like


---------06:04----------
how can these things essentially


---------06:06----------
give you the same benefit like that


---------06:08----------
doesn't make any sense because they're


---------06:09----------
so different


---------06:10----------
and so what people sort of started


---------06:12----------
looking at is something called common


---------06:13----------
factors research and this ipad thing is


---------06:15----------
lacking lagging so we're gonna just


---------06:19----------
go old school lecture style okay


---------06:22----------
so they looked at common factors


---------06:24----------
research and essentially what they


---------06:25----------
figured out is that oh it's not actually


---------06:27----------
any one of these particular things but


---------06:29----------
there's a set of common factors that


---------06:32----------
will determine whether something is


---------06:34----------
mentally like helps your mental health


---------06:36----------
or doesn't help your mental health


---------06:39----------
so there are two or three big things


---------06:40----------
that they sort of discovered the first


---------06:42----------
is something called the therapeutic


---------06:43----------
alliance so you need to have someone


---------06:46----------
that you can trust and talk to


---------06:48----------
like that


---------06:49----------
that can like sort of handle your mental


---------06:51----------
things you need a consistent trusted


---------06:53----------
space to go to with your mental health


---------06:56----------
problems


---------06:57----------
the second thing that they discovered


---------06:58----------
was that you need an organizing


---------07:00----------
framework


---------07:01----------
so like the good therapists are not


---------07:03----------
necessarily it's not that cbt is like


---------07:05----------
more correct than psychoanalysis


---------07:07----------
or that dbt is more correct than cbt


---------07:11----------
it's that whoever is like teaching you


---------07:13----------
the stuff or whoever is offering mental


---------07:15----------
health support needs to have an


---------07:17----------
organizing framework that sort of


---------07:19----------
encompasses everything that we kind of


---------07:20----------
look at


---------07:22----------
and so this these were kind of two of


---------07:24----------
the really big things that they they


---------07:26----------
kind of discovered


---------07:28----------
so the interesting thing is that you


---------07:29----------
know back in the day


---------07:31----------
we didn't really have like an


---------07:33----------
appreciation for mental health so like


---------07:35----------
where did people go with their mental


---------07:36----------
health problems right so if i feel sad


---------07:39----------
or i lose a child and i'm going through


---------07:41----------
the grief process


---------07:43----------
who do i go to like help me make sense


---------07:46----------
of that because we've sort of discovered


---------07:47----------
through research that that's really


---------07:49----------
important for people who's like where's


---------07:51----------
like a place that organizes the way that


---------07:53----------
i view the world and a lens that that


---------07:57----------
that i can use to understand problems in


---------07:59----------
myself


---------08:00----------
and this used to be done through


---------08:02----------
religion right so like


---------08:04----------
that's what religion sort of did like if


---------08:06----------
you lose your kid like who do i turn to


---------08:07----------
like okay i'm gonna turn to like a


---------08:09----------
priest right so hopefully there's like a


---------08:11----------
strong therapeutic alliance there


---------08:13----------
there's a trusted person who has an


---------08:15----------
organizing framework that they can use


---------08:17----------
to like help me


---------08:19----------
navigate my problems and we even see


---------08:21----------
this from this particular poster that


---------08:23----------
this person's dad went through a very


---------08:25----------
you know tumultuous time in their life


---------08:27----------
that was not easy and religion sort of


---------08:29----------
gave them answers gave them a narrative


---------08:32----------
gave them maybe a trusted space


---------08:35----------
and so they used those kinds of things


---------08:37----------
to kind of like navigate their life and


---------08:39----------
get some kind of mental strength and


---------08:40----------
fortitude so that sort of makes sense


---------08:43----------
right so like if you kind of look at it


---------08:45----------
that way religion sort of touches on a


---------08:47----------
couple of the parts of common factors


---------08:49----------
research


---------08:50----------
okay


---------08:52----------
so


---------08:53----------
you know what do we need we need a


---------08:55----------
therapeutic alliance


---------09:01----------
and then we need an organizing framework


---------09:05----------
and in the past this is where we you


---------09:07----------
know religion used to do these two


---------09:08----------
things so a couple of other big things


---------09:10----------
that are very very important


---------09:13----------
that religion does for us one is it


---------09:14----------
gives us a sense of community or social


---------09:16----------
capital


---------09:20----------
there have been numerous studies that


---------09:22----------
show that social interactions and social


---------09:25----------
capital are good for mental health


---------09:28----------
right so like isolation makes mental


---------09:30----------
health problems worse


---------09:32----------
community makes mental health problems


---------09:33----------
better we have like a shared group of


---------09:35----------
people that we can like survive with or


---------09:38----------
process things with right so we see this


---------09:40----------
a lot for example with like the jewish


---------09:42----------
diaspora where there's like a very very


---------09:44----------
strong sense of like community and like


---------09:46----------
an almost us versus them kind of


---------09:48----------
mentality which has downsides


---------09:50----------
but that strong social connection we see


---------09:52----------
this a lot also amongst like you know


---------09:54----------
indian diaspora too so like indians and


---------09:56----------
hindus like we all hang out with each


---------09:58----------
other right because this is like our


---------10:00----------
shared culture it's our religion so we


---------10:02----------
have a strong sense of community at


---------10:03----------
least where i live


---------10:05----------
and we kind of all get together and


---------10:06----------
these have positive impacts on mental


---------10:08----------
health so religion kind of offers you


---------10:10----------
know a safe space theoretically


---------10:13----------
where people you can trust


---------10:16----------
religion offers definitely offers an


---------10:17----------
organizing framework right depending on


---------10:19----------
which religion you believe in stuff like


---------10:20----------
heaven hell


---------10:24----------
sin good bad


---------10:28----------
et cetera like it just gives us lots of


---------10:30----------
like ways to view the world why does a


---------10:32----------
bad thing happen to me well because


---------10:34----------
religion will give you an answer


---------10:36----------
and i'll say because of this and that it


---------10:37----------
definitely offers a sense of community


---------10:39----------
right and then there are two other


---------10:41----------
things that i think are really really


---------10:42----------
important that religion offers


---------10:46----------
one is sublimation of ego


---------10:51----------
so if you guys watch our streams a lot


---------10:53----------
you're gonna know that a lot of our


---------10:54----------
suffering comes from our ego ego isn't


---------10:56----------
all bad


---------10:58----------
but religion is essentially like


---------11:00----------
at least abrahamic religions tend to be


---------11:03----------
like very sublimating the ego oriented


---------11:06----------
so a good example of this is alcoholics


---------11:08----------
anonymous


---------11:10----------
so this is something i know a little bit


---------11:11----------
more about which is why i'm going to use


---------11:12----------
this as an example so alcoholics


---------11:15----------
anonymous is a very successful on the on


---------11:18----------
the whole a very successful organization


---------11:20----------
that helps people


---------11:22----------
gain sobriety there are some studies


---------11:24----------
that even suggest that alcoholics


---------11:26----------
anonymous is the most successful


---------11:28----------
intervention that someone can do that


---------11:31----------
will


---------11:32----------
has the greatest chance of becoming


---------11:34----------
having someone become sober there are


---------11:35----------
all kinds of caveats and problems with


---------11:37----------
that research but there's you can


---------11:38----------
definitely make the argument


---------11:41----------
so a big thing


---------11:42----------
that's kind of bizarre about alcoholics


---------11:44----------
anonymous is it starts


---------11:46----------
with the idea that i am powerless


---------11:51----------
in the face of my addiction


---------11:57----------
and that's weird


---------11:59----------
right like you'd think that we'd think


---------12:02----------
like logically that


---------12:03----------
you know if you want to overcome a


---------12:04----------
problem like we want to empower people


---------12:06----------
right like we want people to be like um


---------12:08----------
yeah like you can do it like you can you


---------12:11----------
can kick this habit like you're in


---------12:13----------
control like you can do it


---------12:16----------
and so alcoholics anonymous which is


---------12:17----------
very heavily uh founded by in christian


---------12:21----------
roots by the way so it's like it's very


---------12:22----------
religious so they believe in like higher


---------12:24----------
power and like a lot of christianity


---------12:26----------
like focus themes and stuff like that


---------12:27----------
which rubs people the wrong way if you


---------12:29----------
guys are not really into that refuge


---------12:31----------
recovery is a very good alternative so


---------12:33----------
that's like uh


---------12:35----------
has a lot of like fellowship and


---------12:36----------
community it was based more on buddhist


---------12:38----------
principles


---------12:39----------
so this is kind of weird right because


---------12:41----------
like alcoholics anonymous and


---------12:42----------
christianity will sort of say


---------12:44----------
this this is where i'm like i could be


---------12:46----------
misspeaking so apologies if i'm


---------12:48----------
offending people but like there's sort


---------12:49----------
of this idea that in the abrahamic


---------12:51----------
religions that god is all-powerful and


---------12:53----------
like you are not


---------12:54----------
right like that's a common in the


---------12:56----------
abrahamic religions is that god can like


---------12:58----------
do whatever they want to but like you as


---------12:59----------
a human being you don't have all the


---------13:00----------
power in the universe which is different


---------13:02----------
from the karmic religions because the


---------13:03----------
karmic religions actually sort of say


---------13:05----------
the opposite or even say that you are


---------13:07----------
one with god and you are just as


---------13:08----------
powerful as


---------13:10----------
divinity is or you are divine so that's


---------13:12----------
kind of different there


---------13:14----------
but since the person is kind of coming


---------13:15----------
from the tradition of islam and we're


---------13:17----------
you know we'll just use that as an


---------13:18----------
example so like if you kind of think


---------13:20----------
about it how is this sort of like ego


---------13:22----------
sublimation like how can this help with


---------13:24----------
mental health right


---------13:26----------
because this is a big part of you know


---------13:28----------
religion is sublimating your ego and


---------13:30----------
sort of like teaching you that god is


---------13:32----------
all-powerful and you are not and all


---------13:33----------
this kind of good stuff and so


---------13:35----------
alcoholics anonymous is a good example


---------13:36----------
of this because a big part of the


---------13:38----------
addict's brain


---------13:43----------
is


---------13:44----------
i can handle this


---------13:51----------
so when people kind of say this


---------13:54----------
right like like when your brain says i


---------13:57----------
can handle the i can handle it i'm in


---------13:58----------
control


---------14:03----------
it's this kind of thought


---------14:05----------
which is essentially coming from the ego


---------14:08----------
right this is coming from the ahamkara


---------14:10----------
or ego


---------14:11----------
and this is the thought that gets you in


---------14:13----------
trouble


---------14:14----------
so when you adopt like a sublimation of


---------14:16----------
the ego kind of attitude it actually


---------14:18----------
does seem to help in terms of kicking in


---------14:21----------
addiction there's good data for that and


---------14:23----------
i suspect that it helps too in terms of


---------14:25----------
like dealing with suffering right


---------14:26----------
because we know that ego is associated


---------14:28----------
with suffering and so we can sort of see


---------14:30----------
how okay so like if we're sublimating


---------14:33----------
the ego


---------14:34----------
you know we're going to decrease our


---------14:35----------
suffering


---------14:38----------
and this may in turn improve mental


---------14:39----------
health


---------14:40----------
there's also good data behind this as


---------14:42----------
well so if we look at the outcomes of


---------14:44----------
meditative practice which will sort of


---------14:46----------
you know sublimate the ego weaken the


---------14:48----------
ego and that seems to be correlated with


---------14:50----------
people like being happier because we


---------14:51----------
know that meditation improves mental


---------14:53----------
health


---------14:54----------
okay so that's another mechanism that


---------14:56----------
religion uses and the last mechanism


---------14:58----------
that we're going to talk about is that


---------14:59----------
religion does actually teach us


---------15:01----------
discipline of the mind


---------15:04----------
hopefully


---------15:05----------
we're going to talk about caveats in a


---------15:06----------
second so if we think about things like


---------15:08----------
saying hail mary's right


---------15:13----------
what we're literally doing is we're like


---------15:14----------
it's a darn technique so it's focusing


---------15:16----------
the mind


---------15:20----------
when we go to church every sunday we're


---------15:21----------
like sort of disciplining ourselves


---------15:24----------
because we got to go to church so you


---------15:26----------
could like you can't be a degenerate


---------15:27----------
like you got to get to church you got to


---------15:29----------
like get dressed up and you got to clean


---------15:30----------
yourself up and this and that right so


---------15:32----------
when you pray five times a day


---------15:37----------
that sort of improves your awareness


---------15:38----------
like you can't lose track of time


---------15:40----------
because you've got to pray five times a


---------15:41----------
day so a lot of like religion


---------15:44----------
has baked into it techniques like prayer


---------15:46----------
which involve like focusing the mind and


---------15:49----------
probably have health benefits as a


---------15:51----------
result


---------15:52----------
and so this is where things get a little


---------15:53----------
bit so so a lot of religion has actually


---------15:56----------
like stuff kind of baked in that results


---------15:58----------
in disciplining of the mind


---------16:00----------
so can religion help mental health


---------16:02----------
there's some studies that actually


---------16:03----------
suggest that religion and spirituality


---------16:05----------
actually religion can have positive


---------16:07----------
effects on mental health there are lots


---------16:08----------
of downsides to religion and mental


---------16:10----------
health as well


---------16:12----------
so for example this person is talking a


---------16:13----------
little bit about guilt


---------16:15----------
right so like i don't know where i stand


---------16:17----------
i feel ashamed and guilty so religion is


---------16:20----------
not necessarily a blanket or it's not


---------16:22----------
neces it's in no way


---------16:24----------
a blanket positive force for mental


---------16:26----------
health so there's a lot of like abuse of


---------16:29----------
power there's a lot of shame there's a


---------16:31----------
lot of guilt there's a lot of betrayal


---------16:33----------
of trust there's a lot of like bad


---------16:35----------
things that come out of humility of


---------16:38----------
religion so when we sublimate the ego


---------16:40----------
can that improve uh our suffering and


---------16:42----------
mental health yes but sublimation of the


---------16:44----------
ego also makes us right to be taken


---------16:47----------
advantage of


---------16:48----------
right because if i am like if i'm


---------16:50----------
powerless in the in the face of whatever


---------16:52----------
and there's like there's this this


---------16:54----------
priest is all-powerful and he says do


---------16:56----------
something then i should do that


---------16:58----------
right so there are definitely downsides


---------17:00----------
which can happen with religion


---------17:03----------
but there is some research that suggests


---------17:05----------
that religion can have positive impacts


---------17:06----------
on mental health and as we start to sort


---------17:08----------
of unpack what is it that religion does


---------17:11----------
like what are the mechanisms of religion


---------17:13----------
what we sort of discover is that i


---------17:14----------
haven't seen anything that suggests that


---------17:16----------
a particular religion is more correct


---------17:19----------
and or sorry more beneficial for mental


---------17:21----------
health than another religion i'm not an


---------17:23----------
expert in the research by the way


---------17:25----------
so i think what we can what i would


---------17:26----------
conclude sort of scientifically is that


---------17:28----------
it's not a particular religion and


---------17:30----------
actually this is also influenced by the


---------17:32----------
studies that i've done because patanjali


---------17:33----------
says this too so he says that you can


---------17:35----------
meditate and all this kind of stuff


---------17:37----------
that's fantastic you can attain


---------17:38----------
enlightenment that way but you can also


---------17:40----------
attain enlightenment through devotion


---------17:42----------
and surrender to god


---------17:43----------
and the key thing that patanjali doesn't


---------17:45----------
really explain in a whole lot of detail


---------17:47----------
because that's not what he talks about


---------17:49----------
but if you if you really like look at


---------17:50----------
some of these yogic texts what they say


---------17:51----------
is that it's not the god part that leads


---------17:54----------
to enlightenment it's the devotion and


---------17:56----------
surrender part so the god that you


---------17:58----------
surrender to doesn't matter it's not


---------18:00----------
like


---------18:01----------
this god will give you more spiritual


---------18:03----------
growth than that god now i recognize


---------18:05----------
that that is a


---------18:06----------
contentious statement for a lot of


---------18:07----------
people who insist that their god is the


---------18:09----------
better god and that's the one that you


---------18:10----------
should surrender to but what potentially


---------18:12----------
sort of said is that he's like the


---------18:14----------
important part is like the sublimation


---------18:16----------
of the ego and the devotion to an uh an


---------18:18----------
object


---------18:19----------
whether it's a particular god or it's an


---------18:21----------
ideal or whatever it's the devotion to


---------18:23----------
the thing that results in the spiritual


---------18:25----------
growth


---------18:26----------
and so what we can kind of see if we


---------18:28----------
sort of unpack religion is that there


---------18:30----------
are like five things that i think will


---------18:32----------
contribute to people's mental health


---------18:34----------
that religion or religious organizations


---------18:36----------
and religions tend to offer right and


---------18:38----------
this is where it's kind of like you do


---------18:39----------
you have to be religious to improve your


---------18:41----------
mental health absolutely not but i think


---------18:43----------
the advantage of religion is that it's


---------18:44----------
kind of like a combo meal right it's


---------18:46----------
like pre-packaged everything's sort of


---------18:47----------
set up for you so you kind of get


---------18:49----------
hopefully these things if you go to a


---------18:51----------
good religious place without like having


---------18:53----------
to structure them yourself because if


---------18:54----------
you don't want to go that route you're


---------18:56----------
just totally fine


---------18:58----------
then what i think it's important to do


---------18:59----------
is if you want to get these benefits


---------19:00----------
then you have to structure each of these


---------19:02----------
things yourself


---------19:03----------
right so you can go and order the combo


---------19:05----------
meal and you're going to get kind of


---------19:06----------
everything you need for one meal it's


---------19:07----------
going to be packaged right there's ups


---------19:10----------
and downs to that


---------19:12----------
but if you if you decide okay so if


---------19:13----------
religion is can be good for my mental


---------19:15----------
health but like what if i'm not


---------19:16----------
religious does that mean i mean i need


---------19:17----------
to become religious i'd say absolutely


---------19:19----------
not you do not need to become religious


---------19:21----------
if you are you know not religiously


---------19:24----------
inclined then here are the things that


---------19:26----------
you should do


---------19:27----------
so first


---------19:29----------
is find a trusted source


---------19:32----------
so this is where like i think mentorship


---------19:36----------
is critical here


---------19:37----------
right this can also be like a therapist


---------19:42----------
number two


---------19:44----------
figure out


---------19:46----------
how the world works


---------19:51----------
you need an organizing framework


---------19:53----------
so this is like kind of a tall ask like


---------19:55----------
this is the advantage of of religion


---------19:58----------
which is like they just tell you they're


---------20:00----------
like hey here's how it works we don't


---------20:02----------
have to believe them you don't have to


---------20:03----------
trust it whatever but if you're not


---------20:04----------
going to do that then you need to do the


---------20:05----------
work to figure out what is the


---------20:07----------
organizing principle or like what are


---------20:09----------
the organizing principles that i'm going


---------20:10----------
to use to make sense of like why crap


---------20:13----------
happens is it going to be science


---------20:16----------
is it going to be philosophy


---------20:21----------
is it going to be spirituality of like a


---------20:22----------
particular tradition


---------20:24----------
like meditation


---------20:29----------
right is it going to be like some kind


---------20:30----------
of like family cultural kind of thing


---------20:35----------
so whatever but you need some kind of


---------20:37----------
organizing framework right


---------20:40----------
next thing that you're going to need is


---------20:42----------
community


---------20:44----------
so if you want to meet people going to


---------20:46----------
church is a really really easy way to do


---------20:48----------
it right they're like people they're


---------20:49----------
generally speaking they tend to be


---------20:50----------
pretty nice


---------20:52----------
right so it's like a great form of like


---------20:53----------
social capital and community and stuff


---------20:55----------
like that


---------20:56----------
so if you don't have that you're going


---------20:57----------
to need to like find a community find


---------20:59----------
your tribe


---------21:05----------
number four


---------21:06----------
is sublimate the ego


---------21:11----------
so religion once again does it for you i


---------21:13----------
think sometimes they do it to the


---------21:14----------
detriment to people right when they


---------21:16----------
really browbeat you and


---------21:18----------
treat you with a lot of guilt and shame


---------21:19----------
i don't think that that's healthy


---------21:20----------
personally


---------21:21----------
so you can also get like ptsd and all


---------21:23----------
kinds of self-worth problems from the


---------21:25----------
wrong kind of religious interaction


---------21:27----------
so this too is hard but i think this you


---------21:29----------
can meditate


---------21:31----------
for lack of a better term


---------21:34----------
and then number five is


---------21:37----------
once again meditation and yoga


---------21:39----------
so you're going to need to learn like


---------21:40----------
discipline


---------21:43----------
and like you know


---------21:44----------
practices and stuff like that which is


---------21:46----------
tricky


---------21:48----------
but you know this is your substitute to


---------21:50----------
religion and i think what's starting to


---------21:52----------
happen part of the reason that we're


---------21:53----------
seeing a decline in religion


---------21:55----------
is because the things that religion


---------21:57----------
basically used to be only one that did


---------21:59----------
this stuff right so like a thousand


---------22:01----------
years ago like


---------22:04----------
science wasn't that well developed like


---------22:06----------
they couldn't really give us answers


---------22:07----------
about how the world works


---------22:09----------
um our our community and our tribe was


---------22:12----------
like tangled up with our religion


---------22:14----------
the way that we learned discipline and


---------22:15----------
the way that we learned to sublimate the


---------22:16----------
ego were like basically all that existed


---------22:19----------
was the combo meal because we just sort


---------22:21----------
of had we just didn't have options


---------22:23----------
and now as we're starting to learn more


---------22:25----------
about meditation as we're starting to


---------22:26----------
learn more about community and science


---------22:28----------
and things like that you don't need to


---------22:29----------
go to a religion to get the mental


---------22:31----------
benefits of religion anymore


---------22:34----------
now this once again is going to be a


---------22:35----------
bias view because i'm sure there are


---------22:36----------
going to be people out there who will


---------22:37----------
say that my religion by virtue of what


---------22:40----------
it is offers a significant benefit so


---------22:42----------
specifically like people will say like


---------22:44----------
you know believing in allah


---------22:51----------
like will help your depression that's


---------22:53----------
what this person's dad says


---------22:55----------
they're going to say that this is


---------22:56----------
different from believing in jesus that


---------22:58----------
allah has an effect that jesus does not


---------23:00----------
have


---------23:01----------
right so like that that's where some


---------23:02----------
people will say believing in jesus is


---------23:04----------
going to have an effect


---------23:06----------
even hindus will say that but i don't


---------23:07----------
really think that's what the hindu


---------23:08----------
religion says


---------23:10----------
um to the hindu religion part of what i


---------23:12----------
like about it is that they're sort of


---------23:13----------
like you can be atheistic and you can be


---------23:15----------
hindu you can be agnostic and you can be


---------23:17----------
hindu


---------23:18----------
it's a little bit more in my mind and


---------23:20----------
this could be where my bias is i really


---------23:22----------
don't think so but if you really look at


---------23:23----------
it objectively like if you look at the


---------23:24----------
religious texts of hinduism


---------23:27----------
the oldest religious texts are 25 music


---------23:30----------
theory


---------23:33----------
25


---------23:35----------
medicine


---------23:37----------
25 rituals


---------23:40----------
and 25 creation myths


---------23:46----------
and so you also have people like


---------23:47----------
patanjali are like you can believe in


---------23:48----------
god or like not believe in god


---------23:50----------
so


---------23:51----------
even the concept of hinduism is a


---------23:53----------
religion is sort of like false


---------23:55----------
like that idea of religion even the word


---------23:58----------
religion is like a judeo-christian


---------23:59----------
concept


---------24:01----------
when people ask


---------24:03----------
are you hindu like the r-u-a religion is


---------24:06----------
like a judeo-christian concept right


---------24:08----------
because the abrahamic religions were the


---------24:09----------
ones who sort of said there's like us


---------24:11----------
and not us there's like the people of


---------24:13----------
israel and there's like the not people


---------24:14----------
of israel they're like the ones who


---------24:17----------
believe in christ and like the ones who


---------24:18----------
don't believe in christ there's like you


---------24:21----------
know the infidels and the non-infidels


---------24:23----------
so that fundamental idea of owning to a


---------24:25----------
religion converting to a religion


---------24:27----------
believing in a religion that's actually


---------24:29----------
sort of like a western concept because


---------24:31----------
it's like how do you convert to buddhism


---------24:32----------
like you don't really can i mean sure


---------24:33----------
you can someone somewhere out there will


---------24:35----------
convert you to buddhism if you want to


---------24:37----------
they're going to be sex that will


---------24:38----------
convert people but it's not really like


---------24:40----------
buddha didn't


---------24:41----------
you know start like he wasn't saying


---------24:43----------
like you should believe what i say like


---------24:45----------
you that's he was just teaching stuff so


---------24:47----------
the karmic religions are quite different


---------24:49----------
in that way and that they they're sort


---------24:50----------
of just a collection of information and


---------24:52----------
what the karmic religions did they


---------24:54----------
didn't separate out spirituality from


---------24:55----------
the other things it's just like if you


---------24:56----------
go to university you can major in


---------24:58----------
religion and you can major in


---------24:59----------
mathematics it's no different it's not


---------25:01----------
like spirituality is like a different


---------25:03----------
thing


---------25:04----------
from science they're actually all


---------25:06----------
tangled together they're just different


---------25:07----------
sources of knowledge


---------25:09----------
and so if you look at for example karma


---------25:11----------
like karma is just the principle of


---------25:13----------
cause and fact in effect which is like


---------25:15----------
you know has physics applications and


---------25:16----------
has like non-physics applications


---------25:19----------
um which is why you know you have music


---------25:21----------
theory and medicine which are part of


---------25:22----------
the holy books because that's like the


---------25:24----------
idea of a holy book is also like alien


---------25:26----------
to hinduism there's like no such thing


---------25:28----------
as a holy book there's no bible in


---------25:29----------
hinduism there's like all kinds of texts


---------25:31----------
and you can sort of believe which one


---------25:33----------
you want


---------25:34----------
so it's a little bit more in my opinion


---------25:36----------
scientific but that that's probably


---------25:38----------
going to piss a lot of people off


---------25:39----------
because the idea that i say my religion


---------25:41----------
is more scientific than your religion is


---------25:43----------
like seeing you know as like a easy way


---------25:45----------
to piss people off but i really do think


---------25:46----------
that you know i i i haven't seen any you


---------25:49----------
know prescriptions for


---------25:51----------
malaria in the bible whereas you'll see


---------25:53----------
that in indian or hindu religious texts


---------25:58----------
right


---------26:00----------
yeah so this is the other thing is so


---------26:01----------
hexahorn is saying religious religion


---------26:03----------
equal scientific so in in the west we


---------26:06----------
view those things as like


---------26:08----------
contrary right we think of like religion


---------26:11----------
and science is like being on opposite


---------26:12----------
ends of the spectrum


---------26:14----------
but especially in the eastern religions


---------26:16----------
like if you read patanjali it's like


---------26:17----------
quite scientific like it's critical so


---------26:20----------
it also encourages you like


---------26:22----------
brahma sutra for example is like a text


---------26:25----------
that will teach you logic and will teach


---------26:27----------
you how to poke holes in arguments so


---------26:29----------
it's like a text on logic which is


---------26:30----------
generally considered like a religious


---------26:32----------
text by people in the west but in the


---------26:34----------
east it's just it's just


---------26:36----------
they just taught everything


---------26:37----------
so when you go to when you went to like


---------26:39----------
if you became like a monk for example


---------26:41----------
you had to learn medicine


---------26:42----------
like it was all part of the same


---------26:44----------
education so like all religious leaders


---------26:47----------
like were doctors and were trained in


---------26:49----------
surgery for example i mean that may not


---------26:51----------
be fair to say when i'm saying all


---------26:53----------
because i wasn't there


---------26:55----------
but it's just different


---------26:57----------
right so


---------26:58----------
so in


---------26:59----------
in short you know can religion have


---------27:01----------
positive effects on mental health i


---------27:03----------
think absolutely there's even data to


---------27:05----------
support that and at the same time it's


---------27:08----------
not like religion is the only source of


---------27:10----------
those kinds of things and if we start to


---------27:12----------
analyze a little bit about okay how does


---------27:14----------
religion improve our mental health what


---------27:17----------
we end up with is essentially five


---------27:19----------
factors right so there's a trusted safe


---------27:21----------
space which seems to be very very


---------27:23----------
important and from uh studies of


---------27:25----------
psychotherapy we sort of discover that


---------27:27----------
this is a key part of like


---------27:29----------
positive mental health outcomes


---------27:31----------
we also need an organizing framework so


---------27:33----------
whether it's dbt or cbt or psychodynamic


---------27:36----------
therapy or psychoanalysis it doesn't


---------27:38----------
really matter whether it's a hindu


---------27:39----------
worldview or the christian worldview or


---------27:41----------
whatever you just need a worldview that


---------27:44----------
is internally consistent and can handle


---------27:46----------
whatever life throws at you


---------27:48----------
the other big thing about religion is


---------27:50----------
it's a major source of social capital


---------27:52----------
and community which has very positive


---------27:53----------
effects on mental health


---------27:55----------
the last two things these are a little


---------27:56----------
bit more kind of my opinion there's less


---------27:58----------
research to suggest this but based on


---------28:00----------
what i've seen you know sublimation of


---------28:02----------
the ego is a big common theme amongst


---------28:04----------
religions which leads to positive mental


---------28:06----------
health outcomes it's not necessarily


---------28:08----------
that you need to


---------28:10----------
go to religion to do these things but


---------28:12----------
that seems to be a big part of it based


---------28:14----------
on my study and the last thing is that


---------28:15----------
it seems to be a pretty systematic way


---------28:18----------
to discipline the mind which is very


---------28:20----------
very good for your your mental health


---------28:23----------
and so if you you know can religion be


---------28:25----------
good for your mental health absolutely


---------28:27----------
i think the closer that religions stay


---------28:29----------
to these five points the more positive


---------28:31----------
they're going to be for your mental


---------28:32----------
health can they be bad for your mental


---------28:34----------
health absolutely right so we can


---------28:36----------
there's a dark side to sublimating the


---------28:38----------
ego which is that people may take


---------28:39----------
advantage of you there's a dark side to


---------28:41----------
disciplining the mind which is that some


---------28:43----------
of those practices may border on abusive


---------28:44----------
or not even border on abusive


---------28:47----------
there's a dark side to this which is


---------28:48----------
that you know so community and social


---------28:50----------
capital can lead to things like shunning


---------28:52----------
right and ostracization if you start to


---------28:54----------
like and so suddenly that the community


---------28:57----------
instead of being a positive impact on


---------28:58----------
your mental health starts to become a


---------28:59----------
negative impact and emotionally damaging


---------29:02----------
to you


---------29:03----------
and the last thing is that you know


---------29:04----------
sometimes the therapeutic alliance gets


---------29:06----------
like taken advantage of and that's


---------29:08----------
really bad for you


---------29:10----------
so you don't need religion but it's kind


---------29:11----------
of the combo meal it's easily packaged


---------29:13----------
and you don't have to really worry about


---------29:14----------
it but you can by all means develop


---------29:16----------
these things on your own


---------29:18----------
but it's just going to be harder right


---------29:20----------
because it's not like packaged for you


---------29:21----------
so


---------29:22----------
that's religion and mental health


---------29:36----------
you
