---------00:00----------
if you can get in the zone on a regular


---------00:02----------
basis your performance is going to start


---------00:04----------
yes I want you guys to think about


---------00:06----------
something more safe so when I'm pitching


---------00:10----------
to like Goldman Sachs what I do is I


---------00:12----------
walk in the room and I ask the people


---------00:13----------
what is the difference between a good


---------00:16----------
day and a like think about that


---------00:18----------
as human beings we have good days and we


---------00:21----------
have bad days what's the difference like


---------00:23----------
your biology is the same every day that


---------00:25----------
you play a game like if you're playing


---------00:27----------
it doesn't matter what game you're


---------00:29----------
playing every day your experience is


---------00:30----------
growing so here you should be getting


---------00:32----------
back right you know more about the game


---------00:34----------
today than you did yesterday


---------00:35----------
so if unless something drastic is


---------00:38----------
happening in general you should be


---------00:40----------
improving every single day to play so


---------00:43----------
why do human beings have good days and


---------00:45----------
why do they have bad things and the


---------00:47----------
answer is exactly what Mark said it's


---------00:49----------
about the state that you operated so


---------00:53----------
like when Michael Jordan is in the zone


---------00:54----------
and we've all experienced it if you can


---------00:57----------
get in the zone on a regular basis your


---------00:59----------
performance is going to start so this is


---------01:03----------
where like what I do is I teach people I


---------01:05----------
made it my life's work to teach people


---------01:07----------
that getting in the zone is not random


---------01:09----------
because you guys know like on some days


---------01:11----------
you have a bad day you're like it's just


---------01:12----------
not happening today I'm just not you


---------01:14----------
guys never won before you know with like


---------01:15----------
losing streak and then you guys gone on


---------01:17----------
a winning streak something magical


---------01:19----------
happened and your players suddenly get


---------01:20----------
better on Game five no the way that they


---------01:24----------
showed up to play changed not the person


---------01:26----------
that they are and so meditation is about


---------01:29----------
like structuring that flow snake is


---------01:31----------
about understanding that the difference


---------01:33----------
between good days and bad days it can be


---------01:35----------
reduced if you try if you change your


---------01:39----------
diet if you change your sleeping you


---------01:40----------
learn how to meditate


---------01:42----------
it's I'm done that's probably gonna be


---------01:44----------
hard to do this but I'm gonna ask you


---------01:49----------
best to do is sit up straight and then


---------01:52----------
just raise one finger and we're gonna do


---------01:54----------
a practice called the ultimate not so


---------01:55----------
great okay so I'm gonna demonstrate once


---------01:58----------
you guys can kind of do with me I'm


---------01:59----------
gonna block my right nostril and I'm


---------02:00----------
never leaving through my left I'm going


---------02:05----------
to switch to the other and also block it


---------02:07----------
and then breathe out and then in through


---------02:12----------
the same nostril switch out


---------02:20----------
then again in


---------02:24----------
switch now


---------02:28----------
into the same nostril


---------02:33----------
switch now


---------02:37----------
you


---------02:39----------
other teams pro teams that have salaries


---------02:42----------
of millions of dollars a year when they


---------02:44----------
lose a game they tear each other apart


---------02:46----------
you weren't doing this you want to doing


---------02:47----------
this weren't doing this the attitude in


---------02:50----------
the winning team was completely


---------02:52----------
different they support each other


---------02:54----------
they're like hey man it's okay don't


---------02:55----------
worry about it don't rage don't tilt


---------02:57----------
tilt prevention what I teach is tell


---------03:00----------
prevention and if you can train yourself


---------03:01----------
to not tilt imagine how good they also


---------03:06----------
use this one psychologist
