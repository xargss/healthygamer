---------00:00----------
really like to talk to dr k about


---------00:01----------
executive dysfunction and how to conquer


---------00:03----------
it


---------00:03----------
as it has been the most crippling effect


---------00:05----------
caused by my mental illness and has


---------00:07----------
essentially made life


---------00:09----------
progress progress near impossible in


---------00:11----------
many respects


---------00:13----------
and yet this is a topic that seems to go


---------00:15----------
often untalked about in any sort


---------00:17----------
of detail especially in any sort of


---------00:19----------
solutionary


---------00:20----------
respect i've even struggled to get my


---------00:23----------
therapist to talk about it with me


---------00:25----------
perhaps that is because i have also


---------00:27----------
found that those who don't


---------00:29----------
deal with this issue have an especially


---------00:31----------
difficult time understanding it as well


---------00:33----------
it is hard for them to grasp the idea of


---------00:36----------
feeling


---------00:36----------
like you are literally unable to force


---------00:38----------
yourself to take an action


---------00:40----------
and i get it because i deal with it


---------00:42----------
every day and i still


---------00:44----------
find it hard to understand how it can be


---------00:46----------
this way i too often wonder why can't i


---------00:49----------
just do it like everybody else from my


---------00:52----------
point of view it is a bad enough


---------00:54----------
having to battle my mind but it is


---------00:56----------
torturous not being able to hardly ever


---------00:58----------
just get myself to do some sort of work


---------01:00----------
or even a fun hobby


---------01:02----------
to help myself through it on top of that


---------01:05----------
and it is very hard for me to find


---------01:07----------
purpose in myself


---------01:08----------
or work on other parts of my life and


---------01:11----------
mental health


---------01:12----------
as well when i can't actually manage


---------01:15----------
to hardly get myself to do simple or


---------01:18----------
even fun tasks


---------01:20----------
let alone those more important


---------01:21----------
purposeful ones


---------01:23----------
so basically it feels like i'm


---------01:24----------
constantly stuck in a solitary prison


---------01:27----------
and given nothing to do other than sit


---------01:30----------
and look out through the bars to see all


---------01:31----------
the things that i enjoy and want


---------01:33----------
need to take part in but can't okay this


---------01:36----------
is a great question


---------01:38----------
so the first question is what is


---------01:40----------
executive dysfunction


---------01:41----------
we have a part of our brain called the


---------01:43----------
frontal lobes


---------01:45----------
which plan and execute tasks okay


---------01:48----------
so what this means is that the example


---------01:50----------
that we're going to use to


---------01:51----------
explain executive dysfunction is i have


---------01:54----------
a three-year-old and i have a


---------01:55----------
five-year-old


---------01:56----------
if i tell my five-year-old to clean up


---------01:58----------
the room she can do it


---------02:00----------
if i tell my three-year-old to clean up


---------02:02----------
the room


---------02:03----------
she's gonna feel like she just can't do


---------02:06----------
it right so then what i have to do is i


---------02:07----------
have to tell my three-year-old okay


---------02:09----------
let's put the books away and the


---------02:10----------
three-year-old can do that i can tell


---------02:13----------
let's put the toys away but she can do


---------02:15----------
that let's put the stuffed animals away


---------02:16----------
she can do that she can put the ipad


---------02:19----------
away she can put the controller away she


---------02:20----------
can put her bowl away


---------02:23----------
but she needs me to structure those


---------02:26----------
tasks together to take like to reach an


---------02:29----------
abstract goal okay so executive function


---------02:33----------
is the ability to plan and execute tasks


---------02:37----------
so if i think about something like


---------02:38----------
finding a job


---------02:40----------
that requires a lot of executive


---------02:42----------
function right


---------02:43----------
so it requires me to think about okay


---------02:46----------
like what are the steps involved and


---------02:48----------
execute on those tasks


---------02:49----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------02:51----------
executive function is that


---------02:53----------
it improves with age and your executive


---------02:56----------
function kind of


---------02:58----------
uh you know reaches its full potential


---------03:00----------
it's somewhere between


---------03:01----------
the age ages of 30 and 32 and this has


---------03:04----------
to do with frontal lobe development


---------03:06----------
so the first issue for this person is


---------03:09----------
depending on how old you are


---------03:10----------
things may get better for you as you get


---------03:13----------
older


---------03:13----------
i'm not saying that it's sufficient now


---------03:15----------
like you can't really bank on that right


---------03:17----------
like you can't like


---------03:18----------
if you're a high school student with


---------03:19----------
poor executive function


---------03:21----------
you can't wait until you're 30 to do


---------03:22----------
high school


---------03:24----------
so that's the first thing just to


---------03:25----------
reassure you guys that you will get


---------03:27----------
better at this


---------03:28----------
over time until the age of 30 to 32. the


---------03:31----------
second thing that i found is that


---------03:32----------
executive function tends to get


---------03:34----------
negatively impacted by playing video


---------03:36----------
games


---------03:37----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but if


---------03:40----------
you spend a lot of time playing video


---------03:41----------
games


---------03:43----------
what video games essentially do is like


---------03:47----------
do the executive function for you okay i


---------03:50----------
know it sounds weird but like think


---------03:51----------
about this so i've been playing genji


---------03:52----------
impact recently right so like i don't


---------03:54----------
have


---------03:54----------
the the game sort of tells me what i


---------03:56----------
need to do like if you play world of


---------03:58----------
warcraft or genji


---------03:59----------
impact or whatever i don't have to plan


---------04:01----------
out i mean sort of people do in genshin


---------04:03----------
impact but


---------04:04----------
you know if you play a particular video


---------04:05----------
game the game tells you okay the next


---------04:07----------
step you need to do is this the next


---------04:08----------
step you need to do is this the next


---------04:10----------
step you need to do is this


---------04:11----------
like if i if i take ff7 for example like


---------04:14----------
ff7 doesn't start off in the first 10


---------04:16----------
minutes and say


---------04:17----------
hey beat sephiroth and then you have to


---------04:19----------
construct


---------04:20----------
how to get from where you are to like


---------04:23----------
beat sephiroth at the end


---------04:24----------
sure you know he's the bad guy and you


---------04:26----------
know he's the end goal but


---------04:28----------
gideo video games give you the steps


---------04:30----------
okay


---------04:31----------
so the problem that people with


---------04:32----------
executive function have or dysfunction


---------04:34----------
have


---------04:35----------
is that they don't they're not their


---------04:37----------
brains are not able to


---------04:39----------
plan out and execute each step of the


---------04:42----------
task


---------04:43----------
so if we think about like you know


---------04:44----------
planning and execution


---------04:46----------
what someone with a good executive


---------04:47----------
function can do is like plan out the


---------04:49----------
steps they understand that okay if i


---------04:51----------
need to clean my room


---------04:53----------
these are the six things that need to


---------04:54----------
happen so what people


---------04:56----------
with executive function experience is


---------04:59----------
paralysis


---------05:01----------
around goals so what that means is like


---------05:03----------
they know


---------05:04----------
like the three-year-old theoretically


---------05:06----------
knows


---------05:07----------
what a clean room looks like and if i


---------05:10----------
ask her like what in the room looks


---------05:11----------
dirty she can tell me that


---------05:13----------
so what's really frustrating about


---------05:14----------
people with executive dysfunction


---------05:16----------
is that they're they have insight


---------05:20----------
into um


---------05:23----------
their dysfunction but what's incredibly


---------05:27----------
frustrating about this is that despite


---------05:31----------
the insight


---------05:31----------
it doesn't actually change your brain


---------05:34----------
and allow your brain to actually do it


---------05:36----------
so you like the three-year-old can


---------05:37----------
understand what a clean room looks like


---------05:39----------
can understand that her room is dirty


---------05:41----------
but that


---------05:42----------
abstract level understanding is not the


---------05:45----------
same


---------05:46----------
as the frontal lobes being able to chunk


---------05:49----------
down that task


---------05:50----------
so really what executive function is is


---------05:53----------
the ability to take one task and like


---------05:55----------
chunk it into pieces right so when i


---------05:58----------
plan and execute like here's find a job


---------06:02----------
or clean a room and it's it's being able


---------06:04----------
like this process


---------06:06----------
is what's messed up with executive


---------06:08----------
dysfunction


---------06:09----------
okay and understanding it insight into


---------06:12----------
it


---------06:12----------
is not the same it's the ability to like


---------06:14----------
think through what


---------06:15----------
what to do so another example is like


---------06:18----------
you know sometimes we'll have like let's


---------06:19----------
say like you're having you're hosting a


---------06:21----------
party


---------06:21----------
so people who have like people who are


---------06:23----------
event planners


---------06:25----------
have really good executive dis uh


---------06:26----------
function so like


---------06:28----------
they like plan out this big task let's


---------06:30----------
throw a wedding this has to get done


---------06:32----------
this has to get done this has to get


---------06:33----------
done this has to get done so they're


---------06:35----------
very good


---------06:35----------
like very organized so the problem with


---------06:38----------
executive dysfunction is that we


---------06:40----------
aren't able to like figure out how to


---------06:43----------
chunk up a task and execute on it


---------06:45----------
and it feels incredibly paralyzing


---------06:47----------
because our brain is


---------06:48----------
literally not able to do this so if we


---------06:50----------
think about how you know how do you


---------06:52----------
start on a task that's too big


---------06:54----------
you can't so this is why people feel


---------06:57----------
paralyzed because if the task is too big


---------06:58----------
you literally cannot do it


---------07:00----------
like i can't like if i were to tell you


---------07:03----------
you know


---------07:03----------
win a nobel prize like


---------07:07----------
how do you even start with that like


---------07:08----------
that's crazy like you may be able to


---------07:11----------
theoretically map out what needs to be


---------07:13----------
done but you can't actually break it


---------07:15----------
apart


---------07:16----------
into like it's subsequent pieces and


---------07:19----------
actually execute on it


---------07:20----------
so then the question is what to do about


---------07:21----------
executive function


---------07:23----------
about executive dysfunction actually and


---------07:25----------
this is where there are a couple of


---------07:26----------
things to recognize


---------07:28----------
so when people um


---------07:31----------
have paralysis and executive dysfunction


---------07:34----------
there are a couple of different


---------07:35----------
components


---------07:36----------
so when you're paralyzed towards a


---------07:38----------
behavior there are


---------07:39----------
three things that i'd like to talk about


---------07:42----------
the first is operationalize


---------07:44----------
so what this means is like there's


---------07:45----------
actually a formal process that you can


---------07:47----------
get


---------07:47----------
trained in to do this


---------07:51----------
so this is what we call operationalizing


---------07:53----------
problems


---------07:54----------
um in in gamer terminology so like back


---------07:57----------
when we did


---------07:57----------
a lot of work with gamers i know we


---------08:00----------
still do a lot of work with gamers but i


---------08:02----------
used to


---------08:02----------
do a lot of work specifically around


---------08:03----------
video game addiction and what i would


---------08:05----------
teach people is how to


---------08:06----------
change an open-ended problem so this is


---------08:09----------
something like win nobel prize or find a


---------08:11----------
job


---------08:12----------
into a close-ended problem so what that


---------08:14----------
means is to essentially


---------08:16----------
go through the process of converting an


---------08:18----------
abstract thing


---------08:19----------
into like a discrete quest goal so like


---------08:22----------
forget about the quest


---------08:23----------
chain we're gonna like because we can't


---------08:26----------
map out the quest chain so or


---------08:27----------
actually what we're gonna do is we're


---------08:28----------
gonna take a goal and we're gonna map it


---------08:30----------
on to what we call a quest


---------08:32----------
chain and then the quest chain will have


---------08:34----------
discrete pieces


---------08:35----------
so this is called operationalizing


---------08:37----------
problems which gamers


---------08:39----------
are bad at the really interesting thing


---------08:41----------
is that gamers are actually better than


---------08:43----------
the average population


---------08:45----------
at this piece so if you give a gamer a


---------08:48----------
very discreet task


---------08:51----------
and you give them an end goal and you


---------08:53----------
give them all the pieces


---------08:54----------
they will actually outperform regular


---------08:57----------
people when it comes to doing that task


---------08:59----------
so this is a real scenario okay i was


---------09:01----------
taking a class at harvard business


---------09:03----------
school


---------09:04----------
and in the in the class at harvard


---------09:06----------
business school we were given a case and


---------09:08----------
we were told to solve this problem


---------09:10----------
about how to optimize flow through a


---------09:12----------
urology clinic


---------09:13----------
literally i was swamped at the time so i


---------09:15----------
logged onto discord and i was like hey


---------09:17----------
do you guys want to help me with this


---------09:18----------
and i just uploaded this


---------09:20----------
harvard business school case to group of


---------09:22----------
my degenerate gamer friends


---------09:24----------
and the next day they like came up with


---------09:25----------
like four or five solutions i went into


---------09:27----------
class two days later


---------09:28----------
i had the solutions for my gamer buddies


---------09:30----------
and they're like how what do you do and


---------09:32----------
i was like hey this is what i'm going to


---------09:33----------
do and the professor is like that's


---------09:35----------
brilliant no understanding of medicine


---------09:38----------
no understanding of mba stuff no


---------09:39----------
understanding of any of that crap


---------09:41----------
if you give them a close-ended task and


---------09:43----------
give them the parameters


---------09:45----------
gamers are good at this gamers are bad


---------09:50----------
at this so if you have a problem with


---------09:53----------
executive dysfunction the first thing


---------09:54----------
that you need to do


---------09:55----------
is learn how to turn this into this so


---------09:58----------
that's called


---------09:59----------
operationalizing problems there's a


---------10:02----------
there's a actually an exercise that we


---------10:04----------
share in dr k's guide so we talk a lot


---------10:06----------
about this in dr k's guide but i'll


---------10:08----------
share the exercise with you now so this


---------10:10----------
is what i tell people who have


---------10:12----------
um executive dysfunction like as a


---------10:14----------
therapist


---------10:15----------
what i'll say is pretend you are


---------10:16----------
paralyzed from the the neck down


---------10:19----------
and pretend you have a servant who will


---------10:22----------
do exactly what you tell them to do


---------10:25----------
what would you how would you tell them


---------10:27----------
to like accomplish this task


---------10:29----------
so in the terms of like finding a job


---------10:31----------
it's like you're paralyzed you like


---------10:32----------
literally have to tell them


---------10:34----------
go to my computer log in open a web


---------10:37----------
browser


---------10:38----------
do a google search for jobs available


---------10:41----------
in you know washington dc


---------10:46----------
what do you see there okay then do this


---------10:48----------
then do this then do this


---------10:50----------
and what i find with with people who


---------10:51----------
have executive dysfunction is that when


---------10:53----------
you really like work them through that


---------10:54----------
process


---------10:55----------
they will actually be able to like


---------10:57----------
execute on tasks so the first thing is


---------10:59----------
operationalizing problems


---------11:01----------
second problem with executive


---------11:03----------
dysfunction is frustration


---------11:06----------
and emotions a lot of people with


---------11:08----------
executive dysfunction


---------11:09----------
also have adhd or the other way around


---------11:12----------
so people with adhd have trouble like


---------11:15----------
with executive


---------11:16----------
function okay so this is the really


---------11:18----------
interesting thing is that i find that


---------11:20----------
when you're


---------11:20----------
paralyzed towards behavior there's like


---------11:22----------
a practical component to it


---------11:24----------
but there's also this component of like


---------11:27----------
feeling so


---------11:28----------
damn dumb and feeling so damn


---------11:30----------
incompetent and frustrated with yourself


---------11:32----------
that it actually negatively impacts your


---------11:34----------
behavior because if we think about like


---------11:36----------
what


---------11:37----------
promotes behavior right so like it's not


---------11:39----------
frustration and negative emotion


---------11:42----------
it's like inspiration and confidence so


---------11:44----------
what people with executive dysfunction


---------11:46----------
literally have to do in order to improve


---------11:49----------
their dysfunction


---------11:50----------
is digest these emotions so we'll do


---------11:53----------
therapy around this


---------11:54----------
because any time you're thinking about


---------11:56----------
taking a behavior right like so


---------11:57----------
if i have an idea and then i want to


---------11:59----------
take an action


---------12:01----------
what goes in here what is this composed


---------12:04----------
of it's composed of


---------12:06----------
operationalizing and then there's going


---------12:08----------
to be like


---------12:09----------
there's going to be good emotions and


---------12:12----------
there's going to be


---------12:13----------
bad emotions right so there's like a war


---------12:16----------
between my good emotions and my bad


---------12:18----------
emotions


---------12:18----------
in terms of whether i take the action or


---------12:20----------
not if i think i'm going to fail if like


---------12:22----------
you know if i think i'm good at it like


---------12:25----------
if i feel confident then i'll take the


---------12:26----------
action


---------12:27----------
so that those are a couple of pieces


---------12:29----------
that go into it okay


---------12:31----------
so we're paralyzed towards the behavior


---------12:33----------
we have to learn how to operationalize


---------12:35----------
we have to learn how to like deal with


---------12:37----------
our negative


---------12:37----------
emotions and frustration i think


---------12:39----------
generally speaking i just do two things


---------12:41----------
with them so we tend to get to


---------12:43----------
processing their negative emotions and


---------12:44----------
then we operationalize problems


---------12:47----------
and we use that exercise and that tends


---------12:49----------
to be actually like the way that you


---------12:51----------
deal with executive


---------12:52----------
dysfunction and the third thing to to


---------12:54----------
remember is that over time


---------12:55----------
you will actually improve okay


---------12:59----------
yeah so people are talking about


---------13:01----------
meditation absolutely so you can also do


---------13:03----------
meditation


---------13:04----------
right so the uh it's that's good thank


---------13:06----------
you chat


---------13:07----------
see chad is learning so if we talk about


---------13:09----------
strengthening your frontal lobes


---------13:11----------
meditation actually strength


---------13:12----------
strengthens your mpfc your medial


---------13:14----------
prefrontal cortex


---------13:15----------
which is going to be like a big part of


---------13:17----------
what we want to talk about when it comes


---------13:19----------
to


---------13:22----------
operationalizing problems i think


---------13:24----------
another thing that we want to


---------13:26----------
talk a little bit about is you have to


---------13:27----------
be careful about


---------13:29----------
the thoughts that keep you from starting


---------13:32----------
so this is also like another cognitive


---------13:34----------
skill that you can learn so anytime


---------13:36----------
someone has this is related to the


---------13:38----------
emotions but like


---------13:39----------
if you think about problems with


---------13:42----------
operationalizing like this is where the


---------13:44----------
what-ifs happen right we were talking


---------13:46----------
about the what-ifs earlier


---------13:47----------
what if you know


---------13:50----------
so a lot of thoughts that keep you from


---------13:52----------
starting this kind of has to do a little


---------13:54----------
bit with like procrastination so


---------13:55----------
sometimes like


---------13:56----------
you know perfection can actually keep


---------13:59----------
you paralyzed as well like you want to


---------14:01----------
do it perfect


---------14:02----------
you don't want to like get a b so you're


---------14:03----------
not even gonna try for


---------14:05----------
until you're sure you can get an a


---------14:06----------
you're not even gonna you'd rather have


---------14:08----------
an


---------14:08----------
f than a 10 or 90 chance for an a


---------14:13----------
right you want a 100 chance of an a or


---------14:15----------
an f


---------14:17----------
so this is where there are particular


---------14:18----------
like psychological complexes or


---------14:21----------
cognitive things which you can actually


---------14:23----------
work on


---------14:23----------
these are almost like some scars so we


---------14:25----------
talk about a couple of these in dr k's


---------14:27----------
guides


---------14:27----------
i'll try to you know map more stuff out


---------14:30----------
but when it comes to


---------14:31----------
solving executive dysfunction it gets


---------14:33----------
better with time you have to learn how


---------14:34----------
to operationalize


---------14:35----------
which you can practically do deal with


---------14:37----------
the negative emotions that keep you from


---------14:39----------
acting


---------14:40----------
you can absolutely meditate and then the


---------14:42----------
fourth thing is that


---------14:43----------
you know there are particular thoughts


---------14:44----------
there are particular other


---------14:46----------
challenges that arise which have


---------14:48----------
specific solutions to them


---------14:50----------
questions about executive function does


---------14:52----------
it degrade after the age of 32 not


---------14:54----------
really


---------14:55----------
is it different from motivational issues


---------14:58----------
no so so here's the problem there's no


---------15:00----------
sanskrit word for motivation


---------15:02----------
so motivation i think is one of the


---------15:04----------
worst words in the english language


---------15:06----------
because


---------15:07----------
it lumps together all of these


---------15:10----------
disparate processes under like one term


---------15:14----------
it's like and so the problem like if you


---------15:16----------
look at like solutions to motivation


---------15:18----------
like if you do


---------15:20----------
a google search for like solutions to


---------15:22----------
motivation you will find


---------15:24----------
a million websites with a bunch of


---------15:26----------
people who will


---------15:28----------
sell you their product for like how to


---------15:29----------
get more motivated and we're guilty of


---------15:32----------
that too


---------15:33----------
the problem is like if they're all these


---------15:35----------
solutions to motivation like


---------15:37----------
why isn't everyone super motivated none


---------15:39----------
of them work why don't they work because


---------15:41----------
it's a problem of misdiagnosis


---------15:44----------
motivational problems could be adhd it


---------15:46----------
could be executive


---------15:47----------
dysfunction it could be trauma it could


---------15:50----------
be like a lack of clarity of goal it


---------15:52----------
could be that


---------15:53----------
you're not motivated because it's


---------15:54----------
something you should do instead of


---------15:56----------
something that you care about


---------15:57----------
there are all kinds of like nuances to


---------16:00----------
motivation it's actually a


---------16:02----------
a bunch of different neuroscientific


---------16:04----------
psychological


---------16:05----------
and spiritual problems and the way that


---------16:08----------
i help motivate people is because like i


---------16:10----------
don't call it motivation it's like


---------16:12----------
what's your actual problem


---------16:13----------
so you could look at someone with


---------16:15----------
executive dysfunction you could say this


---------16:16----------
problem has a problem this person has a


---------16:18----------
problem with motivation


---------16:19----------
but they're absolutely they can't act


---------16:21----------
when they want to act right that's what


---------16:23----------
motivation is


---------16:24----------
but if you look at it like their actual


---------16:26----------
problem is not


---------16:27----------
a lack of motivation that's a symptom


---------16:30----------
their problem


---------16:31----------
is is executive dysfunction and so in


---------16:34----------
that way


---------16:35----------
a lack of motivation has a differential


---------16:38----------
diagnosis


---------16:39----------
that includes a lot of different things


---------16:51----------
you
