---------00:00----------
and so it's kind of tricky because like


---------00:02----------
no matter what we do like someone's


---------00:03----------
going to be unhappy someone wants


---------00:05----------
something a little bit more entertaining


---------00:07----------
someone wants something a little bit


---------00:08----------
more in-depth and so we try to just kind


---------00:10----------
of struggle or balance it all


---------00:13----------
so do you want your


---------00:15----------
your question answered by dr k on stream


---------00:17----------
the honest guide


---------00:19----------
um so step number one make a clickbait


---------00:22----------
title have your problem be on the


---------00:23----------
extreme end of the spectrum nothing


---------00:25----------
short of spectacular will do you spend


---------00:28----------
300 a month uh monthly on only fans


---------00:30----------
wrong you have bank drafted your entire


---------00:32----------
family and taken out loans on your house


---------00:35----------
to pay for your only fans addiction you


---------00:37----------
had to buy a big swimming pool to store


---------00:38----------
all the bath water you've been buying on


---------00:40----------
ebay


---------00:42----------
have your problem be in either of these


---------00:44----------
oh let's upvote either of these three


---------00:46----------
categories that are approved of as


---------00:48----------
twitch and meme bait be a sex addict aka


---------00:51----------
only fans addiction have extreme beliefs


---------00:53----------
about women aka incel fail to date or be


---------00:56----------
in a healthy relationship to a


---------00:57----------
spectacular and humoristic


---------00:59----------
level


---------01:01----------
this is me poking a bit of fun but


---------01:02----------
something i feel is an evolving problem


---------01:05----------
over the last year the content have gone


---------01:07----------
from being relatable levels of problems


---------01:09----------
to only extreme and bizarre problems


---------01:11----------
gets highlighted


---------01:12----------
i do accept that some people have these


---------01:14----------
extreme problems and they sure deserve


---------01:16----------
help too but i thought the goal of aoe


---------01:18----------
healing and and are the streams hitting


---------01:20----------
the most people when aimed at the end of


---------01:22----------
the bell curve instead of the middle


---------01:24----------
i can't help to feel that these po posts


---------01:27----------
get hand-picked for being sensational


---------01:29----------
with the goal of being good


---------01:30----------
entertainment to watch while eating


---------01:31----------
popcorn and not aim to help as many as


---------01:34----------
possible at the same time maybe luring


---------01:37----------
in as many people into the computer


---------01:38----------
community with popcorn friendly content


---------01:40----------
is the best way to help as many people


---------01:42----------
as possible if you got this far bravo


---------01:44----------
your attention span is excellent would


---------01:46----------
love to hear some discussion in the


---------01:47----------
comments


---------01:50----------
right


---------01:50----------
so


---------01:51----------
um you know the other thing that we can


---------01:53----------
add is is what about


---------01:55----------
making a post that is critical and will


---------01:57----------
create drama does that does that


---------01:59----------
increase your chances of getting viewed


---------02:01----------
on stream so


---------02:03----------
like i said i kind of feel like


---------02:04----------
lecturing today because i'm feeling like


---------02:06----------
a little bit philosophical but i think


---------02:07----------
this person brings up a lot of problems


---------02:09----------
which frankly we struggle with


---------02:11----------
on a daily basis


---------02:13----------
and i i love actually talking about this


---------02:14----------
stuff so i'm going to just kind of like


---------02:15----------
freestyle and and share with you all a


---------02:18----------
little bit about what our dilemma is and


---------02:20----------
how we approach like what we pick


---------02:22----------
and i think it's cool because there's


---------02:23----------
like stuff going on on the internet


---------02:26----------
which we fall victim to as well and we


---------02:28----------
like are kind of aware of but it's it's


---------02:30----------
really fascinating so let's just let's


---------02:31----------
just talk about how we pick stuff on the


---------02:32----------
internet okay


---------02:34----------
so the first thing is that like


---------02:37----------
you know


---------02:38----------
if we're trying to help the most so this


---------02:40----------
is the i'm genuinely asking y'all okay


---------02:42----------
so i'm gonna share the conclusions that


---------02:44----------
we've come to at healthy gamer but i'm


---------02:46----------
not saying by any means we're right i'm


---------02:48----------
saying these are the conclusions that


---------02:50----------
came to we came to and if you have a


---------02:53----------
better solution by all means please let


---------02:55----------
us know like because this is a serious


---------02:57----------
is this a bug


---------03:00----------
so like here's here's the problem right


---------03:02----------
so like if you think about making


---------03:03----------
content on the internet


---------03:05----------
we can make like the most useful content


---------03:08----------
in the world it can be like super super


---------03:10----------
in-depth


---------03:11----------
and like it can be aiming to help like a


---------03:14----------
lot of people like goes into a lot of


---------03:16----------
detail


---------03:17----------
um you know really kind of digs in deep


---------03:19----------
and then it's a little bit unclear like


---------03:22----------
whether that will actually do well okay


---------03:26----------
so like i'll give you guys just an


---------03:27----------
example so let's take a look at


---------03:30----------
um


---------03:34----------
right so like


---------03:35----------
let's kind of let's just take a quick


---------03:37----------
look at our youtube channel


---------03:39----------
i'm not suggesting that


---------03:41----------
this isn't perfect information but this


---------03:43----------
is the struggle that we have okay


---------03:45----------
so like let's just look at our youtube


---------03:46----------
channel so like


---------03:47----------
i think the motivation and goal setting


---------03:51----------
seminar that we did i think is like a


---------03:53----------
really good example of us trying really


---------03:56----------
hard to make the world a better place


---------03:58----------
we're trying to sort of you know really


---------04:00----------
help people by like understanding like


---------04:02----------
in detail like how does motivation work


---------04:04----------
okay


---------04:05----------
so


---------04:06----------
let's just see where the other one is


---------04:10----------
yeah so motivation goals like part four


---------04:13----------
has uh


---------04:19----------
so motivation like you know has 20 000


---------04:21----------
views like let's see the next one


---------04:23----------
so this one was like uploaded two weeks


---------04:25----------
ago like has 36 000 views


---------04:29----------
this one was uploaded like a month ago


---------04:31----------
has like 81 000 views views this one has


---------04:34----------
100 000 views right and then like


---------04:38----------
how do i poop in public is like maybe


---------04:40----------
around the same quality right


---------04:42----------
and so


---------04:44----------
you know like it's tricky because like


---------04:45----------
we'll have we'll make this kind of


---------04:47----------
content right like so we'll spend a


---------04:48----------
whole week


---------04:49----------
streaming like in depth about like how


---------04:51----------
to actually help people with motivation


---------04:54----------
and the truth is that like most people


---------04:56----------
tend to not be too interested in that


---------04:59----------
right so like and that's kind of the


---------05:01----------
sort of tricky thing is that if we look


---------05:03----------
at like you know how do i poop in public


---------05:05----------
like so there are some things that


---------05:06----------
sometimes we kind of get it right which


---------05:07----------
is like why adhd is linked to addiction


---------05:09----------
that was a month ago 300 000 views


---------05:12----------
really interesting video i think we like


---------05:13----------
educate people like we educate and try


---------05:16----------
to help and sort of make it sort of


---------05:17----------
interesting as well


---------05:19----------
um you know there are different other


---------05:21----------
things like you know why you get ghosted


---------05:22----------
and it's it's why it's your fault you


---------05:24----------
got ghosted like that video was uploaded


---------05:26----------
two days ago already has as many views


---------05:29----------
as like basically day one of our


---------05:31----------
motivation video


---------05:33----------
and so it's kind of interesting because


---------05:35----------
you know at healthy gamer like we really


---------05:37----------
try to struggle like we struggle a lot


---------05:38----------
with trying to figure out


---------05:41----------
you know is our goal here to be like


---------05:43----------
educational or is it to like try to help


---------05:46----------
people or is it to entertain people you


---------05:49----------
know one of the things that i struggle


---------05:51----------
with is let's say i'm making a video


---------05:52----------
that's 90 entertaining and has like


---------05:55----------
brings 10 percent value versus a video


---------05:58----------
that has 10


---------06:00----------
entertainment and 90 value like i think


---------06:02----------
that's a good example of like the


---------06:03----------
motivation series right and we kind of


---------06:05----------
did that and that was like metrics wise


---------06:08----------
like one of our worst weeks in like the


---------06:10----------
history of healthy gamer so when we kind


---------06:12----------
of kind of go big towards trying to like


---------06:15----------
help people it turns out that like


---------06:17----------
people generally speaking are not too


---------06:19----------
interested in it


---------06:20----------
so we we really struggle with trying to


---------06:22----------
figure out you know how to make things


---------06:24----------
like what's the balance between like


---------06:25----------
entertainment and education because this


---------06:27----------
person did sort of elude


---------06:29----------
they kind of figured it out which is


---------06:30----------
like from my perspective


---------06:32----------
you know the more entertaining and


---------06:34----------
relatable we make things the more people


---------06:37----------
we can reach so if i have a video that


---------06:39----------
you know is 80 entertainment and 20


---------06:42----------
education and that video reaches a


---------06:44----------
million people do i help more people


---------06:47----------
does it is that better than like a video


---------06:49----------
that's 100 educational that only reaches


---------06:51----------
like a thousand people


---------06:53----------
so it's a it's a real problem that we


---------06:55----------
kind of struggle with and and what we


---------06:56----------
try to end up doing is like all of the


---------06:59----------
above right so we just go through cycles


---------07:01----------
of like different stuff so we'll sort of


---------07:04----------
accept that you know metrics isn't


---------07:05----------
everything and our primary goal is like


---------07:07----------
not to grow the channel as big as


---------07:08----------
possible so if we spend one week kind of


---------07:11----------
focusing on motivation and like 95 of


---------07:15----------
the internet doesn't really care about


---------07:16----------
it like that's okay because the truth is


---------07:19----------
that there are a chunk of people in our


---------07:21----------
community that that really helps a lot


---------07:24----------
i think the second thing to kind of


---------07:25----------
think a little bit about is you know


---------07:26----------
this person was saying a year ago things


---------07:28----------
were much more relatable so the second


---------07:30----------
challenge we face at healthy gamer is do


---------07:32----------
we basically do the same content over


---------07:34----------
and over and over again or do we expand


---------07:37----------
to different kinds of content so a good


---------07:39----------
example of this is like anxiety right so


---------07:41----------
like the first year or two that we were


---------07:43----------
we were around like


---------07:45----------
20 to 30 percent of our content was like


---------07:47----------
anxiety we were doing interviews about


---------07:49----------
anxiety we were teaching about anxiety


---------07:51----------
we were talking about like anxiety and


---------07:53----------
breathing and anxiety and this and


---------07:54----------
anxiety and that


---------07:56----------
and then like we sort of did that for a


---------07:58----------
while and this is kind of the challenge


---------07:59----------
of twitch is that like twitch is not a


---------08:01----------
great place to store content right


---------08:03----------
so then like we sort of run into a a


---------08:06----------
problem where


---------08:08----------
you know people who have been watching


---------08:09----------
it let's say like we do a piece about


---------08:11----------
anxiety today


---------08:13----------
the people who've been watching us for a


---------08:14----------
year or two are like ah this is boring


---------08:16----------
i've heard this all before it's like a


---------08:17----------
rehash of everything that i've already


---------08:18----------
heard and so they're not happy and the


---------08:21----------
people who are relatively newer


---------08:23----------
or maybe missed some of that stuff we're


---------08:25----------
like oh like why don't you talk about


---------08:27----------
things that are like more relatable like


---------08:29----------
anxiety


---------08:30----------
um


---------08:31----------
and so it's kind of tricky because like


---------08:32----------
no matter what we do like someone's


---------08:34----------
gonna be unhappy someone wants something


---------08:36----------
a little bit more entertaining someone


---------08:38----------
wants something a little bit more


---------08:40----------
in-depth and so we try to just kind of


---------08:41----------
struggle or balance it all


---------08:44----------
and i think the interesting thing here


---------08:46----------
is that one of the one of the


---------08:48----------
the third kind of issue here is


---------08:50----------
something that we call online drift


---------08:53----------
so this is something that's really


---------08:55----------
really interesting so it's happening all


---------08:56----------
over the internet and we're not


---------08:58----------
impervious to it so part of what we try


---------09:00----------
to do at healthygamer is like give


---------09:02----------
people what they want right so we're


---------09:04----------
like trying to figure out you know it's


---------09:05----------
not like i wake up and i say like hey


---------09:07----------
today i'm going to just talk about this


---------09:08----------
because this is what i think is


---------09:09----------
important we're really here what i


---------09:12----------
really view myself as and what we view


---------09:13----------
ourselves as is we are a resource


---------09:16----------
for the digital generation relating to


---------09:19----------
mental health things so our compass


---------09:22----------
actually comes from y'all so the


---------09:23----------
question is like what do you all want


---------09:25----------
what is important to you and that's what


---------09:28----------
we'll actually go and do right so case


---------09:30----------
in point i actually really appreciate


---------09:32----------
and love posts like this on our


---------09:33----------
subreddit because it helps us understand


---------09:35----------
like what we could be doing better


---------09:38----------
and so the challenge with that is that


---------09:39----------
like so if we make one so this person


---------09:42----------
kind of mentioned like only fans right


---------09:44----------
so if we make one video about only fans


---------09:46----------
and that video does really really well


---------09:49----------
then what's gonna happen is like people


---------09:51----------
who resonate with the video are then


---------09:53----------
gonna post their follow-up questions


---------09:55----------
right we're gonna see a lot of different


---------09:57----------
views and we're gonna see like oh like


---------09:58----------
people will say things like um you know


---------10:00----------
this is like really helpful to me like


---------10:02----------
thank you so much for posting this we


---------10:03----------
see five more posts pop up about only


---------10:05----------
fans because we made one video about it


---------10:07----------
people got excited they wanted to engage


---------10:10----------
in discussion they engage in discussion


---------10:11----------
which is fantastic that's exactly what


---------10:13----------
we're here for right we're here to help


---------10:14----------
people with like pornography addiction


---------10:16----------
or only fans stuff or parasocial


---------10:19----------
relationships or whatever


---------10:20----------
and then what happens is like we think


---------10:22----------
oh people are super interested in this


---------10:24----------
because the video got a really positive


---------10:25----------
response so maybe we can like explore


---------10:28----------
this issue more and then we'll make


---------10:30----------
another video about like sex related


---------10:32----------
stuff for like parasocial relationships


---------10:34----------
or whatever and so then what you'll see


---------10:36----------
over time is kind of this like online


---------10:38----------
drift


---------10:39----------
towards like more and more extreme stuff


---------10:42----------
because we did the basic video let's do


---------10:44----------
an advanced video let's do an even more


---------10:46----------
advanced video let's do a super in-depth


---------10:48----------
video and so there's this kind of


---------10:49----------
perception that we're like going to the


---------10:51----------
extreme and this is actually happening


---------10:53----------
this online drift is happening all over


---------10:55----------
the internet right and what's happening


---------10:57----------
is like almost this this cosmic


---------11:00----------
internet wide what i would call middle


---------11:03----------
child syndrome so there's like this


---------11:05----------
thing in psychiatry that's sort of true


---------11:07----------
i mean it hasn't isn't really true but


---------11:08----------
the idea is there


---------11:10----------
that the middle child kind of gets


---------11:12----------
screwed you know the the oldest child is


---------11:14----------
sort of like golden child they're the


---------11:15----------
only kid there everyone pays attention


---------11:17----------
to them you know like because they're


---------11:19----------
the only kid right and then the second


---------11:20----------
child gets bored and they get some


---------11:22----------
attention and then the third child shows


---------11:24----------
up and they're the youngest they're the


---------11:26----------
baby everyone kind of like fawns on them


---------11:28----------
so you've got the you know the oldest


---------11:30----------
child kind of trailblazing at the front


---------11:32----------
and you've got the youngest child


---------11:33----------
getting pampered at the back and like


---------11:34----------
the middle child the person in the


---------11:36----------
middle sort of gets forgotten right and


---------11:38----------
they kind of get like left behind and


---------11:40----------
this is what we're seeing on a cosmic


---------11:42----------
level on the internet right so we're


---------11:44----------
seeing like radicalization of of all


---------11:47----------
dimensions so we're seeing like


---------11:49----------
political radicalization we're seeing


---------11:51----------
like radicalization between different


---------11:53----------
kinds of gamers right we're seeing


---------11:55----------
radicalization even between twitch


---------11:56----------
streamers like where like the people who


---------11:58----------
are fans of this twitch streamer the


---------12:01----------
stands of this twitch streamer will go


---------12:03----------
and fight with the stands of the other


---------12:05----------
other streamer and it's like you know 30


---------12:07----------
years ago like the outsiders kind of


---------12:09----------
thing where you've got these two


---------12:10----------
different gangs and then like we're


---------12:12----------
gonna go have a war on this subreddit on


---------12:15----------
this particular day and it's like


---------12:17----------
everyone suit up like let's go and let's


---------12:19----------
go and battle right we also see this in


---------12:21----------
terms of like you know romance and


---------12:23----------
dating where you've got like kind of the


---------12:24----------
in-cell red pill kind of crowd and


---------12:26----------
sometimes the incel and red pill crowd


---------12:28----------
fights against each other and on the


---------12:30----------
flip side of the spectrum you also have


---------12:31----------
like forever alone and female dating


---------12:34----------
strategy and which is like kind of like


---------12:36----------
female red pill i guess i'm sorry i


---------12:37----------
don't really know too much about it i


---------12:38----------
don't mean to offend anyone and so we're


---------12:41----------
seeing radicalization all over the place


---------12:44----------
so the other interesting thing about


---------12:46----------
that is that like


---------12:47----------
you know part of the reason this is


---------12:49----------
happening is because people who held


---------12:51----------
views that kind of got tempered


---------12:53----------
by you know forcing you to interact with


---------12:56----------
like people within your community now if


---------12:59----------
you hold like a view that's like quite


---------13:01----------
rare within like the hundred people that


---------13:02----------
you know in real life


---------13:04----------
on the internet you can meet a group of


---------13:06----------
people that will share that view and


---------13:08----------
then if you guys create an echo chamber


---------13:10----------
and you all all like talk to each other


---------13:12----------
about this echo chamber kind of stuff


---------13:14----------
then what happens is you end up like


---------13:16----------
going further and further and further


---------13:18----------
like down the path right and then you


---------13:20----------
believe that this is reality because


---------13:22----------
everyone that you talk to has the same


---------13:24----------
shared experience


---------13:26----------
and so this online drift is a huge


---------13:28----------
problem on the internet and i think that


---------13:30----------
all the content aggregation platforms


---------13:33----------
are like a big part of it i don't really


---------13:35----------
blame them for it because you know the


---------13:37----------
goal of the content aggregation platform


---------13:39----------
is to give you what you're interested in


---------13:40----------
right they're like thousands or not


---------13:43----------
billions of posts on the internet


---------13:45----------
and so like you know you'll have a


---------13:46----------
website like reddit or facebook or


---------13:48----------
youtube


---------13:49----------
that will sort of try to recommend


---------13:51----------
things to you that you may like


---------13:54----------
and so as the content algorithm like


---------13:56----------
recommends things to you that you like


---------13:58----------
like let's say that you're you know like


---------14:00----------
a big fan of jordan peterson versus like


---------14:02----------
you're a huge you know new age feminist


---------14:05----------
i don't even know what that means


---------14:07----------
just you're a feminist you're gonna get


---------14:09----------
recommended down different trajectories


---------14:11----------
in youtube


---------14:13----------
and so there's no like cross


---------14:15----------
like there's no crossing of like the


---------14:18----------
divide of beliefs


---------14:21----------
and so this kind of online drift


---------14:23----------
is an example of like we suffer from


---------14:25----------
this too right and like this is how we


---------14:27----------
suffer from it we're aware of it


---------14:29----------
like


---------14:30----------
we just we're not really sure how to


---------14:32----------
navigate it because how do we know


---------14:34----------
okay is this a case of online drift or


---------14:37----------
and this is what i suspect specifically


---------14:38----------
about only fans is that these parasocial


---------14:41----------
relationships and like pornographic


---------14:43----------
addiction problems are far more


---------14:46----------
prevalent than we ever really realized


---------14:49----------
because these problems are evolving so


---------14:51----------
five years ago the relationship that


---------14:53----------
people had to pornography and the


---------14:55----------
relationship that they have to only fans


---------14:57----------
now has like changed a lot right and


---------15:00----------
part of the reason that we try to focus


---------15:01----------
on it like personally like i think the


---------15:04----------
reason we focus on it is because i do


---------15:05----------
think it's actually a much bigger


---------15:07----------
problem than people realize i do suspect


---------15:09----------
that the prevalence is way higher than


---------15:11----------
people realize


---------15:13----------
on the flip side of that so this is also


---------15:15----------
why we made like dr k's guide because we


---------15:18----------
realize that there's a certain amount of


---------15:21----------
information about anxiety or depression


---------15:23----------
that people are always going to want


---------15:25----------
like there's a reason why dr k's guide


---------15:27----------
is anxiety depression and meditation


---------15:28----------
like these are the three


---------15:30----------
central pillars that our community has


---------15:32----------
been interested in


---------15:34----------
so we decided to do is like go through


---------15:36----------
all of our content really package it up


---------15:38----------
from start to finish added a lot of


---------15:41----------
in-depth stuff that most people like


---------15:43----------
didn't care about to be honest so if we


---------15:46----------
look at our stream numbers for example


---------15:48----------
like can anyone guess when the most


---------15:50----------
people leave our stream


---------15:52----------
right so if we want to like


---------15:54----------
like there's one thing that we can do to


---------15:56----------
increase our stream numbers can anyone


---------15:58----------
guess what it is


---------16:02----------
we want to boost our meta our stream


---------16:05----------
numbers


---------16:07----------
it's meditation absolutely


---------16:09----------
right


---------16:10----------
so cutting meditation from the stream is


---------16:12----------
the best way to improve our med our our


---------16:15----------
stream numbers


---------16:17----------
it's kind of interesting so that that's


---------16:18----------
where like it and at the end of the day


---------16:20----------
like you know that's where we have to


---------16:21----------
make like a mission-based


---------16:23----------
decision like do we want to teach


---------16:25----------
meditation on stream or not and the


---------16:27----------
answer is like yeah we do because like


---------16:28----------
that's part of who we are and if people


---------16:30----------
want to leave like that's totally fine


---------16:31----------
if they want to move on to the next


---------16:32----------
thing like that's totally fine and on


---------16:34----------
the flip side the other thing that we


---------16:35----------
sort of discovered is that like people


---------16:36----------
want more meditation but we can't really


---------16:38----------
teach advanced meditation on stream


---------16:40----------
because like people are coming in and


---------16:41----------
out you don't know who's done it you


---------16:43----------
don't know who hasn't you don't want to


---------16:44----------
teach an advanced meditation technique


---------16:45----------
to people who are new


---------16:47----------
and so then that's why we made dr k's


---------16:49----------
guide because like that's sort of a


---------16:50----------
storehouse of content that's also why we


---------16:52----------
have a youtube channel so that people


---------16:54----------
who are interested in like the more


---------16:56----------
relatable stuff


---------16:57----------
um or like the more basic stuff like


---------16:59----------
it's all there on youtube like you know


---------17:01----------
there are tons of videos on anxiety tons


---------17:03----------
of videos about you know


---------17:05----------
depression tons of videos about trauma


---------17:07----------
like adhd like all that stuff is there


---------17:09----------
you just have to go look for it


---------17:11----------
and so that's the struggle that we have


---------17:14----------
i think the other thing that um we can


---------17:16----------
kind of talk about a little bit


---------17:18----------
is


---------17:19----------
to think a little bit about where people


---------17:21----------
in our community are


---------17:23----------
so what i'd like to do now is


---------17:25----------
share with you all how we think about


---------17:27----------
helping people


---------17:28----------
and so what i the reason i think this is


---------17:30----------
important is because


---------17:32----------
if you look at yourself like a lot of


---------17:34----------
people want to change so you may want to


---------17:36----------
change you may want to say like okay i


---------17:38----------
want to do something about my anxiety i


---------17:40----------
want to do something to get physically


---------17:41----------
in shape i really do want to pick up a


---------17:43----------
new hobby i really do care about and


---------17:46----------
want to


---------17:47----------
um


---------17:49----------
you know change like i want to improve


---------17:51----------
my life but when it comes down to it


---------17:53----------
oftentimes we just don't right so a lot


---------17:56----------
of people in our community who want to


---------17:58----------
change but they just find it very very


---------18:01----------
hard to actually start changing and this


---------18:04----------
has a big part of our our


---------18:06----------
uh how we design content as well so like


---------18:09----------
so you know this is the so there are a


---------18:11----------
lot of people who let's say don't


---------18:12----------
realize


---------18:15----------
they need to change


---------18:20----------
and then over here they're also people


---------18:24----------
who


---------18:25----------
want


---------18:27----------
change


---------18:29----------
but


---------18:30----------
don't


---------18:31----------
actually change


---------18:35----------
and then then there are people who are


---------18:36----------
like ready to change


---------18:40----------
like yeah like i really do like i've


---------18:42----------
made up my mind


---------18:48----------
and then there are the people who


---------18:49----------
actually in the process of changing


---------18:51----------
okay so when we look at our community


---------18:54----------
and if you're someone out there who is


---------18:55----------
like basically trying like i don't know


---------18:58----------
if this makes sense but a lot like a lot


---------18:59----------
of y'all may want to change like you


---------19:01----------
really do want it right like you want to


---------19:03----------
change your life you want to go out and


---------19:06----------
make new friends you want to go out and


---------19:07----------
ask your crush out on a date you want to


---------19:10----------
you know brush up your online dating


---------19:12----------
profile you want to switch careers you


---------19:14----------
want to start writing you know your tv


---------19:16----------
show or your script you want to learn a


---------19:19----------
new instrument like there are all these


---------19:20----------
things that you want to do but you can't


---------19:22----------
actually change so i'd say the majority


---------19:24----------
of people in our community are actually


---------19:26----------
here


---------19:27----------
and and so this is where let's kind of


---------19:29----------
think a little bit about like what's an


---------19:31----------
example of this or


---------19:32----------
and so then what we try to do is is


---------19:34----------
before we get to the example let's kind


---------19:35----------
of think a little bit about how we craft


---------19:37----------
content


---------19:38----------
so


---------19:39----------
here's where we create like you know


---------19:41----------
meme entertainment content so the


---------19:43----------
advantage of making this kind of content


---------19:45----------
is that people are like not looking for


---------19:47----------
answers they're just you know looking


---------19:49----------
for entertainment and so sometimes we'll


---------19:51----------
do this kind of thing like i think the


---------19:52----------
jimmy from philly we don't really try to


---------19:54----------
create meme content but


---------19:56----------
uh the jimmy from philly example a video


---------19:59----------
is i think a really good example of this


---------20:00----------
where


---------20:01----------
um


---------20:02----------
you know in order to like it's people


---------20:05----------
came in the door because they heard


---------20:06----------
about like the wildness of the interview


---------20:08----------
and they walked away like


---------20:11----------
wanting to work on themselves or


---------20:13----------
learning a little bit about compassion


---------20:15----------
it's almost like tricking people


---------20:20----------
into being better humans


---------20:25----------
so


---------20:26----------
this is also where like we could do a


---------20:28----------
lot of interesting entertaining content


---------20:30----------
but like we don't you know what we what


---------20:33----------
we sometimes want to do is like trick


---------20:34----------
people into like you know wanting to


---------20:36----------
change


---------20:38----------
right


---------20:38----------
so so like it


---------20:40----------
i mean i say tricking people because


---------20:42----------
you know clearly the reason people are


---------20:44----------
coming in the door is not for some kind


---------20:45----------
of help so this is also what we can call


---------20:48----------
like you know raising awareness so the


---------20:50----------
goal of this kind of content is not like


---------20:51----------
really to


---------20:52----------
get anyone to change it's just helping


---------20:54----------
people understand oh maybe like this is


---------20:56----------
my problem maybe i never realized that


---------20:59----------
this was going on and now it's so it's


---------21:02----------
really about raising awareness and the


---------21:03----------
goal of this sort of content is a little


---------21:05----------
bit different


---------21:07----------
then we get this camp and this is where


---------21:09----------
we like what we really want to do is


---------21:11----------
focus on like internal conflict


---------21:14----------
so an excellent example of this kind of


---------21:17----------
thing is the interview with mudahar


---------21:19----------
so if you guys haven't watched that i'd


---------21:21----------
really check it out like if you're


---------21:22----------
someone who's struggling like there's a


---------21:24----------
part of you that really wants to change


---------21:26----------
but you can't bring yourself to do it i


---------21:28----------
think the mudahar interview is actually


---------21:29----------
like a really really good example of


---------21:31----------
what you should watch


---------21:33----------
and and the reason is because mudahar


---------21:34----------
basically he comes in and he says i have


---------21:36----------
a problem and then we talk about it for


---------21:38----------
two hours and then i ask him the


---------21:40----------
question do you want to fix your problem


---------21:41----------
and he says no i don't think i want to


---------21:44----------
and so this is a very classic example of


---------21:46----------
why we are we as a community are stuck


---------21:49----------
because i think a lot of y'all may want


---------21:51----------
to change and that want is genuine what


---------21:53----------
you don't realize is that there's


---------21:54----------
ambivalence


---------21:56----------
on the inside and what ambivalence means


---------21:59----------
is that you're conflicted so resolving


---------22:01----------
that that conflict is what's necessary


---------22:04----------
to move you


---------22:05----------
over here across this threshold and


---------22:08----------
where where you've actually made up your


---------22:10----------
mind


---------22:10----------
and so this is where


---------22:12----------
you know what we these are where our


---------22:14----------
kind of solution based videos are


---------22:19----------
and so sometimes we'll give we'll


---------22:20----------
actually like give people advice right


---------22:22----------
like the dopamine detox video is a good


---------22:24----------
example of like here's the how so this


---------22:27----------
is where we teach people the how of


---------22:29----------
changing in progress this is where you


---------22:31----------
know all this is why we teach meditation


---------22:33----------
on stream because some people are


---------22:35----------
actually even though you know 60 of our


---------22:37----------
viewers leave when we start teaching


---------22:39----------
meditation forty percent do you all stay


---------22:41----------
because y'all are the ones that are like


---------22:43----------
actually interested in meditating and


---------22:45----------
out of the forty percent that stay half


---------22:47----------
of y'all are actually meditating and the


---------22:49----------
other half of you are like meaning in


---------22:50----------
chat about meditating


---------22:52----------
right so but and so this is where we get


---------22:54----------
to the how this is where we get to the


---------22:55----------
meditation and then this is where like


---------22:58----------
and then you know once people are like


---------23:00----------
ready for a menu basically the goal here


---------23:02----------
is to provide a menu


---------23:04----------
of options so like now that you're ready


---------23:05----------
to change what's going to work for you


---------23:08----------
and this is where actually like we get


---------23:10----------
to our you know our for lack of a better


---------23:13----------
term our products


---------23:15----------
right so this is why we have these kinds


---------23:16----------
of things this is where coaching lives


---------23:19----------
this is where dr k's guide lives


---------23:23----------
this is where meditation also lives


---------23:25----------
right so it's not all these things are


---------23:27----------
not necessarily paid so this is also


---------23:29----------
where you could even say things like


---------23:30----------
dopamine detox video there's a lot of


---------23:32----------
stuff on youtube


---------23:34----------
so some of our youtube videos are like


---------23:35----------
very like solution focused


---------23:38----------
but these are people who have like gone


---------23:40----------
over that that awareness hump and so for


---------23:43----------
those of you who are maybe see well some


---------23:45----------
of you all have figured this out but


---------23:46----------
this model that we


---------23:48----------
use to understand you


---------23:50----------
actually correlates with something


---------23:52----------
called the stages of change model


---------23:55----------
and so this is what we would call


---------23:56----------
pre-contemplative


---------24:00----------
this is contemplative


---------24:05----------
this is


---------24:07----------
planning


---------24:09----------
and this is action


---------24:10----------
so this is an evidence-based model of


---------24:13----------
behavioral change


---------24:14----------
that you know i use as an addiction


---------24:16----------
psychiatrist and basically the idea here


---------24:19----------
is that


---------24:21----------
there are let's see is this catching up


---------24:24----------
um so


---------24:26----------
or where was that yeah so this is the


---------24:27----------
stages of change model that we use and


---------24:29----------
so like here's an example of as an


---------24:31----------
addiction psychiatrist


---------24:32----------
what i look for so this is like you know


---------24:35----------
let's let's take the example of like


---------24:37----------
marijuana addiction


---------24:38----------
okay so like what would someone say


---------24:40----------
who's in this mental stage of change so


---------24:42----------
over here they would say


---------24:44----------
i don't have a problem


---------24:50----------
over here they would say there


---------24:52----------
are upsides


---------24:56----------
and downsides


---------24:58----------
so a good example of this is like i want


---------25:00----------
to quit for these reasons but i don't


---------25:02----------
want to quit for these reasons


---------25:04----------
okay and then over here it's i'm ready


---------25:06----------
to quit


---------25:10----------
but


---------25:12----------
i don't know how


---------25:16----------
so here's like the menu phase right so


---------25:18----------
i'll say okay like do you want to go


---------25:19----------
cold turkey do you want to just like


---------25:21----------
smoke on weekends do you want to go to


---------25:23----------
alcoholics and are like you know


---------25:25----------
marijuana addicts anonymous like what do


---------25:26----------
you want to do do you want like


---------25:27----------
medication like you need something for


---------25:29----------
your anxiety like that's where you


---------25:31----------
and then this is where you actually like


---------25:33----------
act okay like let's go


---------25:35----------
and so even within our community like


---------25:37----------
the reason that we have let's say more


---------25:39----------
meme heavy content is because some


---------25:40----------
people are over here and what these


---------25:42----------
people are going to respond to is like


---------25:44----------
memes and awareness


---------25:46----------
get them thinking about it


---------25:48----------
right so as a psychiatrist when i'm


---------25:49----------
working with someone who's


---------25:50----------
pre-contemplative i'll just ask them


---------25:52----------
questions i don't want to like because i


---------25:54----------
don't want to just you know pounce on


---------25:55----------
and say hey you need to quit smoking pot


---------25:57----------
because that's what happens a lot of


---------25:58----------
times right in addictions you'll have


---------26:00----------
family members that come to you and say


---------26:01----------
hey you have a problem you need to admit


---------26:04----------
that you have a problem


---------26:06----------
this needs to stop and it doesn't work


---------26:08----------
like people sometimes get forced into


---------26:10----------
rehab and then like i kick them out in a


---------26:12----------
week because they don't want to come


---------26:13----------
they don't want to be there they don't


---------26:14----------
want to do the work


---------26:16----------
so they come for a week and then they


---------26:17----------
end up getting kicked out the reason


---------26:18----------
they came in the first place because


---------26:19----------
their wife is threatening divorce if


---------26:21----------
they show up and they're not doing any


---------26:22----------
of the work so it's like hey you just go


---------26:23----------
dude like if you're not gonna do the


---------26:25----------
work just go


---------26:26----------
so you can't jump to action and this is


---------26:28----------
the problem within our community is that


---------26:30----------
a lot of people want to jump straight to


---------26:31----------
action they're like what do i do about


---------26:33----------
this how do i fix this what's the


---------26:35----------
solution whereas where you really are is


---------26:38----------
over here which is like yeah i kind of


---------26:40----------
want to change but i don't really want


---------26:41----------
to change


---------26:43----------
so even if you think about things like


---------26:44----------
playing video games like yeah i should


---------26:46----------
really stop playing video games i really


---------26:48----------
need to get a job it's really really


---------26:49----------
important but then i'm like okay so


---------26:51----------
uninstall all your games and go get a


---------26:52----------
job they're like but it's boring


---------26:55----------
i can't get the job that i want to


---------26:58----------
oh in this capitalistic society blah


---------27:00----------
blah blah blah blah right and then like


---------27:01----------
you come up with all this resistance all


---------27:03----------
the reasons that you don't do things and


---------27:05----------
this is really where most of our


---------27:06----------
community is that a lot of y'all do want


---------27:08----------
to change but you have some kind of


---------27:10----------
internal resistance to actually changing


---------27:14----------
and so once you're ready to change then


---------27:16----------
it's about figuring out a menu right


---------27:17----------
like is coaching right for you is dr k's


---------27:20----------
guide right for you


---------27:22----------
isn't just


---------27:24----------
youtube and twitch right for you like


---------27:25----------
you is going to therapy right for you


---------27:29----------
right like do you want to do it do you


---------27:30----------
want a diy do you want help do you want


---------27:32----------
our help do you need someone else's help


---------27:34----------
do you have like a clinical problem like


---------27:36----------
what's going on here


---------27:37----------
and then as we sort of work through


---------27:39----------
those things then we end up acting


---------27:42----------
right oh i tried dr k's guide it


---------27:43----------
actually didn't help me that much


---------27:45----------
coaching wasn't for me or i tried what


---------27:47----------
we hear more often is i've tried going


---------27:49----------
to a therapist and it didn't help let me


---------27:51----------
try coaching so we'll hear that and


---------27:52----------
that's where you kind of get to the


---------27:53----------
action phase and so part of the reason


---------27:56----------
that we approach content the way that we


---------27:57----------
do is because if we think about where


---------27:59----------
you are on this journey like ask


---------28:00----------
yourself you know do you think you have


---------28:03----------
a problem


---------28:05----------
do you have a problem but you're truly


---------28:07----------
conflicted about it and this is where i


---------28:09----------
think most people don't realize that


---------28:10----------
they're actually internally conflicted


---------28:12----------
that's why they don't act in the first


---------28:13----------
place


---------28:15----------
and then once you've resolved that


---------28:17----------
internal conflict


---------28:18----------
then you can start to plan right but


---------28:20----------
this is where we see this a lot in our


---------28:22----------
community we actually see this a lot


---------28:24----------
especially in group coaching where


---------28:25----------
people will come into group coaching and


---------28:26----------
they'll be like


---------28:28----------
i was hoping people would give me tips


---------28:29----------
or a curriculum to like fix my life


---------28:32----------
i came here looking for answers and this


---------28:35----------
is where like we could say like okay


---------28:36----------
here are the answers but if this is


---------28:38----------
where you are in your stages of change


---------28:40----------
or if this is where you are in your


---------28:41----------
stages of change giving you answers


---------28:43----------
isn't going to help which is why you


---------28:45----------
know what what our coaches ask these


---------28:46----------
people who come in at looking for


---------28:48----------
answers is when someone gives you


---------28:50----------
answers when someone gives you advice


---------28:53----------
what happens


---------28:54----------
is your do you implement it do you


---------28:57----------
listen do you actually change


---------28:59----------
and then the people are like no not


---------29:01----------
really and that's why they actually have


---------29:03----------
to go here and do the actual work of


---------29:05----------
coaching so this is why group coaching


---------29:07----------
is important because everyone is looking


---------29:09----------
for answers and if you look at blogs


---------29:11----------
right blogs will tell you


---------29:12----------
like exactly what to do like you can


---------29:14----------
read about exactly what i can tell you


---------29:16----------
wake up every day at 6am work out for an


---------29:18----------
hour meditate have a smoothie for


---------29:20----------
breakfast work on your resume apply to a


---------29:22----------
couple of jobs and then like do your


---------29:24----------
work from 12 to 8


---------29:26----------
go for a walk in the evening play games


---------29:28----------
for an hour and lights out by 10.


---------29:31----------
i could tell you to do that but ain't no


---------29:32----------
one can actually do it


---------29:35----------
and so this is where you know that's our


---------29:37----------
approach is to kind of like help people


---------29:39----------
with their motivation not to give


---------29:41----------
solutions because they're like we don't


---------29:42----------
know what solution like some random


---------29:44----------
coach on the internet isn't going to


---------29:45----------
know what solution works for you like


---------29:46----------
we'll get there we have to get to know


---------29:47----------
you


---------29:48----------
but it's really working on motivation


---------29:51----------
so we try to design content to address


---------29:53----------
all of these different


---------29:55----------
things right sometimes we have


---------29:57----------
interviews


---------29:59----------
that end up over here sometimes we have


---------30:00----------
interviews where the person has conflict


---------30:02----------
sometimes we even have interviews


---------30:04----------
so we had a uh you know an interview


---------30:06----------
with some a guy with complex ptsd i


---------30:09----------
think that's i think that's what he said


---------30:10----------
his diagnosis was and he was like can i


---------30:12----------
ever be fully healed that's a really


---------30:14----------
interesting interview as well and i kind


---------30:16----------
of laid out for him okay here's the


---------30:17----------
process of like how you overcome complex


---------30:20----------
ptsd from start to finish


---------30:22----------
and so some people are ready for that


---------30:24----------
not everyone is ready for that some


---------30:25----------
people don't even realize that they have


---------30:26----------
complex ptsd or that they've been


---------30:28----------
traumatized


---------30:30----------
so that's kind of how we approach things


---------30:32----------
and if if y'all are trying trying to


---------30:34----------
figure out you know okay like what


---------30:35----------
what's right for me why can't i change


---------30:38----------
despite wanting to change


---------30:40----------
this is sort of the the thing to really


---------30:42----------
understand like this is the frame of


---------30:44----------
mind of like how change happens so this


---------30:47----------
is the frame of mind that leads to the


---------30:49----------
evidence-based technique of motivational


---------30:51----------
interviewing so how can you talk to


---------30:53----------
someone to actually in a scientifically


---------30:56----------
validated way increase their motivation


---------30:58----------
to act and this is the model that we use


---------31:02----------
so understanding this model also


---------31:04----------
explains why people who look for


---------31:05----------
solutions don't get better because the


---------31:08----------
solution that they look for it doesn't


---------31:10----------
fit


---------31:11----------
the cognitive space that they're in


---------31:17----------
questions


---------31:20----------
so part of the reason that so if you're


---------31:21----------
someone who wants to change


---------31:24----------
but you find yourself being unable to


---------31:25----------
change


---------31:26----------
and you end up looking for solutions


---------31:28----------
right you look for this oh let me do a


---------31:30----------
dopamine detox let me like start eating


---------31:32----------
keto


---------31:33----------
let me


---------31:34----------
just do this thing and then all my life


---------31:36----------
will be fixed


---------31:37----------
and if you're one of these people that


---------31:39----------
like can come up with all the things


---------31:40----------
that you should do but you can't figure


---------31:42----------
out why you can't do them you just can't


---------31:44----------
bring yourself to do them you need to


---------31:46----------
understand the stages of change model


---------31:48----------
because this this model of like internal


---------31:51----------
motivation


---------31:52----------
explains


---------31:54----------
why people can have the right answer and


---------31:56----------
not implement it it explains how to go


---------31:59----------
through the process of being in denial


---------32:01----------
to being internally conflicted to


---------32:03----------
actually being prepared to act and then


---------32:05----------
actually implementing change but until


---------32:08----------
you resolve that internal conflict until


---------32:10----------
you are aware of what's going on inside


---------32:12----------
you i can give you the perfect solution


---------32:14----------
and you'll never implement it


---------32:17----------
and so what we try to do here at healthy


---------32:18----------
gamer is actually like our structure our


---------32:21----------
interviews structure our questions


---------32:23----------
structure our lectures to try to hit


---------32:25----------
each of these dimensions so that we can


---------32:27----------
help everyone along the spectrum the


---------32:29----------
real challenge is that like i would say


---------32:31----------
75 percent of people out there


---------32:34----------
are in the contemplative stage which


---------32:35----------
means their main problem is internal


---------32:37----------
conflict there's a part of me that does


---------32:39----------
and there's a part of me that doesn't


---------32:44----------
can we do this to ourselves you can


---------32:46----------
absolutely do it to yourself in fact


---------32:47----------
most human beings do it to themselves


---------32:50----------
right most human beings find their


---------32:52----------
internal motivation over a long and


---------32:54----------
painful process


---------32:56----------
the advantage of you know


---------32:59----------
what we try to do is accelerate that


---------33:01----------
process so i i mean some i mean i guess


---------33:04----------
there may be theoretically cases of


---------33:06----------
people who wouldn't be able to do it on


---------33:07----------
their own but what we really try to do


---------33:09----------
like our emphasis at healthy gamer is


---------33:11----------
like y'all can't wait like


---------33:14----------
there's a real cost if you spend three


---------33:16----------
years figuring this stuff out so we try


---------33:18----------
to accelerate the process


---------33:22----------
right we can guide you like that's the


---------33:23----------
whole point of like


---------33:25----------
i mean anyone can start at the age of 15


---------33:27----------
and like discover a lot of mathematics


---------33:30----------
like you can discover all that stuff on


---------33:31----------
your own


---------33:32----------
but depending on how much you get taught


---------33:35----------
like you can you know you learn the


---------33:37----------
basic stuff that is already known so


---------33:38----------
much faster and then you can like


---------33:40----------
discover like mathematics that has never


---------33:42----------
been discovered before so that's what we


---------33:44----------
really try to do


---------33:49----------
is there a world in


---------33:51----------
okay so dr kane regards specifically on


---------33:53----------
cannabis is there a world in that daily


---------33:55----------
controlled use of cannabis can be


---------33:57----------
helping with no negative effect side


---------33:59----------
effect am i addicted or is the substance


---------34:01----------
helping me for real so that's a good


---------34:03----------
question so let's let's take a quick


---------34:04----------
look at this question as it re relates


---------34:07----------
to cannabis use


---------34:08----------
is there a world in which i can use


---------34:10----------
cannabis every day and have no negative


---------34:12----------
side effect


---------34:14----------
am i addicted or is this substance


---------34:15----------
helping me and i think the biggest thing


---------34:17----------
you need to do is stop using the word or


---------34:20----------
it's and okay


---------34:22----------
so is there a world in which there's


---------34:23----------
daily controlled use that has no


---------34:25----------
negative side effect i would say no


---------34:28----------
so there is you can use is it helping


---------34:30----------
you sure but is it going to have a


---------34:32----------
negative side effect almost undoubtedly


---------34:35----------
so that's where like when we think about


---------34:36----------
the you know medical use of cannabis


---------34:39----------
it's not about no negative side effect


---------34:42----------
it's about the benefits outweighing the


---------34:44----------
harm so i'll give you guys just like an


---------34:46----------
actual example of like clinical cases of


---------34:48----------
when i recommend cannabis use


---------34:50----------
so the number one reason i will


---------34:52----------
recommend cannabis use is to reduce the


---------34:54----------
dependence on prescription opioids


---------34:58----------
so opioid addiction is far more damaging


---------35:01----------
in my opinion than like


---------35:03----------
some amount of cannabis use


---------35:05----------
so there are studies that show that if


---------35:07----------
you are addicted to opioids first of all


---------35:09----------
it's very impairing ver causes a ton of


---------35:11----------
suffering people are in a lot of pain


---------35:13----------
they use a lot of opioids they're


---------35:15----------
mentally impaired they can't work they


---------35:17----------
can't drive they're super constipated


---------35:20----------
um you know people are stealing their


---------35:21----------
pain meds it causes all kinds of


---------35:23----------
problems narcotic addiction is super bad


---------35:25----------
there's an opioid epidemic people are


---------35:27----------
like overdosing all the time


---------35:30----------
so in a harm reduction strategy adding


---------35:33----------
cannabis can sometimes clinically be a


---------35:35----------
good idea because it reduces their


---------35:37----------
dependence on opioids now would i


---------35:39----------
recommend that people stay on cannabis


---------35:41----------
and opioids for the rest of life no i


---------35:42----------
think that that's like that's a step


---------35:44----------
along your path right and ideally you


---------35:46----------
should be from also free from all


---------35:48----------
substances


---------35:50----------
and so can it help you sure like can


---------35:52----------
cannabis have positive effects on


---------35:54----------
anxiety like absolutely and can you


---------35:56----------
become chemically dependent on it


---------35:57----------
absolutely there are also prescription


---------35:59----------
medications like clonazepam is a good


---------36:02----------
example


---------36:03----------
that can be very effective for anxiety


---------36:05----------
and have people having like a chemical


---------36:07----------
dependence on it which is unhealthy


---------36:10----------
so i think it's all about risk versus


---------36:12----------
benefit and that's why you should have a


---------36:13----------
conversation with your actual doctor to


---------36:15----------
figure out okay where am i on the


---------36:16----------
spectrum


---------36:18----------
but my gut instinct is that 70 to 80 of


---------36:21----------
people who use cannabis use it in an


---------36:23----------
unhealthy manner and it probably is like


---------36:26----------
more about


---------36:28----------
like addiction as opposed to being


---------36:30----------
therapeutic and that's especially like


---------36:32----------
basically all the people that i know


---------36:34----------
that use cannabis in a relatively


---------36:36----------
healthy way are the ones that use it


---------36:39----------
rarely basically right like if it's like


---------36:41----------
something you use like every two or


---------36:43----------
three months like then it's


---------36:45----------
almost certainly like not addictive


---------36:46----------
because you just can't be addicted at


---------36:48----------
that point


---------36:50----------
right so and then this is where like you


---------36:52----------
know if you're if you're listening to


---------36:54----------
this video and the idea of using


---------36:56----------
marijuana once every two to three months


---------36:59----------
creates a lot of resistance in you then


---------37:01----------
you may have a problem


---------37:03----------
right


---------37:15----------
you
