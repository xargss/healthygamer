---------00:06----------
I'm cool to talk about whatever yeah so


---------00:08----------
what's it like to talk to evil people on


---------00:10----------
the phone oh I think that I have become


---------00:17----------
somewhat it would callous be the right


---------00:20----------
word um I feel like Oh


---------00:23----------
for three years huh yeah I've been doing


---------00:26----------
it for three years also initially there


---------00:29----------
were times where a scammer would say um


---------00:31----------
I play a grandma character or I do all


---------00:36----------
the characters I try to be like a


---------00:38----------
grandfather and they would say something


---------00:42----------
like I'm if you don't go to the store


---------00:45----------
and buy me a gift card I will come to


---------00:48----------
your house and shoot you and the first


---------00:53----------
few times I heard that you don't know


---------00:58----------
what to say and there's this moment of


---------00:59----------
wow how could another person say this to


---------01:02----------
it


---------01:03----------
a human being and then I think the more


---------01:05----------
that I've done it I just


---------01:09----------
maybe I'm desensitized so you said that


---------01:15----------
there's a moment where you and then you


---------01:16----------
made a facial expression oh and so what


---------01:20----------
what do you feel unless you in that


---------01:22----------
moment I think for me it there's times


---------01:25----------
where when I talk to them I feel


---------01:31----------
searching for the right word


---------01:36----------
you can feel shocked and wonder how


---------01:39----------
could a human being say that to someone


---------01:43----------
how could a person get to the point


---------01:46----------
where they feel it's okay to threaten an


---------01:52----------
87 year old grandma for a gift card I


---------01:54----------
guess that's what goes through my mind


---------01:56----------
yeah so that's a little bit abstract


---------01:58----------
right because like you're on the other


---------01:59----------
end of the phone and they're telling you


---------02:02----------
this but I don't hear anything personal


---------02:06----------
right you're asking how could someone do


---------02:09----------
it's like you're watching the news like


---------02:10----------
you're not participating how could


---------02:14----------
anyone do this to another human being


---------02:16----------
which is a little bit strange like I


---------02:18----------
would expect that if I was on the phone


---------02:20----------
with someone and said I'm gonna come to


---------02:21----------
your house and I'm gonna kill you even


---------02:22----------
if I was pretending I would imagine that


---------02:25----------
I felt like some kind of personal yeah


---------02:28----------
remorse yeah yes kind of yeah and some


---------02:33----------
of the a few of this gamers I've talked


---------02:35----------
to you I I think they don't care at all


---------02:41----------
they're they're okay with they want me


---------02:44----------
to be afraid and they want me to sure to


---------02:47----------
cry and capitulate and listen to


---------02:50----------
whatever it is they want and I suppose


---------02:53----------
that's the hardest part is where there


---------02:56----------
are times that I know in order to keep


---------03:00----------
wasting the scammers time in order to


---------03:03----------
keep like doing what I do I have to play


---------03:06----------
a character who is scared and sad and


---------03:10----------
will take their abuse and sometimes


---------03:14----------
that's really hard to what's hard about


---------03:16----------
works work through well it's it's


---------03:21----------
terrible you have you have someone


---------03:24----------
yelling at an old man and someone who is


---------03:27----------
like verbally abusing you and and trying


---------03:30----------
to manipulate someone to give them money


---------03:35----------
and you have to act like this is okay


---------03:39----------
I'm just gonna keep going along with it


---------03:41----------
and and I think I'm fine with it because


---------03:44----------
I know that I'm educating people about


---------03:47----------
the scams I'm wasting the guy's time at


---------03:50----------
the end of the day I typically also


---------03:52----------
something that we've been doing lately


---------03:54----------
is I'll like by the Google Play card


---------03:56----------
that they want and I my background is in


---------03:59----------
software dev so I coded a fake Google


---------04:02----------
store and I've redeemed the Google Play


---------04:05----------
card and then they get really really mad


---------04:07----------
at me so I know in the back of my mind


---------04:11----------
that there's gonna be some how do you


---------04:14----------
feel when they get mad at you there yeah


---------04:18----------
I admittedly there is a little bit of


---------04:20----------
like a I don't know justice is the right


---------04:23----------
word because it's now really justice but


---------04:28----------
don't ask me that question um I don't


---------04:34----------
know I don't know what it is but it's


---------04:36----------
there's something satisfying about


---------04:41----------
saying well you thought that you could


---------04:45----------
control the situation and manipulate an


---------04:47----------
87 year old man but actually we were


---------04:51----------
controlling the situation for the past


---------04:54----------
five hours and and you just got scammed


---------04:56----------
it's like we've we flipped the table and


---------05:01----------
kind of got back at the scammers in a


---------05:04----------
small way I guess can I ask you so you


---------05:07----------
were saying earlier that you become


---------05:09----------
callous over time do you feel a whole


---------05:11----------
lot of empathy like in general yeah or I


---------05:17----------
think in general I'm I hate I don't like


---------05:22----------
making statements like this but I feel


---------05:24----------
as though I have empathy and I don't


---------05:29----------
like staying that because I don't like


---------05:30----------
coming I don't want to come across like


---------05:32----------
oh yeah I'm great arrived I'm a really


---------05:35----------
nice person or something but I do think


---------05:37----------
that I think about people and I very a


---------05:42----------
lot of the times when I talk to scammers


---------05:43----------
I Iram in the back of my mind this is


---------05:47----------
just another person who you know is


---------05:50----------
going through who knows what and I don't


---------05:54----------
know the story that they got him here


---------05:57----------
but yeah so kit let me let me ask you so


---------06:01----------
those seem like thoughts right okay


---------06:05----------
right so what I'm curious about is do


---------06:07----------
you do you when you say when I ask you


---------06:10----------
do you feel empathy your answer was sort


---------06:13----------
of I think I do but I don't want to say


---------06:15----------
yes because that seems arrogant or


---------06:17----------
something yeah I just don't want to come


---------06:20----------
I don't want to sound like I'm saying


---------06:21----------
dude I'm the nicest person on the


---------06:23----------
internet found the most humble person


---------06:25----------
ever because obviously that's not the


---------06:28----------
question I'm asking right I'm not asking


---------06:31----------
if you're a nice guy or you are you


---------06:32----------
concerned that maybe you come across as


---------06:34----------
too nice or not nice enough


---------06:39----------
I don't know okay yes I think that I met


---------06:42----------
with empathetic I think I will answer it


---------06:45----------
more straightforwardly sure you think


---------06:47----------
you're empathetic what makes you think


---------06:50----------
you're empathetic let me I get empathy


---------06:55----------
and sympathy mixed up sure so to me so


---------06:59----------
lit so so let's define me great great


---------07:01----------
point right so sympathy is feeling kind


---------07:04----------
of bad for someone empathy is feeling


---------07:06----------
what they feel okay yeah I think that so


---------07:15----------
say that again sympathy is that sympathy


---------07:16----------
is feeling bad right so I'm over here


---------07:18----------
and you're over there and and I feel bad


---------07:22----------
for you and empathy is sort of I feel


---------07:25----------
bad with you


---------07:26----------
right so empathy is the capacity for one


---------07:29----------
human being to like feel another's pain


---------07:32----------
so like if I'm watching TV and someone


---------07:34----------
gets hit in the nuts I feel a visceral


---------07:37----------
pain within myself does that make sense


---------07:41----------
like like putting yourself in someone's


---------07:43----------
shoes yeah exactly so like for example


---------07:47----------
when I see I would say that I'm that I


---------07:49----------
am empathetic or I have yeah absolutely


---------07:52----------
okay so I'm gonna toss out kind of an


---------07:55----------
inflammatory hypothesis and I think that


---------07:58----------
it you know I and please give me a


---------08:01----------
chance to explain myself


---------08:03----------
so as we become callous I think it like


---------08:08----------
we sort of lose our capacity for empathy


---------08:10----------
right and and you kind of like I'm just


---------08:13----------
noticing that in your job or for lack of


---------08:16----------
it I mean I'm you know in your stream


---------08:18----------
which I'm just gonna call a job because


---------08:20----------
I don't know what else to call it so


---------08:21----------
like in your work okay so like water


---------08:24----------
weight are you thinking that screaming


---------08:26----------
is not a job


---------08:26----------
no I it's just I was implying that like


---------08:28----------
I don't know because you mentioned that


---------08:30----------
you have a background in software


---------08:31----------
development so I don't know if this is


---------08:32----------
your job or not it is my job now just


---------08:34----------
kidding we posit yeah so so in your work


---------08:37----------
you've had to become callous and as a


---------08:42----------
result of callous you sometimes feel


---------08:45----------
less empathy right and you have a couple


---------08:49----------
of like abstract statements and even


---------08:51----------
when you


---------08:52----------
talk about empathy you use the word to


---------08:53----------
think a lot like it sounds like the the


---------08:56----------
the manifestation of your empathy is


---------08:58----------
something that I'd call cognitive


---------08:59----------
empathy which is it sort of like an


---------09:01----------
analysis of someone feeling bad as


---------09:03----------
opposed to feeling bad yourself and like


---------09:06----------
kind of like in essence capturing what


---------09:09----------
they feel hmm


---------09:11----------
right so interesting and and some of


---------09:14----------
that actually relates to a term that is


---------09:17----------
misunderstood which is sociopathy right


---------09:21----------
so that's the inflammatory hypothesis so


---------09:23----------
what I want to tell you myself that was


---------09:25----------
bad it doesn't sound bad


---------09:26----------
so I test very highly on the sociopathic


---------09:28----------
scale just as a disclaimer and what that


---------09:32----------
means it doesn't mean like sociopathy


---------09:33----------
isn't bad in and of itself so


---------09:35----------
psychiatrists tend to test very highly


---------09:36----------
and part of testing highly on the scale


---------09:39----------
is actually controlling or not feeling


---------09:43----------
emotional or like having a lot of


---------09:45----------
control over the amount of emotional


---------09:47----------
empathy you feel so the part of what


---------09:49----------
makes psychiatrists good at their job is


---------09:52----------
that they don't actually when someone


---------09:54----------
comes into my office and they feel super


---------09:55----------
super depressed and I see people for


---------09:57----------
like ten hours a day who are all


---------09:59----------
depressed if I have in a big valve in


---------10:02----------
terms of like the faucet of empathy is


---------10:04----------
open I'm gonna get destroyed


---------10:06----------
so psychiatrists trained themselves to


---------10:09----------
actually like acquire some degree of


---------10:12----------
like walls between them and another


---------10:14----------
person and those when we think about the


---------10:17----------
concept of sociopathy I'm not calling


---------10:18----------
you sociopath because once again I'm


---------10:20----------
saying I test highly on this I think


---------10:22----------
that that when you talk about feeling


---------10:23----------
callous that in some way is similar to


---------10:27----------
like how sociopaths feel right because


---------10:30----------
the interest if we think about a


---------10:31----------
sociopath and you ask them like you know


---------10:33----------
if you think about them like how do you


---------10:35----------
know what kind of people are their


---------10:36----------
callous people interesting I will say


---------10:39----------
just for the sake of conversation I was


---------10:42----------
specifically talking about just the


---------10:46----------
scammers yep because like I have kids


---------10:49----------
and there's time the other day my my


---------10:52----------
youngest was really excited about


---------10:55----------
something that was on the table and one


---------10:58----------
of the older ones in a very evil way


---------11:04----------
pushed


---------11:06----------
push the youngest away and I cried just


---------11:09----------
because my I was remembering my


---------11:12----------
childhood and my my little ones face was


---------11:16----------
just devastated it's like why could why


---------11:18----------
did this happen to me and I cried


---------11:22----------
because I was like like it was so many


---------11:26----------
emotions whatever oh gosh I think this


---------11:35----------
is a terrible thing - not terrible


---------11:38----------
that's the wrong word but I very much


---------11:41----------
don't I don't want my kids to get hurt I


---------11:43----------
don't want them to have to go up against


---------11:45----------
like to me what I saw and what does to


---------11:49----------
go up against yeah so what I saw in the


---------11:53----------
youngest of the boga clans eyes was just


---------11:56----------
a complete unexpected you know I don't


---------12:05----------
want to use the word malevolent but just


---------12:09----------
use own just a tear yeah I'm the level


---------12:11----------
and act like why would my betrayal yeah


---------12:14----------
like why would my older sibling do this


---------12:19----------
to me


---------12:20----------
and I didn't like seeing that I've been


---------12:22----------
betrayed and it's terrible and even


---------12:25----------
though it was a small thing it was just


---------12:26----------
one little thing well it was just you


---------12:31----------
could say it was just getting knocked


---------12:34----------
over right versus someone it's not like


---------12:39----------
your spouse cheats on you or something


---------12:42----------
yeah but for for my young kid that was


---------12:45----------
probably maybe the first time or one of


---------12:48----------
the first times that they've been


---------12:50----------
betrayed and I yeah so all those


---------12:53----------
thoughts and flooded into my mind anyway


---------12:57----------
it was all that was to say I still think


---------13:00----------
that I I don't feel like I'm callous in


---------13:02----------
most situations another way I could


---------13:05----------
describe it is um and sorry I talk a lot


---------13:09----------
so if you can just stop me but um when I


---------13:11----------
first started streaming but I still try


---------13:14----------
to do this today but sometimes at the


---------13:17----------
end when I would talk to a scammer


---------13:19----------
after I said you know gotcha I I wasn't


---------13:25----------
a gold right after all I'm just the


---------13:27----------
normal guy wasting your time I would ask


---------13:30----------
them why are you doing this


---------13:32----------
do your parents know that you're doing


---------13:34----------
this I would try to have a


---------13:35----------
heart-to-heart conversation beautiful.i


---------13:38----------
and I would I really wanted to somehow


---------13:42----------
reach in to their life and and even if


---------13:46----------
it was a 1% chance that they might think


---------13:48----------
about it at night and and it would get


---------13:51----------
them to change I would do that almost


---------13:53----------
every time and it made some people


---------13:56----------
really upset because they wanted me to


---------13:57----------
just yell off the scammers and say look


---------13:59----------
after you you know you suck but I really


---------14:03----------
wanted to do it because I felt like


---------14:04----------
there's mistakes I've made that people


---------14:08----------
reached in and said hey you made a bad


---------14:11----------
choice but you can be better like why


---------14:13----------
can't I do that to a scammer why can't


---------14:15----------
we do that for people that felt right


---------14:17----------
but over time it's becoming harder and


---------14:21----------
harder for me to do that maybe that's


---------14:24----------
another way to to say I'm callous or


---------14:27----------
like it's harder to still have that same


---------14:29----------
hope oh yeah like these this guy can


---------14:32----------
change or this girl can change because


---------14:34----------
I've been doing it for for 3 years and


---------14:36----------
you run across so many characters


---------14:40----------
respond um most of the time there's


---------14:50----------
probably three different responses one


---------14:52----------
is this arrogant like scamming is


---------14:56----------
awesome I make hundreds of million


---------14:58----------
dollars of hundreds of millions of


---------15:00----------
dollars a year and I have like 16 what


---------15:05----------
do they call it they they're sleeping


---------15:07----------
with girls all the time and their life


---------15:09----------
is perfect and they always bring up the


---------15:13----------
money thing like they make tons and tons


---------15:14----------
of money which I just think there's a


---------15:19----------
lot of evidence to say that's not true


---------15:21----------
and sure but of course they want I think


---------15:26----------
they want to feel special and they want


---------15:28----------
to take away anything I'm saying and


---------15:30----------
just say


---------15:31----------
I love my life things are great so


---------15:35----------
that's one probably the majority of this


---------15:37----------
camera what do they even do with you on


---------15:39----------
that level yeah I would probably half of


---------15:44----------
them would wooden some of them would


---------15:46----------
just hang up and say we're not scammers


---------15:48----------
and they would just hang up you know and


---------15:50----------
the other half would respond to me so I


---------15:54----------
would say 50% just hanging up 25% would


---------15:58----------
respond to me and say I love my life and


---------16:01----------
then maybe 25% would get a little bit um


---------16:05----------
you could tell that their voice changed


---------16:08----------
a little bit and they would they would


---------16:10----------
tell you something like well this is the


---------16:14----------
only thing that I can do to feed my


---------16:16----------
family or something like that and then


---------16:19----------
it was an even less percent of people


---------16:21----------
that would just tell you I'm a scammer I


---------16:24----------
don't make any money but honestly I'm


---------16:29----------
not sure what else to do and like get


---------16:31----------
into a really really actual real


---------16:33----------
conversation that's maybe like 2% or


---------16:36----------
something and you say that your viewers


---------16:39----------
don't like that well I think I think the


---------16:44----------
community that I have now is fine when I


---------16:48----------
do that I think there's just a


---------16:51----------
especially when I first started and it


---------16:54----------
was so new there were people there's a


---------16:56----------
group of people that come in who I am


---------16:59----------
this is my perception of it I talked a


---------17:03----------
minute about how a minute ago about how


---------17:04----------
there's a a nice feeling right of


---------17:10----------
revenge or something yeah when when you


---------17:13----------
get back at the scammers whatever it is


---------17:15----------
and I think there's a lot of people who


---------17:20----------
want to see that happen and then when I


---------17:23----------
start sympathizing or empathizing or


---------17:26----------
whatever and saying hey you're a person


---------17:28----------
you can do better than this what do you


---------17:31----------
tell your kid what do you tell your kids


---------17:32----------
do you want your kids to have to do this


---------17:35----------
is this the world that you want to


---------17:36----------
create for the people start thinking


---------17:38----------
wait a second like kit this guy doesn't


---------17:41----------
deserve anything he's a he's a filthy


---------17:43----------
filthy scammer who needs


---------17:45----------
you know what do you want a comments


---------17:48----------
what do you take away from them okay by


---------17:50----------
humanizing the person you're talking to


---------17:53----------
what do I take away from chat or what


---------17:55----------
are we having from I think to some for


---------17:59----------
some people I'm not saying the majority


---------18:00----------
I'm not saying the majority I think


---------18:02----------
there are some people that hmm maybe


---------18:10----------
it's harder for them to hate that person


---------18:13----------
or harder for them to feel as though


---------18:15----------
they I don't know what the right word is


---------18:20----------
you haven't thought about this before


---------18:24----------
cuz you give myself a very important


---------18:26----------
right what is that feeling the revenge


---------18:30----------
feeling or the yeah I think that for


---------18:33----------
some people you know their their family


---------18:42----------
has been affected by scams sure maybe


---------18:45----------
their grandma got scammed


---------18:46----------
um and then Here I am saying this is


---------18:52----------
just another person who could make


---------18:55----------
better life choices and deserves a


---------18:57----------
second chance


---------18:58----------
and I don't think so doesn't say what I


---------19:02----------
hear that when your mom just got scammed


---------19:04----------
yeah you know oddly enough kid I be I


---------19:07----------
mean I don't have any data to support


---------19:08----------
this but I'd be surprised if most people


---------19:11----------
who watch what you do resonate with you


---------19:16----------
because they have been victims of some


---------19:18----------
kind of scamming or someone they they


---------19:20----------
know has been victimized I think what


---------19:23----------
you're talking about is a feeling of


---------19:24----------
righteousness right it's like just like


---------19:29----------
yeah there's people who like let that


---------19:32----------
uncomfortable for me to accept this but


---------19:35----------
there are people who've said that yeah


---------19:37----------
like they've called it justice porn yeah


---------19:39----------
absolutely and it puts me in kind of a


---------19:44----------
weird situation or has put me in a weird


---------19:47----------
situation at times because while yes I


---------19:54----------
think that it's important to waste their


---------19:59----------
time and


---------19:59----------
to keep people about these scammers and


---------20:01----------
and I don't ever want to say that it is


---------20:03----------
acceptable for them to do what they're


---------20:07----------
doing I do genuinely believe that every


---------20:10----------
person has value and that everyone


---------20:13----------
should be treated that way and sure I


---------20:15----------
think that if most people thought about


---------20:17----------
it they would say well yeah that's like


---------20:20----------
that's the way our justice system works


---------20:22----------
right if people if you get in trouble


---------20:24----------
you're still treated as though you have


---------20:27----------
some sort of I mean I could be wrong but


---------20:30----------
some sort of something that you might be


---------20:32----------
able to bring to the world so you have a


---------20:34----------
defense against you and it's all these


---------20:37----------
different things but we had a couple of


---------20:39----------
things that if I can just jump in for a


---------20:40----------
second one is I want to explain a little


---------20:44----------
bit more about what I meant and ask you


---------20:45----------
a couple of questions about callousness


---------20:47----------
and sociopathy because I want to just


---------20:49----------
clarify that I didn't mean to imply that


---------20:50----------
I think you're a sociopath it's what I


---------20:54----------
what I really meant to understand is I


---------20:56----------
think that so this is a big problem with


---------20:58----------
with the idea of sociopathy is we kind


---------21:00----------
of label people as sociopaths are not


---------21:02----------
sociopaths I don't think it's binary


---------21:04----------
like I look I'll be a little bit more


---------21:06----------
transparent so when I was talking about


---------21:08----------
psychiatrists I think that callousness


---------21:10----------
and essentially sociopathy is is a


---------21:13----------
function of the mind that can be grown


---------21:16----------
and adaptive in certain circumstances


---------21:18----------
right into a certain degree like like


---------21:21----------
all physicians have to learn how to deal


---------21:23----------
with death and like deal with it in a


---------21:26----------
very neutral way in order to do their


---------21:29----------
job and it doesn't surprise me at all


---------21:31----------
because I actually have the same


---------21:32----------
experience that you have with your kids


---------21:34----------
which is a whole years ago I used to be


---------21:38----------
very very emotionally like level and not


---------21:42----------
many things would upset me or bother me


---------21:43----------
I could watch like movies and stuff with


---------21:45----------
gore and and all kinds of bad things


---------21:47----------
happen go yeah people it didn't bother


---------21:49----------
me at all


---------21:50----------
in fact I was probably even a little bit


---------21:52----------
like titillated or you know the


---------21:54----------
extremity like watching an extreme


---------21:56----------
emotion or extreme situation made me


---------21:59----------
feel a little bit more because most of


---------22:01----------
my experience of life was like just me


---------22:03----------
being dead in the inside yeah and but


---------22:07----------
after having kids and also I think after


---------22:09----------
sort of starting to practice psychiatry


---------22:10----------
I found that I


---------22:12----------
more walls up for my emotions with


---------22:14----------
people and then there was some amount of


---------22:17----------
like emotional build-up that would


---------22:19----------
happen with people which then would


---------22:20----------
start pouring out in other situations


---------22:23----------
and especially like with my kids and


---------22:26----------
stuff so like I find myself getting


---------22:27----------
teary eyed and stuff at all kinds of


---------22:29----------
random and so I think it is I'm kind of


---------22:36----------
curious about sort of talking a little


---------22:37----------
bit more with you about you know being


---------22:40----------
closed off in calais in one situation


---------22:43----------
and being open and feeling in another


---------22:45----------
situation I'd also be a little bit


---------22:48----------
curious you said that you know you said


---------22:52----------
something about being betrayed and when


---------22:54----------
you saw you know like one child it's not


---------22:58----------
so much of your kid was malevolent


---------22:59----------
although like there was some malevolence


---------23:02----------
in there right so there's a little


---------23:04----------
pretty young yeah sure I don't know if


---------23:07----------
they intentionally tried to this is a


---------23:10----------
very big difference sure absolutely


---------23:12----------
so but there was something about that


---------23:14----------
picture that feels malevolent even if


---------23:16----------
it's not you know one of your kids being


---------23:19----------
malevolent maybe the other kid doesn't


---------23:21----------
have a perception of malevolence but


---------23:23----------
there's you know level and somewhere in


---------23:25----------
there right maybe between the lines and


---------23:27----------
so you said it reminded you of something


---------23:30----------
that happened to you I'm very curious


---------23:32----------
about that and part of the reason that


---------23:35----------
I'm curious about that is I'm curious


---------23:37----------
why you do what you do um I don't think


---------23:42----------
I do what I do because of the probably


---------23:45----------
biggest betrayal thing that comes to


---------23:48----------
mind so it would probably be two very


---------23:50----------
tips tricks but I'm happy to talk about


---------23:53----------
either or both and then the last kind of


---------23:55----------
thing that I want to talk to you about


---------23:56----------
is do you think your job is fun


---------24:02----------
yeah yeah for the most part what's fun


---------24:05----------
about it very much enjoy it um I like


---------24:08----------
that every day is a different like story


---------24:14----------
are different I don't know what to


---------24:16----------
expect every day and novelty yeah you


---------24:22----------
know I I think occasionally some P and I


---------24:24----------
totally understand this for for some


---------24:26----------
people you once you've seen a couple of


---------24:32----------
my streams and you've seen that there's


---------24:34----------
probably five or six different main scam


---------24:36----------
just let's say and after you've just


---------24:38----------
seen let's say I'll say a dozen whatever


---------24:41----------
it is you could go alright well I kind


---------24:44----------
of know what's gonna happen now like I


---------24:45----------
know I have a general understanding of


---------24:48----------
the way the scams work and I think some


---------24:51----------
people are like oh he just does the same


---------24:53----------
thing every day


---------24:54----------
but for me it's it's always a different


---------24:56----------
person I'm talking to you on the phone


---------24:58----------
sure I try to play a different character


---------25:00----------
we do a lot of weird different things


---------25:03----------
and I like that I also really like um I


---------25:06----------
like making people laugh and I I think


---------25:10----------
that to some degree there has been a


---------25:12----------
sense of I don't know if I want to say


---------25:15----------
purpose but it feels like I'm I'm


---------25:19----------
providing for my family I'm doing


---------25:22----------
something that I enjoy and believe in


---------25:23----------
I'm educating people I'm able to help


---------25:26----------
people laugh and and learn about things


---------25:29----------
and I feel like it meets a lot of yeah


---------25:33----------
that checks a lot of things off the list


---------25:35----------
so I'm very grateful for that very


---------25:37----------
grateful for that I'm curious do you


---------25:39----------
feel like a predator no I I don't think


---------25:47----------
so


---------25:48----------
you mean then I talking to this cameras


---------25:50----------
yeah yeah people have asked me before


---------25:53----------
like yeah do I feel like I'm I don't


---------25:57----------
know taking advantage some people have


---------25:58----------
said that I I am taking advantage of


---------26:01----------
them and like I don't know that you're


---------26:04----------
taking advantage of them


---------26:06----------
I don't think think so um do I feel like


---------26:10----------
a predator


---------26:11----------
I don't know if I bet anyone's asked me


---------26:13----------
that particular question predator as in


---------26:16----------
it makes me think of like a lion or


---------26:19----------
something like I'm stalking them and so


---------26:22----------
I wasn't thinking so much lion I was


---------26:24----------
thinking spider okay like trying to trap


---------26:28----------
them and um Chad says confirmed


---------26:35----------
sociopathic predator and this is what I


---------26:42----------
mean by challenging is this okay that


---------26:44----------
I'm asking you these things oh I don't


---------26:45----------
care okay yeah no this is interesting I


---------26:47----------
I really like to think I really like to


---------26:50----------
think about stuff so um yeah I don't I


---------26:56----------
think that I have ever thought of myself


---------26:59----------
as a predator or like I was doing


---------27:01----------
something wrong I did have some serious


---------27:03----------
conversations with a friend of mine


---------27:05----------
who's also just likes to think in the


---------27:08----------
very beginning so three years ago let's


---------27:10----------
say is what you know is what I'm doing


---------27:14----------
wrong let's say like that was sort of


---------27:16----------
the topic what am i you know am I so you


---------27:21----------
would if we're straightforward about it


---------27:24----------
I lie on the phone every day right I


---------27:30----------
talked to this gamer and I pretend to be


---------27:33----------
an 87 year old man or whatever it is for


---------27:36----------
five hours or whatever I lie and at


---------27:42----------
first there were times where I would


---------27:43----------
think oh gosh I mean a pretty big I


---------27:46----------
think it's fairly important to fairly


---------27:52----------
important is wrong I don't want it I


---------27:54----------
think it's very important not to lie I


---------27:56----------
think something that I I teach my kids


---------27:59----------
and that everyone generally would would


---------28:02----------
say to their children you don't tell


---------28:04----------
your kid you know what a great thing to


---------28:06----------
do son or daughter like lie that's


---------28:10----------
that's great so that was something that


---------28:12----------
was hard for me for awhile like it


---------28:14----------
gosh I'm lying every day and the way I


---------28:17----------
sort of justified it or the way that I


---------28:19----------
thought through it with with one of my


---------28:22----------
friends was that one


---------28:25----------
I do typically tell them at the end I do


---------28:29----------
not always but in the beginning I always


---------28:33----------
at the end told them that I was actually


---------28:36----------
me and I I sort of like stopped lying


---------28:41----------
you know and explained the whole entire


---------28:43----------
situation and part of that was a mental


---------28:46----------
thing for me to say okay well I'm not


---------28:48----------
lying anymore like no but then I also


---------28:53----------
went in talking to my friend thought


---------28:55----------
well maybe this is just I think there's


---------28:58----------
a word for it so you might know um sort


---------29:02----------
of like it I don't want to say for the


---------29:06----------
greater good because I think that's like


---------29:08----------
misquoted a lot but but that can I don't


---------29:13----------
that kind of vibe but maybe that's the


---------29:16----------
best oh I meant to say the ends justify


---------29:20----------
the means I think that's misquoted a lot


---------29:21----------
the the but further greater good you


---------29:25----------
could kind of say yeah like okay so I


---------29:27----------
lied to a scammer for a while so I could


---------29:30----------
keep them on the phone and educate


---------29:31----------
thousands of people about the scam I


---------29:33----------
feel like there's a so what that I'm


---------29:39----------
gonna ask you something okay so what it


---------29:41----------
sounds like no no I'm just an ER I


---------29:42----------
actually really appreciate that you talk


---------29:45----------
a lot you shared a lot of thoughts and


---------29:46----------
it really honestly it's it's it's really


---------29:49----------
awesome so let me ask you something so


---------29:50----------
right now what you're doing is


---------29:52----------
essentially providing a lot of reasons


---------29:54----------
why your behavior is good right yeah


---------29:58----------
because I'm a predator so my protection


---------30:03----------
okay so I was trying to say yeah I don't


---------30:07----------
think I am and here's why but absolutely


---------30:09----------
right so so so I didn't okay so maybe to


---------30:14----------
clarify so I'll ask you again do you


---------30:16----------
feel like a predator leader doing this


---------30:19----------
but just so it's clear I didn't think


---------30:21----------
that you were calling me a predator so I


---------30:24----------
misspoke well get in there at some point


---------30:29----------
um no I don't think that I mode


---------30:34----------
predator I don't feel like I'm a


---------30:35----------
predator okay I don't when you're


---------30:37----------
talking to you Scambler do you feel like


---------30:39----------
you're hunting hmm I've been hunting


---------30:45----------
before it's not gosh you know maybe


---------30:54----------
there's definitely times where I don't


---------30:56----------
know if I'm supposed to say that but


---------30:58----------
there's definitely times where it feels


---------31:01----------
like I'm a few steps ahead of them and I


---------31:06----------
know exactly what they're gonna do and


---------31:07----------
I'm I'm laying my traps if you will or


---------31:12----------
like I there's days where it feels like


---------31:14----------
I what was the term I can play them like


---------31:18----------
a fiddle and and it's like I hate maybe


---------31:23----------
this comes across really weird but yeah


---------31:25----------
it's like I can do whatever I want I can


---------31:28----------
have them sing songs I can have them


---------31:30----------
yeah you can so you can really just so


---------31:35----------
you're a person troll now who can


---------31:37----------
control other people you can play them


---------31:40----------
like a fiddle


---------31:41----------
well I've only experienced that with the


---------31:45----------
scammers absolutely right


---------31:49----------
so so these are your words right there


---------31:51----------
there are moments where you can feel


---------31:53----------
like you can play them like a fiddle and


---------31:55----------
we're talking about yet so I would say


---------31:58----------
the concept is or at least as I've


---------32:01----------
before we're going to jump in I want you


---------32:05----------
to ask I want to ask you what are you


---------32:07----------
feeling when I say that it's like kind


---------32:10----------
of an inflammatory and almost like an


---------32:12----------
attack I feel uncomfortable yeah yeah I


---------32:16----------
feel like I shouldn't be saying it


---------32:18----------
because I deserve let's talk about why


---------32:22----------
just you know maybe it feels wrong it


---------32:25----------
feels like a bad like oh yeah I can


---------32:28----------
control people like it feels like that


---------32:30----------
her like a bad guy in a movie would be


---------32:33----------
things yeah yeah I can control people


---------32:38----------
you know kit who else can control can


---------32:40----------
control people


---------32:44----------
there's a lot of jokes but I want to say


---------32:46----------
but uh you know so I can do that so a


---------32:52----------
lot of times you know on stream I'm


---------32:54----------
capable of bringing people in a


---------32:56----------
particular way and I I choose to use my


---------32:59----------
power for good instead of evil but like


---------33:00----------
I'm I can I mean so I have a skill to


---------33:04----------
essentially like shape the behavior and


---------33:07----------
perceptions of other human beings that's


---------33:09----------
what a small actress does yeah and and I


---------33:12----------
think the more you especially the more


---------33:14----------
you you know how people think and the


---------33:19----------
more that you experience that I'm sure


---------33:21----------
you can ask questions and lead people


---------33:24----------
any which way and I think I'm I've


---------33:28----------
experienced that with with the scammers


---------33:31----------
because I know for the most part let's


---------33:34----------
say 90% I know what they want I know how


---------33:37----------
the scam works


---------33:38----------
I know I know what's driving them I'd


---------33:41----------
I've learned all of these things and so


---------33:43----------
you can use it you could say against


---------33:46----------
them to waste their time and do whatever


---------33:48----------
it is you want and so I would say the


---------33:50----------
same thing I've used it in a way I


---------33:52----------
viewed it for good rather than -


---------33:55----------
absolutely


---------33:56----------
so that's unclear about this okay so I'm


---------33:59----------
glad that you're saying that because I'm


---------34:01----------
under stand that you feel uncomfortable


---------34:02----------
cuz I think what you're doing so I'm


---------34:03----------
just gonna ask you is it fun and your


---------34:06----------
answers were there's novelty there's


---------34:07----------
humor there's purpose I support my


---------34:10----------
family


---------34:10----------
those are all positive things right and


---------34:14----------
and so it is it so so when I ask you is


---------34:18----------
it fun your answer is involved like yeah


---------34:20----------
it's something new every day you know I


---------34:22----------
support my family it's funny there's


---------34:25----------
like humor to it and and I think there's


---------34:28----------
also like this undercurrent of like I


---------34:31----------
think why people watch us because


---------34:32----------
they're watching a hunter right like I I


---------34:36----------
think I think that just because you're


---------34:37----------
trying to like I think it's very I think


---------34:40----------
your moral approach is doubly important


---------34:44----------
because there's an underbelly to this


---------34:47----------
that is not positive so I think that


---------34:49----------
you're a good person because you don't


---------34:51----------
give in to those feelings of


---------34:53----------
righteousness and you try to go the


---------34:55----------
extra step


---------34:56----------
actually help people but I think there's


---------34:59----------
absolutely some amount of you know


---------35:01----------
satisfaction from playing people like a


---------35:05----------
fiddle because that's how human beings


---------35:06----------
work right the other thing if we think


---------35:09----------
about it the more I'm asking you about


---------35:11----------
the stuff and more uncomfortable I make


---------35:12----------
you feel the more and it's I mean I


---------35:15----------
apologize for doing this but I'm kind of


---------35:17----------
doing it on purpose


---------35:18----------
I'm sort of manipulating you even now


---------35:20----------
right sure so I'm like as the discomfort


---------35:24----------
comes up you say more and more positive


---------35:27----------
things like you're like you know I'm


---------35:29----------
trying to help people and I think that's


---------35:30----------
how you've dealt you've reconciled your


---------35:33----------
own internal conflict because I think


---------35:35----------
there's a there's a part of you that is


---------35:37----------
like darkness on the inside right


---------35:39----------
because we all have that sure yeah yeah


---------35:42----------
and I think there's been plenty of times


---------35:44----------
where if you think to yourself oh gosh


---------35:46----------
am I like is this well not as much more


---------35:50----------
but when I first started like is this at


---------35:52----------
the cool like am I like am i doing


---------35:55----------
something wrong here


---------35:57----------
yeah use like it's good but I I had to


---------36:01----------
work through that quite a bit because I


---------36:03----------
think there's so that what I think is


---------36:05----------
really respectable about what you do and


---------36:07----------
I think what makes you a good person is


---------36:08----------
that struggle so like I want to kind of


---------36:11----------
try to be clients panics I guess have


---------36:13----------
yeah so so I think we have the


---------36:14----------
perception that good people don't have


---------36:16----------
bad pieces right when I asked you is


---------36:19----------
this fun you're like yeah I do it


---------36:21----------
because I'm trying to help people I'm


---------36:23----------
trying to like educate people about


---------36:24----------
scamming this is good about what I do


---------36:26----------
this is good about what I do this is


---------36:27----------
good right what about it this is good at


---------36:29----------
work yeah I think part of that um is


---------36:32----------
because there are things that are not


---------36:35----------
fun so I never I I think I was starting


---------36:39----------
to say well here's the reasons why it


---------36:42----------
what isn't here's the times where I feel


---------36:44----------
like it's fun but there's other times


---------36:46----------
where it's it's not fun and I also think


---------36:49----------
in general yeah there's probably some


---------36:52----------
fun whether it's a dark way or whatever


---------36:55----------
you want to call it when you're in


---------36:56----------
control of the situation you can get


---------37:00----------
them to sing Britney Spears or whatever


---------37:03----------
it is yeah how does that feel like that


---------37:06----------
yeah good I don't know I suppose it's


---------37:14----------
because I again I still think it's


---------37:16----------
because there's value in it


---------37:19----------
like I see it as I'm keeping them on the


---------37:21----------
phone why can't you let why can't why do


---------37:24----------
you have to see value in it


---------37:26----------
right why is otherwise it just feels


---------37:28----------
like I'm manipulating a human being and


---------37:30----------
that doesn't feel right yeah so but do


---------37:34----------
you see what your mind is doing there's


---------37:36----------
the feeling of manipulating a human


---------37:38----------
being and then the rationalization comes


---------37:40----------
in and says let's balance them let's


---------37:43----------
balance that's what you're always


---------37:45----------
telling me like here's the way I balance


---------37:47----------
it here's the way I balance it here's


---------37:49----------
the way I balance oh yeah and and oddly


---------37:50----------
enough that makes you feel like an evil


---------37:53----------
person but that's actually what makes


---------37:55----------
you a good person because a good person


---------37:57----------
is not someone who lacks negative


---------37:59----------
feelings a good person is one who


---------38:01----------
strives to balance like that sense of


---------38:04----------
like because you're you're a [ __ ]


---------38:06----------
predator man right like that's what you


---------38:10----------
do like do you agree yeah I live


---------38:14----------
manipulate evil people but you're


---------38:17----------
absolutely a predator for evil people


---------38:19----------
yeah right look let's be clear like


---------38:23----------
people you war people into your trap and


---------38:26----------
then you pounce which is what people are


---------38:29----------
looking for they're looking for you to


---------38:31----------
pounce and then what you do [ __ ] kit


---------38:33----------
then you be nice to them and you try to


---------38:35----------
help them and then it's like and then


---------38:37----------
everyone who's watching like sees this


---------38:40----------
like Snow Leopard to jump out of a tree


---------38:42----------
and like grab a monkey and then starts


---------38:44----------
giving it like an oil massage and


---------38:46----------
they're like this is not what I signed


---------38:48----------
up for yeah why isn't he tearing them


---------38:52----------
their limbs apart and feeding it to his


---------38:54----------
children yeah absolutely


---------38:56----------
that's a good description there


---------38:59----------
certainly have been times where


---------39:01----------
especially when I come up against


---------39:04----------
someone who just feels completely I


---------39:07----------
think there's been a few times


---------39:09----------
specifically that I have met maybe a


---------39:13----------
sociopath which I believe is someone who


---------39:15----------
lacks empathy sure yeah it's the one way


---------39:19----------
of yes


---------39:20----------
yeah yeah or there have been people who


---------39:22----------
just do not care at all about any


---------39:27----------
persons feeling whatsoever and that has


---------39:30----------
been weird and uncomfortable to come up


---------39:33----------
against and so with those people there


---------39:35----------
have been times where I'm thinking I


---------39:37----------
don't I don't know if I can have a


---------39:40----------
serious conversation with this person


---------39:41----------
and tell them what they're doing is


---------39:43----------
wrong you need to stop and so I'll


---------39:45----------
pounce and set the trap or whatever you


---------39:47----------
want to call it or I'll just end the


---------39:50----------
call and I'll leave them thinking gosh I


---------39:52----------
ruined it


---------39:53----------
I could have scammed this person and


---------39:55----------
I'll just I'll just end it because


---------39:58----------
that's thinking I can't


---------40:00----------
I would rather so here's another on that


---------40:03----------
line of thought there have been times


---------40:05----------
where I've revealed to them


---------40:06----------
I call it revealing like yeah taking my


---------40:09----------
mask off which by the way like licking


---------40:12----------
can we just for a minute comment on the


---------40:15----------
fact that you actually like me we're


---------40:16----------
like you literally become about it right


---------40:19----------
like your identity you see you wear


---------40:21----------
something and then you go out for the


---------40:23----------
greater good and and you you know it's


---------40:27----------
the world that makes you put the mask on


---------40:29----------
right like the world calls you to do


---------40:32----------
this because some people are being like


---------40:33----------
scam like yeah absolutely yeah yeah I


---------40:37----------
feel like that's really humbling I don't


---------40:39----------
know how to take compliments very well


---------40:40----------
because I I just feel like a normal guy


---------40:42----------
but but yeah I appreciate that that's


---------40:46----------
what that's he's so extraordinary well


---------40:50----------
thanks anyway what we're talking about


---------40:56----------
Oh so there's times where I I do


---------40:59----------
appreciate that I don't want that to


---------41:01----------
come across whatever it's just hard for


---------41:03----------
me to that's a whole their topic I


---------41:07----------
suppose that's a whole other because I I


---------41:11----------
think the simplest answer is I think


---------41:13----------
that I'm just a


---------41:15----------
Everidge person who I you know I think


---------41:19----------
I'm a maybe at the root of it is like


---------41:23----------
what I was saying before I think


---------41:24----------
everyone is everyone has value everyone


---------41:28----------
has things that they can do that are


---------41:30----------
that are


---------41:30----------
good and how did you Murray and I how


---------41:34----------
did I learn what the value thing or yeah


---------41:36----------
how did you like so it seems like you


---------41:38----------
really do have a central belief that you


---------41:40----------
I don't even know if you I think you you


---------41:45----------
convince yourself of that right like


---------41:48----------
that's a conclusion they probably and


---------41:49----------
and and you kind of worked to that and


---------41:52----------
at some point you almost chose to set


---------41:54----------
that yes north on your compass yeah I


---------41:57----------
think there's times where you look at


---------42:02----------
this is all I haven't answered a lot of


---------42:04----------
these questions before it's kind of fun


---------42:05----------
to think about but I think to some


---------42:08----------
degree when you look at I come across


---------42:13----------
some evil people and you could say the


---------42:21----------
world is terrible why should I have kids


---------42:24----------
why should anybody do anything


---------42:26----------
why would like gosh it's just this


---------42:29----------
terrible evil place is full of heartache


---------42:33----------
and misery or whatever like you could


---------42:35----------
you could have those thoughts or you


---------42:38----------
could say I guess there was a moment


---------42:41----------
where I said like no I just refused to


---------42:46----------
believe that that had to be acceptable


---------42:50----------
and I said if there are people who can


---------42:52----------
be evil there has to be and I'm not


---------42:56----------
trying to say anything special about


---------42:57----------
myself I just think there was a everyone


---------43:00----------
makes a choice every single day and says


---------43:02----------
am I gonna do something that's a little


---------43:05----------
bit good or a little bit bad and it


---------43:10----------
feels like why can't why can't we choose


---------43:13----------
to do better why can't we be good and I


---------43:17----------
want that for my kids in my family and I


---------43:21----------
want there to be good let me ask


---------43:23----------
something and why was it so emotional


---------43:25----------
for you when one of your kids knocked


---------43:27----------
off the thing for the other kid probably


---------43:31----------
because they saw bad


---------43:35----------
what is that evil I think it was a silly


---------43:40----------
moment to some degree because I don't


---------43:44----------
well try think about it describe it to


---------43:48----------
me it was one of the first times where I


---------43:50----------
watched the whole thing take take place


---------43:53----------
where I saw something bad or malevolent


---------43:56----------
or whatever I mean they're young so it


---------44:00----------
was one of the first times that they


---------44:02----------
just saw evil and there was this look on


---------44:06----------
their face if I don't understand why


---------44:07----------
this happened and I wonder if I wonder


---------44:14----------
if the reason it struck you is because


---------44:16----------
in that moment you saw your younger


---------44:20----------
child start to formulate a world where


---------44:25----------
this struggle that you talked about was


---------44:30----------
not true and what I'm sorry this is


---------44:32----------
gonna be really abstract but you know so


---------44:35----------
this is what I'm hearing from you you


---------44:36----------
kind of talk about people making a


---------44:37----------
choice right you're saying that all


---------44:40----------
human beings have value and and that


---------44:43----------
sort of presupposes like and that


---------44:45----------
everyday like you have a struggle and


---------44:47----------
you have to make a choice to be like a


---------44:49----------
good person or a bad person and so like


---------44:51----------
that I think is like absolutely what


---------44:53----------
I've been trying to point out to you


---------44:55----------
about your own psychological process is


---------44:57----------
that it's lopsided towards positivity


---------45:00----------
because I think you know that there is a


---------45:02----------
negative person inside you right


---------45:04----------
there's the hundred think that I could


---------45:07----------
do terrible evil things absolutely and


---------45:10----------
it isn't because you recognize that


---------45:12----------
beast what is within you that's why you


---------45:14----------
recognize that people have value so like


---------45:17----------
it's not that people have in very


---------45:19----------
inherent value it's that they have the


---------45:21----------
hope for value right that any person can


---------45:24----------
be turned around because if if it is


---------45:26----------
hopeless for others then what does that


---------45:28----------
mean for your own internal beast do you


---------45:32----------
think that there is a reason why certain


---------45:34----------
people get concerned with certain


---------45:36----------
philosophical questions like you all of


---------45:39----------
your abstractness has to do with like


---------45:41----------
this axis of good and evil of like value


---------45:45----------
in forgiveness and can someone be bad


---------45:48----------
and can we forgive them or should they


---------45:51----------
be you know should we crucify them and


---------45:54----------
just like Pinos there is there


---------45:57----------
is there forgiveness or is there like


---------45:58----------
righteous justice about putting them in


---------46:01----------
the race and in my sense is that all of


---------46:05----------
your abstractions and and now like so I


---------46:08----------
conclusions that are really really


---------46:11----------
unfair because I like it's like a snap


---------46:14----------
judgment right so the reason this isn't


---------46:16----------
really a conclusion it's really like a


---------46:17----------
hypothesis for you to think about is it


---------46:20----------
okay if I share like my hypothesis about


---------46:22----------
a couple of things and just a company


---------46:25----------
comes over I might disagree so yeah


---------46:28----------
absolutely you're completely and and and


---------46:30----------
you're you're gonna be the judge of


---------46:32----------
whether this is right or wrong it's not


---------46:33----------
my place to make a conclusion like


---------46:34----------
you're the one who knows right so I'm


---------46:36----------
gonna share this with you and then I'd


---------46:38----------
love to hear your reflections about like


---------46:40----------
whether I'm way off base or it resonates


---------46:41----------
so the first is like you know I I think


---------46:44----------
what I think you are a good person I


---------46:45----------
don't think you're a sociopath but I


---------46:47----------
think that you do have this part of you


---------46:49----------
that like we all have and this is the


---------46:52----------
problem is like people don't get this


---------46:53----------
and this is why I'm harping on this is


---------46:55----------
because people feel like bad people


---------46:57----------
because they have bad feelings and by


---------47:00----------
bad feelings I don't mean anger and


---------47:02----------
depression I mean like you know


---------47:03----------
schadenfreude means so schadenfreude is


---------47:07----------
a german word that involves getting


---------47:08----------
pleasure out of the suffering for from


---------47:10----------
of others expelling the b c and h oh i


---------47:17----------
said i speak a little bit yeah so the


---------47:23----------
you know i think it's interesting


---------47:25----------
because like like human beings have that


---------47:27----------
right like when we watch about like if


---------47:29----------
you look at like some you know some


---------47:30----------
subreddits right like there's a lot of


---------47:33----------
there's a lot of satisfaction over like


---------47:36----------
watching the idiocy of others and i


---------47:38----------
don't know how that is but I think it's


---------47:39----------
wired into us because human beings just


---------47:41----------
that's like a you know it's not like a


---------47:43----------
cultural thing it's like you can take


---------47:44----------
human beings from all over the world and


---------47:47----------
they're gonna get satisfaction out of


---------47:49----------
watching someone else like [ __ ] off in


---------47:51----------
some way and then I think we also have


---------47:53----------
parts of us that that are I mean some of


---------47:55----------
us are hunters right and I think that


---------47:58----------
like just because you feel let that


---------48:00----------
degree of satisfaction I think it's part


---------48:02----------
of the reason that people watch what you


---------48:03----------
do because there's a certain like


---------48:05----------
righteous satisfaction out of being able


---------48:07----------
to like you know dhamaal or someone


---------48:10----------
who's


---------48:10----------
like an evil person and so we have these


---------48:13----------
parts of us that we generally view as


---------48:17----------
like dark or negative right like the


---------48:18----------
capacity to hunt the capacity to like


---------48:21----------
take advantage of someone the capacity


---------48:23----------
to manipulate someone and and goodness


---------48:25----------
or badness doesn't come from having


---------48:27----------
those thoughts so like for example


---------48:29----------
people with OCD sometimes people have


---------48:31----------
obsessional thoughts that are negative


---------48:33----------
yeah they like walk around and like they


---------48:35----------
have OCD which means their mind like


---------48:37----------
thinks about killing other people and


---------48:39----------
then this person feels bad because


---------48:42----------
they're like I don't want to have these


---------48:43----------
thoughts but our mind doesn't we don't


---------48:45----------
control what our mind thinks up right


---------48:46----------
like that's but we we blame ourselves


---------48:49----------
for the thoughts that our mind gives us


---------48:52----------
and for someone who has anxiety they're


---------48:54----------
like I want to just be able to interact


---------48:55----------
with normal human beings at a party but


---------48:58----------
instead instead my mind is like oh


---------49:00----------
you're a dumbass shut up right you look


---------49:03----------
like an idiot no one here likes you like


---------49:05----------
that's that doesn't that doesn't mean


---------49:07----------
we're actually bad people thinking


---------49:09----------
negative thoughts doesn't make us bad


---------49:11----------
people doesn't make it true our thoughts


---------49:13----------
are not true you know what I think is


---------49:15----------
actually an I would agree with that yeah


---------49:17----------
yeah so what I think where goodness


---------49:19----------
comes from is not about what your


---------49:22----------
internal impulse not about what your


---------49:24----------
internal impulses are but about the way


---------49:26----------
that you act and form them like the way


---------49:29----------
that you act on them in the life that


---------49:30----------
you want for yourself right so I think


---------49:32----------
that's part of the thought of okay why I


---------49:35----------
said well you have a choice every day


---------49:37----------
like you perhaps so this is where it's


---------49:40----------
exactly so I think your worldview comes


---------49:44----------
from this struggle that you have within


---------49:46----------
yourself right because let me ask you


---------49:49----------
just go ahead kiddo if you became a


---------49:51----------
scammer how successful do you think you


---------49:52----------
would be I choose not to answer the


---------49:57----------
question


---------49:57----------
absolutely that's good I don't need I


---------49:59----------
feel like with everything that I have


---------50:01----------
learned that I could be very successful


---------50:03----------
iver good and I think think that I don't


---------50:07----------
think that I could ever actually do it


---------50:09----------
though I feel like I would it would be


---------50:13----------
it would throw away all of my morality


---------50:16----------
and everything that I absolutely so when


---------50:18----------
you say answer your question I couldn't


---------50:22----------
actually


---------50:22----------
do any medicines let's be clear about


---------50:24----------
definitions you're capable of doing it


---------50:27----------
you choose not to and that's where good


---------50:30----------
yes comes fun sure right yeah that's


---------50:34----------
yeah it's very interesting I think that


---------50:36----------
that's yeah I think that I would agree


---------50:41----------
with what you're saying that and that's


---------50:43----------
why I say that idea of now though where


---------50:46----------
we get value from what all that stuff I


---------50:48----------
still don't fully understand I think if


---------50:55----------
I can try to summarize it is well every


---------50:58----------
day you can choose to do something that


---------51:01----------
is going to make things worse and bad


---------51:05----------
and evil for you or those around you or


---------51:08----------
you can choose to do things that are


---------51:11----------
good for you and your family and those


---------51:13----------
around you and that gives that brings


---------51:16----------
value maybe yeah so I would change


---------51:19----------
actually I'm that might be sort of my


---------51:22----------
weird thought yeah so so now I think we


---------51:24----------
get to maybe what we talk about next


---------51:26----------
time which is where does this come from


---------51:28----------
right and I think that like like in your


---------51:31----------
case I'd be really really curious about


---------51:33----------
you know what your upbringing was like


---------51:35----------
who took advantage of you and whether on


---------51:39----------
some level you're trying because like


---------51:41----------
you know from a Freudian level what we


---------51:44----------
kind of say is like some people have


---------51:45----------
daddy issues like right so what we mean


---------51:47----------
by that is like like oftentimes or you


---------51:49----------
know some women especially will have a


---------51:51----------
particular relationship of where their


---------51:54----------
father like didn't treat them with


---------51:55----------
respect and then that translates in some


---------51:58----------
way into their like current romantic


---------52:00----------
relationships the point here is that


---------52:02----------
something about your upbringing in the


---------52:04----------
past shapes the way that you live your


---------52:07----------
life today and that's kind of like a


---------52:09----------
psychological Freudian like kind of a


---------52:11----------
negative cast to it I think that's the


---------52:13----------
same side that's a different side of the


---------52:15----------
coin but is essentially the same coin is


---------52:16----------
what Mahatma Gandhi said which is be the


---------52:19----------
change that you want to see in the world


---------52:20----------
yeah I absolutely agree with that


---------52:25----------
statement
