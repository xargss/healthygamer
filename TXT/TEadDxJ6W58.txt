---------00:04----------
to making friends meeting potential


---------00:06----------

---------00:08----------
interaction plus shared goal


---------00:09----------

---------00:11----------
regarding meeting people over the


---------00:13----------
interla


---------00:14----------
internet and online dating now that is


---------00:16----------
our only option


---------00:18----------
a side question how do you jump a bridge


---------00:21----------
between introductory small talk and


---------00:22----------
free-flowing conversation


---------00:24----------
i've matched with girls on tinder not


---------00:26----------
exclusive to online interaction before


---------00:28----------
virus met people with something


---------00:29----------
in common at parties but never started a


---------00:31----------
conversation


---------00:32----------
being terrified of not knowing what i


---------00:34----------
should say to spark interest


---------00:36----------
and have the other side engage back is


---------00:39----------
there something internally


---------00:40----------
holding back that i should think about


---------00:42----------
and digest or is there a technique that


---------00:44----------
can help me get through


---------00:45----------
okay so chat i've been thinking about


---------00:47----------
this for a long time i think


---------00:48----------
i think we gotta we gotta come up with


---------00:50----------
like a you know


---------00:51----------
how to date and meet people by dr k


---------00:54----------
because i i'm okay we're gonna talk


---------00:56----------
about this okay okay


---------00:58----------
okay how do you jump a bridge between


---------01:00----------
introductory small talk and free-flowing


---------01:02----------
conversation


---------01:04----------
being terrified of not knowing what i


---------01:06----------
should say to spark interest and have


---------01:08----------
the other side engage back so this is


---------01:09----------
the key thing okay


---------01:10----------
all right so let's think about this okay


---------01:12----------
chat all right stay with me now


---------01:14----------
okay so here's the thing when y'all talk


---------01:17----------
to someone


---------01:19----------
it's not your job to spark interest


---------01:22----------
it's not your job to make the other


---------01:24----------
person engage back


---------01:26----------
i want you guys to think about


---------01:27----------
interactions with


---------01:29----------
we're gonna assume a heteronormative and


---------01:32----------
male standpoint


---------01:34----------
your job is not to make them like you or


---------01:36----------
get them interested


---------01:38----------
your job you're like you're like a


---------01:40----------
street vendor who has a table of stuff


---------01:43----------
that is laid out right so your job is to


---------01:46----------
lay out the stuff on the table


---------01:48----------
and if they're interested they'll


---------01:51----------
you know they'll play the game but you


---------01:53----------
it's not about saying the right thing or


---------01:55----------
the wrong thing


---------01:56----------
it's about saying what you have to say


---------02:00----------
and so like put yourself out there right


---------02:02----------
so i'm not i don't mean


---------02:03----------
dick pic that's a terrible idea under


---------02:05----------
all circumstances but i mean like


---------02:07----------
you know especially if you're a male


---------02:08----------
like you know do a little bit of the


---------02:10----------
male dance


---------02:11----------
and and so there's small talk but then


---------02:13----------
like i think there are a couple of


---------02:14----------
questions that you can


---------02:15----------
you can ask um you know like what was


---------02:19----------
2020 like for you


---------02:21----------
you know so that's like that's like a


---------02:22----------
great kind of open-ended question


---------02:25----------
but generally speaking you want to you


---------02:26----------
want to show people like who you


---------02:28----------
are and if they're interested in that


---------02:30----------
they'll engage with you and if they're


---------02:32----------
not interested in that they won't


---------02:34----------
but what you don't want to do is like


---------02:35----------
try to get them to spark interest


---------02:38----------
and try to get them to engage with you


---------02:40----------
by like being something that's


---------02:41----------
inauthentic


---------02:42----------
because then it's like you're just


---------02:43----------
setting yourself up for failure down the


---------02:44----------
road


---------02:45----------
so just be who you are and be authentic


---------02:48----------
as it turns out in my experience most


---------02:50----------
women find that


---------02:50----------
attractive right when you're just like


---------02:52----------
authentic and fun


---------02:55----------
and like when you're cognitively focused


---------02:57----------
on like enjoying yourself and being who


---------02:59----------
you are


---------02:59----------
as opposed to like trying to be


---------03:01----------
something that you're not which is like


---------03:02----------
so


---------03:03----------
cognitively intense that you're like


---------03:04----------
living a lie and there's all this like


---------03:05----------
subconscious processing going on


---------03:07----------
like you just can't you're not relaxed


---------03:09----------
you're overthinking it


---------03:10----------
you're less fun so just be who you are


---------03:13----------
and


---------03:13----------
and let other people engage i mean even


---------03:16----------
if you're a woman it goes both ways


---------03:17----------
right so you shouldn't


---------03:18----------
try to be a particular thing for a man


---------03:20----------
or if you're gay you shouldn't try to be


---------03:22----------
a particular thing for


---------03:24----------
your partner or someone that you're


---------03:25----------
attracted to just be who you are


---------03:28----------
and display that and for the people that


---------03:30----------
are interested they'll respond


---------03:33----------
um so does does that make sense like


---------03:36----------
like i want you guys to not


---------03:37----------
try to get something to get them to like


---------03:40----------
you it's sort of like


---------03:41----------
be who you are and if they're interested


---------03:43----------
great


---------03:45----------
because you're probably pretty


---------03:47----------
interesting


---------03:48----------
and and if they're interested cool so


---------03:50----------
like then you guys can build on that and


---------03:52----------
it's like it's it's a relationship


---------03:53----------
that's founded on authenticity


---------03:56----------
now how do you break in between small


---------03:58----------
talk and free flow and conversation this


---------03:59----------
is where like you got it like there's


---------04:00----------
some notes to take here okay


---------04:02----------
so open-ended question followed by like


---------04:05----------
investigative response and then a little


---------04:07----------
bit of sharing


---------04:09----------
two to one question to answer ratio okay


---------04:12----------
so like this is where oh what was 2020


---------04:15----------
like for you oh interesting okay


---------04:17----------
oh wow that sounds crazy oh you got a


---------04:18----------
cat cool tell me about your cat


---------04:21----------
awesome and then you're like yeah i


---------04:24----------
you know you can toss in like i'm i'm


---------04:26----------
deathly allergic to cats but


---------04:28----------
now it's like tough because i clearly


---------04:30----------
want to meet your cat


---------04:31----------
and i'm totally into you but i'm


---------04:33----------
allergic to cats so it's like do i


---------04:34----------
choose


---------04:35----------
you know allergies or continuing to


---------04:39----------
you know shoot my shot with you i don't


---------04:40----------
know


---------04:42----------
and then like this is also where like


---------04:43----------
i'd make your intentions known like


---------04:45----------
pretty early


---------04:47----------
okay you gotta let her know like you


---------04:49----------
gotta flirt


---------04:50----------
bros you know you'd be like oh man


---------04:53----------
that's a real pity but you know maybe i


---------04:55----------
can learn to live with allergies for you


---------04:57----------
like


---------04:57----------
if it's if it involves you like


---------04:58----------
absolutely i can learn to adjust


---------05:02----------
and then you see how they respond to


---------05:03----------
that like if they're like oh my god this


---------05:04----------
guy's a creeper and


---------05:06----------
and then you're like okay you back off a


---------05:07----------
little bit maybe you overplayed your


---------05:08----------
hand


---------05:09----------
or she giggles in which case it's like


---------05:11----------
yeah


---------05:12----------
let's go baby and so so you know


---------05:15----------
introductory small talk and then like


---------05:17----------
actually get to know the person because


---------05:18----------
what you're thinking about is like


---------05:19----------
you're thinking about dating this person


---------05:21----------
right so like you want to get to know


---------05:22----------
like is this a person interesting


---------05:23----------
what are they into what are you into um


---------05:26----------
you know how does that and and then like


---------05:28----------
try to engage with them around


---------05:30----------
topics that like seem interesting to


---------05:32----------
both of you guys


---------05:34----------
so ask a couple of open-ended questions


---------05:36----------
um


---------05:38----------
you know i think there are a lot of


---------05:38----------
questions that people tend to ask that


---------05:41----------
like


---------05:42----------
people feel put on the spot so


---------05:45----------
steer clear of yes or no questions steer


---------05:47----------
clear of like questions about like


---------05:49----------
you know if you want to do like what do


---------05:51----------
you do for a living i don't think that's


---------05:52----------
an interesting question


---------05:54----------
um you know what was 2020 like for you


---------05:57----------
is a good one


---------05:58----------
um you know what's something that you're


---------06:01----------
excited about


---------06:02----------
for 2021 is a good one right so you get


---------06:05----------
to like learn a little bit about their


---------06:06----------
interests


---------06:08----------
you can be like authentically curious


---------06:09----------
about what they have to say you can


---------06:11----------
share a little bit


---------06:12----------
um i think they're like a lot of


---------06:14----------
questions like that that you can ask


---------06:16----------
that that will sort of open up the


---------06:18----------
discussion


---------06:20----------
what do you think about love i think


---------06:22----------
that sounds like it's coming on a bit


---------06:24----------
too strong


---------06:27----------
uh is dr k a pickup artist certainly not


---------06:29----------
the last person i picked up was 17 years


---------06:31----------
ago


---------06:32----------
so i'm dated to say the least


---------06:38----------
yeah as smiling is important


---------06:42----------
right and then like the other thing is


---------06:43----------
remember you all can be authentic so


---------06:45----------
this is like


---------06:45----------
this is the this is this is what i think


---------06:49----------
is sort of the trump card which can


---------06:51----------
really like


---------06:52----------
it you can make or break you but if


---------06:53----------
you're having trouble talking to a girl


---------06:55----------
because you don't know like


---------06:56----------
what to say to her just walk up to her


---------06:57----------
and be like for the last 10 minutes i've


---------07:00----------
been


---------07:00----------
trying to think about how to strike up a


---------07:03----------
conversation with you because i think


---------07:04----------
you're


---------07:05----------
absolutely gorgeous and i haven't been


---------07:08----------
able to come up with anything


---------07:10----------
can you help me out just


---------07:13----------
tell her like lay it out there like be


---------07:15----------
authentic


---------07:16----------
and like i've been racking my brain


---------07:18----------
because i'd love to get to know you


---------07:20----------
better but i just can't think of


---------07:21----------
anything


---------07:23----------
right and and just be authentic


---------07:28----------
dudes


---------07:30----------
right be authentic and then we'll see


---------07:33----------
how she responds and she's like oh yeah


---------07:35----------
you know


---------07:36----------
that's a sweet thought but i'm i'm


---------07:38----------
really not interested and you can say


---------07:39----------
okay thanks thanks for letting me know i


---------07:40----------
really appreciate it


---------07:42----------
enjoy the rest of your night and then


---------07:44----------
you don't go barking up the wrong tree


---------07:45----------
like you it's also like


---------07:47----------
very important to respect boundaries


---------07:48----------
right like you don't want to push them


---------07:51----------
and then you can even like so this is


---------07:53----------
where you can do a little bit of like


---------07:54----------
asking for


---------07:55----------
for permission and you can say okay i


---------07:57----------
get what you're saying sounds like


---------07:58----------
you're not interested


---------07:59----------
um if i think of something good


---------08:03----------
later on in the night like let's say the


---------08:04----------
two-year-old at a bar or whatever like


---------08:06----------
if i think of something really really


---------08:07----------
good


---------08:09----------
can i take another you know can i take


---------08:12----------
another swing


---------08:14----------
and then she'll either say yes or no and


---------08:16----------
like that's like you're you're asking


---------08:17----------
for permission you're making your


---------08:18----------
intentions no


---------08:19----------
known you're respecting her boundaries


---------08:21----------
but you're also letting her know like


---------08:22----------
you're not gonna quite give up right


---------08:24----------
away and then if she says like yeah you


---------08:26----------
can take another shot at it


---------08:27----------
you're like fantastic um


---------08:32----------
and then i don't know


---------08:35----------
based or cringed i don't know what based


---------08:37----------
means


---------08:39----------
right does that make sense guys like you


---------08:40----------
want to you want to be you want to be


---------08:42----------
like respectful


---------08:43----------
but you want to be like authentic like


---------08:45----------
respectful authentic


---------08:47----------
you know respect the boundary you know


---------08:50----------
make her laugh


---------08:51----------
be funny you know have confidence


---------08:55----------
it's like authentic that's that's that's


---------08:58----------
the way


---------09:00----------
and then if she's like no you know i'm


---------09:02----------
i'm seeing someone you're like


---------09:04----------
awesome good for you and good for that


---------09:06----------
dude presuming it's a dude


---------09:08----------
and then you move on with your life


---------09:13----------
but i can i can [ __ ] guarantee you


---------09:15----------
that over the next 24 hours


---------09:17----------
she will think about you at least once


---------09:21----------
at least once right


---------09:24----------
and and like it's cool like even if she


---------09:27----------
rejects you which it's not really a


---------09:28----------
rejection it's just she's seeing someone


---------09:30----------
at the end of the day like you're still


---------09:31----------
gonna make her feel good about herself


---------09:33----------
right so like you've made the world like


---------09:34----------
even if it's like rejection on your part


---------09:36----------
you've made the world like a slightly


---------09:37----------
better place because you've you've


---------09:38----------
helped like you've helped a


---------09:40----------
woman or man or whatever feel attractive


---------09:43----------
and feel wanted by another human being


---------09:45----------
which is an awesome gift to give


---------09:47----------
right even if there's no relationship in


---------09:48----------
it like it like you you guys are way too


---------09:50----------
caught up in how it's like affecting you


---------09:52----------
like oh my god she said no i'm so


---------09:53----------
embarrassed


---------09:55----------
but like yeah she use she said no but as


---------09:57----------
long as you're not cringe about it


---------09:59----------
which we'll talk about you know cringe


---------10:00----------
is all about boundaries and respecting


---------10:02----------
boundaries


---------10:02----------
but as long as you're not cringe then


---------10:04----------
you know like even if she turns you down


---------10:06----------
it's like she's gonna


---------10:07----------
wake up the next morning and feel like


---------10:09----------
she's an attractive woman


---------10:11----------
which is like an awesome thing right so


---------10:13----------
we live in a society where


---------10:14----------
we're taught that we're unattractive


---------10:16----------
because of you know magazines and


---------10:18----------
integra


---------10:18----------
instagram filters and all that kind of


---------10:20----------
crap so if you can help someone feel a


---------10:21----------
little bit attractive about themselves


---------10:23----------
like cool


---------10:27----------
all right
