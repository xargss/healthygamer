---------00:00----------
so it's almost like your life is like


---------00:02----------
you've gotten to the age of 30 and


---------00:05----------
you're in reckful z-- life but you like


---------00:07----------
you're at the airport of your life but


---------00:09----------
you left your bag at home


---------00:20----------
how are you so the day after we talked


---------00:26----------
last time yeah I felt a lot better I


---------00:29----------
think I might message you about it yeah


---------00:32----------
I woke up I felt more whole yeah great


---------00:34----------
um then I remember having a moment


---------00:40----------
though okay this is gonna sound really


---------00:43----------
government I was sad the day after that


---------00:46----------
and I remember being like oh I'm not


---------00:48----------
fixed obviously I'm not it's not


---------00:51----------
permanent


---------00:52----------
there's no permanent fix to sound is


---------00:53----------
gonna be up and down right it's just a


---------00:56----------
dumb thought but I remember having that


---------00:58----------
thought and being like ah you know even


---------01:00----------
though it just it's just an automatic


---------01:02----------
thing to think yeah but why do you think


---------01:04----------
that that's a dumb thought it's a dumb


---------01:07----------
thought because human emotion is always


---------01:09----------
gonna be up and down right I'm not gonna


---------01:11----------
be happy forever


---------01:13----------
yeah but I mean I is crazy as it sounds


---------01:17----------
I don't I don't think that's a dumb


---------01:19----------
thought I think it's actually the


---------01:20----------
opposite I think it's an important


---------01:21----------
realization right so sometimes sometimes


---------01:25----------
when when you have you know a powerful


---------01:28----------
moment and life you feel transformed and


---------01:30----------
then the next day rolls around and


---------01:32----------
you're like oh [ __ ] we're back to square


---------01:33----------
one and that's actually like I'm glad


---------01:37----------
you feel that way because I think part


---------01:39----------
of so you know this this is not about


---------01:43----------
curing people this is about teaching you


---------01:45----------
how to go in and out of the water so


---------01:47----------
like you had you felt really good for a


---------01:49----------
day and then you went you notice that


---------01:51----------
like there were things about you that


---------01:52----------
are still the same and so like the whole


---------01:54----------
process of I think growth and healing is


---------01:57----------
actually like is like having good days


---------01:59----------
and then bad days and good days and then


---------02:01----------
bad days and each time you learn how to


---------02:04----------
move from one to the other and then over


---------02:07----------
time you get better at like moving back


---------02:09----------
and forth and then you get to control


---------02:10----------
whether your days are good or your days


---------02:12----------
are bad


---------02:14----------
this makes sense yeah yeah I've been


---------02:19----------
waking up every day every day for the


---------02:22----------
last week I've been waking up and I


---------02:24----------
start out in a I'd call it a sad state I


---------02:28----------
started out in a sad state and I always


---------02:32----------
have like this faint memory of some


---------02:34----------
dream that was really annoying like I


---------02:36----------
was in an airport and lost my luggage


---------02:38----------
like these kind of just so I think that


---------02:42----------
kind of affects the feeling when you


---------02:44----------
wake out maybe a little bit then uh then


---------02:47----------
I'm waking up and I'm like I'm like I'm


---------02:49----------
it's probably most people probably wake


---------02:51----------
up a little sad cuz you have a little


---------02:53----------
energy a little maybe I don't know sure


---------02:55----------
then uh house I'm getting from my day


---------02:57----------
and starting to do some things I find


---------03:00----------
fulfilling like talk to Tyler who's my


---------03:03----------
friend who works on everything um then


---------03:07----------
I'm feeling better and then uh after we


---------03:11----------
stopped working for the day then I go


---------03:13----------
into slump for a bit and then I try to


---------03:17----------
reach out to friends to hang out and if


---------03:18----------
they hang out with me then I'd go back


---------03:20----------
in a happy time and then I get a little


---------03:23----------
lonely and then I go to bed and that's


---------03:24----------
my day yeah so yeah you're I'm gonna


---------03:29----------
have to apologize because some of the


---------03:30----------
interviews are starting to blur together


---------03:31----------
but didn't we talk a little bit about


---------03:33----------
how you had periods of time where you


---------03:35----------
distract yourself from your base state


---------03:37----------
and then you kind of get tired of doing


---------03:39----------
so I mean I think this is this is so


---------03:43----------
reckful this is all fantastic actually I


---------03:45----------
mean I realize I say this way too much


---------03:47----------
on screen but people will tell me


---------03:48----------
something really [ __ ] depressing


---------03:49----------
about their life don't be like that is


---------03:51----------
fantastic what I think is fantastic is


---------03:53----------
that you're noticing the patterns of


---------03:54----------
your life okay right yeah they're


---------03:57----------
noticing what's going on and the


---------03:59----------
theories that we developed last time


---------04:01----------
which is that you have this basic state


---------04:03----------
of like unhappiness where you do like


---------04:06----------
fulfilling stuff or distracting stuff


---------04:08----------
and that kind of distracts you from that


---------04:10----------
but then you kind of like come back to


---------04:11----------
like your you're like neutral which is


---------04:15----------
sad which we're gonna get into but I


---------04:18----------
think it's really important to recognize


---------04:19----------
that like you you're gonna have just to


---------04:23----------
understand what's going on in you that


---------04:25----------
you can do like dharmic


---------04:26----------
you can do work that you find fulfilling


---------04:28----------
and that makes you feel good and you can


---------04:32----------
also hang out with friends and that


---------04:33----------
makes you feel good but when you're


---------04:34----------
alone and by yourself it sounds like you


---------04:37----------
feel sad yes and I actually view that as


---------04:41----------
okay I think about it like from I guess


---------04:44----------
an evolutionary standpoint that humans


---------04:47----------
needed other humans around them to


---------04:52----------
survive and pass on their genes so if


---------04:54----------
you didn't have other humans around you


---------04:56----------
you'd be unhappy maybe it's like why do


---------04:59----------
you do that driver because I mean so


---------05:02----------
like yeah sure so I mean I'm a scientist


---------05:05----------
but I mean I say sort of [ __ ] that


---------05:08----------
because the whole goal here is for you


---------05:11----------
to be peaceful and happy when you were


---------05:13----------
alone right is your basic state to be


---------05:15----------
peaceful and happy like that's the goal


---------05:16----------
that would be awesome but yeah that


---------05:18----------
would be awesome but then I I do like


---------05:20----------
this feeling that I can if I feel


---------05:24----------
terrible I'm like oh it makes sense I


---------05:27----------
can step back and be like oh it makes


---------05:29----------
sense I'm alone human beings were meant


---------05:33----------
to be in tribes not alone so that's huge


---------05:37----------
but I think the key thing there is not


---------05:40----------
the rationale but your capacity to step


---------05:43----------
back and accept the way that you feel to


---------05:46----------
not judge yourself for the way that you


---------05:48----------
feel hmm


---------05:50----------
so the reason you do it is fine I mean


---------05:53----------
whether it's evolutionary or whatever


---------05:54----------
like I you know that's great but I think


---------05:56----------
the important thing is that when you're


---------05:58----------
feeling sad this I think is a little bit


---------06:00----------
different is that I think you're you


---------06:02----------
except that you feel sad and you kind of


---------06:05----------
are okay with that


---------06:07----------
in a sense yeah I'm somewhat okay with


---------06:13----------
it so tell me about that tell me what


---------06:15----------
you mean by somewhat okay with it I can


---------06:20----------
imagine okay well I definitely didn't oh


---------06:27----------
man when I was in high school or 20 or


---------06:31----------
something I didn't see I didn't imagine


---------06:34----------
that when I'm 30 I'll be a person who's


---------06:37----------
alone this often I didn't think that


---------06:40----------
would happen and


---------06:47----------
I think that kind of thought in itself


---------06:50----------
makes me a little more sad mm-hmm and I


---------06:53----------
should just take things day by day more


---------06:55----------
um III think streaming I have a lot of


---------07:01----------
justifications for it I mean in my in my


---------07:03----------
head I'm like okay well streaming as a


---------07:04----------
job is very isolating you end up you do


---------07:08----------
talk to people on the internet but you


---------07:09----------
end up sitting in your room 10 hours a


---------07:13----------
day many years in a row sometimes seven


---------07:17----------
days a week I did before


---------07:22----------
and there's not not gonna make a look


---------07:24----------
not gonna make a lot of funds like that


---------07:25----------
you know and then if you want to talk to


---------07:29----------
other people who are streamers who are


---------07:30----------
in the same field usually people meet


---------07:32----------
people at their career but the other


---------07:34----------
streamers are just as busy streaming all


---------07:36----------
the time also so then I can't really


---------07:40----------
expect them to give me their time


---------07:45----------
you're gonna sit me yeah reckful I have


---------07:47----------
a couple of just simple questions for


---------07:49----------
you


---------07:49----------
where what part of the world do you live


---------07:51----------
in in the u.s. I'm in Texas right now I


---------07:54----------
used to be in California how much


---------07:57----------
exposure to sunlight do you get I get a


---------08:00----------
lot so I walk every day I step I just


---------08:02----------
actually look at my screen for a walk


---------08:04----------
like a week ago but I walk outside for


---------08:06----------
like five miles actually a day okay okay


---------08:10----------
so you get point because I mean you


---------08:11----------
could just be like vitamin D deficient


---------08:13----------
you know my dad always thought that -


---------08:14----------
yeah but I mean my God every time he


---------08:19----------
visits me or I visit him he just hands


---------08:20----------
me this vitamin D pills from Costco I


---------08:24----------
mean if you're getting if you're walking


---------08:26----------
five miles a day that's that's what like


---------08:28----------
an hour and a half of walking yeah yeah


---------08:31----------
I just brainstorm while doing it yeah


---------08:33----------
what's your what's your ethnicity I'm


---------08:36----------
Israeli okay so so people who have


---------08:40----------
darker skin so people who are Israeli or


---------08:42----------
Middle Eastern or Indian or African or


---------08:45----------
African American we have lower our


---------08:49----------
vitamin D apparatuses are not as


---------08:51----------
efficient as people who are Caucasian


---------08:54----------
and that's just because we were


---------08:55----------
bombarded by sunlight like all the time


---------08:58----------
which is why it makes me longer to get


---------08:59----------
vitamin D yes okay so so like but still


---------09:02----------
shouldn't be a problem in taxes but in


---------09:04----------
the Northeast for example like I'm


---------09:06----------
Indian so I'm almost certainly vitamin D


---------09:08----------
deficient because my vitamin D like


---------09:10----------
apparatus is not is efficient to someone


---------09:12----------
who's Scandinavian by origin yeah okay


---------09:18----------
so let me just kind of recap a little


---------09:21----------
bit about what I heard so it sounds like


---------09:23----------
things are moving in a positive


---------09:24----------
direction that you're able to accept and


---------09:27----------
understand that sometimes you still feel


---------09:29----------
sad you're also able to this is really


---------09:31----------
important sort of see how your life has


---------09:35----------
influenced as you make the careers of


---------09:38----------
the career that you committed to it has


---------09:40----------
created the situation that your life


---------09:42----------
isn't now which is like somewhat lonely


---------09:44----------
yeah that's I mean so what I'm hearing


---------09:47----------
from you is that you say sad but what


---------09:49----------
I'm hearing is is lonely


---------09:52----------
I equate that I relate those two are


---------09:55----------
very related to me okay the feeling of


---------09:58----------
loneliness it makes me sad yeah but I


---------10:04----------
mean a lot of things make someone sad


---------10:05----------
but what I'm hearing from you is like


---------10:06----------
the the meaning of sad or the origin of


---------10:09----------
sad is really loneliness like when you


---------10:12----------
wake up in the morning and you feel sad


---------10:13----------
okay knowingness because I just


---------10:16----------
remembered when you said that I


---------10:18----------
remembered I was at twitchcon at a party


---------10:20----------
and I tweeted I'm in a room full of


---------10:22----------
people but I've never felt so alone


---------10:24----------
something like that and uh I guess I


---------10:31----------
equated to not relating to people near


---------10:34----------
me maybe yeah so so I think let's


---------10:39----------
remember that being alone and being


---------10:40----------
lonely are like two different things


---------10:43----------
okay yeah yeah


---------10:44----------
so what's the difference um well you can


---------10:49----------
feel lonely you can feel lonely if what


---------10:53----------
I just said though if you feel lonely


---------10:54----------
for not relating to people around you


---------10:55----------
right or you don't feel a close


---------10:56----------
connection with them yeah even if you're


---------10:59----------
around people and when you wake up in


---------11:02----------
the morning like what what do you mean


---------11:04----------
by feeling sad can you help me or us


---------11:06----------
understand that yeah I want to try to


---------11:09----------
okay I want to try to word it better so


---------11:11----------
let's say I'm not trying we put really


---------11:12----------
put myself in a situation just woke up I


---------11:16----------
wake up and I'm like already nervous


---------11:19----------
about something or anxious is the word


---------11:21----------
maybe sure and I don't know what it is


---------11:25----------
and then I think that maybe it's the


---------11:29----------
dreams but I don't remember then I I


---------11:34----------
like to not look at my phone too quickly


---------11:36----------
when I wake up because I realized that


---------11:38----------
already kind of puts me in a bad state


---------11:39----------
of mind so I just sit there and like


---------11:42----------
breathe and think for a little bit


---------11:44----------
and then when I finally do look at my


---------11:46----------
phone I like go through some message I


---------11:48----------
might have gotten I don't really get


---------11:49----------
that many but you know that I respond as


---------11:53----------
people and then sometimes uh-hmm I'm


---------12:00----------
walking myself through it but I'm not


---------12:02----------
really getting anything okay um I'm just


---------12:07----------
curious about dreams do you have dreams


---------12:08----------
that are kind of like negative you sort


---------12:11----------
of always negative things bad things


---------12:15----------
happen to you in your dreams


---------12:17----------
yeah dreams of flying or falling falling


---------12:25----------
yeah falling okay not flying and like if


---------12:30----------
I remember them it's it's some weird


---------12:32----------
things like I was falling and I woke up


---------12:33----------
yeah


---------12:34----------
what about dreams of I don't know how to


---------12:40----------
say this but not so like persecution


---------12:45----------
isn't the right word but like dreams of


---------12:47----------
like disappointing people or like being


---------12:50----------
like I don't know how to describe this


---------12:53----------
but like dreams of like showing up to


---------12:55----------
class and forgetting that like


---------12:57----------
forgetting your homework at home does


---------12:59----------
those are my most common type okay


---------13:02----------
showing up there's always something I


---------13:04----------
forgot somewhere I am I don't have


---------13:06----------
something I'm not yeah exactly that's


---------13:11----------
the feeling well I mean maybe a lot of


---------13:13----------
people do I thought when I just was at


---------13:16----------
the airport and I like lost my bag or


---------13:19----------
something it's hard to remember exactly


---------13:21----------
what it was or just something was lost


---------13:23----------
while I was there and I just kept he was


---------13:26----------
an it was so long I just kept looking


---------13:27----------
for it forever and I just couldn't ever


---------13:30----------
find it and I was just stuck in this


---------13:32----------
loop for so yeah okay yeah so let's just


---------13:38----------
put a pin on that for a second so and


---------13:43----------
when you feel sad like let's say let's


---------13:45----------
talk about going to bed then when you go


---------13:48----------
when you go to bed how do you feel


---------13:55----------
depends on the day I guess if I feel if


---------13:59----------
the specific day I felt like I'm made


---------14:03----------
some progress toward my game finishing


---------14:06----------
or back before when I see a stream a lot


---------14:09----------
if I stream that day and I liked the


---------14:10----------
stream I'm going to yeah or if I hung


---------14:14----------
out with some people who were I felt a


---------14:17----------
connection with like a friends or


---------14:18----------
whatever um then I'll go to bed it like


---------14:24----------
more fulfilled and calm and a lot of


---------14:28----------
times I'll just go to bed though uh go


---------14:35----------
to bed a little bit lonely I mean ya


---------14:39----------
know how else to describe it I think


---------14:41----------
that's a good word so I think I'm gonna


---------14:46----------
try to offer something else


---------14:47----------
I think there's loneliness there and I


---------14:50----------
think there's also life not turning out


---------14:55----------
the way you thought it would like this


---------14:58----------
is not the life that you expected to be


---------15:00----------
living yeah I feel like it could be a


---------15:03----------
lot better and it doesn't seem like it


---------15:05----------
would be that difficult to get there I


---------15:07----------
could have more friends around somehow


---------15:11----------
I've tried to force it to happen


---------15:12----------
sometimes like really try to get people


---------15:16----------
to move to be near me and things like


---------15:19----------
that like friends to do that yeah but


---------15:21----------
it's led to bad situations when I did it


---------15:24----------
yeah


---------15:31----------
give me just a second okay yeah yeah so


---------15:42----------
it's almost like your life is like


---------15:43----------
you've gotten to the age of 30 and


---------15:45----------
you're in reckful z-- life but you like


---------15:48----------
you're at the airport of your life but


---------15:50----------
you left your bag at home like this is


---------15:53----------
not how things were supposed to wind up


---------15:55----------
you know it's like this this is not it's


---------16:02----------
not that anything is like wrong per se


---------16:04----------
like everything else is right but


---------16:05----------
there's just like one thing that's just


---------16:07----------
missing like this is just not how things


---------16:09----------
were supposed to be and not enough


---------16:12----------
friends around and I think the challenge


---------16:15----------
here reckful is that you know we can in


---------16:18----------
a bizarre way I'm gonna actually ask you


---------16:20----------
to kind of move past a lot of what we


---------16:22----------
talked about last time so I think living


---------16:23----------
a life of Dharma and like building


---------16:25----------
Everland and stuff like that is actually


---------16:26----------
really important I think it's good that


---------16:28----------
you're doing it and I want you to just


---------16:30----------
notice that I think to a certain degree


---------16:34----------
like that's your that's your medicine


---------16:37----------
and the problem here is that like as


---------16:40----------
long as your life is the way it is


---------16:41----------
you're always gonna need medicine to


---------16:43----------
make it feel better


---------16:46----------
the goal is yet okay but we the goal is


---------16:48----------
the goal is I feel good without medicine


---------16:50----------
exactly right so like it I don't I


---------16:54----------
really don't see that ever happening and


---------16:56----------
I know that's part of the problem no


---------16:58----------
it's not it's not part of the problem no


---------17:00----------
no no so don't do that to yourself don't


---------17:02----------
you don't judge yourself no I think it's


---------17:04----------
it's a completely reasonable logical and


---------17:07----------
intelligent conclusion because you have


---------17:12----------
30 years that have told you it's not


---------17:13----------
gonna happen so why the [ __ ] would you


---------17:18----------
like so this is this is where like I


---------17:20----------
don't like this power of positive


---------17:21----------
thinking and like you know hope and I


---------17:23----------
mean like hope is good but like let's


---------17:25----------
understand what where hope comes from


---------17:27----------
what so I think this is yeah no I don't


---------17:30----------
think that's part of the problem that's


---------17:31----------
fantastic that's where we start so let


---------17:34----------
me so what I'm getting from you reckful


---------17:36----------
is that there is just a seed of like


---------17:39----------
discontent that is actually like pretty


---------17:42----------
deep yeah that no matter like what you


---------17:45----------
do you can start to feel better but


---------17:47----------
there's just this one thing that you


---------17:48----------
can't shake yes so and and you know


---------17:56----------
there's a there's someone else who kind


---------17:58----------
of and you're pretty successful like


---------18:01----------
would you describe yourself that way


---------18:03----------
um I go in and out of thinking I'm


---------18:07----------
successful not let me put it this way do


---------18:10----------
you think that other people would be


---------18:11----------
happy to be in your shoes without my


---------18:15----------
mental state yes


---------18:17----------
okay the circumstance they have their


---------18:20----------
mental state yeah yeah yeah and I do


---------18:23----------
have some questions for you about like


---------18:25----------
your relationships and things like that


---------18:26----------
but I'm just gonna save those for a


---------18:28----------
little bit later so like you know who


---------18:30----------
else kind of felt like you did really


---------18:33----------
famous person there's a religion that's


---------18:38----------
sort of based off of teachings there's a


---------18:42----------
religion based as long as teachings of


---------18:44----------
Confucius no would that oh okay we're


---------18:48----------
gonna talk a little bit about Buddha for


---------18:50----------
a second so what do you know about very


---------18:54----------
little


---------18:54----------
although wait um okay wait I read the


---------19:00----------
book


---------19:01----------
Siddhartha or something okay when I was


---------19:05----------
do you know what what like what was


---------19:06----------
blood this job do you remember I feel


---------19:10----------
like he was like a prince or something


---------19:11----------
and then he left us that no bill yeah he


---------19:13----------
was a nobility and then he left


---------19:15----------
and Truckee wasn't happy there and then


---------19:17----------
they just wandered around so let's stop


---------19:20----------
right there that's that's fantastic


---------19:21----------
reckful so why did it why was he unhappy


---------19:23----------
do you remember what do you think felt


---------19:28----------
unfulfilled I did imagine ya just


---------19:31----------
sitting there he was born into wealth he


---------19:33----------
didn't have to do anything uh he wants


---------19:36----------
to somehow feel like he's helping the


---------19:38----------
world and some way maybe yeah but he


---------19:40----------
wasn't something like that yeah so I


---------19:43----------
think this is so you're in a very I


---------19:45----------
think you know you kind of say you're in


---------19:47----------
a hopeless position but I think that


---------19:49----------
you're in a in a difficult but wonderful


---------19:52----------
position which is that you're in you're


---------19:55----------
in the position that Gotham would this


---------19:57----------
started off with which is he woke up one


---------19:59----------
day and we have we all have this idea


---------20:01----------
that a certain thing is gonna give us


---------20:03----------
happiness like and this is easy if


---------20:06----------
you're one of the have-nots right like


---------20:07----------
if I wake up and I'm poor and I'm broke


---------20:09----------
and I have like credit card debt and I'm


---------20:11----------
we're gonna get evicted at the end of


---------20:12----------
the month and no one loves me then like


---------20:16----------
it's easy to think if someone loves me


---------20:18----------
or ideal like if the credit card debt


---------20:20----------
goes away or if I have stable housing or


---------20:22----------
things like that then I'll be happy with


---------20:24----------
me so then then you always have yeah you


---------20:25----------
always have a progression path when you


---------20:27----------
have a progression want yeah what was


---------20:29----------
what this progression path he when he


---------20:32----------
was a nobility doesn't know what it's


---------20:35----------
like would this like he's he's


---------20:37----------
nobility's a prince he's respected he's


---------20:39----------
loved he has power he has wealth he's


---------20:42----------
married to a beautiful woman with others


---------20:46----------
down the line should he want them yeah


---------20:48----------
and so


---------20:50----------
he wakes up and he's unhappy and he is


---------20:54----------
way more [ __ ] than the broke person


---------20:56----------
why


---------21:00----------
well this is really funny you asked me


---------21:03----------
because I had a one time I got clipped


---------21:06----------
saying being poor seems fun and it was


---------21:10----------
really bad did the people like it that


---------21:12----------
were really mad at me yeah but I just


---------21:14----------
wasn't context there sure those thing


---------21:17----------
there's a progression path for you yep


---------21:20----------
you have something to do which is


---------21:22----------
exactly we're talking about so yeah so


---------21:25----------
wait why is what the more screwed than


---------21:28----------
the person who's broke because he has he


---------21:33----------
doesn't know what to do to seek


---------21:34----------
fulfillment exactly in fact he has done


---------21:37----------
everything to see like all of the goals


---------21:40----------
that people strive for that give them


---------21:41----------
meaning and progression in life but that


---------21:44----------
is just [ __ ] because he's gotten all


---------21:47----------
of those things and it's like well now


---------21:48----------
what it's like imagine playing a game


---------21:51----------
that you beat and the game doesn't end


---------21:53----------
like that is the most [ __ ] boring


---------21:58----------
game in the world depends on the game


---------22:00----------
but yeah sometimes right well no I mean


---------22:02----------
like imagine there's like nothing like


---------22:03----------
your post the last boss and you're like


---------22:05----------
in the chamber where you've like slain


---------22:07----------
the last boss and you're just hanging


---------22:09----------
out okay yeah okay there's nothing to do


---------22:12----------
in the game yeah you'd have to be able


---------22:14----------
to go back to previous levels yeah but


---------22:16----------
like that's not that you know that's not


---------22:19----------
like I mean so would that could in


---------22:21----------
theory I guess he could go and and well


---------22:24----------
that's what he did right is he he gave


---------22:25----------
up his welfare you gave up what about


---------22:27----------
the previous levels yeah he didn't do


---------22:29----------
game plus right yeah and and so I think


---------22:33----------
this is a subtle but important point


---------22:34----------
because I think that and so there's a


---------22:37----------
great text called Patanjali Yoga Sutras


---------22:40----------
and so sutras are translated as like


---------22:44----------
threads or lines there so like the old


---------22:48----------
like Hindu and Buddhist texts or Sutra


---------22:52----------
so they're not like texts they're like


---------22:54----------
they're like poems or they're like


---------22:56----------
hundreds of lines long so they're each


---------22:59----------
like kind of like an equation so there's


---------23:01----------
not like any filler there's no


---------23:02----------
explanation there's no it's like all


---------23:05----------
like equals a MC squared y equals MX


---------23:07----------
plus B like it's just a bunch of


---------23:09----------
equations and the idea and the reason is


---------23:11----------
because they were passed down through


---------23:12----------
oral tradition


---------23:13----------
they had to be memorized so like if you


---------23:15----------
if you can memorize 50 equations like


---------23:17----------
you can understand algebra and you can


---------23:18----------
teach algebra and things like that does


---------23:20----------
that make sense I was trying to follow


---------23:23----------
well while I was trying to follow I


---------23:25----------
realized I had to pee and then I was


---------23:26----------
like why am I getting distracted by this


---------23:28----------
and then also your mic cut out one time


---------23:29----------
and I got a strike okay so go pee go pee


---------23:34----------
but just kind of going back to sutras


---------23:37----------
so like sutras are there they're like


---------23:41----------
lines so they're very short and there's


---------23:43----------
a weird thing in Patanjali yoga sutras


---------23:45----------
which is that the first word of his


---------23:47----------
sutras is now and it's kind of a weird


---------23:51----------
thing like if you have a if you have


---------23:53----------
just like a list of it like math


---------23:54----------
equations like the word now doesn't


---------23:56----------
belong there does that make sense like


---------23:58----------
if you ever read a book that starts with


---------24:00----------
the word now I remember what word most


---------24:05----------
books start with like like there's no


---------24:09----------
textbook that's like now we're gonna


---------24:11----------
talk about algebra like that's something


---------24:13----------
that you say if you're making a


---------24:14----------
transition but like no written thing


---------24:16----------
starts with the word now okay


---------24:19----------
this reminds me of the power of No yeah


---------24:21----------
well that's that cart toll right yeah


---------24:22----------
but so the interesting thing about it


---------24:25----------
and so a lot of times people were


---------24:26----------
wondering like for Patanjali who's his


---------24:28----------
his sutras are like really really dense


---------24:30----------
so for example one of his sutras or one


---------24:33----------
of the lines of his sutras is great is


---------24:34----------
says that Yoga is something that's yoga


---------24:37----------
chitta vritti nirodh aha' which means


---------24:39----------
Yoga is the practice of cessation of


---------24:42----------
fluctuations of the mind it's a practice


---------24:45----------
of cessation of fluctuations of the mind


---------24:48----------
yes that's the point of Yoga is to stop


---------24:51----------
the fluctuations of the mind so it's


---------24:53----------
like really like dense kind of like


---------24:54----------
meaningful sort of things and so it's


---------24:56----------
weird that he starts with the word now


---------24:58----------
because and people were like why on


---------25:01----------
earth is he saying now like isn't it


---------25:02----------
obvious when you pick up a book that


---------25:04----------
you're reading the book to make it more


---------25:06----------
present do you think about the present


---------25:08----------
moment maybe so on the contrary so like


---------25:11----------
what what people sort of hypothesized is


---------25:13----------
that actually he says that Yoga starts


---------25:16----------
with desperation


---------25:17----------
that like now so is his first line is


---------25:21----------
now the science of yoga and reckful I


---------25:24----------
think now you are ready for yoga because


---------25:26----------
you have reached a point where like


---------25:28----------
nothing else is giving you happiness and


---------25:30----------
that is when the path of yoga begins


---------25:32----------
it starts out of desperation your it


---------25:34----------
starts with wood the wood though like


---------25:36----------
what wheat what most of us think of as


---------25:38----------
the endgame is like beating the game is


---------25:40----------
where Buddha started and Buddha's


---------25:43----------
journey of yoga oh yeah like Buddha's


---------25:47----------
path for enlightenment began at the end


---------25:50----------
of most people's games right he achieved


---------25:53----------
everything or was given everything that


---------25:55----------
most people strive for and so like the


---------25:57----------
search for spirituality starts like


---------25:59----------
actually when your material desires are


---------26:01----------
fulfilled and you wake up one day and


---------26:03----------
you're unhappy so then you're like oh


---------26:05----------
[ __ ] now like I'm just [ __ ] I don't


---------26:09----------
think that this is ever gonna get better


---------26:11----------
that's the conclusion you come to


---------26:13----------
because all of the things that you think


---------26:15----------
are gonna make it better or things that


---------26:16----------
maybe on some level you already have


---------26:18----------
right so I think like the other thing


---------26:19----------
here is like I'm not I'm curious about


---------26:21----------
your relationships cuz that's not


---------26:23----------
something that I know anything about but


---------26:24----------
I wonder about your sense of loneliness


---------26:25----------
and better relationships yeah but


---------26:29----------
generally speaking I think this is


---------26:31----------
actually a great place to start because


---------26:32----------
you're sort of desperate because nothing


---------26:35----------
is gonna fix your problem and that's


---------26:37----------
when you really go looking so that was


---------26:39----------
another long time yes and Buddha was too


---------26:42----------
and then but they decided I don't think


---------26:44----------
you need to do this but but they decided


---------26:46----------
that he was like I'm gonna I'm gonna


---------26:47----------
give this up and go look for an answer


---------26:49----------
because I've heard out there that there


---------26:51----------
are ways people who supposedly claim


---------26:53----------
that they can lead to like peace and


---------26:55----------
contentment and I'm gonna go look for


---------26:57----------
that and all this stuff is not bringing


---------26:59----------
me happiness I didn't do it to the same


---------27:00----------
extent Saul riding around I didn't do it


---------27:02----------
to the same extent but I just like stop


---------27:03----------
streaming go travel do things that


---------27:06----------
people say make some happy things like


---------27:07----------
yeah


---------27:08----------
and so you've explored just like would


---------27:10----------
the did and now you need to start the


---------27:12----------
path of yoga which is like sadhana


---------27:15----------
saadon that means like dedicated


---------27:16----------
spiritual practice so this is like


---------27:19----------
learning how to and you know we can talk


---------27:21----------
about how you can do that but like so


---------27:24----------
the path that I follow is something


---------27:25----------
called Raja yoga and Raja Yoga is the


---------27:28----------
kings path or the Eightfold Path and it


---------27:30----------
believes that the way


---------27:31----------
to get to enlightenment is like a


---------27:33----------
stepwise sequential thing you level up


---------27:35----------
basically it starts with personal


---------27:36----------
observances and societal observances


---------27:39----------
goes to yoga postures breathing


---------27:42----------
techniques sensory deprivation or


---------27:45----------
sensory withdrawal techniques which is


---------27:46----------
techniques that allow you to withdraw


---------27:48----------
the attention from your senses too and


---------27:52----------
redirect it inward so generally speaking


---------27:54----------
our attention like is engaged in the


---------27:56----------
senses all the time so to redirect that


---------27:58----------
inward to focus to meditate and then to


---------28:01----------
gain a state of temporary enlightenment


---------28:03----------
I when you said breathing I realized the


---------28:09----------
way I breathe


---------28:10----------
any time I find myself and start


---------28:13----------
manually breathing I feel instantly


---------28:15----------
happier yes I think the way I breathe my


---------28:20----------
automatic breathing can I train my


---------28:22----------
automatic breathing to be in a better


---------28:24----------
way


---------28:24----------
or is it too late yes because it's


---------28:28----------
always like short breaths you know yep


---------28:30----------
but when I really think about it and


---------28:32----------
breathe deep I feel calmer yeah so


---------28:36----------
that's exactly why the fourth step of


---------28:38----------
this process is Brown I am Brown I am is


---------28:40----------
breathing techniques and the reason is


---------28:42----------
because the way to control the mind is


---------28:44----------
through the breath so but Anjali figured


---------28:47----------
out that each mood that we have and I've


---------28:50----------
done this before on screen but we can do


---------28:52----------
it again because by the way our stream


---------28:53----------
is blown up gigantically since our time


---------28:56----------
together so thank you for that but we


---------28:58----------
can do this again so like let's just


---------29:00----------
talk about breath for a second let's


---------29:01----------
help you understand breathing and what


---------29:05----------
effect it has on your mind and what the


---------29:06----------
relationship between mind and breath is


---------29:08----------
so first of all reckful what do you


---------29:10----------
think is the relationship between your


---------29:12----------
mind and your breath


---------29:17----------
hmm well I guess the breaths are the


---------29:25----------
food of the mind right what does that


---------29:27----------
mean it means the oxygen surely to the


---------29:33----------
air so I'm gonna offer a couple of very


---------29:35----------
difficult ground rules no philosophy no


---------29:38----------
Theory no science just experience okay


---------29:43----------
okay that's better I like the better


---------29:44----------
okay so let me write what is the


---------29:47----------
relationship between your breath and


---------29:50----------
your mind well like I was saying if I am


---------29:54----------
my automatic breathing he always feels a


---------29:56----------
little hurried and if I take a moment


---------29:58----------
and breathe deeper then I feel calm


---------30:01----------
so I guess my state of mind depends on


---------30:05----------
how I'm breathing to some extent I I


---------30:12----------
wouldn't say that the outside influences


---------30:15----------
don't matter at all because some people


---------30:17----------
will go to that extent but for me that


---------30:19----------
isn't true sure but uh so breath


---------30:24----------
influences mind yes it does influence it


---------30:27----------
for sure does mind influence breath yes


---------30:34----------
okay so so are there certain patterns of


---------30:39----------
so let me ask you this I want you to I'm


---------30:41----------
just gonna breathe and I want you to


---------30:43----------
tell me what I'm feeling nervous or I


---------30:51----------
guess people call it anxious or you're


---------30:57----------
scared maybe even okay now this one what


---------31:05----------
is that


---------31:05----------
do it again I think that's just tired


---------31:12----------
just you've worked out or something okay


---------31:14----------
that's not it it's not what I was going


---------31:17----------
for but that's okay okay that's fine


---------31:20----------
so let's do this one it


---------31:31----------
right so let's just think about this for


---------31:34----------
a second okay let me try to see if I can


---------31:36----------
do another one okay I'm gonna do a


---------31:38----------
couple of difference you're a little


---------31:48----------
worried about something absolutely right


---------31:50----------
little worried about some then there's


---------31:52----------
this you're starting to be afraid yeah


---------31:57----------
right so worried and fear so just let's


---------32:00----------
just think about what you're doing right


---------32:01----------
now how are you able to determine what


---------32:06----------
is going on in my mind what are you


---------32:08----------
observing the breath well maybe a little


---------32:12----------
bit of facial expression too but it's


---------32:13----------
the breath right I could do it with the


---------32:15----------
eyes closed I think yeah yeah actually


---------32:16----------
you were doing it better with eyes


---------32:18----------
closed like there was a time I don't


---------32:19----------
know if you noticed but what do you


---------32:21----------
closed your eyes and you listened and


---------32:22----------
that's when you could tell right so it's


---------32:25----------
kind of weird and then so the first


---------32:28----------
thing to understand is that like there


---------32:29----------
are patterns of breath that are


---------32:31----------
associated with certain moves so now the


---------32:33----------
question is is it a two-way street if I


---------32:36----------
adopt a pattern of breath that is


---------32:38----------
anxious or fearful will I become anxious


---------32:41----------
or fearful I think you will become a


---------32:44----------
little more anxious and fearful yes


---------32:45----------
absolutely right so now let's think


---------32:47----------
about that what does that mean for the


---------32:49----------
moods that you experience reckful well


---------32:52----------
it means I can start a pattern of


---------32:55----------
breathing that will make me more calm


---------32:58----------
and maybe I could achieve the serenity I


---------33:00----------
want absolutely


---------33:03----------
that yeah so you I mean this all started


---------33:07----------
because you discovered this on your own


---------33:08----------
you said oh [ __ ] sometimes like when I'm


---------33:11----------
feeling bad I noticed that my breaths


---------33:13----------
are shallow and if I change the way that


---------33:15----------
I breathe I feel better instantly and as


---------33:18----------
a whole humanity understands this


---------33:20----------
because what do we tell people who are


---------33:21----------
freaking out take a deep breath


---------33:23----------
absolutely right and look why the [ __ ]


---------33:26----------
does that like why do we say that is


---------33:28----------
that just like societal or is there some


---------33:32----------
physiology from dollars we learned over


---------33:34----------
thousands of years we keep back


---------33:35----------
absolutely it's [ __ ] it's not rocket


---------33:37----------
science right it's just like hey man


---------33:39----------
like slow the [ __ ] down take a few deep


---------33:42----------
breaths tell me what's going on right


---------33:44----------
that's what we tell people and then the


---------33:47----------
mind-blowing thing is that that that


---------33:49----------
this [ __ ] works that it actually works


---------33:52----------
and so if you can control your breath


---------33:56----------
which is what the practice of brown I am


---------33:57----------
is then you can control your mind so


---------34:01----------
there are a couple of things that we're


---------34:02----------
gonna tunnel down a little bit further


---------34:03----------
okay so what are the different qualities


---------34:06----------
of breath so like how do i how do I like


---------34:09----------
the different patterns of breathing that


---------34:11----------
I was giving you what are the different


---------34:14----------
things that how are those things


---------34:16----------
different how are those patterns of


---------34:17----------
breath different like what are the


---------34:20----------
qualities of them like what are the


---------34:22----------
stats or attributes of different


---------34:24----------
breathing patterns mean excellent


---------34:27----------
perfect that's it


---------34:28----------
got it beautifully enough okay so let's


---------34:32----------
just think about this if I am breathing


---------34:36----------
rapidly and shallowly


---------34:39----------
what emotion do you think that is


---------34:43----------
worried absolutely right


---------34:47----------
so if I'm breathing shallowly and slow


---------34:49----------
what emotion do you think that is


---------34:54----------
shallowly and slow shelley and [ __ ] a


---------34:58----------
rare one it's net weight shallow and


---------35:00----------
slow pay attention to yourself because I


---------35:03----------
breathe you breathe that way a lot I


---------35:05----------
think you breathe that way in the


---------35:06----------
morning in at night oh man really okay


---------35:12----------
well I know my feeling but that's not


---------35:14----------
everyone else's fact my feeling is like


---------35:16----------
cares about everyone else's feeling okay


---------35:18----------
so my feeling that I'm having when I'm


---------35:19----------
breathing this way is I need to be ready


---------35:22----------
at any moment I need to be ready at any


---------35:27----------
moment to answer someone with something


---------35:32----------
they'd like can we just call it being at


---------35:35----------
the airport without your bag not sure


---------35:39----------
okay what's that anxiety maybe it's


---------35:45----------
anxiety but uh what I'm feeling okay


---------35:47----------
like a lot of times I'm hanging out with


---------35:48----------
people and I put this pressure on myself


---------35:51----------
to be the person who keeps the


---------35:54----------
conversation going so I'm having these


---------35:57----------
kind of breaths that I'm kind of ready


---------35:59----------
to fill the shallows empty space okay so


---------36:05----------
I think there's something I don't know


---------36:07----------
if you want to turn to chat at some


---------36:09----------
point we can also remove chat to help us


---------36:12----------
out or we are talking what do you think


---------36:14----------
we should do charts interesting let's


---------36:17----------
see what they're saying so chat what do


---------36:19----------
you guys think that shallow and slow is


---------36:22----------
which is weird because generally we


---------36:23----------
think about shallow and and it's like if


---------36:26----------
we're breathing slowly we associate that


---------36:28----------
with long a lot of people said sad or


---------36:30----------
anxiety but I feel like I breathe like


---------36:32----------
that all the time yeah so I think that's


---------36:35----------
on the sadness spectrum and that anxiety


---------36:38----------
is more like rapid and shallow right


---------36:43----------
when I think about someone who's anxious


---------36:44----------
oh man and then just like kind of slow


---------36:50----------
breaths that are more shallow I think of


---------36:52----------
as more of sad someone with spending


---------36:54----------
insecurity which is not false not false


---------36:59----------
so there I mean I'm simplifying the


---------37:01----------
breath but they're there all kinds of


---------37:03----------
nuances to the breath which we can dig


---------37:05----------
into further and further and further


---------37:07----------
there's a whole branch of yoga called


---------37:09----------
soiree yoga which is all about the


---------37:12----------
different mechanisms of breath and they


---------37:14----------
even get so not only like which nostril


---------37:17----------
is more open than the other because that


---------37:19----------
correlates with mood like right now


---------37:21----------
everyone thinks that both of their


---------37:22----------
nostrils are open all the time but one


---------37:24----------
of your nostrils is open at a time usual


---------37:26----------
and like which one are your nostrils is


---------37:29----------
more open can you tell the right one


---------37:31----------
okay


---------37:32----------
so we'll check and if you want you if


---------37:34----------
you want to switch it you let me know


---------37:35----------
I'll show you how to switch it so


---------37:39----------
they're there more so we're gonna sort


---------37:41----------
of start with some people I don't know


---------37:42----------
right now how do you switch it okay I


---------37:46----------
mean it's it's gonna interrupt the flow


---------37:48----------
of the stream though because it takes


---------37:49----------
some time but we can do it yeah I mean


---------37:53----------
we could do it if y'all want to so this


---------37:54----------
is this will be our formal meditation


---------37:56----------
technique at the end of the art tak talk


---------38:00----------
today okay someone it's that's it left


---------38:02----------
game later okay there sing later yeah so


---------38:07----------
then then let's let's go through a


---------38:08----------
couple of other emotions so what is


---------38:10----------
rapid and deep breaths what emotion is


---------38:13----------
that what would you guys say that is


---------38:23----------
there's think panic or anger all right


---------38:27----------
so I'll show you one more time reckful


---------38:34----------
what is yeah I is this the one that I


---------38:38----------
said you just worked out and I messed up


---------38:40----------
or no just what do you think it is


---------38:41----------
forget about what you said earlier you


---------38:48----------
just you just got past something hard


---------38:54----------
okay I mean that's what I would but


---------38:57----------
that's just me specifically yeah so I


---------38:59----------
think this is important so I'm talking


---------39:01----------
like I have answers but it's important


---------39:04----------
to remember that everyone's perspective


---------39:06----------
is gonna be different and so you guys


---------39:07----------
should explore this for yourself so in


---------39:09----------
my mind that's anger so when I what I do


---------39:12----------
when I create that pattern of breathing


---------39:13----------
is I think about something that no I


---------39:15----------
don't hang out with a lot of angry


---------39:16----------
people I don't think that's okay yeah so


---------39:18----------
the other thing is one person some


---------39:20----------
people in my chat said sex and I think


---------39:22----------
sex is a spectrum so if you breathe


---------39:25----------
deeply and a little bit more slowly than


---------39:28----------
anger then I think it's arousal right


---------39:30----------
that's how you get the sex it's just a


---------39:32----------
little all I have to do is breathe a


---------39:33----------
little deeper than lust lust so this is


---------39:37----------
this is lust right so okay


---------39:40----------
oh the eyebrow is involuntary because


---------39:48----------
it's like yeah so so that's that's like


---------39:54----------
that's arousal so arousal is also kind


---------39:56----------
of an emotional state so we can look at


---------39:59----------
other things right and then there's


---------40:00----------
calmness which is sort of like then


---------40:01----------
there's chilled out and then there's


---------40:03----------
like calm which are two different things


---------40:05----------
like there are so many gradations of the


---------40:07----------
state of our mind so chill this is kind


---------40:10----------
of like you know we're gonna we're gonna


---------40:11----------
smoke weed and we're gonna chill out and


---------40:13----------
we're gonna like you know like just


---------40:14----------
that's like the as I killed out and then


---------40:19----------
there's like true like sort of peaceful


---------40:23----------
kind of like meditative breathing right


---------40:26----------
and if you do this you're gonna have


---------40:28----------
like a respiratory rate of like four per


---------40:30----------
minute there's one time in my life I


---------40:34----------
remember I was in Amsterdam and I had


---------40:40----------
just done a very big mushroom dose but


---------40:42----------
it was after it ended and I was sitting


---------40:46----------
in a Chinese restaurant with a cup of


---------40:49----------
tea and it was the most peaceful I ever


---------40:55----------
felt I've never experienced this feeling


---------40:59----------
again I want to be there yes so that's


---------41:04----------
what needs to change right so I think


---------41:06----------
that like we could talk about the hunt


---------41:08----------
of all all you want to we can talk about


---------41:09----------
getting you know we can talk about like


---------41:14----------
treatment of depression and sadness but


---------41:16----------
I think at the end of the day reckful


---------41:18----------
what needs to change for you to truly be


---------41:20----------
not lonely anymore


---------41:21----------
it needs to like you need to cultivate


---------41:24----------
that part of yourself you need to give


---------41:26----------
yourself that experience time and time


---------41:28----------
and time again and just like your breath


---------41:30----------
through which you can train like


---------41:32----------
voluntarily first and eventually it


---------41:35----------
becomes involuntary kind of like driving


---------41:37----------
right like when we learn a skill I


---------41:39----------
really want to be involuntary I would


---------41:41----------
love that but I yes how much training do


---------41:44----------
you think huh I mean I want to do it no


---------41:46----------
matter what but how much time will it


---------41:47----------
take for my breath to involuntarily be


---------41:52----------
deeper and slower so science says


---------41:55----------
somewhere around eight weeks I'd say it


---------41:58----------
somewhere around a year yeah a year okay


---------42:00----------
like so talk about what I'm talking


---------42:02----------
about is not even science that's beyond


---------42:04----------
science but science all of the clinical


---------42:06----------
trials that look at meditation for


---------42:09----------
treatment of depression and anxiety and


---------42:11----------
things like that show a clinically


---------42:13----------
significant all of the effect sizes and


---------42:17----------
average all of the duration of trials


---------42:19----------
there are 12-week trials there are four


---------42:20----------
week trials there are six week trials or


---------42:22----------
eight-week trials basically like my


---------42:23----------
conclusion is that if you average all


---------42:25----------
that [ __ ] together the average person


---------42:28----------
needs eight weeks have dedicated


---------42:29----------
meditative practice to create a


---------42:30----------
clinically significant improvement in


---------42:34----------
depression or anxiety so my answer to


---------42:38----------
you is very long eight weeks but I think


---------42:40----------
that that's for depression or anxiety I


---------42:43----------
think to get to what we're talking about


---------42:44----------
which is looking at your cup of tea is


---------42:46----------
gonna take way longer you may have


---------42:49----------
moments but you want to be able to like


---------42:51----------
have that sense of peace within you and


---------42:53----------
I think that's really what you're what


---------42:55----------
is missing so I think like you don't you


---------42:57----------
don't there's something like missing in


---------43:01----------
you like something fundamental and this


---------43:04----------
I don't think it's necessarily like go


---------43:07----------
ahead I was gonna say what are you


---------43:10----------
feeling


---------43:12----------
you hit me that's it


---------43:18----------
okay so just notice yourself


---------43:22----------
notice your breathing


---------43:28----------
so as you change the breath the mind


---------43:30----------
changes yeah you don't have to change


---------43:35----------
the mind you decide whether you want to


---------43:36----------
feel what you're feeling and let the


---------43:38----------
breath be natural or you want to control


---------43:40----------
the breathing I'm fine okay good job


---------43:50----------
so what so let's just think about what


---------43:52----------
just happened right so like something


---------43:54----------
you felt something something resonated


---------43:57----------
and then the emotions came up your mind


---------43:59----------
started to think and experience certain


---------44:01----------
things are not quite sure what and using


---------44:03----------
the breath you restrained or calm to


---------44:05----------
those feelings and you know I think last


---------44:09----------
time I guess the track we got on was to


---------44:11----------
explore those feelings this time I want


---------44:14----------
to teach you something else so it's not


---------44:16----------
necessarily about exploring those


---------44:17----------
feelings right now unless you want to


---------44:19----------
but I think


---------44:25----------
leave that there's that whatever in me


---------44:27----------
that's missing that I can fill it so


---------44:31----------
this is the other really important thing


---------44:33----------
to understand that thing within that is


---------44:36----------
missing within you is also a calling


---------44:39----------
I think I have the calling though now I


---------44:42----------
feel like I have four career feeling I


---------44:45----------
feel like I have it what I want yes so


---------44:49----------
calling is about more than a career


---------44:52----------
right so this is something within you


---------44:54----------
that is not allowing you to be content


---------44:57----------
this is something within you that is


---------44:59----------
stripe that is pushing you to explore


---------45:02----------
and learn and grow because this is not


---------45:05----------
it's not read it's not satisfied so


---------45:10----------
that's the same thing that would the


---------45:11----------
head like he just like felt like


---------45:14----------
something was missing and so so and you


---------45:17----------
say like nothing is ever gonna change


---------45:18----------
that because for 30 years nothing has


---------45:20----------
ever been able to change it I just want


---------45:22----------
to wake up and be around a lot of


---------45:25----------
friends and have a lot of people


---------45:26----------
laughing and about random things yeah


---------45:29----------
maybe sit on a couch and take turns


---------45:32----------
playing some games casually


---------45:33----------
okay that's and then I wanna that that's


---------45:39----------
the other thing I always feel like it


---------45:40----------
was missing that I want yes but the


---------45:42----------
thing is with the career um I always


---------45:46----------
felt like that was missing but now that


---------45:48----------
I'm working on my game I feel like that


---------45:50----------
part I I do what I want okay doing what


---------45:52----------
I always wanted to do maybe I'm not


---------45:55----------
there yet and like my game will come out


---------45:57----------
and then when I'm actually seeing people


---------45:59----------
play it and I'm patching it you know and


---------46:02----------
taking their feedback and things like


---------46:03----------
that and making it better then maybe


---------46:05----------
it'll feel it's more in the state of


---------46:08----------
where I want to be okay you know


---------46:11----------
so reckful I think we've got one of two


---------46:14----------
choices so one is that so my hypothesis


---------46:17----------
is that you should strive to create a


---------46:19----------
life filled with people who enjoy your


---------46:22----------
company and who you feel relaxed and


---------46:24----------
like fulfilled by and I suspect once you


---------46:29----------
get that one day you're gonna wake up


---------46:31----------
and you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] this


---------46:32----------
feeling isn't gone yeah that's scary cuz


---------46:37----------
at least right now I have a goal because


---------46:38----------
I don't have a goal that I want some


---------46:40----------
friends around if I have a bunch of


---------46:41----------
friends around and then I still feel


---------46:43----------
empty inside I


---------46:45----------
I don't know yeah so so let's talk about


---------46:53----------
friends for a second so tell me a little


---------46:55----------
bit about are you tell me a little bit


---------46:57----------
about your situation like um you know it


---------46:59----------
seems like you're really hunger in for


---------47:02----------
relationships and companionship


---------47:06----------
you


---------47:09----------
okay well the first thing I came in mind


---------47:12----------
is just being in school


---------47:15----------
um I I don't know why for some reason


---------47:20----------
when I was in school no one liked me


---------47:22----------
now people like me on the Internet but


---------47:25----------
uh


---------47:28----------
I didn't have any friends um very


---------47:34----------
isolating going to school every day


---------47:35----------
having no friends


---------47:38----------
you see but also good friends for years


---------47:40----------
you don't have any um but I feel like I


---------47:50----------
could get over that what is it really


---------47:55----------
how did you feel when you were in school


---------47:58----------
I mean I felt terrible what does that


---------48:03----------
mean


---------48:08----------
I don't know it's hard to put myself


---------48:12----------
back


---------48:16----------
it's unrelated I mean people will


---------48:17----------
understand what it is I don't have to


---------48:19----------
actually like put myself in the emotion


---------48:21----------
and experience it again


---------48:22----------
sure people like the feeling of not


---------48:25----------
being included in things or


---------48:28----------
[Music]


---------48:33----------
I don't I don't really know how to


---------48:37----------
describe it exactly yeah I think not


---------48:39----------
being included is a great way to start


---------48:42----------
because what I'm hearing from you is


---------48:45----------
inclusion is what you're looking for


---------48:48----------
right like what would this this picture


---------48:49----------
that you painted of like people just


---------48:50----------
being around yeah yeah reckful like you


---------48:53----------
want to grab some food like yeah man


---------48:55----------
like you want to play some Smash


---------48:56----------
Brothers like it yeah man yeah like okay


---------48:58----------
so right before we did our talk I went


---------49:01----------
live on Instagram I got text like five


---------49:03----------
people no one want to get food that day


---------49:05----------
and I went live on Instagram and asked


---------49:07----------
if anyone wanted to get food with me and


---------49:09----------
then I met up with a viewer to get


---------49:12----------
dinner like that's how much I'm seeking


---------49:15----------
like someone to talk to you yeah yeah


---------49:22----------
we talked about some scars last time a


---------49:26----------
lot of the terminology the harm I


---------49:30----------
remember that one but a lot of the


---------49:32----------
terminology I don't remember so I think


---------49:37----------
I'm just thinking about timing


---------49:49----------
I'm just trying to think about how to


---------49:50----------
say this stuff in a way that doesn't


---------49:52----------
make it seem obvious or informational


---------49:54----------
but can it be a little bit more


---------49:57----------
impactful or transformative I'm


---------50:00----------
wondering if I should tell you some more


---------50:02----------
stories or something for my do you like


---------50:04----------
to listen to people's childhood and


---------50:06----------
things like that it's very open yeah


---------50:08----------
yeah I'm I'm also just thinking a little


---------50:10----------
bit about time because I don't want to


---------50:12----------
lose track of the earlier stuff that we


---------50:15----------
were talking about and I'm just trying


---------50:17----------
to decide a little bit about the


---------50:19----------
cost-benefit of like really hammering


---------50:22----------
something down like would you be better


---------50:24----------
served by just hammering down the breath


---------50:27----------
and implementing that change or by like


---------50:29----------
really opening up this topic in like a


---------50:31----------
new way because I feel like if we talk I


---------50:34----------
want to open it up in a new way yeah


---------50:35----------
okay


---------50:36----------
so then then okay so then tell me a


---------50:39----------
little I mean um although the breath


---------50:42----------
thing yes things more direct and it


---------50:45----------
helped me right away yes so I I'm


---------50:47----------
actually gonna do something that I think


---------50:48----------
a lot of people including yourself are


---------50:50----------
gonna find unsatisfying sorry about for


---------50:53----------
a while sorry I was gonna say I'm


---------50:55----------
actually thinking about doing something


---------50:56----------
that you and probably twitch chat will


---------50:58----------
find unsatisfying because I think we're


---------51:00----------
on the cusp of something important for


---------51:02----------
you but at the same time I think it is


---------51:04----------
important to recognize that change is


---------51:07----------
not necessarily following change doesn't


---------51:10----------
come about by following the thing that


---------51:12----------
we feel like doing change comes about by


---------51:15----------
doing the thing that we really need to


---------51:16----------
do and I think we're actually at that


---------51:19----------
juncture right now where the last time


---------51:21----------
we talked there was something kind of


---------51:22----------
emotionally transformative about our


---------51:24----------
time together and now we have another


---------51:26----------
opportunity to basically do like episode


---------51:28----------
2 of last time but what I'm really


---------51:31----------
wondering is are you gonna be better


---------51:33----------
served by doing episode 2 of last time


---------51:35----------
or by you actually like settling down


---------51:38----------
and like Nate or like nailing in nailing


---------51:41----------
down I guess this with the work that I'm


---------51:42----------
phrase I'm looking for this issue of the


---------51:44----------
breath and starting to implement that


---------51:46----------
change like a year from now which one is


---------51:50----------
yeah so I'm just trying to think a


---------51:52----------
little bit about timing and like which


---------51:54----------
one I feel like we should do the breath


---------51:56----------
thing first even though I imagine that


---------51:59----------
that will feel unsatisfying to you it's


---------52:03----------
not super incessant like I could do it


---------52:05----------
okay okay so I'm gonna try to yeah so I


---------52:10----------
think this is what we have to do and we


---------52:12----------
can talk about emotions and childhood


---------52:13----------
and Loan we got to dig into that but I


---------52:15----------
think that's gonna be like a whole


---------52:16----------
nother hour at a minimum so I think this


---------52:19----------
is what I want you to do I'm gonna try


---------52:21----------
to give you a sense of the teacup that


---------52:25----------
you had on shrooms which is hard because


---------52:27----------
you weren't shrooms but we're gonna try


---------52:28----------
to get you there a little bit okay so


---------52:30----------
which of your nostrils is open now right


---------52:33----------
okay the right one so the right one


---------52:36----------
you're sure about that


---------52:39----------
yeah okay so I want everyone to check


---------52:42----------
right so you can do it this way and one


---------52:45----------
of them is gonna be more open reckful


---------52:47----------
now what I want you to do so this is


---------52:49----------
great because your bread is in the


---------52:49----------
picture I want you too late because your


---------52:52----------
bed is in the picture sure I want you to


---------52:55----------
lay down on your bed oh wait not yet not


---------52:58----------
yet still hear you with the speakers


---------52:59----------
okay so so but don't do it yet because I


---------53:02----------
want you to so this is what I want you


---------53:04----------
to do when you lay down in your bed I


---------53:07----------
want you to with each breath and you


---------53:09----------
guys should do this at home too with


---------53:10----------
each breath notice which of your


---------53:13----------
nostrils is open so just focus on the


---------53:15----------
nostril that's open and then when you


---------53:17----------
feel the shift I want you to sit and


---------53:20----------
feel that shift as closely as you can


---------53:24----------
try to feel that shift from right to


---------53:26----------
left it with as much attention as you


---------53:28----------
can okay and then we're gonna talk about


---------53:31----------
what that experience is like and the


---------53:33----------
practice ends when your other nostril


---------53:35----------
switches and is like securely there for


---------53:38----------
like ten breaths okay I lie down yes and


---------53:43----------
Payet H breath which are focusing on


---------53:46----------
close your eyes with each breath focus


---------53:48----------
on the which of your nostrils is open


---------53:50----------
and then you're gonna feel a transition


---------53:52----------
and try to sit fully within that


---------53:53----------
transition and then the transition we're


---------53:55----------
gonna get it from the right nostril to


---------53:57----------
the left you're not trying to get it


---------53:59----------
it's gonna happen on its own and you're


---------54:00----------
just gonna watch it and as it so this is


---------54:03----------
what I want you to do imagine that


---------54:04----------
you're the wave is coming in and out


---------54:06----------
from the ocean and sometimes you just


---------54:08----------
stand and you just feel the water right


---------54:10----------
you're not doing anything to the water


---------54:12----------
you're not bringing the water the waters


---------54:14----------
are doing it on its own you're just


---------54:15----------
sitting in the water so I want you to


---------54:17----------
just sit in the transition and just feel


---------54:19----------
it lay down on your right and just put


---------54:27----------
full attention to which of your nostrils


---------54:29----------
is open on your right so right side down


---------54:35----------
yapper it oh so put put put put your arm


---------54:39----------
put put your right arm under you right


---------54:44----------
arm under like this yeah under under


---------54:47----------
under your body yeah yeah so just lay


---------54:51----------
down on your right side I know you don't


---------54:55----------
I know you don't I know you don't but do


---------54:57----------
it this time and try to be yeah don't


---------55:01----------
curl no no no curling just lay down yeah


---------55:05----------
so just scoot down a little bit so this


---------55:12----------
is [ __ ] weird I know


---------55:13----------
fold the pillow in half and tuck it


---------55:14----------
under your head yes perfect close your


---------55:22----------
eyes and watch you guys do it - lay down


---------55:30----------
on whichever side the nostril is open


---------55:38----------
and then close your eyes and watch watch


---------55:42----------
your breath it's gonna take a couple


---------55:48----------
minutes so be patient both of them are


---------56:05----------
rarely are gonna be fully open so check


---------56:08----------
with your nose you may notice a subtle


---------56:13----------
difference between the two if you think


---------56:15----------
they're both open no it's not enough to


---------56:28----------
put the head on the side as nothing to


---------56:29----------
do the head has to do with the armpit


---------57:02----------
[Music]


---------57:12----------
I'm trying to respect being quiet for


---------57:15----------
reckful but we can answer all these


---------57:17----------
questions okay so some people are saying


---------57:26----------
this and say okay so both of your


---------57:28----------
nostrils really shouldn't be equally


---------57:30----------
open all the time that's the perception


---------57:32----------
that people have but if you check with


---------57:33----------
your your finger you'll notice that one


---------57:38----------
of them is more clogged so if it changes


---------57:43----------
I want you guys to sit in that


---------57:45----------
transition and just notice that


---------57:46----------
transition is it happens the [ __ ]


---------58:00----------
someone just gifted a bunch of subs


---------58:04----------
what the hell thank you


---------58:11----------
how we doin reckful right nostril still


---------58:15----------
open okay just sit with it okay so you


---------58:29----------
can you can curl up put you I mean not


---------58:33----------
like super uncomfortable but you can put


---------58:35----------
your hand under your head if you want


---------58:38----------
your right hand under your head yeah


---------58:44----------
yeah yeah but then you're tipping


---------58:48----------
forward which isn't good but that's okay


---------58:54----------
you


---------59:02----------
did he miss it okay come back okay I'm


---------59:19----------
left okay your left gang all right so


---------59:23----------
let's just see like who procedure eyes


---------59:25----------
up huh yeah I'm left gang okay so this


---------59:31----------
is what you've got to do reckful so if


---------59:34----------
you want to feel if you want to get back


---------59:36----------
to the teacup you can't miss it because


---------59:40----------
you missed it yeah I didn't notice what


---------59:41----------
happened


---------59:42----------
so like for what I watch all to do is


---------59:44----------
like when you guys do this practice you


---------59:47----------
can just lay down on the on the side


---------59:48----------
that your nostril is open and watch as


---------59:51----------
its gonna shift it's just hard to


---------59:53----------
describe you're gonna feel it and so pay


---------59:55----------
attention so right now what we need to


---------59:56----------
do is get you to be able to pay


---------59:57----------
attention to that damn leg how do you


---------60:00----------
feels a little different is left going


---------60:02----------
than right gang I was thinking just now


---------60:04----------
it is it is different so the the not the


---------60:09----------
nerves in your left nostril connect to


---------60:12----------
in Turner ons that innervate your your


---------60:15----------
parasympathetic nervous system what and


---------60:19----------
the nerves in your right nostril connect


---------60:22----------
to in Turner ons that innervate your


---------60:24----------
sympathetic chain ganglia which is your


---------60:26----------
so this is essentially like Sun and Moon


---------60:28----------
or yin and yang so your sympathetic


---------60:30----------
nervous system is more active when you


---------60:32----------
when your right nostril is open and your


---------60:34----------
parasympathetic nervous system is more


---------60:36----------
active when your left nostril is open so


---------60:38----------
if I want to be better at what do I want


---------60:41----------
the left nostril open and if I want to


---------60:43----------
be better at what do I want the right


---------60:44----------
one if you want to be physically active


---------60:46----------
or like passionate mental activity then


---------60:51----------
right nostril is better if you want to


---------60:53----------
be calm if you want to have sort of


---------60:56----------
clarity of mind without passion then


---------60:59----------
left nostril is better if you want to


---------61:01----------
rest left nostril is better if you want


---------61:04----------
to yeah left nostril is better


---------61:10----------
although we're having this conversation


---------61:12----------
and I want to go deep left nostrils


---------61:15----------
better but didn't you say left nostril


---------61:18----------
was for being really calm and then if I


---------61:20----------
want to where do you say can you stick


---------61:24----------
in the right nostril yeah so right


---------61:25----------
nostril is your sympathetic nervous


---------61:26----------
system so it's fight or flight if I'll


---------61:29----------
have you know yeah like any sort of


---------61:31----------
physical activity or be like have a


---------61:34----------
passionate mind then right now someone's


---------61:37----------
gonna have a passionate mind right now


---------61:38----------
it depends do you want to experience


---------61:41----------
more emotion or do you want to


---------61:42----------
understand yourself better oh I want to


---------61:44----------
understand it then laughs nostril


---------61:46----------
okay so if so this is what and I


---------61:50----------
encourage you guys to explore this right


---------61:51----------
so in my experience and according to the


---------61:54----------
yoga Shastras left nostril is gonna make


---------61:56----------
you feel a little bit more chill and


---------61:58----------
right nostril is gonna make you feel a


---------62:00----------
little bit more active and the other tip


---------62:03----------
I'll give you guys just one really


---------62:04----------
simple thing is after you eat a meal you


---------62:06----------
should lay down on your left side for


---------62:08----------
about five to ten minutes and just see


---------62:10----------
how you feel afterward after a meal we


---------62:14----------
want to be lay down on the left side so


---------62:16----------
we get the right nostril activated yes


---------62:19----------
okay so yeah this is some crazy [ __ ] so


---------62:26----------
there's some science behind it but the


---------62:28----------
science behind it is not very good


---------62:29----------
there's not what it's not very good so I


---------62:32----------
think what the the best thing that I


---------62:34----------
recommend about this stuff cuz this is


---------62:35----------
not really something that has been


---------62:37----------
although I'm sorry I don't know I it's


---------62:40----------
transmitting over here water so I'll try


---------62:46----------
to find you guys references for what


---------62:48----------
science supports with this stuff but


---------62:50----------
this is not this specificity of breath


---------62:54----------
and meditation has not really been like


---------62:56----------
scientifically studied like this is


---------62:58----------
generally speaking in plant trials and


---------63:00----------
it didn't not not to this degree of


---------63:02----------
specificity right so remember that like


---------63:05----------
inhaling is that if there were trials


---------63:08----------
with a couple hundred people it would be


---------63:10----------
true but you haven't been yeah because


---------63:12----------
no one is like that's just it's just way


---------63:14----------
too specific and there isn't a


---------63:16----------
foundation so generally speaking let's


---------63:18----------
remember how like research works we


---------63:20----------
research something very generally and


---------63:22----------
then we start researching


---------63:24----------
things like the next study is gonna be a


---------63:25----------
little bit more specific is gonna be a


---------63:27----------
little bit more specific is gonna be a


---------63:28----------
little bit more specific so right now


---------63:31----------
there are just general studies being


---------63:33----------
done on mindfulness or meditation in


---------63:35----------
general there are very few studies that


---------63:37----------
look at different kinds of meditation or


---------63:39----------
explore like physiologic effects of like


---------63:41----------
different techniques very few we're just


---------63:44----------
sort of starting that we're still trying


---------63:46----------
to figure out whether this stuff has any


---------63:48----------
merit or not right can meditation help


---------63:51----------
with arthritis can meditation help with


---------63:53----------
depression there are some preliminary


---------63:55----------
studies that suggest different kinds of


---------63:57----------
meditation have different effects on


---------63:59----------
your brainwave patterns so that's the


---------64:02----------
resolution that we're at is do are two


---------64:04----------
kinds of meditation even different and


---------64:06----------
is there any evidence of that and the


---------64:08----------
answer to that is yes there are


---------64:09----------
convincing studies of that that I can


---------64:11----------
look you but we have nowhere nowhere no


---------64:14----------
one has explored this degree of


---------64:15----------
specificity and research because we're


---------64:17----------
just not there yet right it's sort of


---------64:20----------
like we have to remember that you know


---------64:22----------
let's say penicillin was discovered I


---------64:25----------
think sometime between the 20s and 50s


---------64:26----------
and so that was like like our


---------64:28----------
understanding of microbial


---------64:30----------
microorganisms and antibiotics is like a


---------64:33----------
hundred years old and so over a hundred


---------64:35----------
years we've had a lot of time to study


---------64:37----------
now we know a lot about different kinds


---------64:39----------
of microorganisms and antibiotics we've


---------64:41----------
been studying meditation for like twenty


---------64:43----------
to thirty years and so we really have an


---------64:47----------
anecdote yeah so for me haha if I had


---------64:52----------
started doing magic mushrooms five years


---------64:55----------
ago for depression people would have


---------64:58----------
called me a lot crazier than they would


---------65:00----------
now that it's getting fda-approved for


---------65:03----------
as a breakthrough therapy Yeah right


---------65:07----------
[Music]


---------65:09----------
but it would have helped me just as much


---------65:10----------
five years ago we didn't know yeah so


---------65:14----------
you have to remember that science so


---------65:15----------
like this is the difference because two


---------65:17----------
years ago even in I mean there's been


---------65:19----------
knowledge or exploration of meditation


---------65:22----------
for like the better part of five


---------65:23----------
thousand years and they learned a lot


---------65:25----------
and science is like by comparison


---------65:28----------
science started studying this [ __ ] like


---------65:29----------
30 years ago so there's a there are the


---------65:32----------
you know what what the Yogi's understood


---------65:34----------
about meditation which I do believe I


---------65:36----------
mean not to say that everything that


---------65:38----------
they say is right but I think they're


---------65:39----------
they're brilliant because a lot of the


---------65:41----------
work that I do is based on their stuff


---------65:44----------
and I think like people say your


---------65:45----------
credentials a bit because people in the


---------65:47----------
chat might not know they do tune in and


---------65:49----------
random times in and out oh no sure


---------65:52----------
so by the way someone gifted like a


---------65:54----------
hundred subs so thank you to that person


---------65:57----------
so so might be but Gumpy I'll do my I'll


---------66:02----------
do my Andy thing so intro Andy so my


---------66:04----------
name is all okay noise I'm a


---------66:05----------
psychiatrist


---------66:06----------
I studied meditation for an yoga for


---------66:10----------
about an Eastern medicine Ayurveda


---------66:11----------
specifically mostly a little bit of


---------66:13----------
Chinese medicine for about seven years


---------66:16----------
originally with the goal of becoming a


---------66:18----------
monk and then ended up going doing


---------66:21----------
neuroscience research for a couple of


---------66:23----------
years and then went to medical school


---------66:26----------
and trained to become a psychiatrist and


---------66:28----------
now I do integrative or holistic


---------66:32----------
psychiatry like incorporating


---------66:33----------
complementary alternative medicine


---------66:35----------
meditation yoga and things like that


---------66:37----------
into treatment for depression anxiety


---------66:39----------
PTSD stuff like that and then I'm are


---------66:43----------
trained in a faculty at Harvard Medical


---------66:45----------
School


---------66:48----------
yeah I'm a Harvard Andy so I did


---------66:51----------
neuroscience research they're trained to


---------66:52----------
become a psychiatrist there and I'm on


---------66:54----------
faculty there so where did I learn


---------67:01----------
meditation so I learned meditation from


---------67:02----------
like dozens of people so I traveled to


---------67:05----------
India every year for a period of about


---------67:07----------
seven years and spent about four months


---------67:09----------
a year in India and studied with


---------67:12----------
different teachers different ashrams


---------67:14----------
different lineages learned a lot of


---------67:16----------
different kinds of meditation techniques


---------67:18----------
from a lot of different people and then


---------67:20----------
now I sort of use different kinds of


---------67:22----------
techniques to help different kinds of


---------67:24----------
people but a lot of this like


---------67:26----------
fundamental stuff about how to


---------67:28----------
understand the breath like in and this


---------67:31----------
is the thing like I don't think you can


---------67:32----------
find speaking of science I don't know if


---------67:36----------
there's actually a study that tells us


---------67:38----------
what the pattern of breathing for


---------67:39----------
different emotions is I've never seen a


---------67:42----------
study like that maybe that's out there


---------67:43----------
but like that's the kind of simple


---------67:45----------
formative stuff that sometimes science


---------67:47----------
like misses right but we can sort of


---------67:49----------
test that ourselves just and it's kind


---------67:52----------
of like common sense so I think science


---------67:55----------
is really fantastic and you should make


---------67:56----------
evidence-based decisions when you're


---------67:58----------
doing treatment but I also think that as


---------68:01----------
I've learned time again and again as a


---------68:03----------
clinician it doesn't matter what sign


---------68:05----------
says if the patient if it doesn't work


---------68:08----------
for the patient so even if you know the


---------68:12----------
overwhelming evidence suggests that a


---------68:14----------
good treatment for depression is an SSRI


---------68:16----------
or antidepressant like prozac if it


---------68:20----------
doesn't work for you it doesn't [ __ ]


---------68:21----------
work for you so what side says kind of


---------68:23----------
doesn't matter right so you like a lot


---------68:26----------
of what I advocate for is individual


---------68:28----------
exploration Rosic yeah when my brother


---------68:32----------
killed himself he had just started


---------68:33----------
taking Prozac yeah how old was he 21 so


---------68:38----------
I don't know if people are aware of this


---------68:40----------
but there's a black box warning placed


---------68:42----------
by the FDA that soon after taking SSRIs


---------68:45----------
it actually increases the risk of


---------68:48----------
suicidality which is but completely


---------68:50----------
bizarre


---------68:51----------
some people hypothesize that when you're


---------68:54----------
super depressed you don't feel like


---------68:56----------
doing anything so even though you're


---------68:58----------
suicidal


---------69:00----------
your lack of motivation prevents you


---------69:02----------
from killing yourself and I mean no none


---------69:05----------
of this no one really knows this but


---------69:07----------
when I asked people when I asked my


---------69:08----------
professors like you know why is it that


---------69:10----------
SSRIs actually increase the risk of


---------69:12----------
suicidality like what the [ __ ] is up


---------69:14----------
with that one person told me well I


---------69:16----------
think actually as crazy as this sounds


---------69:17----------
what happens is that it fixes motivation


---------69:20----------
problems before it fixes suicidality so


---------69:23----------
there's a brief window of time where


---------69:24----------
people still feel suicidal but the


---------69:26----------
prozac is giving them like enough pep in


---------69:28----------
their step to actually go and try to


---------69:30----------
hurt themselves so it's kind of like a


---------69:32----------
really bizarre sort of instance but this


---------69:36----------
is like there's literally a black box


---------69:37----------
warning which means when you get a


---------69:39----------
medication there's like a black box on


---------69:41----------
it from the fda that says that taking


---------69:43----------
this medication increases suicidality


---------69:48----------
yeah the warning happened because a lot


---------69:51----------
of people like your brother killed


---------69:52----------
themselves and the warning is really


---------69:54----------
applies to adolescents and teenagers but


---------69:56----------
I think it also fits for young adults it


---------69:58----------
seems to not have that effect nearly as


---------70:01----------
much in older people or it seems to be


---------70:03----------
absent so we're not sure why that


---------70:04----------
happens yeah so if they had known back


---------70:07----------
then that mushrooms were good for


---------70:08----------
depression and instead of Prozac then he


---------70:11----------
might have been alive I shouldn't think


---------70:17----------
that way you know yeah what do you what


---------70:25----------
does that thought what do you what are


---------70:27----------
you thinking what are you feeling can't


---------70:31----------
blame anybody they're trying I mean I


---------70:34----------
guess they're trying to discover what's


---------70:35----------
good for depression right that's not


---------70:37----------
what you're doing


---------70:39----------
what are you doing reckful regret yeah


---------70:43----------
yeah also blame also wanting yeah


---------70:50----------
also at its core you want things to be


---------70:53----------
different you want things to not be this


---------70:56----------
way yeah that's that's the crux of it is


---------71:03----------
that you're not ready to accept the way


---------71:06----------
things are yeah and unless what are you


---------71:18----------
gonna hold so when you don't accept what


---------71:20----------
happened to your brother and you don't


---------71:22----------
accept your own depression what does


---------71:25----------
that mean for you like what does that


---------71:26----------
mean for your life what is that lack of


---------71:29----------
acceptance feeling what does the lack of


---------71:32----------
acceptance feel like unfulfilled I don't


---------71:40----------
know I don't know what answers like


---------71:43----------
there's some something [ __ ] missing


---------71:46----------
yeah that's unfulfilled right yeah and


---------71:50----------
so when you wake up in the morning and


---------71:52----------
you feel like something is unfulfilled


---------71:54----------
when you feel like something is missing


---------71:56----------
like that's where that [ __ ] comes from


---------71:59----------
and as long as you hold on to that I'm


---------72:01----------
not saying that you should it's easy to


---------72:03----------
let go or that you're ready to let go


---------72:04----------
yet because I don't think you are that


---------72:07----------
that sense that fundamental sense


---------72:08----------
something I've let go of it like [ __ ] a


---------72:10----------
hundred [ __ ] times in my life you


---------72:11----------
know it just comes up sometimes


---------72:13----------
yeah so that's because you haven't let


---------72:15----------
go because you don't want to let go


---------72:16----------
you're not ready to let go you're not


---------72:18----------
ready because lucky you don't you still


---------72:20----------
blame things for what happened


---------72:22----------
you blame science and you blame yourself


---------72:24----------
and you blame your brother and you don't


---------72:26----------
blame your brother you learn to forgive


---------72:28----------
him but there's still a part of you that


---------72:29----------
is just not it just it shouldn't be this


---------72:32----------
way it shouldn't have been this way this


---------72:34----------
shouldn't have happened it shouldn't


---------72:35----------
have happened to him and it shouldn't


---------72:36----------
have happened to you yeah I was just


---------72:38----------
thinking something interesting um when I


---------72:41----------
was kid remember they died my grandma my


---------72:48----------
dad


---------72:49----------
she was really old already she's like 85


---------72:51----------
86 no 87 she's 87 and my dad didn't want


---------72:58----------
to tell her that he died so she would


---------73:02----------
ask where's guy how come he hasn't


---------73:04----------
visited in a while you just say oh he's


---------73:06----------
really busy that he was getting his


---------73:10----------
pilot wings for a while but then he got


---------73:12----------
his pala wings a little bit for um and


---------73:17----------
we never told her and I was in on it


---------73:19----------
to never tell her I was kid she died


---------73:22----------
never knowing that he died she was like


---------73:26----------
in the hospital and she like fallen in


---------73:30----------
the shower and broken her hip and she


---------73:33----------
was in the hospital and she was


---------73:35----------
wondering where he was but it was better


---------73:38----------
not to tell her that he was not that


---------73:40----------
round we never told her yeah why do you


---------73:44----------
bring that up now it just came in my


---------73:46----------
mind yeah why I'm not sure what is that


---------73:50----------
story about some closure feeling I guess


---------73:57----------
yeah


---------73:59----------
by closure feeling it that stories about


---------74:01----------
the impossibility of acceptance that


---------74:06----------
story is about like not knowing that


---------74:08----------
story is about a version of reality that


---------74:11----------
you in a bizarre way longed for in a


---------74:15----------
bizarre way I'm looking for a version of


---------74:16----------
reality that your grandmother had like a


---------74:20----------
version of reality where my parents are


---------74:23----------
looking for it a little more I'm sure I


---------74:25----------
yeah


---------74:29----------
yeah have you ever talked I mean I'm


---------74:32----------
sure you guys have talked but have you


---------74:34----------
talked to your parents about your


---------74:35----------
brother passing away not for this yeah


---------74:38----------
like what are this conversations go like


---------74:41----------
they don't go well okay good yeah what


---------74:45----------
does that mean I don't want to thought


---------74:47----------
they were probably listening right okay


---------74:48----------
sure yeah so I mean I I think you know


---------74:54----------
speaking of community and loneliness I


---------74:58----------
you know reckful them it's better if I


---------75:00----------
talk to them directly right yeah sure so


---------75:02----------
I mean I I think the challenge here is


---------75:04----------
that we're talking about you letting go


---------75:06----------
but like I don't think I I don't think


---------75:09----------
it's just you that needs to let go right


---------75:12----------
you told me about how your relationship


---------75:14----------
with your other brother kind of changed


---------75:15----------
and like this is you could [ __ ] my halo


---------75:18----------
so I was I was just saying I don't think


---------75:21----------
this is just about you letting go this


---------75:23----------
is yes is about like you because it's


---------75:26----------
gonna be very hard to let go when other


---------75:30----------
people are holding on in some way and


---------75:31----------
you guys are like connected and that my


---------75:33----------
dad my dad told me about a year ago that


---------75:38----------
he finally feels okay here's what he


---------75:42----------
said but I remember when I was really


---------75:44----------
young I overheard him talking to his


---------75:48----------
friend I don't know I was like 12 that


---------75:53----------
he told his friend that he wanted to


---------75:55----------
kill himself I was weird to hear my dad


---------75:58----------
say that yeah reckful do you have a


---------76:02----------
therapist I've gone to therapy a few


---------76:05----------
times but not I've never saw it as


---------76:09----------
useful enough to keep going this time I


---------76:11----------
do well okay this is not therapy but I


---------76:18----------
[Music]


---------76:20----------
yeah it was so okay so look look man so


---------76:25----------
this is what we got to do so either so I


---------76:27----------
think this is way more longitudinal like


---------76:30----------
there's something this is way more


---------76:31----------
longitudinal right so I think we have to


---------76:35----------
do a we got to figure something out so


---------76:36----------
either you need to talk to someone about


---------76:38----------
this because you understand things that


---------76:40----------
you didn't understand before or


---------76:43----------
like I can't do one offs like we can do


---------76:45----------
one offs about meditation and random


---------76:47----------
[ __ ] but if you really want to get into


---------76:48----------
this if you want to get into loan this


---------76:50----------
we got to do it like in sequent like we


---------76:52----------
got to do it sequentially like we got to


---------76:53----------
do fine with that we got to do it you


---------76:55----------
know get started yeah so let's let me


---------76:57----------
just think about that it doesn't have to


---------76:58----------
be online but you know if you want to do


---------77:01----------
it online that's fine but then I think


---------77:03----------
we have to do it consistently and how


---------77:06----------
could you have done I mean I would say


---------77:08----------
probably every week for like four to


---------77:13----------
eight weeks that's not that long I mean


---------77:17----------
it's not that long but I mean it's I'm


---------77:20----------
willing to do that if okay well yeah I


---------77:22----------
mean I'm willing to do it because I I


---------77:24----------
mean I think you just have to think


---------77:25----------
about whether you really want to do that


---------77:27----------
huh and yeah I think you just gotta


---------77:29----------
think like you gotta just I


---------77:31----------
my thing is transmitting though I don't


---------77:33----------
know I think it's I think it's disorder


---------77:35----------
it's gotta be disclose sorry discord uh


---------77:38----------
I don't know like I think I don't think


---------77:41----------
I'm yeah it's discord my people are -


---------77:43----------
cuz I'm sitting here [ __ ] pulling out


---------77:45----------
my hair cuz I'm thinking that if I like


---------77:47----------
move back it stops I think it's discord


---------77:50----------
but it might because that time I was


---------77:52----------
watching it sensitivity you tried


---------77:54----------
changing it oh well I mean I think it


---------77:58----------
should be the same as anyway so going


---------78:00----------
back to going back to what we're talking


---------78:02----------
