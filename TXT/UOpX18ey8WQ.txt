---------00:00----------
so as long as you're trying to solve


---------00:01----------
that problem in


---------00:03----------
the game that the anxiety is playing for


---------00:05----------
you it's like


---------00:06----------
you know playing against the house in


---------00:10----------
a casino it's a game you're designed to


---------00:12----------
lose


---------00:13----------
how do i get out of this thought loop


---------00:15----------
when i am quiet


---------00:17----------
am i being boring and when i'm talking


---------00:19----------
am i being annoying


---------00:22----------
okay if we think about this for a second


---------00:25----------
this is brilliant by the way


---------00:27----------
so let's start by just understanding you


---------00:29----------
know where does the root


---------00:31----------
of this come from right so like do you


---------00:34----------
guys see how this thought


---------00:36----------
am i being boring like comes from a


---------00:38----------
presumption


---------00:40----------
that people don't like you or that


---------00:42----------
you're not delivering value


---------00:44----------
and this too comes with a presumption


---------00:47----------
that you're not delivering value


---------00:49----------
like you guys see how both of these


---------00:51----------
questions even though


---------00:52----------
the behavior is the exact opposite


---------00:56----------
like they share the same root so this is


---------00:58----------
really important to understand


---------01:00----------
so a lot of times people think that


---------01:03----------
their


---------01:04----------
anxiety is dependent on a particular


---------01:07----------
thought


---------01:07----------
right so like my mind produces the


---------01:09----------
thought for me am i being boring by


---------01:11----------
being quiet


---------01:12----------
or am i being annoying by talking


---------01:15----------
and so what we do is we focus on the


---------01:17----------
content of the anxiety what is like the


---------01:19----------
worry that we have


---------01:20----------
right am i being boring am i being


---------01:22----------
annoying like both of those are the


---------01:23----------
content of the mind


---------01:24----------
but if you kind of think about it that


---------01:26----------
doesn't make any logical sense because


---------01:27----------
if you're worried about being


---------01:29----------
boring the solution to that is to talk


---------01:33----------
and then if you start talking


---------01:34----------
theoretically that problem should be


---------01:36----------
fixed you're no longer boring


---------01:37----------
but you wind up being either your mind


---------01:39----------
your mind actually tells you now that


---------01:41----------
we're talking


---------01:42----------
am i being annoying maybe i should be


---------01:43----------
more quiet so from a logical perspective


---------01:46----------
and from a thinking perspective


---------01:48----------
it's like a lose-lose situation there's


---------01:50----------
no way you can win


---------01:51----------
because your mind is producing for you


---------01:53----------
thoughts and worries and concerns


---------01:56----------
which theoretically should lead to a


---------01:57----------
particular behavior or solution


---------01:59----------
but even if you engage in that


---------02:01----------
behavioral solution you're still screwed


---------02:04----------
so like how on earth do you deal with


---------02:05----------
that


---------02:07----------
and the key thing here is to go back to


---------02:09----------
the root that produces these thoughts


---------02:11----------
okay so like this is where you know as


---------02:14----------
long as you


---------02:15----------
feel internally emotionally


---------02:18----------
that you are not going to like be


---------02:21----------
pleasant to be around if you are


---------02:23----------
insecure about you know what value you


---------02:26----------
bring to like other people's like social


---------02:29----------
service like social like situations if


---------02:32----------
you can't really like serve to be like


---------02:34----------
socially useful to other people


---------02:36----------
as long as you hold that belief that


---------02:39----------
belief will spawn off


---------02:41----------
thoughts no matter the circumstance does


---------02:43----------
that make sense


---------02:44----------
so it's kind of interesting because like


---------02:46----------
a lot of people will will start


---------02:48----------
they'll try to solve the individual


---------02:50----------
thought but like


---------02:52----------
what this this picture beautifully


---------02:53----------
illustrates is brilliant right


---------02:55----------
is that you can try to solve as many


---------02:57----------
problems as you want to your your mind


---------02:59----------
if you're socially anxious


---------03:00----------
is still is like never going to be


---------03:02----------
appeased right when i'm quiet am i being


---------03:04----------
boring oh talk more


---------03:05----------
and then when you're talking you're like


---------03:06----------
oh my god am i being annoying be quiet


---------03:08----------
more


---------03:09----------
you can ping pong back and forth through


---------03:10----------
this as much as you want to and you'll


---------03:12----------
never fix it


---------03:14----------
so what do you do about it what you do


---------03:15----------
is first of all recognize the process


---------03:18----------
that your mind is going to like give you


---------03:21----------
these thoughts kind of no matter what


---------03:24----------
and as long as you're playing at the


---------03:25----------
level of thought you're never going to


---------03:27----------
fix it and this is why people get stuck


---------03:28----------
right it becomes a loop you start


---------03:30----------
looping because you're like bouncing


---------03:31----------
around


---------03:32----------
up here instead what you need to do is


---------03:33----------
go down to the root up


---------03:35----------
tell yourself notice first of all oh my


---------03:38----------
mind is doing that thing again where


---------03:39----------
it's like


---------03:40----------
behaving at an intellectual level but


---------03:43----------
this


---------03:43----------
intellectual content of my mind is being


---------03:46----------
fueled by the emotion


---------03:48----------
and so instead of trying to solve that


---------03:50----------
problem up here just ask yourself how do


---------03:52----------
i


---------03:52----------
feel right now what is the emotional


---------03:55----------
energy that is driving this anxiety


---------03:59----------
and once you start working at that level


---------04:01----------
like so you may


---------04:02----------
discover for example oh like i'm just


---------04:04----------
afraid that people aren't gonna like me


---------04:07----------
and i'm not confident about myself


---------04:09----------
because i've been in like


---------04:10----------
isolation for a year and i feel like


---------04:12----------
socially rusty


---------04:14----------
i'm concerned that these people might


---------04:16----------
not like me and then you can kind of sit


---------04:18----------
with that and it's like it's not about a


---------04:19----------
particular manifestation it's sort of


---------04:21----------
like okay like


---------04:22----------
i feel afraid that people don't like me


---------04:25----------
and this is why it's useful to work with


---------04:27----------
someone like a therapist or coach or


---------04:28----------
something like that right


---------04:29----------
if you really have social anxiety i'd


---------04:31----------
recommend seeing you know a clinician


---------04:34----------
if you have like a diagnosed social


---------04:35----------
anxiety


---------04:37----------
and then you know once you start sitting


---------04:39----------
with those feelings working on that


---------04:40----------
underlying emotion


---------04:42----------
then what you can do is like as the


---------04:43----------
emotion kind of kind of starts to like


---------04:45----------
empty out and decompress


---------04:47----------
the thoughts above will start to crumble


---------04:49----------
so it's kind of interesting but like


---------04:51----------
it's it's tricky because we sort of


---------04:53----------
think like okay how do i deal with this


---------04:54----------
thought loop because it keeps on looping


---------04:56----------
up there


---------04:57----------
and instead of like dealing with the


---------04:58----------
root loop it's like you know how do i


---------05:00----------
start move


---------05:01----------
how do i stop moving in this loop well


---------05:03----------
like the answer to stop moving in the


---------05:05----------
loop is like you have to like


---------05:07----------
empty your gas can right because as long


---------05:09----------
as you've got fuel your mind will loop


---------05:12----------
in that way those rational thoughts


---------05:14----------
those logical thoughts those anxious


---------05:15----------
thoughts will keep on looping


---------05:17----------
and you will keep on trying to problem


---------05:19----------
solve okay


---------05:20----------
and that problem solving will never


---------05:22----------
actually lead to well i'm not i guess i


---------05:24----------
can't say never


---------05:25----------
but it will it's not really consistently


---------05:28----------
going to lead to anything whereas the


---------05:29----------
real money


---------05:31----------
isn't actually is in dealing with the


---------05:34----------
underlying emotion that's fueling the


---------05:36----------
anxiety


---------05:36----------
okay so a good example of this so we


---------05:39----------
have a we have a


---------05:40----------
a video entirely about this on dr k's


---------05:43----------
guides


---------05:44----------
so this is the anxiety module okay just


---------05:46----------
real quick


---------05:48----------
so there's uh by the way there's a video


---------05:50----------
actually on thought loops


---------05:53----------
so if you guys are there's but that's


---------05:54----------
not the one i'm thinking about this is


---------05:56----------
what i call feeding the beast


---------05:59----------
okay so sometimes in our minds there are


---------06:01----------
actually a couple of videos about this


---------06:03----------
there are a couple ways that we deal


---------06:04----------
with anxiety and one way that we deal


---------06:06----------
with anxiety is by like


---------06:08----------
trying to rationally solve that problem


---------06:10----------
right we can try to solve the problem of


---------06:12----------
when i'm quiet am i being boring and and


---------06:15----------
when i'm talking


---------06:16----------
am i am i being annoying so as long as


---------06:19----------
you're trying to solve


---------06:20----------
that problem in the game that the


---------06:22----------
anxiety is playing for you


---------06:24----------
it's like you know playing against the


---------06:27----------
house


---------06:28----------
in a casino it's a game you're designed


---------06:30----------
to lose


---------06:31----------
because it's not an intellectual problem


---------06:33----------
so you can come up with as many


---------06:34----------
intellectual solutions as you want to


---------06:37----------
and it's not going to work this is the


---------06:38----------
other problem with anxiety right is


---------06:39----------
because we have a bunch of like five


---------06:41----------
heads out there that are like


---------06:43----------
okay i just need two dot dot dot i


---------06:45----------
figured everything out


---------06:46----------
like i just need to develop confidence i


---------06:48----------
just need to do this i just need to do


---------06:49----------
this


---------06:50----------
i figured everything out up here and


---------06:51----------
they try to do it and never works


---------06:54----------
it's because all of your energy is being


---------06:56----------
spent on sort of like the symptom


---------06:58----------
as opposed to the cause so get down to


---------07:01----------
the roots of your insecurity or your


---------07:03----------
lack of confidence


---------07:04----------
and notice in that moment instead of


---------07:06----------
playing the game with the anxiety up top


---------07:08----------
notice like what am i actually feeling


---------07:10----------
right now like where does this


---------07:11----------
insecurity actually


---------07:12----------
come from right and as you kind of do


---------07:15----------
that work as you start to notice


---------07:17----------
oh this is just my anxiety producing all


---------07:20----------
of these thoughts and worries it's not


---------07:21----------
even me


---------07:22----------
that's another useful technique that you


---------07:24----------
can do is notice what is your anxiety


---------07:26----------
versus you and you're like oh that's


---------07:28----------
just my anxiety it's like no big deal


---------07:30----------
like it's gonna act up again and you can


---------07:31----------
even anticipate it so the next time you


---------07:33----------
go into a social situation


---------07:34----------
you know okay so my anxiety is gonna


---------07:36----------
start producing thoughts


---------07:38----------
i know it sounds weird but as you


---------07:40----------
anticipate it and then the anxiety comes


---------07:42----------
you don't fight it because remember most


---------07:43----------
of the time we try to fight anxiety


---------07:45----------
which just feeds the loop because you're


---------07:46----------
adding


---------07:47----------
uh gas to your gas tank so instead what


---------07:50----------
you want to do is take a step back and


---------07:51----------
just be like okay


---------07:52----------
we knew this was coming oh wow this


---------07:54----------
anxiety is really powerful today


---------07:56----------
is it so powerful that i need to leave


---------07:58----------
or can i give it like half an hour and


---------08:00----------
hopefully i can start to have fun


---------08:02----------
when you start dealing with your anxiety


---------08:04----------
like this you kind of take the steam out


---------08:05----------
of it you take the energy out of it


---------08:07----------
it'll kind of calm down and the thoughts


---------08:09----------
will actually stop on their own right so


---------08:11----------
someone's saying


---------08:12----------
you have to fight the idea that you need


---------08:14----------
to demonstrate value to others i think


---------08:16----------
that's the right


---------08:17----------
sentiment i wouldn't encourage fighting


---------08:20----------
it


---------08:21----------
right so i wouldn't encourage like i


---------08:23----------
know it's an


---------08:24----------
interesting nuance here but i would


---------08:27----------
notice


---------08:28----------
that that is a false belief so i i think


---------08:31----------
generally speaking


---------08:32----------
and fighting your mind and anxiety makes


---------08:35----------
things


---------08:36----------
worse for most people as they've learned


---------08:38----------
they may conquer it for a time but it


---------08:40----------
comes


---------08:40----------
roaring back the next day so i'd


---------08:42----------
encourage people to just notice oh like


---------08:44----------
there's a part of me that feels like i


---------08:46----------
need to demonstrate my value to others


---------08:49----------
it feels that very strongly i feel like


---------08:51----------
super inadequate and i feel like a waste


---------08:53----------
of space


---------08:54----------
unless i demonstrate my value to other


---------08:56----------
people


---------08:57----------
and then you don't go and bully that


---------08:59----------
part of you you're not like


---------09:00----------
screw you believe in yourself


---------09:04----------
dumbass you should believe in yourself


---------09:06----------
more


---------09:07----------
why are you so stupid start believing in


---------09:09----------
yourself more


---------09:11----------
you know it's like you got to be careful


---------09:12----------
there so you can conquer it for a time


---------09:15----------
but generally speaking my experience has


---------09:18----------
been that


---------09:18----------
encouraging people to notice it is


---------09:21----------
actually like


---------09:22----------
more potent right so it's interesting


---------09:24----------
it's tricky gets tricky


---------09:25----------
there is value to sometimes fighting and


---------09:27----------
overcoming your anxiety though like so


---------09:29----------
it's just like


---------09:31----------
generally speaking people tend to know


---------09:32----------
how to do that relatively well


---------09:34----------
and it's this part that people generally


---------09:37----------
speaking need to learn
