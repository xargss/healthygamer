---------00:00----------
do you think that narcissists believe


---------00:02----------
that and I'm I don't I don't know if


---------00:06----------
you're a narcissist or not so this isn't


---------00:07----------
some kind of veiled attack I'm genuinely


---------00:09----------
curious because I have a follow-up


---------00:11----------
question do you think that narcissists


---------00:13----------
believe that they are that they have


---------00:16----------
that they're objectively better in some


---------00:19----------
ways than other people


---------00:29----------
hey man how are you can you can you hear


---------00:32----------
me yeah thank you for being so patient


---------00:34----------
I'm sorry about the guys it's fine if


---------00:37----------
you can have people I don't mind yeah


---------00:40----------
also what I want to say do you hear echo


---------00:42----------
when you're talking I I don't hear echo


---------00:45----------
okay that's good that's good that's good


---------00:47----------
awesome okay and and just volume wise


---------00:50----------
what we're doing okay yeah yeah I'm


---------00:52----------
hearing you clear clear okay let me just


---------00:54----------
um all right so I think can you tell me


---------00:58----------
a little bit about what so I'm not quite


---------01:03----------
sure exactly how this got set up but


---------01:05----------
there were people in in my chat who


---------01:07----------
wanted me to talk to you yeah cuz I have


---------01:11----------
quite a controversial reputation on the


---------01:14----------
internet and people love to see drama


---------01:17----------
so they'd love to see you know like I


---------01:20----------
talk a lot about you know being


---------01:23----------
responsible and stuff on the live stream


---------01:24----------
and I've you even run my own place and


---------01:27----------
such and I can say things that sometimes


---------01:30----------
are very confrontational and I got


---------01:32----------
myself a little bit of a cult guru


---------01:35----------
reputation and that's why they they like


---------01:38----------
the idea of you know me talking to you


---------01:41----------
because some for for the drama sake some


---------01:44----------
to see if there's something interest


---------01:46----------
interesting that comes out of it


---------01:47----------
everybody has their a little bit their


---------01:49----------
own motivation what are you like to get


---------01:53----------
out of it like for me the the reason why


---------01:56----------
I think it's a I didn't mind having a


---------02:00----------
chat because I can potentially learn


---------02:06----------
from you and you can potentially learn


---------02:10----------
from me and if our intent is to help out


---------02:13----------
other people this conversation could


---------02:15----------
prove to be very fruitful that's one one


---------02:19----------
aspect of it the other aspect is also


---------02:21----------
that even if that is not what it leads


---------02:25----------
to people will get a better idea new


---------02:28----------
about you know how I think and how I see


---------02:31----------
things and how you think and how you see


---------02:33----------
things and either way uh I I do think


---------02:37----------
that the outcome will be positive either


---------02:39----------
way so sure my goal


---------02:42----------
with this talk is not to to country


---------02:45----------
create controversy or drama I I checked


---------02:50----------
a bit a few of your streams and well


---------02:53----------
like I just skipped through it and I I


---------02:54----------
checked I saw your Dharma approach like


---------02:57----------
the the Dharma AoE and I looked a bit


---------03:00----------
into it and like being responsible and


---------03:03----------
quite action-oriented I I really like


---------03:05----------
that sure it's it's the it's the you


---------03:09----------
know it's the direction I steer people


---------03:14----------
into as well so you're like why are you


---------03:19----------
doing all of this why am i why do i


---------03:21----------
stream why do you you know yeah why do


---------03:25----------
you stream why do you because I also


---------03:28----------
know you have a website healthy gamers


---------03:32----------
yeah like what what is the yeah what is


---------03:35----------
it for you what is your intent what is


---------03:37----------
your true motivation for what you're


---------03:40----------
doing so my motivation is Dharma so I


---------03:43----------
believe that doing this is my duty or


---------03:45----------
responsibility and what I mean by that


---------03:48----------
in a much more so that sounds like kind


---------03:50----------
of fancy but I think in a simple sense


---------03:52----------
I've had a very unique a couple of very


---------03:56----------
unique opportunities in my life so I was


---------03:58----------
addicted to video games slash almost


---------04:01----------
failed out of college from playing too


---------04:02----------
many video games and then studied for


---------04:04----------
several years to become a monk and then


---------04:07----------
ended up becoming a psychiatrist and in


---------04:09----------
in the process of training to become a


---------04:11----------
psychiatrist I started asking a lot of


---------04:14----------
my professors and supervisors about


---------04:16----------
video game addiction and then really no


---------04:18----------
one knew anything because it's a


---------04:20----------
relatively new phenomenon I think


---------04:22----------
technology and social media and the way


---------04:25----------
that they affect minds and brains is


---------04:27----------
like people just don't understand that


---------04:29----------
it's a really no one knew much about it


---------04:32----------
so about five years ago I just started


---------04:34----------
asking gamers like you know why do you


---------04:37----------
play video games do you want to play


---------04:39----------
fewer video games and why can't you stop


---------04:41----------
and the more that I've worked with


---------04:44----------
gamers so I you know sort of started


---------04:46----------
streaming actually only three months ago


---------04:47----------
and having worked with people for about


---------04:50----------
five years now I realized that like


---------04:53----------
a lot of people have the same problems


---------04:55----------
so that I was essentially having the


---------04:57----------
same conversations with like dozens or


---------05:00----------
hundreds of people and realized that


---------05:03----------
basically we need to AoE this stuff


---------05:04----------
right so instead of having and that I


---------05:07----------
could I couldn't get to everyone so


---------05:09----------
about one year ago a little over a year


---------05:11----------
ago I posted an an AMA threat on Reddit


---------05:15----------
and just said I'm a psychiatrist who's


---------05:17----------
interested in video game addiction and


---------05:18----------
got thousands of messages people were


---------05:21----------
like paging me at the hospital and stuff


---------05:22----------
like that


---------05:23----------
I got calls from all over the world


---------05:25----------
actually for parents and people who were


---------05:27----------
struggling it didn't didn't know how to


---------05:29----------
get help and so I realized that like I


---------05:32----------
can't you know I can be a psychiatrist


---------05:33----------
and work in my office and see 40


---------05:36----------
patients a week and I will never it'll


---------05:40----------
never be enough and so I need to change


---------05:42----------
so if I get it right you you actually


---------05:45----------
want to help people in in the most


---------05:47----------
effective manner you can what do you


---------05:50----------
mean by elective like to give a


---------05:58----------
comparison rather than having 40


---------06:01----------
patients


---------06:01----------
you'd rather like reach thousands if


---------06:05----------
yeah because because no one else is


---------06:07----------
right so if someone else is doing it


---------06:09----------
then that's fine but right now like the


---------06:11----------
overwhelming message that I get is that


---------06:13----------
gamers who go and see a psychiatrist get


---------06:16----------
diagnosed with depression get started on


---------06:19----------
medication and then six months later


---------06:22----------
their life is exactly the same and and


---------06:25----------
why why why do you what why is it


---------06:27----------
something that you know because I'm just


---------06:30----------
trying to to understand the motive and


---------06:32----------
the drive and such right like why do you


---------06:34----------
want to reach many instead of just 40


---------06:38----------
because many reach out to me is it


---------06:42----------
because of the reach out to something so


---------06:43----------
like so that's good so the reason I


---------06:46----------
asked about effectiveness is because I


---------06:48----------
see a big difference between public


---------06:50----------
health and clinical medicine so there


---------06:53----------
are some interventions that we do that


---------06:55----------
effect of population but don't affect


---------06:57----------
the population as profoundly as an


---------06:59----------
individual so what I enjoy doing the


---------07:02----------
most is working with individuals I


---------07:04----------
actually think that's the most effective


---------07:06----------
that in order for me to help someone if


---------07:09----------
I get one hour a week with them for like


---------07:13----------
six months that person is like different


---------07:16----------
at the end of that and one of the


---------07:19----------
struggles that I have with doing this is


---------07:21----------
that I meet with people once and we sort


---------07:24----------
of really try to make things like super


---------07:26----------
cross-sectional and I are trying to help


---------07:27----------
them out a little bit but I don't know


---------07:29----------
if this is actually helping people what


---------07:33----------
you're doing right now yeah by talking


---------07:36----------
to all these people on the UM on line I


---------07:39----------
mean people say it's helping right so


---------07:40----------
the last interview the last survey see


---------07:43----------
who is helping this part of the equation


---------07:45----------
you you really want to help people yeah


---------07:47----------
and you want you want to be able to help


---------07:49----------
as much as you can yeah why because I


---------07:56----------
can so let me put it to you this way so


---------08:00----------
I think Dharma is so Dharma is related


---------08:03----------
to karma so karma is sort of like the


---------08:05----------
idea of like circumstance right so like


---------08:08----------
this so I think that I've been given a


---------08:10----------
relatively unique background and so that


---------08:16----------
comes with a certain obligation so let


---------08:18----------
me put it to you this way


---------08:19----------
let's say that the two of us are sitting


---------08:21----------
at a park bench and I have two


---------08:23----------
sandwiches and you have none and both of


---------08:26----------
us are hungry I believe that I should


---------08:29----------
give you a sandwich just because I have


---------08:31----------
two and you have none that there's just


---------08:33----------
sort of a karmic setup there that like


---------08:36----------
if I'm able to do something like who


---------08:38----------
else is gonna do it because the really


---------08:40----------
scary


---------08:41----------
yeah can I give it can I give another


---------08:43----------
example sure because I like the


---------08:45----------
apartment let's say you're on the park


---------08:47----------
bench and you have two sandwiches right


---------08:50----------
and the person next to you didn't eat


---------08:53----------
all day right and the person on the


---------08:58----------
other side of the the park hasn't eaten


---------09:02----------
for a week


---------09:04----------
or a month would you give the sandwich


---------09:06----------
to


---------09:08----------
I don't understand how that analogy


---------09:11----------
relates to our situation here well like


---------09:15----------
for me because when the when the core is


---------09:19----------
helping people you try to help people


---------09:21----------
where the needs is the biggest and I'm


---------09:24----------
just trying to use your support I think


---------09:27----------
I should be doing instead


---------09:30----------
well I just want to understand the true


---------09:33----------
intent and motivation of why you're


---------09:36----------
helping people because that would give


---------09:38----------
the answer to whether it even what what


---------09:41----------
whether it's even relevant if something


---------09:44----------
else would be better because what would


---------09:47----------
have what I've realized and and


---------09:48----------
experienced myself in my life is a lot


---------09:52----------
of the time when people are doing good


---------09:54----------
it's within their comfort and when it


---------09:57----------
when it requires them to go outside


---------09:59----------
their comfort they start rationalizing


---------10:01----------
why they shouldn't be doing this so they


---------10:04----------
shouldn't be doing that and and then


---------10:05----------
even mentioning what they could be doing


---------10:08----------
better just causes conflict and has very


---------10:10----------
little purpose like for me my goal is


---------10:13----------
not to pinpoint the inconsistencies my


---------10:16----------
what I just try to understand is what


---------10:19----------
the intent is because if the intent is


---------10:21----------
really pure and and really like yeah I


---------10:23----------
want to help people where the need is


---------10:26----------
the biggest and and I am very you know


---------10:28----------
almost about it towards myself and I


---------10:30----------
would even go out of my comfort zone


---------10:32----------
because like for example the two


---------10:34----------
sandwiches if you're really hungry you


---------10:35----------
could eat them both you go out of your


---------10:37----------
comfort zone giving a sandwich to the


---------10:39----------
person next to you but how far would you


---------10:41----------
go would you would you give it to two


---------10:43----------
starving people next to you and not eat


---------10:46----------
the sandwich help me understand why it


---------10:48----------
is it is help me understand why you want


---------10:52----------
to understand my motivations and


---------10:54----------
specifically it sounds like you're


---------10:56----------
trying to figure out do I fall into the


---------10:58----------
camp of helping people within my comfort


---------11:00----------
zone or helping people outside of my


---------11:03----------
comfort zone that seems to be what


---------11:04----------
you're asking about or to which extent


---------11:07----------
would you go out of your comfort zone in


---------11:09----------
order to to basically follow the the


---------11:13----------
Dharma ideology yeah so yeah why do you


---------11:17----------
think you're so you're curious about


---------11:19----------
that right you're curious about me


---------11:22----------
and to what degree I will step outside


---------11:23----------
of my comfort zone to help people well


---------11:26----------
yeah like it would be it's it's very


---------11:28----------
interesting to know yet to know these


---------11:30----------
things because what I yeah yeah so


---------11:33----------
people people are curious about all


---------11:36----------
kinds of things right like some people


---------11:38----------
are curious about what kind of product I


---------11:41----------
put in my hair


---------11:43----------
some people are curious about yeah but I


---------11:46----------
mean I'm curious about this is because


---------11:47----------
it's very functional


---------11:50----------
it's like if you can find common what I


---------11:54----------
mean like what what I mean with that is


---------11:57----------
if you can find a common shared


---------12:00----------
foundation then you can potentially get


---------12:04----------
a lot more of the relationship than just


---------12:06----------
this talk for example like if you share


---------12:09----------
you're looking for commonality between


---------12:11----------
me and you


---------12:15----------
because now I can play now thank you I


---------12:17----------
completely agree with because I think


---------12:19----------
that's what you're looking for too


---------12:20----------
so I that's a new line more than


---------12:22----------
commonality with you and me I would say


---------12:25----------
commonality with are you comparing us


---------12:30----------
no like that's that's exactly what I'm


---------12:32----------
trying to get to for me it's not about


---------12:34----------
comparing to what I do because that's


---------12:36----------
that's not so relevant to me it's about


---------12:38----------
understanding your connection to giving


---------12:43----------
back to the world basically and how


---------12:45----------
strong that is and so is it how you


---------12:47----------
isn't that like the central part of I


---------12:50----------
mean just based on what you've said so


---------12:51----------
far I guess that that is a very central


---------12:54----------
part of who you are


---------12:55----------
is that you are someone who gives back


---------12:57----------
to the world and I mean I don't really


---------13:00----------
know much but that I would guess that


---------13:01----------
you step outside of comfort zones that


---------13:05----------
many other people would not well the


---------13:08----------
thing is like for me rather than saying


---------13:11----------
this is how I am or whatever like I


---------13:14----------
don't really have an identity about it I


---------13:16----------
just got to do what I got to do it's


---------13:19----------
like water that flows down a mountain


---------13:21----------
why does it flow down a mountain it's


---------13:23----------
just because it follows the path of what


---------13:26----------
it is and and I think if you come to a


---------13:29----------
certain awareness of us what is so let


---------13:32----------
me ask you what is the how does the


---------13:33----------
water flow down the mountain in terms of


---------13:36----------
this example of like me sitting with a


---------13:38----------
guy next to me and then a guy across the


---------13:40----------
park who hasn't eaten for a week where


---------13:42----------
has water flow there well the the thing


---------13:45----------
is like if you if you grow up right and


---------13:48----------
depending on how you've been conditioned


---------13:50----------
and such you are you are very wired to


---------13:52----------
follow how you feel yeah


---------13:56----------
rather and do what feels right rather


---------13:58----------
than what is right Dan so but but and


---------14:01----------
then your water will flow differently


---------14:03----------
then if you go about it in a more


---------14:05----------
analytical manner where you just see the


---------14:08----------
impact for what it is and base your


---------14:11----------
actions on that even if it doesn't


---------14:13----------
always feel as as as as good and that's


---------14:16----------
the thing that's how you achieve very


---------14:18----------
big impact by by by playing the number


---------14:21----------
became more so than playing the the


---------14:23----------
empathy game and that's why okay so help


---------14:27----------
me understand something a theme so you


---------14:29----------
were saying earlier that you don't


---------14:30----------
really think about this stuff as your


---------14:33----------
identity you don't really think about


---------14:35----------
whether you step out of your comfort


---------14:36----------
zone that you are essentially like like


---------14:39----------
you have water that flows downhill and


---------14:41----------
so you have some sort of intrinsic


---------14:43----------
arrived to do something and you kind of


---------14:45----------
don't question it you just do it it's


---------14:47----------
not you it's just a natural process well


---------14:50----------
let me let me bounce back the question


---------14:52----------
do I have a drive to breed


---------14:56----------
yes


---------14:59----------
okay so like there is an actual active


---------15:03----------
process in my brain going on where I say


---------15:06----------
and mind myself to breathe


---------15:09----------
yes maybe we're maybe we're


---------15:11----------
miscommunicating well no so yeah you


---------15:14----------
absolutely have parts of your brain that


---------15:16----------
measure your co2 levels and Oh two


---------15:18----------
levels you know that's not it's not part


---------15:21----------
of my awareness it's it's not part of my


---------15:22----------
active awareness it's not like but let


---------15:25----------
me give another example do do do I have


---------15:28----------
the drive for my blood cells to - you


---------15:32----------
know heimeau go hemoglobin to absorb


---------15:35----------
oxygen from the air and distribute it to


---------15:39----------
my organs do I have a drive to do that


---------15:41----------
no no well just by drive you buy drive


---------15:45----------
you're defining that is like an


---------15:46----------
awareness or a motivation to consciously


---------15:49----------
do that


---------15:51----------
why do you drive so yeah that that's


---------15:54----------
what what I'm trying to get to is trying


---------15:56----------
to figure out a common ground because to


---------15:59----------
make sure we understand the same


---------16:01----------
language so for me like it's more a


---------16:05----------
state of being rather than a drive it's


---------16:08----------
like I just wake up and I do what I


---------16:11----------
gotta do and and that's as simple as it


---------16:13----------
is there is you know so that's on one


---------16:16----------
end of the spectrum and being analytical


---------16:18----------
is on the other end of the spectrum well


---------16:23----------
but the thing is though like being


---------16:25----------
analytical is part of just doing what I


---------16:28----------
got to do because it's like you know a


---------16:31----------
computer that that processes you know a


---------16:34----------
lot of data it's also just doing what it


---------16:36----------
has to do and it's analyzing numbers


---------16:38----------
like crazy as well like like I just want


---------16:41----------
to make sure that you understand what


---------16:43----------
what I mean like it's just a state ID


---------16:45----------
yeah I don't understand what what you


---------16:48----------
mean I think but that's what I'm trying


---------16:49----------
to explain it


---------16:50----------
that's why I explain it like I think it


---------16:52----------
would be helpful so generally speaking


---------16:54----------
in my experience so you let me know if


---------16:55----------
your experience is different yeah when


---------16:58----------
I'm communicating with someone who


---------16:59----------
doesn't understand what I mean and they


---------17:02----------
ask a question I find that instead of


---------17:05----------
giving them an explanation or asking


---------17:07----------
them a completely separate question I


---------17:09----------
find that like if someone asks me a


---------17:12----------
question if I'm if my goal is


---------17:14----------
understanding I just answer it right if


---------17:16----------
someone asks me like oh look what are


---------17:19----------
you put in your hair instead of talking


---------17:20----------
about hemoglobin or red blood cells or


---------17:22----------
using an analogy I just answer the


---------17:25----------
question that they ask so like in


---------17:28----------
communication what is what is crucial is


---------17:31----------
for the other person to understand what


---------17:33----------
you mean because else you're just


---------17:35----------
explaining something based on your own


---------17:37----------
experience and how you grew up and maybe


---------17:39----------
the person won't even understand what


---------17:40----------
you're trying to explain so that's why


---------17:42----------
for me it's very important to define


---------17:44----------
certain concepts in a way that you


---------17:47----------
understand them the way I'm trying to


---------17:48----------
explain them because maybe I'm using


---------17:50----------
words in a different way than you are or


---------17:53----------
have a different meaning in a result we


---------17:55----------
wish are so so I I completely agree that


---------17:57----------
sometimes there's confusion about


---------17:59----------
terminology and that it's important to


---------18:01----------
like iron out those details but what


---------18:04----------
I'm really curious about us sometimes I


---------18:05----------
ask you a question and instead of just


---------18:08----------
answering the question and then us going


---------18:10----------
from there because maybe I understand


---------18:12----------
what you mean maybe I don't so usually


---------18:14----------
when someone answers a question what I


---------18:16----------
try to do is repeat back what I


---------18:18----------
understood and then give them a chance


---------18:20----------
to clarify but what I'm noticing that


---------18:24----------
you're doing is when I ask a question


---------18:26----------
you sort of ask me a question or talk


---------18:28----------
about some sort of analogy like do you


---------18:30----------
see how that's the pattern of our


---------18:32----------
communication it's because I I go within


---------18:36----------
the concepts you use if you talk about


---------18:38----------
drive I dive deeper into the word and


---------18:42----------
what it actually means to me which gives


---------18:45----------
it a much a much more accurate answer


---------18:47----------
than one where I would just answer more


---------18:50----------
superficially in a way that you know


---------18:52----------
that that's so accurate for who jaime


---------19:00----------
accra so when you give additional


---------19:02----------
information well it gives it who does


---------19:06----------
that who does that make things more


---------19:08----------
accurate for yourself or for me well it


---------19:15----------
would give you a better understanding in


---------19:18----------
what I mean with Drive and how it


---------19:21----------
relates to but I think why don't you


---------19:23----------
rely on me to ask the questions about


---------19:25----------
the things that I don't understand


---------19:27----------
instead of presuming what I do or don't


---------19:29----------
understand and that's like telling me


---------19:31----------
random stuff huh because you might jump


---------19:35----------
to conclusions based on the answers I


---------19:37----------
give absolutely man absolutely I


---------19:40----------
completely agree with you so when I jump


---------19:42----------
to a conclusion I think it would be


---------19:44----------
awesome if you point that out to me yes


---------19:48----------
and that's what I'm and what I think


---------19:51----------
would also be awesome is if I ask you a


---------19:53----------
question if instead of like talking


---------19:56----------
about some sort of foundational analogy


---------19:59----------
you answer the question and then you see


---------20:01----------
if I jump to a conclusion like if I ask


---------20:03----------
you is 2+2 4 and then your answer is


---------20:05----------
like well let's start talking about


---------20:07----------
mathematics and then you start talking


---------20:09----------
about mathematics to make sure we're all


---------20:10----------
on the same page but if I ask you is 2+2


---------20:12----------
4 and then you say yes and then I'm like


---------20:15----------
ok great we all agree that 2+2 is 4 we


---------20:17----------
don't


---------20:17----------
have to go into the background but even


---------20:20----------
there when you say is 2+2 4 even though


---------20:23----------
that is you know accurate in within


---------20:25----------
uncertain framework


---------20:26----------
you could argue in certain frameworks


---------20:28----------
2+2 is not equal for sure you could


---------20:31----------
argue anything with anyone I know which


---------20:33----------
is what we're doing apparently that is


---------20:36----------
but that is why what I always try to do


---------20:38----------
is to avoid ok so I think are you


---------20:42----------
willing to answer questions in a way


---------20:44----------
that may I may find helpful or do you


---------20:46----------
want to answer questions in the way that


---------20:48----------
you think will best help me understand


---------20:50----------
like are we going to rely on my judgment


---------20:53----------
to help me like like if I ask you a


---------20:56----------
question about your preferences or your


---------20:57----------
beliefs do you think it like it's really


---------21:00----------
important for you to lay that foundation


---------21:01----------
or is it possible for you to just answer


---------21:05----------
a question and then correct me if I'm


---------21:06----------
wrong that that's the thing if you if


---------21:08----------
you get to understand like how I see


---------21:11----------
things


---------21:12----------
then a lot of these questions become


---------21:13----------
irrelevant like for example believes if


---------21:16----------
you ask me what do you believe in like


---------21:18----------
it's it's very irrelevant to me because


---------21:20----------
to me I just look at reality and that's


---------21:24----------
it and things are the way they are and I


---------21:25----------
accept them my beliefs and even my


---------21:28----------
feelings are merely tools for life to to


---------21:31----------
to to thrive and to align with reality


---------21:33----------
nothing more nothing less


---------21:34----------
so I don't have an attachment to it if


---------21:37----------
if I believe a certain thing it's merely


---------21:40----------
a tool to to to to be more aligned but


---------21:43----------
if tomorrow I get confronted otherwise I


---------21:45----------
change that belief


---------21:46----------
it's very moldable it's adaptable and


---------21:48----------
that's the thing like when when when


---------21:52----------
when certain value is being given on


---------21:54----------
certain concepts I bring up people and


---------21:57----------
maybe also perhaps you might get the


---------21:59----------
wrong idea


---------22:00----------
and that's why I'm trying to explain


---------22:01----------
like yeah I just I just do what I got to


---------22:03----------
do and here's what I'm here's what I'm


---------22:06----------
hearing from you a theme you're very


---------22:07----------
concerned about people getting the wrong


---------22:09----------
idea and it's very important for you


---------22:12----------
that they appropriately understand you


---------22:16----------
you know I don't find it important like


---------22:19----------
but that is acceptances stop stop for a


---------22:23----------
second this whole conversation is about


---------22:26----------
me asking you a question and then you


---------22:28----------
taking a painstaking


---------22:31----------
and deliberate approach to making sure


---------22:33----------
that I don't jump to conclusions correct


---------22:36----------
like that's exactly what you've been


---------22:38----------
saying more so easy for you to


---------22:41----------
understand what I ABS so then I just


---------22:43----------
asked you a question it seems very


---------22:46----------
important that you are not misunderstood


---------22:48----------
that other people understand what you're


---------22:50----------
trying to say and don't misrepresent


---------22:52----------
your beliefs that is what I'm asking if


---------22:55----------
I value if you if you value


---------22:57----------
understanding Mead and I deem to show


---------23:00----------
the respect to explain things the way I


---------23:02----------
would explain it to myself so if if I


---------23:05----------
was use not a yes I'm confused


---------23:08----------
so it's my impression that you were it's


---------23:13----------
very important to you that I understand


---------23:16----------
things and I don't jump to conclusions


---------23:17----------
and that you want to explain things to


---------23:21----------
me in a way where like I understand your


---------23:23----------
foundation I understand your logic I


---------23:25----------
understand where you start from I


---------23:27----------
understand your foundational beliefs so


---------23:29----------
that I can understand what you're saying


---------23:30----------
that's what you're trying to do right


---------23:32----------
like I ask you a question instead of


---------23:34----------
answering the question you make sure you


---------23:36----------
lay the foundation so there's no


---------23:37----------
misunderstanding between us that's what


---------23:40----------
we're doing here right if that is the


---------23:43----------
the is if that is what you value within


---------23:46----------
the conversation to understand me then


---------23:47----------
then yes I want to make sure that I


---------23:49----------
explain but I'm not I'm asking you what


---------23:52----------
you value in a conversation because I'm


---------23:54----------
asking you a question and based on your


---------23:56----------
response okay it's not like that what I


---------23:59----------
value what I value in a conversation is


---------24:02----------
for the conversation to lead to positive


---------24:04----------
results


---------24:07----------
okay so what I'm getting from you so I


---------24:12----------
understand that that sounds like sort of


---------24:14----------
an abstract answer but based on the way


---------24:17----------
in which you're answering my questions I


---------24:19----------
think you are very concerned about being


---------24:23----------
let me finish I think about being


---------24:25----------
misunderstood and I also think that you


---------24:28----------
are not comfortable with the idea that


---------24:31----------
you're concerned about that that if I


---------24:34----------
tell you that you're concerned about


---------24:36----------
that that you're going to respond with


---------24:38----------
something telling me how you're not


---------24:40----------
concerned about that because you're like


---------24:41----------
water that flows down hills and water


---------24:44----------
doesn't concern about anything you know


---------24:47----------
I'm not saying I'm not saying that I


---------24:49----------
don't have emotions I have emotions but


---------24:51----------
I don't I just don't value them like I


---------24:54----------
could without that I completely


---------24:56----------
understand that so so like I just said


---------24:58----------
like you're not gonna be you're not


---------25:00----------
gonna you're not gonna believe or value


---------25:03----------
the fact that you are concerned about


---------25:06----------
being misunderstood but the thing is


---------25:09----------
though like I I don't really I don't


---------25:10----------
really mind whether I'm being


---------25:12----------
misunderstood or not like for me I just


---------25:14----------
want to understand that once we are on


---------25:16----------
the same page that's all yeah right so


---------25:20----------
so like that's exactly what I just said


---------25:21----------
right like you are not going to accept


---------25:24----------
or agree to the fact that you are


---------25:27----------
concerned about being misunderstood and


---------25:29----------
you just said that well whereas I don't


---------25:34----------
think I don't experience any concern of


---------25:37----------
being misunderstood like I believe that


---------25:40----------
I understand I don't think you


---------25:41----------
experience the concern what I'm saying


---------25:43----------
is that if you analyze our conversation


---------25:45----------
you have a very very important goal in


---------25:49----------
the conversation to not be misunderstood


---------25:51----------
and since you devalue emotions I'm sure


---------25:55----------
you experience them wait wait wait or


---------25:57----------
what our value is that we have proper


---------25:59----------
communication


---------26:01----------
yeah so that when you ask me a question


---------26:04----------
that I give you a nice you know a nice


---------26:07----------
overview so you have a good good good


---------26:09----------
view in what I mean and absent and what


---------26:13----------
I'm trying absolutely like that that's


---------26:15----------
what I can I try to rephrase that to you


---------26:18----------
so what you value in a conversation is


---------26:20----------
to be understood that's what you just


---------26:24----------
said right well what I value in a


---------26:27----------
conversation is that it has positive


---------26:29----------
results being understood or not is just


---------26:31----------
a tool in order to get positive results


---------26:34----------
for me if I know we're on the same page


---------26:36----------
then understanding each other is by far


---------26:39----------
the most effective approach in order to


---------26:41----------
have the best positive results but if


---------26:43----------
we're not on the same page then


---------26:45----------
communication is merely a tool for both


---------26:47----------
of us to achieve the goal while we have


---------26:50----------
the conversation to begin with are


---------26:53----------
either this understood I think say what


---------26:55----------
are you misunderstood when in general


---------27:01----------
now in general well people call me a


---------27:05----------
cult leader and stuff like I don't even


---------27:07----------
like it yeah yeah people yeah I would


---------27:10----------
say lack of understanding yes a lot of


---------27:13----------
is a very bit of lack of understanding


---------27:15----------
but by by bigger than that like on the


---------27:18----------
Internet


---------27:19----------
I mean like what's that like for you


---------27:24----------
well I focus on the people that I can


---------27:27----------
work with to to have an impact in the


---------27:29----------
world because I mean I try and I'm not


---------27:34----------
busy with with like like if if there's a


---------27:37----------
lot of misery in the world right to put


---------27:39----------
it I like to use analogies because it's


---------27:41----------
it makes things very simple to


---------27:43----------
understand like if they're also missing


---------27:44----------
in the world yeah that for me you know


---------27:47----------
the other thing that analogies do a


---------27:48----------
theme is they separate us from the


---------27:50----------
equation right they become abstract and


---------27:52----------
it no longer becomes personal when you


---------27:53----------
use an analogy


---------27:58----------
and it allows you to to have a better


---------28:01----------
you know analytical view on the on the


---------28:04----------
problem and make better decisions


---------28:05----------
absolutely so I think well III think it


---------28:08----------
allows you to have a more analytical


---------28:09----------
view because when you use an analogy you


---------28:11----------
remove yourself from the equation right


---------28:14----------
you're not talking about you anymore


---------28:15----------
you're talking about a third party well


---------28:18----------
so it sort of makes sense my


---------28:20----------
conversation where yeah in a


---------28:22----------
conversation where you talk to thousands


---------28:24----------
of people it's very effective to do so


---------28:27----------
because if I talk more about about my


---------28:31----------
own personal experience it might be a


---------28:33----------
little bit you know it might be


---------28:35----------
alienating for some people while if I


---------28:37----------
use certain analogies where people can


---------28:39----------
have an easier time to relate with I can


---------28:41----------
resonate with more people I think you


---------28:43----------
know what I think would be awesome like


---------28:45----------
I would love it if you could do me a


---------28:46----------
favor I want you to just tell like don't


---------28:49----------
talk about analogies like what I am


---------28:51----------
curious about what I would like to


---------28:52----------
understand is not analogies but is you


---------28:57----------
and if you're concerned about alienating


---------28:59----------
me like as I know you're not concerned


---------29:01----------
about being misunderstood because you've


---------29:03----------
made that very very clear that you're


---------29:04----------
not concerned about being misunderstood


---------29:06----------
but that sometimes there's a chance that


---------29:08----------
you alienate people when you answer


---------29:10----------
questions about yourself I'm okay with


---------29:12----------
that


---------29:14----------
like I would love it if you could put


---------29:15----------
faith in me and understand that like


---------29:18----------
even if you talk about yourself that


---------29:19----------
like I'm not gonna be alienated or if I


---------29:21----------
do feel alienated I'll let you know and


---------29:24----------
then you can set me straight so you're


---------29:26----------
telling me I can trust you I'm asking


---------29:29----------
you to trust me I'm asking you to not


---------29:32----------
worry about alienating me and tell me


---------29:34----------
about yourself because that's what I'm


---------29:36----------
curious so like why are you curious


---------29:41----------
about myself


---------29:43----------
because you're here like I'd like to


---------29:45----------
understand you that's that's what I'm


---------29:48----------
that's what I that's what I scream for


---------29:50----------
to talk to and uhm


---------29:52----------
do you truly want to understand me I


---------29:54----------
think so


---------29:55----------
well that that question implies that


---------29:58----------
there may be some up part of the


---------30:00----------
understand like so that's just a weird


---------30:01----------
question do I truly want to understand


---------30:03----------
you that it's not working because


---------30:04----------
because if how would I know the


---------30:06----------
difference between wanting to understand


---------30:08----------
you and truly wanting to understand you


---------30:09----------
I think I I think that if your true


---------30:13----------
intent is to understand me rather than


---------30:16----------
understanding wanting to understand me


---------30:18----------
for another you know separate goal the


---------30:21----------
the intent for which you are trying to


---------30:24----------
understand me will highly define the way


---------30:28----------
you go about it like seeking first to


---------30:30----------
understand and putting yourself in other


---------30:31----------
people's shoes to truly see the world


---------30:34----------
through their eyes and try to understand


---------30:36----------
it has always you know has a reason


---------30:40----------
behind it yeah me because you want to


---------30:43----------
achieve something yourself and depending


---------30:45----------
on what your own goal is your own motive


---------30:47----------
is you will this process of trying to


---------30:50----------
understand me will be different like it


---------30:52----------
might it might suit can I jump in I know


---------30:56----------
you're on a roll but so like I


---------30:58----------
completely agree with you so like I just


---------31:00----------
want to point out what I think just


---------31:01----------
happened there so you asked me do you


---------31:03----------
truly want to understand me I expressed


---------31:05----------
confusion about something your question


---------31:08----------
and then you provided an explanation and


---------31:10----------
now I understand what you mean and my


---------31:13----------
confusion is gone and I do truly want to


---------31:16----------
understand you okay and then let me tell


---------31:21----------
you my true motivation from that


---------31:23----------
conversation is to see or to understand


---------31:28----------
if


---------31:31----------
we both are on the same page in terms of


---------31:34----------
truly wanting to help people because if


---------31:37----------
you want to help people and I want to


---------31:40----------
help people and we are truly you know


---------31:42----------
like like like going about it in the


---------31:44----------
most effective manner and wanted to do


---------31:46----------
it


---------31:46----------
really because it's just the right thing


---------31:49----------
to do and we are responsible to do so


---------31:51----------
then then then then just a conversation


---------31:56----------
is not the only you know we can do a lot


---------32:01----------
more than just having a conversation we


---------32:03----------
can literally you know collaborate and


---------32:07----------
and work together not saying that that's


---------32:11----------
going to happen I'm just saying like


---------32:12----------
what I realize is when it comes down to


---------32:14----------
like-minded people that truly want to


---------32:16----------
give back to the world organizing


---------32:19----------
yourself and working together allows you


---------32:21----------
to elevate your impact drastically so


---------32:24----------
that is you know why for me like


---------32:27----------
initially that's what I'm trying to


---------32:30----------
understand your intent you're like like


---------32:32----------
do you go about it in a scientific way


---------32:34----------
helping people is everybody equal do you


---------32:36----------
see people you know like in you know


---------32:38----------
that are starving as equal as gamers


---------32:40----------
like do you see every human as equal so


---------32:43----------
where do you put your resources where do


---------32:44----------
you put your energy go do you go about


---------32:46----------
it very scientifically and go like okay


---------32:48----------
if I can help so many people there that


---------32:50----------
is more important than you know this or


---------32:52----------
that like that is what I want to try


---------32:53----------
understand and if that is not the case


---------32:55----------
which which I'm fine with


---------32:56----------
then it's about then then the


---------32:58----------
conversation becomes more about like ah


---------33:00----------
what is your true intent and how do you


---------33:03----------
you know how do you how do you find a


---------33:08----------
relationship with yourself when you know


---------33:10----------
that truly helping people is not part of


---------33:13----------
the equation but rather it's a mean


---------33:17----------
within your comfort that is that is the


---------33:19----------
you know that is basically the sequence


---------33:24----------
of my my true intent of this


---------33:29----------
conversation so if you truly want to


---------33:31----------
understand me that is what I would like


---------33:33----------
to know so and and if you have questions


---------33:36----------
in that context great but I would also


---------33:38----------
like to know your side of these things


---------33:40----------
sure where you so first of all Athena I


---------33:42----------
want to start by expressing gratitude


---------33:44----------
so I am so grateful that you instead of


---------33:48----------
using analogies instead of asking me


---------33:50----------
questions that you just shared a


---------33:52----------
perspective about yourself right like


---------33:53----------
you just talked about why you're coming


---------33:55----------
on stream and why we're having this


---------33:56----------
conversation what your motivations are


---------33:58----------
that I I'm really grateful for because


---------34:01----------
that helps me instead of like asking


---------34:03----------
like talking about abstract concepts it


---------34:05----------
sounds like you're here because you're


---------34:07----------
you're wondering like where I'm coming


---------34:09----------
from whether are our goals are aligned


---------34:11----------
and whether there's an opportunity for


---------34:13----------
collaboration and if I our vision is not


---------34:18----------
aligned if I have not met some standard


---------34:20----------
that you're that you have for yourself


---------34:23----------
or that some that's get simplified like


---------34:28----------
that sure yes yeah I'm just it's fuzzy


---------34:30----------
then then you maybe you're curious about


---------34:33----------
if I'm not like you then like what am I


---------34:36----------
like and why am I like that way yes yes


---------34:39----------
yeah exactly


---------34:40----------
that yeah that is really yes I I think


---------34:43----------
this this works way better when we stop


---------34:45----------
using analogies and we actually just


---------34:46----------
like start talking to each other and


---------34:48----------
making sure if we're on the same page


---------34:49----------
right yes okay so thank you for doing


---------34:53----------
that that that style of communication


---------34:54----------
helps me way more so I mean so can I


---------35:00----------
tell you why I why I'm here to have this


---------35:05----------
conversation yeah okay I would love to


---------35:07----------
yeah so um I'm just here to talk to


---------35:10----------
people because you know you kind of talk


---------35:12----------
about like whether I'm in it to help


---------35:13----------
people and and whether I sort of know


---------35:15----------
whether I'm analytical and and do I want


---------35:18----------
to distribute resources in a fair way


---------35:20----------
and things like that I mean I think the


---------35:21----------
short answer is yes but I'm not very


---------35:23----------
confident so I think that I am a human


---------35:26----------
being and I'm prone to bias and although


---------35:28----------
I'm a smart guy and I'm an analytical


---------35:30----------
guy and I've trained for years and


---------35:32----------
formal systems to understand things like


---------35:34----------
bias and emotions and the origins of


---------35:36----------
desires and things like that as well as


---------35:38----------
studying neuroscience and psychology and


---------35:40----------
psychiatry then at the end of the day


---------35:42----------
I'm like sort of a flawed instrument


---------35:44----------
because that's what humans are that


---------35:45----------
humans are not really logical creatures


---------35:47----------
that like we have a lot of other things


---------35:49----------
that drive our behavior so I'm here to


---------35:51----------
do the best that I can but I'm guessing


---------35:53----------
that your commitment is way higher than


---------35:56----------
mine so I also


---------35:58----------
tend to be like somewhat of a really


---------35:59----------
like balanced guy in life in terms of


---------36:01----------
like I and I I don't nothin nothing


---------36:04----------
about your so I apologize if this is


---------36:06----------
being judgmental but I enjoy playing


---------36:08----------
video games I understand you do too so


---------36:10----------
maybe we're not that different but that


---------36:13----------
you know I I mean I basically wake up


---------36:15----------
and I try to help who I can in the way


---------36:17----------
that I can until I'm done helping people


---------36:20----------
and I need some time to recuperate or


---------36:22----------
regenerate and then I sort of like will


---------36:24----------
go home and I'll do like you know simple


---------36:27----------
things and be a regular human and then I


---------36:30----------
come back three times a week to hop on


---------36:32----------
stream and I try to help whoever the


---------36:34----------
universe puts in front of me and by the


---------36:36----------
universe I mean dank Moses who sets up


---------36:39----------
who comes on here so so and so I don't


---------36:43----------
like that is does that fit it that's it


---------36:45----------
that's what I'm about it's it's it's a


---------36:48----------
it's an answer that gives me an answer


---------36:50----------
to the question like yeah because like


---------36:52----------
the way I go about it I I take it I take


---------36:56----------
that my commitment a lot further and it


---------36:59----------
might be connected with confidence


---------37:01----------
because you you initiate it your


---------37:04----------
response by saying you're not that


---------37:05----------
confident because you have your own


---------37:07----------
flaws and I do know we all have our own


---------37:09----------
flaws but the beauty about humans is the


---------37:12----------
ability to learn from our flaws and and


---------37:15----------
improve it and and not to settle with


---------37:19----------
our flaws and it's right try to do


---------37:22----------
better and better I can bring the


---------37:24----------
impression that I'm not confident it's


---------37:27----------
what you said you started your answer by


---------37:30----------
saying like yeah so I'm asking you so


---------37:32----------
your impression of me would you say that


---------37:35----------
I come across as lacking and I think I


---------37:38----------
think my impression of you is is


---------37:41----------
actually irrelevant if I trust what you


---------37:45----------
say because if you say you're not


---------37:47----------
confident because of the human flaws


---------37:49----------
then I just accept that because you come


---------37:51----------
across a confidence but it's not about


---------37:53----------
how you come across


---------37:54----------
what you are is defined by what you are


---------37:56----------
and my my impression of you does not


---------37:59----------
have to align with with the facts of


---------38:02----------
what you actually are therefore I always


---------38:04----------
question my impression like and I just I


---------38:07----------
give you the benefit of the doubt and


---------38:09----------
what you say I just assumed to be true


---------38:12----------
unless there's an inconsistency yeah so


---------38:16----------
I wouldn't say that I'm not confident


---------38:18----------
and in fact I feel pretty confident I


---------38:19----------
would say that I just acknowledged that


---------38:21----------
I have flaws and that I'm not perfect


---------38:23----------
and that there's a big difference I


---------38:24----------
would actually say that my confidence


---------38:26----------
stems from understanding that I have


---------38:28----------
limitations so I used to have way less


---------38:32----------
confidence when I thought I was the best


---------38:35----------
thing since sliced bread as I've gained


---------38:37----------
experience and studied a lot of


---------38:38----------
different disciplines and worked a lot


---------38:40----------
with different people I I've developed a


---------38:43----------
lot of confidence out of understanding


---------38:45----------
that I'm limited and that I make


---------38:46----------
mistakes and do you do you see these


---------38:50----------
mistakes and do these limitations as a


---------38:52----------
strength to do better or as a weakness


---------38:55----------
of a human being


---------38:56----------
ah both probably more of the four more


---------39:04----------
as a strength so I think that I tend to


---------39:05----------
learn from my mistakes and that you


---------39:08----------
should learn from your mistakes and I


---------39:10----------
think that no matter how many mistakes I


---------39:12----------
learn from I'm gonna continue making


---------39:14----------
mistakes buddy but the beauty is that as


---------39:18----------
you keep learning from your mistakes


---------39:21----------
even though you still make mistakes they


---------39:24----------
will be you know they will be from a


---------39:27----------
different type and won't be always the


---------39:31----------
same as the previous once you've made so


---------39:34----------
for example if yes so so we're talking


---------39:37----------
abstractly again right what you see that


---------39:40----------
is abstractly because this is really


---------39:42----------
about you yeah but you're about to say


---------39:44----------
for example and then you were about to


---------39:46----------
use an analogy so I just jumped in there


---------39:48----------
oh I wanted to give you as an example


---------39:52----------
for example you playing video games and


---------39:55----------
being addicted to it and learning from


---------39:56----------
it okay apologies for interrupting you


---------40:00----------
no it's fine has put you in a position


---------40:01----------
where where you were you now helping


---------40:04----------
other gamers with similar issues so that


---------40:06----------
yeah that that in a sense that mistake


---------40:09----------
has has made you come out stronger and


---------40:12----------
absolutely you and and what I would I


---------40:15----------
would go even a step further and say


---------40:17----------
that any type of you know like anywhere


---------40:21----------
where you can improve even in in


---------40:24----------
in the more comfortable comfortable area


---------40:30----------
of your life even there you can you can


---------40:33----------
push further further and and do even


---------40:36----------
more good that's that's all I'm trying


---------40:37----------
to to point because for me I truly see


---------40:44----------
myself as the same as you as the same as


---------40:46----------
everyone we're all equal like I I do I


---------40:49----------
do think we're all equal in our


---------40:51----------
environment and how we grow up for a big


---------40:54----------
part shapes us we're where we where we


---------40:56----------
end up and and how we see things but


---------41:00----------
fundamentally our essence is is the same


---------41:02----------
and we we all just want to align with


---------41:05----------
reality in and we're all just life and


---------41:07----------
that's it and and basically like our


---------41:12----------
ability to you know understand these


---------41:14----------
mechanics and understand how it works


---------41:17----------
allows us to just you know be a better


---------41:20----------
version of ourselves and there is no


---------41:22----------
reason to act it at a certain point when


---------41:25----------
you feel comfortable say are here is the


---------41:26----------
line and this is where I stop and that


---------41:29----------
is why I just you know when you wear


---------41:31----------
earlier saying like oh yeah maybe have a


---------41:33----------
different way of going about life and


---------41:36----------
stuff or maybe it's it's it's it's


---------41:38----------
higher or well it didn't use the word


---------41:40----------
higher but it was in that direction I


---------41:42----------
don't see myself as I live my life at a


---------41:44----------
higher moral level or whatever I just


---------41:47----------
see I just try to be consistent and


---------41:49----------
truthful to myself and I and I and I and


---------41:52----------
I you know I put the bar where reality


---------41:55----------
is and and and when I see how people are


---------41:58----------
starving and stuff it really you know it


---------42:01----------
puts the bar quite high because I'm


---------42:03----------
living a very very comfortable life


---------42:05----------
compared to that and even if people feel


---------42:08----------
like I'm sacrificing a lot or even if


---------42:10----------
they feel like whoa you really go out of


---------42:12----------
your comfort zone because even when it


---------42:14----------
comes down to games I only play games as


---------42:17----------
function to reach people and and if it


---------42:20----------
doesn't suit the purpose to have an


---------42:22----------
impact I just don't do it because it's a


---------42:24----------
waste of my time like for example right


---------42:27----------
and and and I'm very functional I and


---------42:30----------
I've raised more I think they just jump


---------42:32----------
in for a second


---------42:32----------
are you sure so you've just but you've


---------42:34----------
been like talking for a little while and


---------42:36----------
I just want to pause for a second


---------42:38----------
just process what you've said can I ask


---------42:56----------
you a couple of questions yes of course


---------42:59----------
okay um I just I just found my my


---------43:05----------
attention waning a little bit and I was


---------43:07----------
having trouble following you so it helps


---------43:09----------
me to sort of just pause and make sure i


---------43:12----------
SPECT that because that is try to


---------43:14----------
actually listen which yeah III because


---------43:18----------
you said a couple of things that I was


---------43:20----------
really curious about and I think I'd


---------43:21----------
like to understand those better before


---------43:23----------
you keep going so that if we do have


---------43:25----------
sort of a common foundation so you said


---------43:26----------
that you set the bar where reality is


---------43:31----------
yes do you think that that is different


---------43:34----------
from what other people do that's a good


---------43:41----------
question because I would say other


---------43:44----------
people always set the bar where the


---------43:46----------
reality is and that's just how it is but


---------43:48----------
the thing is people's reality can be you


---------43:53----------
know can be very narrow can be very


---------43:56----------
small can we just do you know they're


---------43:57----------
family and that's it while the reality


---------43:59----------
that I live in is is is the planet like


---------44:02----------
I really see and look at the issues all


---------44:04----------
around the world and and these issues


---------44:06----------
when they're not in people's awareness


---------44:09----------
because they're not busy with it then


---------44:11----------
it's not part of their reality and even


---------44:13----------
their actual reality it doesn't exist


---------44:15----------
it's only you know it's only when they


---------44:17----------
see it on the news or whatever that they


---------44:18----------
get confronted by it same with like for


---------44:20----------
example I'll give you another example


---------44:22----------
like the meat industry like people when


---------44:25----------
they just buy it buy meat they just you


---------44:27----------
know there is the reality what are you


---------44:30----------
doing again theme okay I like I'll give


---------44:36----------
the I'll make the I'll make the example


---------44:38----------
personal like if you know


---------44:41----------
but you just I I don't I don't feel like


---------44:44----------
I need an example can I actually can we


---------44:46----------
go the other route where I just asked


---------44:47----------
you and and make sure you're on the same


---------44:49----------
page yeah thank good okay so you're


---------44:53----------
saying that you set your standard to


---------44:56----------
reality in that everyone sets their


---------44:57----------
standard to reality and that some


---------45:00----------
people's and the realities are narrow


---------45:02----------
and some people's realities are planet


---------45:05----------
wide well like depending on your


---------45:07----------
awareness it's it's bigger or smaller


---------45:09----------
and that basically where is your


---------45:13----------
awareness in relation to like other


---------45:15----------
people


---------45:17----------
I see everybody as equal well that's


---------45:21----------
kind of interesting because because it


---------45:23----------
that you know you you make these you


---------45:26----------
make these kind of like abstract


---------45:28----------
philosophical statements but when I


---------45:30----------
actually listen to what you say it


---------45:32----------
implies something else so maybe you can


---------45:34----------
help me understand this because you want


---------45:36----------
to say like so I asked you you know do


---------45:38----------
other people have objective realities


---------45:40----------
and then you said yes and then you


---------45:42----------
proceeded to make an actual comparison


---------45:44----------
so you said that they're their realities


---------45:47----------
are narrow whereas my reality is planet


---------45:50----------
wide so you may think it's Harrison


---------45:52----------
there I can't I can give you a really


---------45:54----------
good example I'm sure you can but but


---------45:56----------
please don't get me an example I just


---------45:59----------
want to make sure yeah I know I know you


---------46:02----------
really want to give me an example and it


---------46:04----------
seems like you just really he'll give


---------46:05----------
you a very concrete one about just you


---------46:07----------
can't you can't I know you just really


---------46:10----------
want to right you want to give me an


---------46:11----------
example like do you know do you see that


---------46:14----------
within yourself that you really want to


---------46:16----------
just give me that example like you got


---------46:18----------
it like you got to make me understand


---------46:20----------
you really need to tell me like do you


---------46:21----------
see that within yourself that there's


---------46:23----------
something within you that's like a


---------46:24----------
volcano that wants to explode and just


---------46:26----------
give me that example


---------46:29----------
No if you don't if you aren't eager to


---------46:32----------
hear it and there's no reason to bring


---------46:34----------
it up I am NOT eager to hear I would


---------46:36----------
like to ask a question and it's not that


---------46:38----------
I don't want to hear what you want to


---------46:39----------
say it's just that I find that I hopes


---------46:41----------
and you way better without examples okay


---------46:44----------
so you made a comparison so you say that


---------46:47----------
all people are equal I'm with you you


---------46:49----------
made a comparison where you said that


---------46:51----------
other people have narrow realities and


---------46:53----------
your reality is planet wide yes okay so


---------46:58----------
is there an intrinsic value judgment


---------47:01----------
there like is one better than the other


---------47:07----------
one benefits humanity more than the


---------47:09----------
other so so you're saying that one is


---------47:12----------
better that the planet-wide version of


---------47:15----------
reality is better that white version of


---------47:18----------
reality definitely leads to more


---------47:21----------
constructive actions towards society and


---------47:23----------
towards humanity and life in general yes


---------47:26----------
thank you very much for explaining that


---------47:28----------
that helps me immensely to understand


---------47:30----------
how was it what was it like when I when


---------47:33----------
I sort of was a little bit of an [ __ ]


---------47:34----------
for which I apologize and and and sort


---------47:37----------
of jumped in when you were about to


---------47:38----------
provide an analogy and ask you a


---------47:40----------
question that you answered is that okay


---------47:42----------
for you is it okay if I continue to do


---------47:44----------
that mine okay I don't mind if this


---------47:46----------
helps you and if it serves that purpose


---------47:49----------
then you you can even yell at me I don't


---------47:51----------
mind okay thank you so much man I


---------47:53----------
appreciate it it really helps me


---------47:54----------
understand okay


---------47:55----------
so um and if I cross the line please let


---------47:59----------
me know because it's not my intention


---------48:00----------
it's just I I kind of get the sense from


---------48:02----------
you that there's just this really like


---------48:04----------
instinctive responsive reflexive desire


---------48:07----------
to like help me understand through


---------48:09----------
analogies whereas I just I just want to


---------48:11----------
ask questions and if you answer them


---------48:13----------
plainly I think we'll get there I just


---------48:16----------
have to I have to I have to be better at


---------48:18----------
responding in a way that resonates


---------48:20----------
better with you and I can do I


---------48:22----------
appreciate that


---------48:23----------
yeah that's exactly what I'm asking you


---------48:24----------
to do so I'm really you know I'm


---------48:26----------
adapting a bit yeah thank you I am too


---------48:29----------
yeah so so so it sounds like there is


---------48:33----------
sort of an inherent value judgement


---------48:35----------
about kind of the nature of reality and


---------48:37----------
how much that your version of reality


---------48:39----------
benefits humanity would you call a


---------48:41----------
judgement or would you call it


---------48:43----------
observation


---------48:48----------
you


---------48:51----------
you


---------48:54----------
hi yeah yeah I'm just thinking oh oh


---------48:58----------
sorry sorry sorry it's a good question


---------49:01----------
what I call it a judgment or what I call


---------49:03----------
it an observation I'm not sure I mean if


---------49:11----------
someone is hot that was I was gonna give


---------49:13----------
if I'm busy with you know the


---------49:15----------
environment right and I see where I put


---------49:17----------
my trash to make sure that it doesn't


---------49:19----------
you know that it doesn't pollute the


---------49:21----------
planet and someone else just goes like


---------49:23----------
whatever and throws the trash out and


---------49:25----------
litters I mean like there's the is just


---------49:29----------
a simple example it is it's a personal


---------49:31----------
one or if if I choose to not smoke


---------49:33----------
because its effect will my health in the


---------49:36----------
long term what is he so simple related


---------49:39----------
to you know the the smoking example is


---------49:42----------
also related to a more earth kind of


---------49:47----------
awareness where I don't even deem my own


---------49:50----------
life as as crazy as it is sound as


---------49:54----------
myself my own


---------49:55----------
it's like cells in my body they are


---------49:58----------
there they just do what they gotta do


---------49:59----------
for my life for me to live just as much


---------50:04----------
as I'm here part of the collective to to


---------50:07----------
to give back life is not about me and if


---------50:11----------
you have a if you make life very small


---------50:15----------
then you can believe it's about you even


---------50:17----------
though it's not and that's why so many


---------50:18----------
people experience a void in their life


---------50:20----------
okay um is it okay if I switch gears and


---------50:24----------
just ask you questions in sort of a


---------50:25----------
different vein sure let's go can you


---------50:27----------
tell me a little bit about where you


---------50:29----------
grew up and what your upbringing was


---------50:31----------
like I in Belgium my family was very


---------50:40----------
poor


---------50:40----------
my father's mother came from a very poor


---------50:42----------
rural place


---------50:44----------
my mother is Belgium my mother was my


---------50:47----------
mother was raised Christian and my


---------50:50----------
father was raised Muslim


---------50:54----------
I wasn't like we were financially more


---------50:58----------
strong around 1415 years old


---------51:01----------
hmm so yeah my youth was pretty poor but


---------51:04----------
I didn't experience it as much my father


---------51:06----------
was quite


---------51:08----------
a very strong figure of authority while


---------51:11----------
my mother was very caring and loving and


---------51:16----------
I've had have since I was really young I


---------51:19----------
I was very much in contact with my


---------51:23----------
brother and his friends which were a lot


---------51:26----------
older talking about philosophy and stuff


---------51:28----------
so very young I was already thinking


---------51:31----------
about stuff when I was already seven


---------51:32----------
eight I was already thinking about you


---------51:34----------
know like signs and stuff and was very


---------51:38----------
busy with it


---------51:40----------
so what else yeah I guess that's that's


---------51:43----------
a I've been always I've never I got a


---------51:47----------
little bit you know like when I was


---------51:48----------
young you know some fights in school but


---------51:50----------
I was never like experiencing low


---------51:52----------
self-esteem and I was very unethical


---------51:56----------
since I was very young a very very


---------51:58----------
observer a very observant if I didn't


---------52:01----------
really develop identity when I was 13


---------52:04----------
like puberty didn't hit me so hard and I


---------52:07----------
just wanted to give back my entire life


---------52:09----------
because I've Irie you know saw the wrong


---------52:12----------
in the world and when I saw people that


---------52:15----------
were struggling and me not there is just


---------52:18----------
no difference between me and them it's


---------52:20----------
just like why this is just unfair and if


---------52:22----------
I can do something about it I got to do


---------52:24----------
something about it because else yeah


---------52:26----------
what if I'm that kid I mean if the roles


---------52:29----------
were different and this is just not okay


---------52:31----------
and you said your dad was an authority


---------52:34----------
figure what do you mean by that


---------52:37----------
he was a very uh yeah like very what is


---------52:42----------
the word he became very fundamental


---------52:47----------
Islamic rule alder and was very just a


---------52:55----------
very dominant person that at times were


---------53:00----------
quite it was quite I tried to avoid him


---------53:06----------
when I was younger because it was quite


---------53:09----------
what do you call it


---------53:12----------
yeah just yeah well it's not pleasant to


---------53:16----------
be around him but when it comes down to


---------53:17----------
trauma or something I I never got


---------53:21----------
traumatized by him or anything I don't


---------53:26----------
know for my other siblings if it was the


---------53:28----------
same I think I was like I was always


---------53:32----------
doing really well in school and such so


---------53:34----------
I didn't get the the heat I was not the


---------53:37----------
front line of the one that was taking


---------53:40----------
the blame or frustrations of my father


---------53:42----------
when he was angry so I was always like


---------53:46----------
in my own little corner playing with


---------53:48----------
Lego or whatever when I was a kid so I


---------53:51----------
went through childhood pretty


---------53:54----------
unscratched unless no I'm not


---------53:57----------
suppressing anything there's nothing I


---------53:59----------
forgot about so there's a few things


---------54:02----------
that happen in my past that that had


---------54:04----------
quite a hard impact on me emotionally


---------54:07----------
but even later on in life I managed to


---------54:10----------
process them by reflecting on it like


---------54:13----------
for example like you have in culture of


---------54:17----------
Islam they kill a sheep like that kind


---------54:21----------
of stuff but I was already you know I


---------54:23----------
was it was already vegetarian before


---------54:26----------
that because of my brother but seeing


---------54:29----------
these kind of things made me also


---------54:30----------
realise what are we doing I mean it


---------54:32----------
doesn't make any sense but like it


---------54:34----------
sometimes was hard for me to understand


---------54:37----------
why grown-ups can be so inconsistent but


---------54:41----------
I very quickly came to the realization


---------54:43----------
that people are not perfect and that


---------54:47----------
that even pointing out flaws or whatever


---------54:50----------
leads to more harm than good so yeah


---------54:54----------
okay I became very pragmatic in the way


---------54:57----------
I certainly see that you seemed very


---------54:59----------
pragmatic you seemed very analytical


---------55:01----------
you seem very philosophical you seem to


---------55:05----------
live by truths right that you've you've


---------55:08----------
discovered through reflection can I ask


---------55:10----------
you a couple of questions just about


---------55:13----------
some of the stuff that you said sure so


---------55:17----------
you said that you didn't sort of fail


---------55:19----------
you never face the brunt of your


---------55:23----------
father's anger


---------55:24----------
that you were kind of off in the corner


---------55:27----------
playing Legos and like someone else was


---------55:28----------
facing the blunt with the brunt yes like


---------55:31----------
my father in the past could be very it


---------55:36----------
could be very aggressive verbally and


---------55:40----------
very what is it the meaning is that the


---------55:44----------
word like really putting people down


---------55:45----------
yeah but I was never the target because


---------55:49----------
because I was really I was basically the


---------55:53----------
how do you say it the exemplar kid to


---------55:56----------
put it that way I always had good grades


---------55:58----------
and so my brother and sisters how many


---------56:05----------
sisters do you have to and also in in


---------56:10----------
Islam culture like definitely


---------56:13----------
traditional woman are not always treated


---------56:16----------
the best so like that's that's like


---------56:20----------
that's also a big source of them being


---------56:25----------
the target and my older brother yeah he


---------56:29----------
he had to deal with a lot of [ __ ] as


---------56:31----------
well in that regards I'm sorry that


---------56:33----------
sounds like sort of a rough situation


---------56:36----------
well I think every family has its own


---------56:40----------
has its own obstacles but he was there


---------56:46----------
for us his entire life and he provided


---------56:48----------
yeah and yeah you've made mistakes he


---------56:53----------
definitely made mistakes but sure


---------56:55----------
in retrospect he you know it could have


---------57:00----------
been a lot worse and he was actually I


---------57:02----------
would say definitely above average when


---------57:06----------
it comes down to giving an aim a score


---------57:08----------
okay good more than five has a father


---------57:11----------
okay so it sounds like he wasn't perfect


---------57:14----------
no one really is and at the same time


---------57:16----------
you're grateful for on average most of


---------57:18----------
what he did for you yeah yeah yeah


---------57:20----------
definitely like all doing retrospect if


---------57:25----------
I could go back in time I would have I


---------57:29----------
would have been more capable of steering


---------57:31----------
things into a more constructive


---------57:34----------
direction because there is also there


---------57:37----------
was a divorce and stuff


---------57:38----------
I could have done things better but I


---------57:40----------
didn't had the the knowledge I have now


---------57:42----------
when I was younger


---------57:44----------
who knows it sounds like you don't feel


---------57:45----------
guilty about that no I don't feel guilty


---------57:47----------
about it I mean this is what it is I


---------57:49----------
just always try to do my best


---------57:50----------
dear do you remember so you sort of like


---------57:54----------
rare but you painted a sort of a vivid


---------57:58----------
image of like you playing Legos in the


---------58:00----------
corner while your dad was maybe yelling


---------58:01----------
at your brother do you remember how you


---------58:03----------
felt when that was going on when you


---------58:05----------
were a kid yeah I was like when these


---------58:09----------
things happened I was just like I was it


---------58:13----------
was getting tuned out like I didn't even


---------58:16----------
I was just like he had there too because


---------58:21----------
my brother and my sister were much older


---------58:23----------
than me they were already you know like


---------58:25----------
what was it sixteen seventeen when I was


---------58:27----------
eight I was just like yeah it's it's


---------58:29----------
grown-ups you know like yelling at each


---------58:33----------
other whatever like it's just almost


---------58:35----------
like another day you know like there was


---------58:38----------
no it didn't make me feel like crawling


---------58:42----------
into a into a corner out of fear I was


---------58:44----------
just there and I was tuning it out


---------58:46----------
because yeah because it was it was just


---------58:50----------
me any sense


---------58:52----------
normal even though you're it's respect


---------58:55----------
it's not that normal yeah it's kind of


---------58:58----------
weird right like what what you started


---------59:00----------
to believe was normal that sort of


---------59:01----------
wasn't normal


---------59:02----------
it's also a kid as a kid it just is like


---------59:04----------
that I do it's it's almost it's almost


---------59:08----------
like you're like earlier when you said


---------59:09----------
like oh yeah it's not like anything


---------59:11----------
traumatic happened but we're sort of


---------59:12----------
describing is like sort of traumatic but


---------59:15----------
it was so normal that you sort of don't


---------59:16----------
even see it that way yeah but like


---------59:19----------
although we when I think about traumas


---------59:22----------
and I hear what's two people have to go


---------59:24----------
through I see myself as you know


---------59:27----------
privileged like some people got really


---------59:29----------
sexually abused physically abused and


---------59:32----------
really like you know like emotionally


---------59:36----------
abused that makes sense right like


---------59:38----------
you're kind of saying that other people


---------59:39----------
in the world and I'm sort of seeing you


---------59:42----------
know pardon me because this is just kind


---------59:43----------
of how my mind works but something of a


---------59:45----------
theme like it's almost like when you


---------59:47----------
grew up


---------59:49----------
you know that things were sort of it


---------59:51----------
almost sounds like a little bit unfair


---------59:52----------
in terms of of you know your dad sort of


---------59:56----------
never picked on you because you were a


---------59:58----------
good kid and and that maybe he was doing


---------59:59----------
other things like not he wasn't like


---------60:01----------
sexually abusive or anything like that


---------60:03----------
and you've said very clear I'm not


---------60:04----------
trying to paint your dad out to be a bad


---------60:05----------
guy because you've you know stated very


---------60:07----------
clearly that uh you know on average he


---------60:10----------
was better than most and you're grateful


---------60:11----------
for what he provided I'm not disputing


---------60:13----------
that or trying to trap you or anything


---------60:14----------
at the same time you know I I do think


---------60:16----------
it's kind of interesting because I'm


---------60:18----------
just trying to put myself and I'm gonna


---------60:19----------
talk about me or I'm gonna use an


---------60:22----------
analogy or use an abstract version I'm


---------60:24----------
trying to kind of put myself in the


---------60:26----------
shoes of you know someone who grows up


---------60:30----------
in a household where their dad is


---------60:32----------
demeaning and verbally abusive and how


---------60:36----------
it would be strange for someone to kind


---------60:37----------
of grow up in that sort of household if


---------60:39----------
they're never the target and oddly


---------60:41----------
enough I could sort of see how that


---------60:43----------
could lead to this kind of fundamental


---------60:45----------
realization especially if that kid was


---------60:47----------
super analytical that the world is


---------60:49----------
fundamentally at like an unfair place


---------60:51----------
and even though I have it better than


---------60:53----------
other people it's really unfortunate


---------60:55----------
that other people have it worse and that


---------60:57----------
I wish things weren't like that and I


---------60:59----------
think that things should be more equal


---------61:03----------
well yeah basically what you're trying


---------61:05----------
to get that is where does my motivation


---------61:07----------
come from from doing good in the world


---------61:10----------
yeah I mean I'm saying that that the


---------61:12----------
circumstance you're you're offering I


---------61:16----------
would seems to fit with the motivation


---------61:20----------
that you have but I wouldn't say that


---------61:21----------
such a fundamental motivation comes from


---------61:24----------
such a simplistic place yes indeed like


---------61:27----------
that's exactly what I wanted to answer


---------61:29----------
like yeah the the biggest source of the


---------61:32----------
biggest source of of doing what I'm


---------61:35----------
doing is just the hard reality like and


---------61:41----------
the different experience of going


---------61:43----------
through it I have not even done that I


---------61:45----------
mean III didn't get out I didn't grow up


---------61:48----------
in a war zone


---------61:50----------
I never starved and and I've never liked


---------61:53----------
what I also this is actually something


---------61:55----------
that's gonna sound a bit weird but it's


---------61:56----------
it's a thought experiment I've done so


---------61:58----------
much when I was younger


---------62:00----------
and it's gonna sound a bit weird but


---------62:02----------
it's it's gonna give you a better better


---------62:04----------
ID that's why I'm bringing bringing it


---------62:06----------
up like for me the time and the place


---------62:08----------
you were born is all just random like I


---------62:11----------
could have born in during World War two


---------62:13----------
I could have been born I could have been


---------62:15----------
born a Jew and I could have been you


---------62:17----------
know brought to the you know to the


---------62:19----------
concentration camps and if that would


---------62:22----------
have happened and that did happen to


---------62:23----------
many people and if it would have


---------62:25----------
happened to me and I would see my entire


---------62:26----------
family you know basically getting killed


---------62:29----------
and and me then being forced to do you


---------62:32----------
know hard labor with a gun pointed at my


---------62:35----------
head if I'm capable in that scenario


---------62:38----------
right to do more good in the world then


---------62:41----------
if I am doing right now then in a sense


---------62:45----------
I'd be a better person in that situation


---------62:47----------
and I cannot accept that I cannot accept


---------62:49----------
that that fact and that's a big reason


---------62:51----------
why my bar is quite you know when I said


---------62:55----------
earlier in my bar is hard my bar is


---------62:56----------
quite high because I know if I was in


---------62:59----------
that reality that's what I would be


---------63:01----------
doing I mean like I would literally be


---------63:02----------
working 16 hours a day as a slave while


---------63:07----------
I lost my family and not even being able


---------63:08----------
to properly you know like give say


---------63:11----------
goodbye or anything which is much more


---------63:13----------
cruel and if I could change at that


---------63:15----------
moment if I if I would given be given


---------63:17----------
the choice to live my life like I'm


---------63:19----------
living now rather than that life I would


---------63:21----------
do it in a heartbeat and I want to be


---------63:24----------
able to do better than that version and


---------63:25----------
as crazy as it sounds because I give


---------63:27----------
this example a lot on the stream it is a


---------63:30----------
fact like if I was born in and not even


---------63:32----------
that if tomorrow there is you know


---------63:34----------
whatever there's some it sounds to me


---------63:37----------
like you're just sort of like really


---------63:41----------
it's such such a strange thing that


---------63:42----------
you're kind of saying because what I'm


---------63:43----------
picking up from you I I wouldn't be


---------63:46----------
surprised if you don't sort of get that


---------63:48----------
you're not trying to convey this but


---------63:50----------
it's sort of weird I mean you're talking


---------63:51----------
about almost like that what you're doing


---------63:55----------
in this world is insignificant and that


---------63:57----------
you could be doing so much more know


---------63:59----------
what I'm doing right now is is very


---------64:01----------
significant because I'm putting the


---------64:05----------
effort to do so okay like what I've what


---------64:07----------
I've achieved so far is really a lot


---------64:11----------
like to give you a few examples just to


---------64:14----------
give you an idea I raised more than 25


---------64:16----------
million for children in need making me


---------64:18----------
one of the biggest philanthropists on


---------64:20----------
the Internet in a very effective manner


---------64:22----------
effective programs that I've even


---------64:24----------
visited I visited ebola-hit country to


---------64:27----------
raise awareness and I've also started


---------64:29----------
the place and that's why they call me a


---------64:31----------
cult where people can apply and work


---------64:33----------
together that have the same mindset of


---------64:35----------
wanting to help the world and you know


---------64:37----------
basically find like-minded people to do


---------64:40----------
good in the world and and I'm going to


---------64:43----------
try to even do more like trying to


---------64:45----------
implement universal basic income in in


---------64:47----------
very poor places and stuff I'm very


---------64:50----------
proactive and I also do real talk every


---------64:53----------
day where I talk about you know people


---------64:56----------
reflecting on these things and such and


---------64:57----------
that's why also some people said to talk


---------64:59----------
to you because you do similar things so


---------65:02----------
I I don't put myself down or anything I


---------65:05----------
always try to do better though so it's


---------65:07----------
not like I'm just you know also trying


---------65:09----------
to brag or anything for me I just I just


---------65:12----------
try to do what is best at any given


---------65:13----------
moment and yeah so I think you know it's


---------65:16----------
kind of interesting because I like you


---------65:17----------
have this very interesting


---------65:18----------
conversational sort of pattern and I'm


---------65:20----------
not quite sure what to make of it where


---------65:23----------
you'll say or do something and then you


---------65:25----------
kind of deny it immediately afterward


---------65:27----------
and like what like so for example like


---------65:30----------
yeah you just talked about all of your


---------65:34----------
accomplishments and then like


---------65:35----------
immediately afterward like is the first


---------65:36----------
time you said I don't brag like earlier


---------65:39----------
when you were talking about your


---------65:40----------
upbringing you were like there was


---------65:41----------
nothing traumatic but my dad was kind of


---------65:43----------
yelling and stuff like that you just


---------65:44----------
have this interesting and sometimes when


---------65:46----------
I like repeat back to you what you say


---------65:48----------
it seems like there's a disc


---------65:52----------
between the way I'm perceiving your


---------65:54----------
words and what your intention is which


---------65:58----------
sort of makes sense because it you know


---------65:59----------
it seems like you're very careful about


---------66:01----------
being understood properly the reason why


---------66:05----------
I'm making this clarification because


---------66:07----------
I've been streaming for a very long time


---------66:10----------
and whenever I bring up the amount of


---------66:12----------
money I raise people immediately go into


---------66:14----------
chat charity shield charity shield he's


---------66:16----------
bragging he's bragging so I want to make


---------66:18----------
sure that I'm just trying to state the


---------66:19----------
facts but yet maybe if if I wasn't


---------66:22----------
having a conversation just with you I


---------66:24----------
would not even mention this it's because


---------66:27----------
I'm aware that that more people watch


---------66:28----------
and this is really like the charity


---------66:30----------
stuff at the moment I talk about charity


---------66:32----------
stuff everybody goes like oh hey there


---------66:34----------
he goes again because they think that I


---------66:36----------
use the good work that I did as


---------66:39----------
justification to be aesthetically feel


---------66:40----------
when they say that


---------66:43----------
you


---------66:46----------
honestly


---------66:47----------
now like


---------66:53----------
I don't feel anything because I've


---------66:55----------
already processed it in the past it was


---------66:57----------
it was I had a hard time understanding


---------67:00----------
why but I've come to acceptance I've


---------67:03----------
done I've come to understand why it


---------67:05----------
happens is because it is because people


---------67:08----------
project very easily themselves and just


---------67:10----------
see me as something that I'm not


---------67:12----------
they think I'm a cult leader they think


---------67:14----------
I'm a brain washer they think I'm


---------67:16----------
scamming even though all these things


---------67:18----------
are not real they're not true they


---------67:20----------
believe that because they feel like it


---------67:23----------
and that's it like it doesn't matter


---------67:24----------
what is true or not


---------67:25----------
when they feel like it it must be true


---------67:27----------
and and for me as someone that is much


---------67:29----------
more analytical it's very hard to relate


---------67:31----------
to it because if the truth tells me


---------67:34----------
differently it's really very hard for me


---------67:36----------
to to deny it but I've come to realize


---------67:39----------
also it you know the entire post truth


---------67:42----------
world we live in and such that is


---------67:43----------
becoming more and more strengthened with


---------67:46----------
social media and the echo chambers


---------67:47----------
created and stuff where people get you


---------67:49----------
know their life strengthened that is


---------67:51----------
just you know a normal day for them and


---------67:53----------
and that's the thing like I've come to


---------67:55----------
accept that because in the past my


---------67:57----------
frustration came from a lack of


---------67:58----------
understanding I was like why I'm doing


---------68:01----------
all this good then I made videos even


---------68:02----------
with you know like we'd save the


---------68:03----------
children cuz I raised a lot for save


---------68:05----------
children


---------68:05----------
I showed video I showed proof people


---------68:07----------
kept saying I'm scammers even big


---------68:09----------
streamer saying I was a scammer I think


---------68:10----------
I'm concerned that you have a you have a


---------68:13----------
very subtle but powerful ego can I share


---------68:16----------
some thoughts with you sure sure so like


---------68:20----------
let's just take this example ok so you


---------68:22----------
were kind of saying that you know you


---------68:25----------
you were you were you used to be like


---------68:27----------
sort of not really happy or struggling


---------68:31----------
to understand because you still don't


---------68:32----------
really talk about emotions at all you


---------68:35----------
were saying that you didn't understand


---------68:36----------
why these people thought this way about


---------68:39----------
you but that essentially that they're


---------68:40----------
projecting and even though they're


---------68:43----------
incorrect they just believe this and so


---------68:47----------
like you know that that it's just like a


---------68:50----------
misunderstanding on your part what I


---------68:52----------
think the really dangerous thing there


---------68:54----------
is is like you know how do you know that


---------68:57----------
you are not the one that doesn't


---------69:00----------
understand because you're kind of saying


---------69:02----------
like oh I'm objectively right and


---------69:04----------
everyone else is projecting whereas how


---------69:06----------
do you know


---------69:06----------
you're not the one who's projecting and


---------69:08----------
they're not the ones who are objectively


---------69:09----------
right because like for example if I if I


---------69:12----------
if I walked out it like that I


---------69:15----------
understand that but like with this


---------69:17----------
specific example it's very hard to do


---------69:19----------
that because I'm talking about the fact


---------69:21----------
I mean it's like if I say the money goes


---------69:23----------
all to charity and it actually goes all


---------69:25----------
to charity there is no misunderstanding


---------69:28----------
on my part because I know all the money


---------69:30----------
goes to charity I mean there's evidence


---------69:32----------
everything it's very transparent as well


---------69:33----------
so if people then come to me and call me


---------69:36----------
a scammer then I know it's a


---------69:38----------
misunderstanding on their part it's not


---------69:39----------
sure what about being a cult leader say


---------69:42----------
well what about being a cult leader well


---------69:49----------
I'm open I'm open to - I'm open to the


---------69:56----------
idea that I might be I don't think it is


---------70:00----------
based on the evidence that I see the


---------70:03----------
properties of a cult leader I don't


---------70:05----------
think I am but there is a chance that I


---------70:08----------
am and that I'm just bullshitting myself


---------70:10----------
and that's that's the that's you know


---------70:13----------
that's where I find it as a strength


---------70:15----------
where I I always assume that what I


---------70:19----------
believe might be wrong I don't think I'm


---------70:21----------
a cult leader based on the data points I


---------70:23----------
have but there is a chance that I have a


---------70:25----------
cult leader and I'm just not aware of it


---------70:27----------
but so far no but nobody has shown I


---------70:30----------
mean I'm happy to hear you sort of say


---------70:32----------
that I'm not saying that you are you


---------70:33----------
aren't but I think this is this kind of


---------70:35----------
like for you to kind of admit that maybe


---------70:37----------
you are bullshitting this entire thing


---------70:39----------
maybe you are a cult leader that that


---------70:42----------
maybe you're wrong I think is like a


---------70:44----------
very important perspective to take right


---------70:47----------
an idea that I can I share with you what


---------70:50----------
I think sort of is is what I'm seeing


---------70:53----------
this is just what one man's opinion okay


---------70:56----------
so I'm not claiming this is genius I'm


---------70:57----------
not it's reality I'm just gonna share


---------71:00----------
with you what I see I think that your


---------71:01----------
mission is very very real so I think


---------71:04----------
your your devotion to the cause is very


---------71:06----------
very real I think that you really do


---------71:09----------
long to make the world a better place


---------71:10----------
and there are just a lot of like bizarre


---------71:13----------
things that I think the way that you


---------71:16----------
relate to your emotions the way that you


---------71:18----------
conceptualize yourself you


---------71:20----------
kind of like view your beliefs as truth


---------71:23----------
like and I recognize that when I say


---------71:26----------
that statement to you you're going to


---------71:28----------
respond by saying oh no all people are


---------71:30----------
equal in my truth is no greater than


---------71:32----------
other people's truth like I get that you


---------71:33----------
say that but if you actually listen to


---------71:35----------
the way that you talk for example when I


---------71:37----------
point out this issue of like a lot of


---------71:41----------
people say that you're a cult leader you


---------71:42----------
kind of default to them being the ones


---------71:45----------
that are projecting and you're the one


---------71:47----------
who's factually correct and I think part


---------71:50----------
of the reason that maybe this goes on is


---------71:51----------
because I do think that you're not you


---------71:54----------
have it sounds like you've become


---------71:56----------
accustomed to maybe numbing out emotions


---------72:00----------
I'm not really sure about this this is


---------72:01----------
like where I will be the first to admit


---------72:02----------
that I don't really know but generally


---------72:05----------
speaking if you look at data a lot of


---------72:08----------
times when people grow up in households


---------72:10----------
where there is some form of abuse even


---------72:12----------
if they're not members victims of the


---------72:15----------
verbal demeaning or whatever that they


---------72:18----------
can develop like an interesting


---------72:19----------
relationship with their emotions so


---------72:21----------
their emotions sort of affect them less


---------72:22----------
they learn to suppress things and you


---------72:24----------
sort of described a scenario that kind


---------72:26----------
of fits with that right like you if it


---------72:27----------
became normal to you there's sort of


---------72:29----------
like toxicity there's like objective


---------72:31----------
toxicity in your household and you've


---------72:34----------
become normalized to it it's become kind


---------72:36----------
of like normal to you and anytime we


---------72:39----------
sort of talk about things you sort of


---------72:40----------
say you experience emotions but at the


---------72:43----------
same time like when I ask you about them


---------72:45----------
your mind sort of goes to this and this


---------72:47----------
is another pattern that I've observed in


---------72:49----------
some people unclear if it if it applies


---------72:51----------
to you but that generally the process of


---------72:54----------
abstraction and pulling yourself out of


---------72:57----------
the equation and being non personal with


---------73:00----------
the way that you view the world being


---------73:01----------
objective instead of subjective


---------73:03----------
separates you from some of those


---------73:05----------
subjective influences and in my


---------73:08----------
experience a lot of times when people


---------73:11----------
are not aware of their subjective


---------73:12----------
influences are the ones where they sort


---------73:15----------
of lead to a logical conclusion that


---------73:17----------
they think objectively is true even


---------73:19----------
though they're completely and but they


---------73:21----------
think it's logically true because


---------73:23----------
they're not aware of how their mind is


---------73:25----------
shaping their impressions I can I can


---------73:29----------
understand that you can make this kind


---------73:31----------
of you know


---------73:33----------
connections I do have to say though that


---------73:35----------
when it comes down to emotions and


---------73:38----------
emotional intelligence I would say that


---------73:41----------
I have that I tried even more in that


---------73:46----------
regards than when it's about cognitive


---------73:48----------
intelligence it is because I understand


---------73:50----------
my emotions so well and I've had an


---------73:53----------
always a very you know honest


---------73:55----------
conversation about how I feel towards


---------73:56----------
myself in trying to understand them that


---------73:58----------
I managed to get to a point where I am


---------74:01----------
now because if it was suppressing


---------74:03----------
suppressing mechanics that I would be


---------74:05----------
using in order to achieve what I have


---------74:07----------
achieved I would have already had a


---------74:09----------
nervous breakdown


---------74:10----------
I would I would like I wouldn't have


---------74:12----------
gotten where I am


---------74:13----------
I'm very stable and very fulfilled and


---------74:17----------
satisfied as a person and when certain


---------74:20----------
strong emotional events happens like for


---------74:22----------
example my father passing away like I


---------74:25----------
processed them and and and I and I cry


---------74:28----------
and I feel the emotions and I try to


---------74:31----------
understand and make sense of it and and


---------74:34----------
I and I go through the grieving process


---------74:35----------
just like anyone else but because I have


---------74:38----------
such an honest relationship with myself


---------74:40----------
it goes very fast like it goes much


---------74:43----------
faster than with my siblings for example


---------74:46----------
even though it's you know it's it's of


---------74:48----------
course unfortunate and what I'm just


---------74:50----------
trying to explain is like this sense of


---------74:52----------
separation that you're talking about


---------74:54----------
like that even it's a very big trait of


---------74:57----------
narcissism as well do you think your


---------75:00----------
narcissistic no I don't think so okay I


---------75:04----------
don't think so at all I wouldn't deem


---------75:08----------
everybody equally if I was arson I would


---------75:10----------
for myself being better than others I


---------75:12----------
wouldn't work so hard as well to help


---------75:15----------
other people if I would be narcissists


---------75:17----------
because why I'm better than them like


---------75:20----------
yes so that's kind of interesting


---------75:22----------
because I think this is once again like


---------75:25----------
something that I'm having trouble


---------75:26----------
understanding and I think I'm gonna have


---------75:28----------
to wrap up in a few minutes I'll give


---------75:29----------
you kind of I'm just kind of letting you


---------75:31----------
know but so I'll just give you an


---------75:33----------
example right so like you make these


---------75:34----------
these abstract philosophical statements


---------75:37----------
like I believe all people are equal but


---------75:39----------
if we actually pay attention to what you


---------75:41----------
say


---------75:42----------
you frequently compare yourself for


---------75:45----------
example you just talked about how you


---------75:46----------
process emotions more fully and more


---------75:49----------
rapidly than your siblings after your


---------75:50----------
dad passes away and that's a pattern


---------75:52----------
throughout this conversation you say all


---------75:54----------
people are equal but by the way in this


---------75:56----------
particular example I'm objectively


---------75:58----------
better at processing emotions than other


---------76:00----------
people like you use those kinds of


---------76:02----------
examples all the time that sort of say


---------76:04----------
oh others have an error in reality and I


---------76:07----------
have a planet-wide reality the thing is


---------76:10----------
though equality does not mean that you


---------76:15----------
can have certain traits that are you


---------76:17----------
know factually more nearer advanced and


---------76:21----------
others I mean like do you do you think


---------76:23----------
that personality is on a fundamental


---------76:25----------
level we are all equal as human beings


---------76:27----------
that equality automatically brings about


---------76:30----------
that certain people that can contribute


---------76:33----------
more than others for example that that


---------76:37----------
that aspect also has to be part of the


---------76:39----------
equation and that's the practical


---------76:42----------
reality of equality the practical


---------76:45----------
reality I have one last question sorry I


---------76:48----------
keep interrupting you I apologize I


---------76:49----------
really do you think that narcissists


---------76:52----------
believe that and I'm I don't I don't


---------76:57----------
know if you're narcissists or not so


---------76:58----------
this isn't some kind of veiled attack


---------76:59----------
I'm genuinely curious because I have a


---------77:02----------
follow-up question do you think that


---------77:04----------
narcissists believe that they are that


---------77:07----------
they have that they're objectively


---------77:09----------
better in some ways than other people I


---------77:12----------
think narcissus is glorified himself


---------77:18----------
yeah so I think you have a very


---------77:21----------
interesting kind of ego so I think you


---------77:23----------
have the ego of having no ego so when I


---------77:26----------
was studying in India one of my teachers


---------77:31----------
once told me that there are two kinds of


---------77:33----------
ego and one is very subtle and it's


---------77:35----------
something that you see in people who are


---------77:36----------
highly spiritual one is the standard ego


---------77:38----------
which is kind of like narcissism and one


---------77:40----------
is the ego of having no ego it's saying


---------77:43----------
oh look at how everyone else glorifies


---------77:45----------
themselves but look at how I don't


---------77:47----------
glorify myself at all


---------77:48----------
like other people glorify themselves but


---------77:51----------
I don't


---------77:52----------
so there's sort of like a subtle ego of


---------77:55----------
look at how egotistical everyone else is


---------77:57----------
look at how everyone else projects but I


---------78:00----------
don't I don't project


---------78:02----------
I'm not egotistical I'm objective I'm


---------78:05----------
humble I'm devoted to the cause I'm pure


---------78:08----------
I can't I know that you're almost have


---------78:10----------
to go and that's why I want to respond


---------78:12----------
to this release in a very I do think


---------78:16----------
that a lot of the conversation that


---------78:20----------
we've had like comes from you trying to


---------78:26----------
see yourself in me and a lot of it is


---------78:30----------
projection where you go through life in


---------78:33----------
a more self-centered manner and you try


---------78:36----------
to find that framework in me while so


---------78:41----------
for example for the ego and these things


---------78:43----------
where parts in your life where you


---------78:45----------
struggled with it a lot while for me all


---------78:46----------
these things are very irrelevant like I


---------78:48----------
just go through life I wake up I do what


---------78:51----------
I gotta do when I go to bed it's very


---------78:53----------
simple yeah and all these concepts and


---------78:55----------
and this you know this like all my


---------78:57----------
experience or my pastor stuff is


---------79:00----------
irrelevant to me it's like and it truly


---------79:02----------
is like if you get to know me or you see


---------79:04----------
me you would really be be a little bit


---------79:07----------
confused like a why doesn't he care


---------79:09----------
about these things and because I was


---------79:11----------
confused up until this moment but yeah


---------79:13----------
go ahead a lot of a lot of what a lot of


---------79:19----------
your analyzes is filling the gaps with


---------79:23----------
your own experience which then


---------79:25----------
automatically portrayed something where


---------79:28----------
you try to see you know you try to


---------79:31----------
conceptualize and and and see me as a


---------79:34----------
you know from yeah from that angle while


---------79:37----------
I just live my life and accept things


---------79:39----------
for what they are and and and when I


---------79:41----------
experience discomfort I just take it and


---------79:44----------
I just you know go about my day and


---------79:46----------
that's it like there is no there is no


---------79:49----------
focus on the self development or any of


---------79:52----------
that because at the end of the day we


---------79:54----------
are what we are and all these things are


---------79:57----------
not that you know are not that relevant


---------79:59----------
when you when you want to eat you gotta


---------80:01----------
eat and when you you know when you gotta


---------80:03----------
get water you get water things are


---------80:05----------
actually very same


---------80:06----------
when you strip away all the all this all


---------80:09----------
this noise and that's the way I live my


---------80:12----------
life and and and and there is very


---------80:16----------
little to it like it's it's it's


---------80:18----------
actually quite simple I'm just saying


---------80:20----------
like I think a lot of the analyzing that


---------80:23----------
you're doing is coming from your


---------80:27----------
perspective and trying to understand me


---------80:29----------
through your world which is yeah which


---------80:33----------
is which is which is not which is not as


---------80:37----------
easy when when when when I go about life


---------80:41----------
in a way where a lot of this identity


---------80:43----------
structure and construct just doesn't


---------80:45----------
really exist because I know it's not


---------80:48----------
real sure so I thank you for explaining


---------80:51----------
that positive way and this is not a


---------80:53----------
criticism I I didn't think it was a


---------80:55----------
criticism at all are you getting the


---------80:58----------
sense that I'm Crick I'm very glad so I


---------81:00----------
I've been very transparent with you


---------81:02----------
about what I think could be going on so


---------81:04----------
for example I said like I think you have


---------81:06----------
this other kind of ego called the ego of


---------81:08----------
having no eager I think that could be


---------81:09----------
going on because I can't really know you


---------81:11----------
after talking about an hour and a half


---------81:12----------
right so I I think I think the way I'm


---------81:15----------
approaching this conversation is by


---------81:16----------
trying transparently sharing my


---------81:19----------
impressions so that you can explain to


---------81:21----------
me your perspective on it yes right and


---------81:26----------
so you've just explained to me that you


---------81:28----------
think that when I toss something like


---------81:30----------
that out at you that it is a projection


---------81:32----------
from my end and in my experience yes


---------81:36----------
many parts in the conversation but yes


---------81:38----------
yeah yeah yeah I I agree I'm simplifying


---------81:40----------
things I'm losing some nuance so just


---------81:42----------
one last thing that I would kind of


---------81:43----------
leave with you is that often times and


---------81:46----------
you're when you're kind of talking about


---------81:47----------
me coming from my experience I


---------81:49----------
completely agree I'm absolutely coming


---------81:51----------
from my experience now I don't know when


---------81:53----------
you say my experience do you mean my


---------81:55----------
personal psyche or my do you mean my


---------81:57----------
experience in life


---------81:59----------
your your experience in life okay so


---------82:03----------
I'll show you with you just one last


---------82:04----------
thing so generally speaking when I I'm a


---------82:06----------
psychiatrist and when I deal with people


---------82:08----------
who have narcissism when their


---------82:10----------
narcissism is challenged they will


---------82:12----------
frequently go to things like projection


---------82:15----------
of the person who is challenging their


---------82:18----------
narcissism right so like if I tell you


---------82:22----------
hey I think maybe you have this kind of


---------82:24----------
ego the simplest way for your that kind


---------82:28----------
of ego to hide is to debunk or deep


---------82:32----------
diffuse or challenge or pull the legs


---------82:35----------
out of what I'm trying to say so you say


---------82:38----------
like oh like it's not really a problem


---------82:40----------
on my end you're just projecting which I


---------82:42----------
could be projecting I'm just sharing


---------82:44----------
with you I'm not saying your


---------82:45----------
narcissistic or that you aren't I'm just


---------82:47----------
a question yeah so let's say I would


---------82:51----------
tell you you're a narcissist right yeah


---------82:53----------
and you would start giving arguments


---------82:55----------
while you're not right no ah no no I


---------83:01----------
would ask you why do you think I'm a


---------83:03----------
narcissist I wouldn't start arguing with


---------83:05----------
you immediately I would ask you where


---------83:08----------
your perspective comes from and help me


---------83:10----------
understand why you think I'm a


---------83:11----------
narcissist but that so let's say that's


---------83:14----------
I not what you do right you start


---------83:16----------
arguing immediately and explaining to me


---------83:18----------
why I'm wrong and how I'm all go a step


---------83:21----------
further because like sure I'm not just


---------83:23----------
asking you whether you're a narcissist I


---------83:25----------
say you are a narcissist because of this


---------83:28----------
and this and that


---------83:29----------
right and you respond to this and this


---------83:31----------
and that and you say like yet this does


---------83:34----------
not apply to me and then I tell you


---------83:35----------
that's what every narcissist would say


---------83:41----------
yes what's your question say what you


---------83:44----------
said let me ask you a question but I


---------83:46----------
haven't heard a question well that's the


---------83:48----------
question if but that's it's not a


---------83:50----------
question well like what what what is


---------83:54----------
your what is your response to to to this


---------83:56----------
because it's like a basically a catch-22


---------83:59----------
at that point it's like no it's not


---------84:00----------
because because there's a problem with


---------84:02----------
the assumption right so you said if I if


---------84:04----------
I call you a narcissist and then you


---------84:06----------
said and then I say I give you evidence


---------84:08----------
and then you respond to that evidence if


---------84:11----------
you counter that evidence and then I say


---------84:13----------
but you're projecting I wouldn't do that


---------84:15----------
I wouldn't I wouldn't do that middle


---------84:17----------
step between me and you is different so


---------84:18----------
when you say if you call me narcissus


---------84:20----------
I'm not going to respond to your


---------84:22----------
evidence with evidence of my own I'm


---------84:24----------
gonna stop and ask you why you believe


---------84:27----------
that and help me and I'm going to


---------84:30----------
understand where you're coming from and


---------84:31----------
why you believe that about me so that's


---------84:33----------
the difference so if you if you if you


---------84:38----------
don't let me I would if I would present


---------84:41----------
you with three cases you either have you


---------84:44----------
know the ego of not having an ego or you


---------84:48----------
have you know a strong ego or you have a


---------84:51----------
weak ego right if that is the three


---------84:54----------
points that I you know that I present


---------84:56----------
and I say this is this is in this


---------84:59----------
framework you're either one of the three


---------85:00----------
right and I'm saying like oh no that is


---------85:03----------
that is that is based on your experience


---------85:06----------
that you have these three you know these


---------85:07----------
three properties and you don't see it


---------85:09----------
wider then I am the one giving a organ


---------85:14----------
because it's very directly connected to


---------85:16----------
the reason why you said I wasn't


---------85:19----------
potentially a narcissist or or have ego


---------85:22----------
like and I'm telling you the reason why


---------85:25----------
you only have these three options in


---------85:27----------
your explanation is because you're


---------85:29----------
projecting your experience because if


---------85:30----------
you would have a wider experience you


---------85:33----------
would have more versions than just these


---------85:35----------
you're making you're making a couple of


---------85:38----------
big assumptions so I do have other


---------85:40----------
options in my tool belt I just simply


---------85:42----------
don't think that they apply to you right


---------85:46----------
so I'm not talking to you about things


---------85:49----------
that I don't think apply to you then I


---------85:51----------
misunderstood that I thought yeah


---------85:53----------
you you would I'm glad these these I'm


---------85:56----------
sure I'm sharing when I say here's what


---------85:59----------
I think could apply to you Athene I'm


---------86:01----------
talking about the things that apply to


---------86:03----------
you not all of the possibilities you


---------86:06----------
were talking about your experience in


---------86:08----------
India where you were talking to your


---------86:10----------
teacher and he was mentioning these


---------86:12----------
three yeah so it was not in direct


---------86:14----------
correlation with me it was based on your


---------86:16----------
own experience that's why I brought it


---------86:18----------
up yeah so like I would assume if you


---------86:22----------
would tell me about your experience


---------86:24----------
which is not directly connected to me


---------86:26----------
that it would have all options and if it


---------86:30----------
would just be in in in context to


---------86:33----------
talking to me you wouldn't even have to


---------86:35----------
mention all three you would just mention


---------86:37----------
one so then it's not so far-fetched for


---------86:40----------
me to assume that you were giving a full


---------86:42----------
scope of what you are trying to explain


---------86:45----------
based on your experience which then made


---------86:47----------
me mention hey this is based on your


---------86:50----------
experience that's what you call


---------86:52----------
projection basically I'm just saying


---------86:54----------
like it's not like I'm trying to be you


---------86:57----------
know deflective on what you say I'm GRU


---------86:59----------
was just trying to pinpoint to the


---------87:01----------
argument you were giving me why you know


---------87:04----------
what why these things could be the case


---------87:07----------
that's all like yeah I'm not yeah that


---------87:11----------
makes sense


---------87:11----------
do you have I offended you in some way


---------87:14----------
no not at all


---------87:16----------
okay like honestly they're like I I know


---------87:23----------
you're just trying to do what is best


---------87:26----------
based on your own you know you're your


---------87:29----------
own reference frame and I try to have


---------87:32----------
the best as well so to me I'm not


---------87:35----------
judging or blaming or whatever I just


---------87:37----------
you know I just thought it was


---------87:38----------
interesting to have a chat with you and


---------87:40----------
a call and because people in my in my


---------87:45----------
view were basically in your view base


---------87:47----------
were really you know very very


---------87:52----------
interested in listening to conversations


---------87:54----------
so I thought it would be interesting and


---------87:56----------
I completely agree man so can I offer


---------87:58----------
just a couple of other thoughts and then


---------88:01----------
ask maybe one or two last questions so


---------88:03----------
first of all I think I I you know just


---------88:06----------
for the sake of


---------88:07----------
I want to just repeat what I said


---------88:09----------
earlier I do think that your cause is


---------88:11----------
Venu very genuine and that your approach


---------88:14----------
is just and that you really believe in


---------88:16----------
what you're doing


---------88:17----------
in my experience so once again talking


---------88:19----------
about my reference frame which is really


---------88:20----------
the only reference frame I can come from


---------88:22----------
that can coexist with the ego of having


---------88:27----------
no ego and in fact the people who are


---------88:29----------
the people who develop an ego of having


---------88:32----------
no ego are the ones who are actually


---------88:34----------
doing the kind of work that you do so


---------88:35----------
it's very common amongst people like


---------88:37----------
monks and it's a very very subtle ego


---------88:39----------
that's very difficult to detect so


---------88:42----------
whether that's going on with you or not


---------88:43----------
I at the end of the day can't really say


---------88:45----------
but I'm noticing some signs that could


---------88:49----------
point to that now whether that's the


---------88:51----------
case or not I'm not sure and I've sort


---------88:53----------
of laid those out before and you can


---------88:55----------
kind of watch when I sort of talk about


---------88:56----------
how you end up making comparisons but


---------88:58----------
you make overarching statements about


---------89:01----------
truth of equality but when you actually


---------89:02----------
listen to what you say you make lots of


---------89:05----------
comparisons with other people and that


---------89:07----------
when you make those comparisons you sort


---------89:08----------
of treat them as a reality is a is


---------89:11----------
opposed to an opinion whether it's real


---------89:14----------
or not like I don't know some of that


---------89:15----------
stuff actually sure like you can sort of


---------89:17----------
factually say that you know stuff went


---------89:20----------
to charity or didn't go to charity but


---------89:22----------
when it comes to like who emotionally


---------89:24----------
processes your dad's death the fastest I


---------89:26----------
don't know how you would know that


---------89:28----------
because I don't think there are any


---------89:29----------
external signs that sort of course if


---------89:32----------
practically if I'm talking to my


---------89:34----------
siblings like regularly I can see them


---------89:37----------
carrying it a much more heavily than I


---------89:40----------
do for sure like some of my siblings in


---------89:43----------
more than a year later are still


---------89:45----------
struggling with it like yeah so for me


---------89:47----------
so yeah I mean that is that it's not in


---------89:49----------
my I mean it's just not in my head it's


---------89:51----------
unless I can reason I can I'm


---------89:54----------
suppressing it there you go there you go


---------89:59----------
I don't think so but it is possible but


---------90:00----------
I I completely I completely agree that


---------90:02----------
you could be suppressing it


---------90:04----------
you may not be suppressing it and that


---------90:06----------
it would be very hard for you to know


---------90:08----------
because that's the nature of suppression


---------90:09----------
right suppression is when our mind


---------90:11----------
buries something so that we're not aware


---------90:13----------
of it that's the very definition of it


---------90:14----------
so I'm really using so many emotions


---------90:17----------
when you passed away hi


---------90:20----------
these are even have experienced the


---------90:22----------
emotions the emotional process because


---------90:25----------
like initially initially when it


---------90:30----------
happened I was the person to accept it


---------90:32----------
the quickest like some people didn't


---------90:35----------
like some of my siblings didn't even


---------90:37----------
accept that he passed away like it took


---------90:40----------
in them days before they even realized


---------90:42----------
that I think I really do not know enough


---------90:45----------
about that situation so you know you


---------90:48----------
were there you know what you experienced


---------90:51----------
you know what you saw you're gonna be


---------90:52----------
the one who's who's best able to judge


---------90:54----------
what actually happened there's no way I


---------90:55----------
can say all I'm saying is that I think


---------90:58----------
exactly what you said which is that


---------91:00----------
there's a possibility possible yes that


---------91:03----------
you suppress some kind of emotion


---------91:05----------
because I think the evidence suggests


---------91:07----------
that you grew up in a household where a


---------91:09----------
lot of children learn to suppress


---------91:10----------
emotions ie playing with LEGOs while


---------91:12----------
your brother is getting yelled at and


---------91:14----------
sometimes that leads to emotional


---------91:16----------
suppression I'm not saying it it did in


---------91:18----------
your case or that it happens now I just


---------91:20----------
I don't know do you feel it I actually


---------91:24----------
do not know I I don't know when it comes


---------91:27----------
to you I really don't know I'm just


---------91:28----------
sharing with a bit I'm just in general


---------91:30----------
when you suppress emotions do you feel


---------91:33----------
it in any shape or form yeah almost you


---------91:36----------
do feel it yeah because I don't feel it


---------91:39----------
I'm just saying like what does I mean


---------91:41----------
you can feel it feel it like emotionally


---------91:43----------
or physically or what in any shape or


---------91:46----------
form is that anything yeah so good


---------91:49----------
absolutely so I think the biggest sign


---------91:51----------
that you have suppressed or inactive


---------91:53----------
emotions is actually your ego so in my


---------91:58----------
experience the ego arises is a


---------92:00----------
protective mechanism for emotions and


---------92:02----------
allows us to not feel the emotions so


---------92:06----------
I'll just give you an example like if


---------92:08----------
I'm attracted to a woman and I asked her


---------92:10----------
out and she says no then my ego becomes


---------92:14----------
active and I start coming up with all


---------92:16----------
kinds of justifications for why I asked


---------92:18----------
her out and why she said no instead of


---------92:21----------
just feeling the rejection so I'll start


---------92:23----------
to tell myself oh like objectively she's


---------92:25----------
not that attractive logically I just


---------92:28----------
asked her out for these reasons and then


---------92:30----------
what the ego does is it goes to your


---------92:31----------
intellect and hijacks the Intel


---------92:34----------
because I'm sure you've observed that


---------92:36----------
when people become narcissistic you


---------92:37----------
can't logically convince them of


---------92:39----------
everything because they are logically


---------92:41----------
convinced that they are absolutely


---------92:42----------
correct that their intellect is not


---------92:45----------
functioning properly and is sort of like


---------92:47----------
functioning due to these things like


---------92:48----------
projection and narcissism can they see


---------92:51----------
themselves change I don't know it's an


---------92:55----------
abstract question I'm not sure I'm just


---------92:56----------
sort of well because you were talking


---------93:01----------
about nice it depends on the person so


---------93:03----------
generally speaking when I point this out


---------93:05----------
to them I think a lot of value comes


---------93:07----------
from it right so well this is this is


---------93:09----------
what I see that makes me think that you


---------93:11----------
could have ego one is that you know it


---------93:13----------
sounds like you live a life where


---------93:16----------
there's where people attack you in some


---------93:20----------
ways and generally speaking when I think


---------93:23----------
about that I imagine that at times in


---------93:25----------
the past that sounds like that hurt


---------93:26----------
you're kind of okay with it now or that


---------93:28----------
people say like slandering things about


---------93:29----------
you you tend to be hyper focused on


---------93:32----------
rationality logic and abstraction and


---------93:35----------
when we actually oh one second I'm sorry


---------93:56----------
that it takes so long sorry I gotta get


---------94:00----------
going yeah but that that I sort of see


---------94:04----------
you fitting this pattern whether it


---------94:05----------
applies to you or not I'm not sure but


---------94:07----------
that generally speaking a hyper


---------94:09----------
rationality with abstraction and a lot


---------94:13----------
of comparative statements without


---------94:14----------
believing you're making comparative


---------94:16----------
statements or that your comparisons are


---------94:17----------
objectively correct whereas other


---------94:20----------
people's opinions or just opinions or


---------94:22----------
projections speaks to me of the presence


---------94:25----------
of ego whether that's true or not I


---------94:28----------
don't know I mean I think the reason I'm


---------94:29----------
sharing this with you is because I


---------94:31----------
respect you and I think you should


---------94:32----------
reflect on it which is exactly what I


---------94:34----------
think you're doing in what you will do


---------94:36----------
and I think that's awesome that you're


---------94:38----------
doing that and I have one last question


---------94:41----------
for you so do you want to collaborate


---------94:44----------
that was the goal of this conversation


---------94:47----------
for you right so let me ask you well the


---------94:55----------
answer the answer to that question lies


---------94:57----------
in you and the answer is do you like how


---------95:01----------
far do you want to go to truly help


---------95:07----------
people basically like and and the


---------95:09----------
conversation has shown me that you want


---------95:11----------
to live a normal life and you want to


---------95:15----------
help people on the side and combine them


---------95:18----------
both and basically in a sense settle


---------95:21----------
with that and my question would be like


---------95:23----------
yeah do you want to settle with that or


---------95:25----------
do you want to take it further because


---------95:27----------
you can maybe help even more


---------95:31----------
because like for me that is that is the


---------95:34----------
extent to which we can collaborate


---------95:36----------
because of course we can collaborate in


---------95:37----------
less or bigger extent but like the


---------95:39----------
extent to which you want out of you know


---------95:41----------
your comfort zone and really do good in


---------95:45----------
the world for a big part defines how


---------95:50----------
strong we can work together because of


---------95:52----------
course we can have you know these talks


---------95:54----------
because people seem to really love it I


---------95:55----------
mean like look at the amount of people


---------95:57----------
that are watching it's crazy like they


---------95:59----------
like they like this conversation you


---------96:01----------
like to see you know stalking because


---------96:05----------
it's very interesting so in that regards


---------96:07----------
that on itself could be interesting


---------96:09----------
because I like to talk to you it's not


---------96:10----------
like talking with destiny where it's


---------96:12----------
really very very very sensational and


---------96:14----------
yelling and all that stuff this is much


---------96:17----------
more chill and people seem to like that


---------96:19----------
and and it's hard to even find an


---------96:22----------
interest for these type of conversations


---------96:24----------
so in that regards I think we can


---------96:26----------
definitely collaborate when it comes


---------96:28----------
down to practical action and do you know


---------96:30----------
like like charity work and stuff it's


---------96:33----------
something you know we we could we could


---------96:35----------
explore in the future so I would say I


---------96:38----------
wouldn't I wouldn't drop a no and and I


---------96:41----------
wouldn't throw up a yes I think we can


---------96:43----------
you know we can definitely have a


---------96:45----------
follow-up conversation if that's


---------96:46----------
something you feel like doing and I will


---------96:49----------
definitely reflect on things you said


---------96:50----------
and you can also do so if you think


---------96:52----------
there was anything worthwhile I think


---------96:54----------
there was a time that was worthwhile


---------96:56----------
yeah so yeah like and your viewers if


---------97:02----------
they find it worthwhile because I also


---------97:04----------
understand if you know it's not


---------97:05----------
something for them that I'm not going to


---------97:08----------
you know be this yeah this this guest


---------97:11----------
that they just go like okay again this


---------97:13----------
some of this and yeah maybe we can also


---------97:16----------
you know like in the future spice it up


---------97:19----------
because I've been very I have been very


---------97:23----------
yeah like like we've been very what do


---------97:25----------
you call it surface it was a very


---------97:28----------
surface conversation and I do think if


---------97:30----------
we go deeper things will become even


---------97:32----------
more interesting because it helps people


---------97:35----------
to understand intent and such and and


---------97:38----------
and help you thinking philosophically


---------97:40----------
Sagan you be deeper philosophically no I


---------97:44----------
mean deeper psychologically really to


---------97:46----------
the foundation of what drives us to do


---------97:48----------
what we do and why we do it and and and


---------97:52----------
analyzing it in a way that people can


---------97:54----------
very easily relate to because comfort


---------97:56----------
for example is a word everybody can


---------97:58----------
relate to it's very easy to wrap your


---------98:00----------
head around like oh yeah sure I'm trying


---------98:02----------
to you know settle and find comfort in


---------98:03----------
what I'm doing


---------98:04----------
it's easy to to get like people that


---------98:06----------
procrastinate people you know that don't


---------98:08----------
procrastinate it's very common ground


---------98:10----------
yeah and and and and basically being


---------98:14----------
able to simplify everything we talk


---------98:17----------
about that sometimes kins can look


---------98:19----------
complex on the surface like I mean this


---------98:22----------
conversation it sometimes was really all


---------98:24----------
like a little bit all over the place at


---------98:26----------
the time the theme dude I really gotta


---------98:29----------
go cuz I literally have a car that's


---------98:31----------
waiting outside with my kids it's been


---------98:35----------
here like if you're interested we can


---------98:37----------
definitely have another call and yeah


---------98:40----------
like for me it was interesting I like to


---------98:43----------
have this chat do you get want to


---------98:44----------
collaborate more in the future I have no


---------98:47----------
idea what that means because you speak


---------98:48----------
in such philosophical and broad terms


---------98:50----------
that I like it would be if it would be


---------98:53----------
having more of these kind of


---------98:55----------
conversations for example on the stream


---------98:58----------
yeah okay hold on one second I really


---------99:00----------
got to go um I'm gonna say the same


---------99:03----------
thing you said which is maybe not a yes


---------99:05----------
and not a no okay I just have


---------99:08----------
think about whether this is aligned with


---------99:10----------
the kind of work that I'm trying to do


---------99:11----------
like I think it's done


---------99:13----------
hey what's up yes I understand


---------99:16----------
understood okay okay I'm coming love you


---------99:24----------
