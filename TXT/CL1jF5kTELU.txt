---------00:00----------
and I had a lot of grief and stuff not


---------00:03----------
really so much for my loss of him but


---------00:05----------
the thing that I was the most upset


---------00:07----------
about is that he was I remember the day


---------00:10----------
that I got in medical school he just


---------00:11----------
started crying because I'd been


---------00:13----------
struggling to get into medical school


---------00:14----------
for a while and he was kind of worried


---------00:15----------
it's really cute like that and I hadn't


---------00:17----------
seen him cry like that I mean he just


---------00:19----------
like broke down and he said that you're


---------00:21----------
gonna be amazing


---------00:22----------
he's like nothing is gonna stop you now


---------00:24----------
you are amazing yeah you're really good


---------00:26----------
at what you do you helped me a lot


---------00:28----------
yeah I've talked to a lot of I've talked


---------00:30----------
to a lot of psychiatrists and so he saw


---------00:33----------
that right he saw that like you know


---------00:35----------
when I mean I had a 2.6 GPA and was


---------00:37----------
struggling to get into medical school I


---------00:39----------
never thought I'd be faculty in Harvard


---------00:40----------
Medical School and and he said like


---------00:43----------
nothing is gonna be able to stop you and


---------00:45----------
that you should do good and you should


---------00:47----------
help people that's really cute yeah and


---------00:52----------
so what what I was sad about is actually


---------00:54----------
that he didn't get to see that so eight


---------00:57----------
months after I got into medical school


---------00:58----------
he passed away and and so the the thing


---------01:02----------

---------02:08----------
Boober that's an important button there


---------02:11----------

---------02:11----------
by the way uh uh so I don't know if this


---------02:13----------
is still the case but one of my


---------02:14----------
developers uh-huh who watches your


---------02:16----------
stream ah he said he was looking at he


---------02:21----------
was watching you look at your own chat


---------02:22----------
and that he it looked like people were


---------02:26----------
just typing boomer and all caps to you


---------02:28----------
but they're doing an emoji but you don't


---------02:30----------
have the extension better twitch TV or


---------02:32----------
you didn't have it at the time to see


---------02:34----------
the emoji they're not actually typing


---------02:36----------
boomer to you in all caps oh I thought


---------02:39----------
they were typing boomer to me in all


---------02:40----------
caps is it that a pretty thing because I


---------02:44----------
see yes I see what's actually happening


---------02:46----------
is they're doing this a Moute you need


---------02:47----------
to get


---------02:48----------
oh it's frankerfacez EW I think maybe I


---------02:50----------
think somebody just enabled that because


---------02:53----------
I see lots of like faces man this is


---------02:56----------
like the black and white boomer yeah but


---------02:58----------
yeah now you see it okay good now you


---------03:01----------
want for me they used to type boomer to


---------03:03----------
you in all caps yeah yeah yeah I thought


---------03:04----------
that was just what they typed yeah that


---------03:09----------
would be really I think I mean it's this


---------03:11----------
lesser I mean I thought it was endearing


---------03:14----------
yes okay I I sort of feel like I'm I'm


---------03:18----------
twitches pet boomer yeah twitch loves


---------03:22----------
watching you try to use technology it's


---------03:25----------
very funny no it's I feel like a you


---------03:28----------
know like a three-legged dog that people


---------03:30----------
are cheering on that's yeah that's funny


---------03:34----------
so I mean I feel loved you are loved I


---------03:40----------
we were missing personality like you in


---------03:43----------
the space because if it's just a bunch


---------03:46----------
of streamers talking interacting with


---------03:48----------
each other are they're giving you hearts


---------03:50----------
in the show when it's just a bunch of


---------03:52----------
streamers talking interacting with each


---------03:53----------
other and we're all living in this


---------03:54----------
bubble uh-huh then uh it's I don't know


---------04:01----------
the best way to word this but we


---------04:03----------
definitely get more caught up in all the


---------04:05----------
negatives that result from being exposed


---------04:09----------
to large groups of people yeah and


---------04:11----------
forget to step back and think about it


---------04:14----------
critically yeah I mean I think there's


---------04:16----------
certainly a certain degree of myopia


---------04:18----------
that happens right like so people kind


---------04:21----------
of get super zoomed in on their life and


---------04:23----------
their sphere and it's really easy for


---------04:25----------
toxicity to kind of get built up like


---------04:27----------
even if you look at spiritual


---------04:28----------
communities like if you go to a


---------04:30----------
monastery and stuff like a lot of that


---------04:32----------
like Mayan is kind of yeah it's a


---------04:35----------
nearsightedness yeah okay I looked it up


---------04:38----------
yeah so so it's it's kind of like you


---------04:41----------
know everyone just kind of sees what's


---------04:43----------
in front of them and it can get to be I


---------04:45----------
mean it can just become really toxic and


---------04:46----------
like even when I went to these ashrams


---------04:48----------
and stuff in India like a lot of times


---------04:50----------
there's just a lot of toxicity there and


---------04:51----------
a lot of ego and wait the wind is so


---------04:55----------
crazy that's like I couldn't hear you I


---------04:56----------
think my thing isn't close all the way


---------04:58----------
okay OCD


---------05:12----------
okay okay


---------05:16----------
okay we're gonna yeah so how was your


---------05:18----------
how was your new year okay


---------05:22----------
so this whole going into the holidays I


---------05:26----------
was worried because most years when I'm


---------05:29----------
going into the holidays it's a lonely


---------05:32----------
experience and it's a lonely experience


---------05:35----------
because some lonely experience because


---------05:39----------
well we never celebrated any holidays


---------05:41----------
and my family and I have very little


---------05:44----------
family so I just have my parents and my


---------05:45----------
brother right so actually like a lot of


---------05:51----------
pictures of other people having fun with


---------05:52----------
their family and it always makes me feel


---------05:56----------
left out so most years I'll go visit and


---------05:58----------
just we will hang out and to suck like I


---------06:01----------
don't know we usually just go to dinner


---------06:03----------
or something but mmm so I don't feel


---------06:06----------
that as much but I was sick also and


---------06:10----------
then I kind of I was I've been really


---------06:11----------
sick and then I needed to stay here I


---------06:13----------
think I tried to get them to come here


---------06:16----------
they didn't want to and then but then I


---------06:18----------
just tried to avoid looking at social


---------06:20----------
media and seeing all heavy pictures and


---------06:21----------
stuff like that mm-hmm


---------06:23----------
and it wasn't it wasn't too bad so it


---------06:27----------
sounds like you were sick and it wasn't


---------06:28----------
too bad is how the holidays well yeah


---------06:30----------
yeah but even if you do go home it


---------06:34----------
sounds like even if you're with your


---------06:36----------
family you feel what exactly mmm we're


---------06:41----------
diving right in by the way unless you


---------06:43----------
want yeah I see that what do I feel


---------06:48----------
feels like something's missing yeah


---------06:51----------
[Music]


---------07:01----------
huh wait why is everyone doing this face


---------07:05----------
you guys scared okay for a second yeah I


---------07:12----------
know I mean I maybe I'll close it


---------07:14----------
yeah get more immersed because I saw it


---------07:17----------
in peripheral this sense of community


---------07:28----------
that people usually get or in family


---------07:30----------
from the holidays I've I guess I've been


---------07:33----------
envious of it yeah


---------07:36----------
and even if we get together it just


---------07:42----------
feels like our family is really small


---------07:44----------
and then it's not as a happy experience


---------07:49----------
as the bigger families who have more


---------07:52----------
than just their immediate family yeah


---------07:54----------
well so and how do you feel when you


---------07:57----------
look at pictures of other people over


---------07:59----------
the holidays what's the main thing that


---------08:03----------
the FOMO feeling yes so what what so


---------08:07----------
let's talk about that for a second right


---------08:08----------
so fear yeah yeah Oh mo FOMO is like


---------08:11----------
sure it's fear of missing out but what


---------08:12----------
is it about those pictures that you're


---------08:15----------
missing because FOMO can mean different


---------08:18----------
things to different people for some


---------08:19----------
people it's like a particular place for


---------08:21----------
some people it's like Sun which is what


---------08:24----------
my FOMO is like as I'm in Boston right


---------08:26----------
for some people it's like there's I just


---------08:31----------
want to see a lot of smiling faces


---------08:33----------
around me yeah I guess and you you keep


---------08:37----------
people on close to you with people I'm


---------08:39----------
close to yeah so you keep on talking you


---------08:41----------
use the adjective that you're using has


---------08:43----------
to do with size I don't know if you can


---------08:45----------
if you're noticing that what is that I


---------08:49----------
don't it doesn't seem like size is that


---------08:50----------
important


---------08:51----------
yep for family yeah mm-hmm but that's


---------08:54----------
the words that you're using you see that


---------08:56----------
you've said small like three or four


---------08:58----------
times when we talked about your family


---------08:59----------
and going home for the holidays like my


---------09:02----------
yeah is small so are you seeing pictures


---------09:03----------
of like 15 people smiling together


---------09:07----------
I am but I guess that's not it's


---------09:10----------
probably just that my brother's missing


---------09:11----------
yeah from the picture yep


---------09:15----------
well not me right so like if we think


---------09:18----------
about when you go home go ahead I was


---------09:22----------
trying to figure out if I can put you on


---------09:23----------
the right side of my monitor is there a


---------09:24----------
way to switch this it's okay keep going


---------09:27----------
yeah yeah so let's think about that


---------09:30----------
right so when you go home you feel like


---------09:32----------
something is missing like the people


---------09:36----------
that you're seeing are too small like


---------09:38----------
it's like not in our family right it's


---------09:39----------
not it's not the full family yeah


---------09:41----------
because the whole family reckful isn't


---------09:45----------
the full family it's not the full family


---------09:47----------
yeah yeah so let's just think about that


---------09:49----------
for a second right so the reason like


---------09:50----------
you feel like something is missing


---------09:51----------
during the holidays is because something


---------09:54----------
is missing during the holidays sure


---------09:58----------
yeah um this reminds me I wanted to


---------10:03----------
share with you because I thought of this


---------10:04----------
my dad wrote a book he actually wrote


---------10:07----------
several but in the book he had a


---------10:09----------
fictional character mm-hmm who was based


---------10:11----------
on himself I had a different profession


---------10:14----------
but the same backstory with my brother


---------10:17----------
who you know his kid who commits suicide


---------10:20----------
and then he wrote the experience of the


---------10:23----------
actual experience of what it felt like


---------10:25----------
for him when my my brother committed


---------10:30----------
suicide and I wanted to read it to you


---------10:33----------
sure thought maybe yeah and I when I was


---------10:37----------
16 I actually edited the book for my dad


---------10:40----------
so I read it all the way through back


---------10:42----------
then huh cuz he didn't get an editor I


---------10:46----------
wasn't very good at editing I could


---------10:48----------
actually do it much better now while I'm


---------10:50----------
reading it I would want to change some


---------10:52----------
words around enough anyway just read it


---------10:55----------
but yeah sure


---------10:56----------
so let me pull


---------10:59----------
okay okay so because


---------11:11----------
so some of this is fictional I'll give


---------11:13----------
it a little bit of preface um now I'll


---------11:15----------
just go right into it I tossed and


---------11:18----------
turned in bed but couldn't fall asleep


---------11:19----------
as every night since my personal tragedy


---------11:22----------
happened in midsummer of that same year


---------11:24----------
my son had been suffering from a severe


---------11:27----------
depression for several months and I did


---------11:30----------
some time fear the worst so when my wife


---------11:33----------
called me at work on that evening and


---------11:35----------
said that his room was locked and he


---------11:36----------
wouldn't respond to calling his name and


---------11:38----------
knocking on the door death immediately


---------11:40----------
reared in my mind and my heart


---------11:41----------
palpitated with a pang I shouted my son


---------11:44----------
is dead and I started sobbing savagely


---------11:46----------
and uncontrollably my secretary drove me


---------11:49----------
home someone climbed to the rear window


---------11:51----------
of his room and broke it then


---------11:53----------
immediately screamed to call the


---------11:54----------
paramedics Leora her name's really judy


---------11:57----------
judy ran to guys room the secretary


---------12:00----------
following on the steps Judy came out of


---------12:02----------
the room crying hysterically her paint


---------12:04----------
throbbing around me the paramedics came


---------12:06----------
and she reentered the room with them but


---------12:10----------
they could only confirm guy's death I


---------12:12----------
held even more but did not have the


---------12:14----------
strength of mind to even think about


---------12:16----------
entering guy's room I ran up and down


---------12:18----------
back and forth in the house i sat I


---------12:20----------
stood up against at again lay down on


---------12:23----------
the floor and twisted in all forms and


---------12:24----------
directions but I could not escape the


---------12:26----------
terrible situation I screamed for my son


---------12:29----------
and hope that he would immediately come


---------12:30----------
out of the room I saw Judy breaking out


---------12:32----------
from guy's room dashing past everyone in


---------12:34----------
the corridor ripping out her hair and


---------12:36----------
rushing to her bedroom door slamming


---------12:39----------
behind her and I still twisted around in


---------12:42----------
frenzy this is not true how do I get out


---------12:46----------
of this nightmare my mind raged where do


---------12:48----------
I hide now for eternity at nights I


---------12:51----------
could not sleep


---------12:52----------
daydreaming deliriously about my son


---------12:53----------
conversation and activity with me during


---------12:56----------
the day I had to face all those annoying


---------12:57----------
friends and colleagues who honestly with


---------12:59----------
good intentions were torturing me with


---------13:01----------
the meaningless words all of them


---------13:03----------
repeated endlessly as if they had


---------13:04----------
rehearsed together you have your family


---------13:07----------
to take care of as well as your police


---------13:09----------
work


---------13:10----------
be strong


---------13:12----------
what's calling me but that one


---------13:16----------
800-number is worse thing as if I needed


---------13:20----------
to be told all this we're not for these


---------13:23----------
cursed obligations I would emulate guys


---------13:25----------
suicide and be immediately released from


---------13:27----------
the pain and anyway how could i betray


---------13:30----------
his memory by tending to things as


---------13:32----------
meaningless and trivial as personal


---------13:33----------
achievement status and career the


---------13:36----------
constant unbearable relentless pain


---------13:38----------
weighing down on my chest like a hundred


---------13:40----------
tanks parked on it and the need to


---------13:42----------
perform work and other daily duties was


---------13:44----------
now utterly meaningless to watch people


---------13:46----------
going places coming back talking and


---------13:49----------
toiling for reasons that now completely


---------13:50----------
escaped me what is the meaning of all


---------13:53----------
this hassle and tussle I'm dead and


---------13:55----------
these people continue their daily


---------13:57----------
occupations and I have to watch them and


---------13:59----------
they're utterly stupid ambitions and


---------14:00----------
activities to get rich to be powerful to


---------14:03----------
do this and that


---------14:04----------
what for as life has already ended and


---------14:06----------
why is it that I'm dead and they're


---------14:08----------
alive and why is it


---------14:10----------
they have sons to continue their


---------14:12----------
existence after they're gone and where's


---------14:15----------
mine while performing my duties as a


---------14:20----------
lawyer here at police inspector when


---------14:22----------
it's lawyer really I would feel sad


---------14:24----------
enraged empty-headed and exalted


---------14:27----------
concurrently or alternate are


---------14:29----------
alternatively why can't I also depart


---------14:32----------
after guy maybe I will find him


---------14:34----------
somewhere when I call him back in my


---------14:36----------
dreams he only signals that it was time


---------14:38----------
for him to go on with his passage and


---------14:39----------
not for me I have family duties a city's


---------14:45----------
population to protect here the same


---------14:47----------
population who couldn't honestly give a


---------14:49----------
[ __ ] about guys death anyone understood


---------14:52----------
the city's treatment of beat


---------14:55----------
the weeks and months passed black horror


---------14:58----------
settled in my mind my own darkness


---------15:01----------
engulfed sucked it suffocated me


---------15:04----------
inescapable misery constantly bashing my


---------15:07----------
heart


---------15:07----------
dashing wounds of unbearable pain


---------15:09----------
memories of my son melted my brain like


---------15:12----------
butter and boiling vapor driving me


---------15:14----------
insane and the worst was the


---------15:16----------
impossibility the absolute impossibility


---------15:18----------
to run away and to vanish it disappear


---------15:22----------
there was nowhere to hide accept it


---------15:25----------
bless his sleep came to me some nights


---------15:27----------
after many hours of twisting in my bed


---------15:31----------
no appetite for food for sex your


---------15:35----------
achievement whatsoever no ambition to


---------15:38----------
make even the slightest advance only the


---------15:41----------
burden in my chest getting heavier every


---------15:42----------
day and the nagging dread that in time I


---------15:45----------
will forget Gaia desert him that's why I


---------15:49----------
continued living his dump like a zombie


---------15:51----------
horrific not only the loss of my son but


---------15:53----------
mainly the loss of my old securities of


---------15:56----------
the confident man I used to think I was


---------16:06----------
tougher of it I carefully read it take


---------16:11----------
your time slowly I began realizing that


---------16:14----------
I was separated from life because my son


---------16:16----------
was my life and he would never return


---------16:18----------
I'd lost my connection to the part of


---------16:21----------
myself that could not we thought my son


---------16:23----------
satisfied I'm more than that part of


---------16:26----------
myself which my son had reflected I'm


---------16:28----------
orange for me this was the unfolding of


---------16:32----------
the simple realization of why I felt


---------16:36----------
dead among the living I went to the


---------16:39----------
kitchen took a sleeping pill sagged back


---------16:42----------
inside my bedroom and sank into a


---------16:44----------
welcome dreamless sleep


---------16:59----------
thanks for sharing Batman yeah


---------17:06----------
someone has to wrote that my dad wrote


---------17:09----------

---------17:44----------
were reading that it's hard to explain


---------17:50----------
cuz uh you I think we talked about you


---------17:56----------
know there's a split brain experiment


---------17:58----------
right with the left brain right brain


---------17:59----------
it's not my analytical side of my brain


---------18:01----------
it's not the left brain going off it's


---------18:04----------
the right brain and it doesn't speak


---------18:06----------
yeah so I just feel I'm just it just


---------18:11----------
happens


---------18:12----------
it just go like I just just start crying


---------18:15----------
I can't control it I don't even think of


---------18:17----------
thought consciously


---------18:19----------

---------18:22----------
I have to try to figure it out yeah so


---------18:25----------
tell me what but I'm kind of just yeah


---------18:27----------
so the first thing is I mean so you've


---------18:29----------
read that many times before right yeah


---------18:32----------
does this happen every time you read it


---------18:36----------
yeah and does this feel let's start with


---------18:42----------
just wide swaths does this feel good or


---------18:46----------
bad


---------18:51----------
well when I was really depressed it it


---------18:54----------
would feel good because I felt better


---------18:57----------
feeling something and she's crying then


---------19:00----------

---------19:03----------
feels bad cuz I've been happy you've

---------19:11----------
the around the holidays a little bit


---------19:13----------
yeah and so do you so what I get from


---------19:21----------
you is a profound sense of sadness and


---------19:23----------
loss and I Thea the thing that I don't


---------19:33----------
understand is how much of that loss is


---------19:36----------
for you how much of that loss is for him


---------19:39----------

---------19:42----------
dad my dad for sure I don't know I don't


---------19:55----------
know it's reckful I have a crazy-ass non


---------20:00----------
sequitur question for you okay


---------20:02----------
yeah sure do you want to have children


---------20:04----------
one day


---------20:05----------
I always thought no scared they kill


---------20:10----------
themselves


---------20:25----------
so this is important you're doing good


---------20:29----------
by the way


---------20:31----------
Thanks and I was ready to jump into the


---------20:34----------
water but boy did you take the high dive


---------20:38----------
yeah I thought I wanted to do I wanted


---------20:41----------
to do it so there are a lot of different


---------20:46----------
directions I can go right now but I


---------20:47----------
think I'm gonna zero on them this one


---------20:49----------
thing and we can explore the others


---------20:50----------
later in terms of what you're feeling


---------20:52----------
and how to process those like that's


---------20:54----------
there's a part of me that says that we


---------20:55----------
should talk about helping you through


---------20:57----------
those feelings but there's another part


---------20:58----------
of me that says I want to go to the core


---------21:01----------
of this so when you think about having


---------21:04----------
children that is a choice between life


---------21:07----------
and not life living yeah and not living


---------21:10----------
right and it's the same choice that your


---------21:14----------
dad makes that's the same choice that he


---------21:15----------
can't make because he lives as a zombie


---------21:19----------
amongst a world of regular humans and


---------21:23----------
he's like dead on the inside and


---------21:25----------
everyone around him is alive and living


---------21:27----------
with their petty ambitions and joys and


---------21:29----------
fears and you just can't engage in that


---------21:32----------
life he can't and there's a really


---------21:36----------
dangerous thing because if you move


---------21:38----------
towards life again that means that


---------21:42----------
you're leaving guy behind what why do


---------21:50----------
you say leaving behind I think that's


---------21:53----------
how your dad feels and if you go back


---------21:55----------
and kind of read through it there's I


---------21:56----------
saw that that's how he feels yeah that


---------21:59----------
part I don't I don't fully comprehend a


---------22:03----------
part yeah yeah so I I think to a certain


---------22:05----------
the only way that I think that that


---------22:07----------
overlaps with you is in sort of the


---------22:09----------
desire to have children or the lack


---------22:12----------
thereof because you're saying that like


---------22:13----------
this is a part of life that I do not


---------22:15----------
want to engage in yeah right and his


---------22:19----------
difficulty is is that he like want he


---------22:22----------
can't engage in life because his son is


---------22:26----------
dead


---------22:27----------
yeah


---------22:34----------
what are you feeling I had a thought


---------22:38----------
that I thought I'm still here how do you


---------22:47----------
feel about that no a little bit it was


---------23:34----------
got to stay hydrated chat you guys feel


---------24:02----------
like crying you should cry just let it


---------24:11----------
out man it doesn't do any good staying


---------24:15----------
in there


---------24:33----------
we'll talk about why I smile will ask


---------24:36----------
reckful not a robot


---------24:52----------
[Music]


---------25:17----------
long nosed break huh I washed my face -


---------25:22----------
okay I'm good


---------25:30----------
can you hear me or you need headphones I


---------25:33----------
don't I don't know I can hear you


---------25:34----------
without ya I have it set up where I have


---------25:36----------
is always on the speakers and also on it


---------25:38----------
but yeah I was I forgot I didn't have


---------25:40----------
them on yes I didn't know if I was


---------25:43----------
talking to no one


---------25:44----------
yeah


---------25:55----------
what do you help me understand why you


---------25:58----------
shared that today I think it's great


---------26:00----------
that you did it I'm really happy I


---------26:02----------
thought it would give you a lot of


---------26:03----------
insight on my past and experiences and


---------26:06----------
from a perspective of an adult at the


---------26:09----------
time because I was young and then like


---------26:15----------
maybe what my childhood might have been


---------26:17----------
like after that mm-hmm I think it says a


---------26:21----------
lot and at the same time but that's not


---------26:22----------
a perspective on your childhood right


---------26:25----------
that's a perspective on your dad and we


---------26:28----------
can sort her what things were like yeah


---------26:31----------
that's what I'm saying yeah but I'm just


---------26:35----------
I'm a little bit surprised


---------26:36----------
to be honest that he asked you to edit


---------26:38----------
that at the age of 16 like that's some


---------26:43----------
pretty heavy stuff yeah do you remember


---------26:48----------
what it was like reading it at the age


---------26:49----------
of 16


---------26:54----------
no got maybe I shut it out of my mind


---------26:59----------
I mean I'm sure I felt summer Li mm-hmm


---------27:02----------
I don't I mean those are the first seven


---------27:05----------
pages it's like a maybe 200 pages that's


---------27:10----------
the opening it those that's like page


---------27:13----------
five or something yeah okay interesting


---------27:16----------
feels like a climax you know just from a


---------27:18----------
narrative perspective yeah but and how


---------27:24----------
do you how are you feeling now what are


---------27:25----------
you feeling um a little


---------27:35----------
or something feels nice to have shared


---------27:39----------
it


---------27:44----------
feels like I uh feels like I got


---------27:48----------
something off my chest


---------27:49----------
yeah what did you get off your chest


---------27:56----------
you


---------28:00----------
you


---------28:01----------
hmm I wonder


---------28:06----------
you already know I don't know try to


---------28:10----------
figure it out yeah something something


---------28:13----------
so let's think about that so the first


---------28:18----------
thing is you've read this before right


---------28:20----------
but when you read it before you don't


---------28:22----------
let's try to start actually by helping


---------28:24----------
maybe trying to understand like what is


---------28:27----------
going instead of sort of defining


---------28:29----------
specifically what you got off your chest


---------28:31----------
or how you're feeling better or what is


---------28:34----------
feeling better let's try to understand


---------28:35----------
how you're feeling better like what's


---------28:37----------
going on inside you not from a specific


---------28:39----------
sense but like what are the mechanics of


---------28:42----------
okay generation so you've read this


---------28:45----------
before and it evokes feelings of


---------28:47----------
negativity usually right and sometimes


---------28:49----------
when you're feeling depressed it can


---------28:51----------
feel good because you say it feels you


---------28:54----------
feel something but I suspect that when


---------28:56----------
you're depressed and you read that part


---------28:58----------
of what feels good is resonance it's


---------29:01----------
kind of like when you when you have a


---------29:03----------
breakup and you listen to like breakup


---------29:05----------
songs they hurt but they also feel good


---------29:08----------
because it's like resonant with the way


---------29:10----------
that you feel does that make sense


---------29:12----------
okay so it's possible that it you know


---------29:14----------
just feeling anything I mean very


---------29:16----------
possible just the feeling of you're


---------29:19----------
relating to something yeah so that that


---------29:20----------
like you're not because if you think


---------29:22----------
about depression you're kind of alone


---------29:23----------
and to know that like someone else out


---------29:26----------
there shares your sense of like abject


---------29:32----------
hopelessness about the rest of life can


---------29:36----------
sort of feel good and the fact that it


---------29:37----------
was your dad yeah and feel good too


---------29:39----------
right because it's like at least your


---------29:40----------
dad understands or you understand yeah


---------29:43----------
and it makes sense it also I listen to a


---------29:46----------
lot of musicians who shared some of


---------29:49----------
their thoughts when I was in high school


---------29:51----------
yeah so we look as human beings we look


---------29:54----------
for resonance but that's not what's


---------29:56----------
happening here right so sometimes you


---------30:00----------
read it and then you feel these negative


---------30:01----------
emotions but there's no metabolism I get


---------30:06----------
the sense that you're metabolizing


---------30:08----------
something so I have a sense what do you


---------30:11----------
mean by that yeah so that you have this


---------30:14----------
thing inside you right like this thing


---------30:17----------
that is


---------30:19----------
a zombie I think that's a great way to


---------30:21----------
describe it so for your dad losing a son


---------30:24----------
Zomba thighs him entirely but in your


---------30:28----------
case you were just a child and we sort


---------30:30----------
of saw that there was a piece of you


---------30:31----------
that was zombified and that like this is


---------30:34----------
like sure maybe you have bipolar or


---------30:36----------
whatever I I really have no idea because


---------30:38----------
I haven't like clinically assessed you


---------30:39----------
for that nor am i interested in doing


---------30:41----------
that that's not what the stream is about


---------30:43----------
but that you have something within you


---------30:45----------
that like changes the way that you carry


---------30:48----------
it like you started carrying something


---------30:50----------
that day and you've carried it with you


---------30:52----------
your entire life and it's heavy in it's


---------30:56----------
shitty and there are times where you


---------30:58----------
take it out of your satchel and you're


---------31:00----------
like you see it you hold it in your


---------31:01----------
hands and those are the times that


---------31:02----------
you're depressed and so what I think me


---------31:06----------
believe I disagree at the last part okay


---------31:08----------
only what I'm holding in my hands you


---------31:10----------
think I'm depressed no no no I don't


---------31:12----------
think only when you're depressed is when


---------31:14----------
you're holding it in your hands I don't


---------31:15----------
think if those are necessarily the same


---------31:17----------
but okay I think that some of your


---------31:20----------
depression relates to that or when you


---------31:22----------
get into that depressive mindset that


---------31:24----------
your mind gravitates towards those


---------31:26----------
thoughts or feelings or that those


---------31:27----------
thoughts and feelings lead to your


---------31:30----------
depression I think there's some kind of


---------31:31----------
connection there but it's not it's not


---------31:33----------
exclusive if that makes sense okay


---------31:41----------
and so what I so I call this thing to


---------31:44----------
some scar so some scar is a ball of


---------31:47----------
undigested emotion that's like kind of


---------31:49----------
like unprocessed and if we think about


---------31:51----------
therapy a lot of times the goal in


---------31:54----------
therapy is to process our experiences


---------31:57----------
and so not have them with us in kind of


---------32:00----------
a raw form but to like understand them


---------32:03----------
and kind of like process them so they no


---------32:05----------
longer like weigh on us in the same way


---------32:07----------
and I think something about this very


---------32:10----------
like public sharing and not necessarily


---------32:12----------
that it has to be public I mean you


---------32:14----------
could have read it just to me but I


---------32:15----------
think there is there is some strength in


---------32:17----------
sort of like you sharing this and in


---------32:20----------
bringing this thing within you to light


---------32:23----------
because it only it really thrives in the


---------32:26----------
darkness it doesn't thrive in the light


---------32:30----------
and if we think about experiences of


---------32:33----------
what do you mean by thrive for this


---------32:35----------
thing I mean I think it grows and it


---------32:38----------
sustains itself as long as it's hidden


---------32:41----------
and that when you share if I if I share


---------32:44----------
it then it can help it go away yeah so I


---------32:47----------
think I mean if we think about for


---------32:48----------
example funerals in the grieving process


---------32:52----------
the grieving process is semi public and


---------32:55----------
semi private but for some reason human


---------32:58----------
beings have evolved in basically every


---------33:00----------
culture that when loss happens we share


---------33:04----------
that grief and that somehow has like a


---------33:08----------
better impact whereas when you have a


---------33:11----------
loss that's very private and no one else


---------33:13----------
knows it like digs deeper so I don't


---------33:16----------
know exactly how that works it's just


---------33:18----------
sort of like anthropologic principle


---------33:20----------
yeah I like that analogy


---------33:24----------
yeah the funeral and and so I mean when


---------33:26----------
I think about your family I think when


---------33:28----------
you guys go there the reason that


---------33:30----------
something's missing is because something


---------33:32----------
is to be blunt and secondly because I


---------33:35----------
don't know if you guys ever talk about


---------33:37----------
it right but there can there can be like


---------33:40----------
Union and community and strength in all


---------33:45----------
of you guys sharing your feelings and


---------33:47----------
like actually acknowledging that you


---------33:49----------
miss your brother and that he's gone and


---------33:51----------
that it's shitty that he's gone


---------33:53----------
and your dad you know God I'm curious we


---------33:58----------
were gonna say less Lester first and the


---------34:01----------
last thing is that you know I think that


---------34:03----------
your dad lost his son but he also lost a


---------34:09----------
son and I think it's fine for you to not


---------34:13----------
be able to live for power or promotion


---------34:17----------
but I think there's plenty to live for


---------34:21----------
with you and your other brother and


---------34:24----------
presumably his wife your mom right I'm


---------34:27----------
not saying that he is not allowed to


---------34:30----------
feel devastated and destroyed and like


---------34:32----------
he wants to escape but like let's


---------34:35----------
remember that because I remember feeling


---------34:37----------
this way when when I actually so when I


---------34:39----------
lost my dad


---------34:41----------
my grandmother kept on wailing about how


---------34:44----------
she lost her son she lost her son she


---------34:46----------
lost her son at some point I got pissed


---------34:48----------
off because I was like you still have


---------34:50----------
three children that are alive and you


---------34:52----------
like one of them is your son and and


---------34:55----------
it's sort of like she never kind of and


---------34:58----------
it was almost I don't know how much I'm


---------35:00----------
you know interpreting things but I could


---------35:02----------
almost see the pain in my uncle's face


---------35:05----------
that like she don't like she had lost


---------35:08----------
everything make sense no and and so I


---------35:11----------
think that there's you know I get that


---------35:14----------
your dad is feeling grief and devastated


---------35:17----------
and I can't really know what that's like


---------35:18----------
and it's easy for me to say you know


---------35:22----------
there's a way forward but I think


---------35:23----------
definitely in your case there is and


---------35:25----------
hopefully in his case there is and


---------35:27----------
people have lost children before and in


---------35:30----------
in my grandmother's case like I know


---------35:31----------
that she can still find joy in the world


---------35:33----------
with my dad passing away because I'm


---------35:35----------
alive and my brothers alive and she


---------35:36----------
likes my kids a lot so she happens to


---------35:39----------
think that my oldest daughter is my dad


---------35:41----------
reincarnated I don't know she's a


---------35:42----------
great-grandmother yep okay so she's old


---------35:46----------
and and we just saw her over the break


---------35:48----------
when I was at Houston actually uh-huh


---------35:51----------
and and so I think that there's still


---------35:54----------
joy and people in in chat were wondering


---------35:57----------
why I was smiling when you were like


---------35:59----------
devastated like what do you feel when I


---------36:01----------
smile reckful


---------36:03----------
I assume that when you're smiling


---------36:07----------
something clicked in your brain a


---------36:09----------
certain way to treat my situation okay


---------36:14----------
that is sometimes true but most of my


---------36:18----------
smile doesn't come from clicking because


---------36:20----------
that's like analytical and it also


---------36:22----------
doesn't come from treating I don't smile


---------36:26----------
because I think I know how to help you I


---------36:28----------
don't smile because of a particular


---------36:30----------
thought I smile because I have hope I


---------36:32----------
have smiled because when I look at you I


---------36:35----------
smile because when I look at you I see


---------36:38----------
someone who's starting to like UNH's


---------36:41----------
Amba fie mm-hmm I smile because I am


---------36:45----------
starting to exam if I yeah and I smile


---------36:47----------
because I can see it happening and it's


---------36:49----------
a beautiful thing


---------36:50----------
Thanks I smile because I ask you the


---------36:54----------
question are you gonna have kids one day


---------36:55----------
and I hope the answer is yes because


---------37:01----------
you're gonna know a joy that I don't


---------37:05----------
know that it's gonna outweigh any grief


---------37:07----------
because I haven't lost a brother yet but


---------37:09----------
it sure outweighs the grief of losing a


---------37:11----------
father and that your life can be full


---------37:20----------
but what you were saying about how your


---------37:23----------
grandma thought she lost everything when


---------37:25----------
your father died yeah and that your


---------37:28----------
uncle was sad I don't feel sad about my


---------37:34----------
that because if your uncle had died


---------37:37----------
maybe she would have I assume she would


---------37:39----------
have also felt like she lost everything


---------37:40----------
I think she could have lost any son any


---------37:43----------
or daughter and feel like she lost


---------37:45----------
everything same with my dad if he had


---------37:47----------
lost me he would also feel like you lost


---------37:49----------
everything or if you had lost Gary he


---------37:51----------
would also feel like I lost everything I


---------37:52----------
think each of us is everything you know


---------37:59----------
yeah


---------38:05----------
but that's why I smile why are you


---------38:07----------
smiling


---------38:08----------
yeah because I'm relating to you what


---------38:12----------
are you relating to loss of a family


---------38:16----------
member


---------38:16----------
yeah I'm curious have you ever talked to


---------38:23----------
your dad about that when he says about


---------38:24----------
the dream is that you said something


---------38:28----------
about like when he says he has a dream


---------38:30----------
where he sees your he sees guy and guy


---------38:34----------
tells him that it was his time yeah


---------38:38----------
those those kind of things I not more


---------38:45----------
interested in now that you mentioned it


---------38:48----------
but usually I dismiss it all try not to


---------38:53----------
think things like that but dreams why


---------38:58----------
not why do you dismiss it not sure I'm


---------39:03----------
trying to think about it there's a lot


---------39:04----------
of things I dismiss in my life all the


---------39:06----------
time and avoid or ignore and I recently


---------39:10----------
stopped started doing it less I kind of


---------39:13----------
want to talk about that like I that's a


---------39:17----------
big reason why you may be feeling better


---------39:19----------
yeah just just little things are


---------39:21----------
changing so I'm able to like clean my


---------39:25----------
room and you know like do laundry and I


---------39:31----------
don't know put things away and just


---------39:35----------
things were always very hard for me like


---------39:38----------
it would weigh on me to do it and I do


---------39:41----------
it I'm like oh I see the benefit of this


---------39:43----------
it feels better in here now yeah


---------39:47----------
[Music]


---------39:49----------
but uh why did I bring that up I brought


---------39:52----------
it up for a reason yeah I think it's a


---------39:54----------
very important so rifles I think what


---------39:57----------
you're starting to do is become whole


---------40:00----------
you're starting to become a complete


---------40:03----------
person and so far in your life you've


---------40:06----------
lived a life of two-faced in this


---------40:08----------
because you've got the zombie miss


---------40:10----------
within you and then you try to live this


---------40:12----------
life outside of it right like there it's


---------40:15----------
a struggle between pushing that grief


---------40:18----------
down and pushing it away and trying to


---------40:20----------
forget and trying to twist away in a


---------40:22----------
direction that you can never twist away


---------40:24----------
and then you try to build this life that


---------40:27----------
everyone tells you you have to build but


---------40:29----------
it's not authentic it's not complete


---------40:31----------
it's like on or off and so life is not


---------40:37----------
complete or whole and what I see that I


---------40:40----------
think is actually like what I'm hoping


---------40:41----------
for and I think I see it is that you're


---------40:44----------
starting to integrate you're starting to


---------40:48----------
let these feelings kind of come out and


---------40:50----------
you're you're accepting them you're


---------40:51----------
accepting your loss in a way that you


---------40:55----------
know you kind of didn't have a choice


---------40:58----------
like I don't know that you've ever


---------41:00----------
really accepted it and I think you're in


---------41:02----------
the process of accepting it having a


---------41:04----------
choice I think would be even harder


---------41:06----------
because if I feel like if I felt like I


---------41:08----------
could have saved him that way on me more


---------41:11----------
no I mean I don't know I didn't know I


---------41:13----------
felt like I was too young well yeah so I


---------41:18----------
don't


---------41:18----------
yes I I mean so you don't have a choice


---------41:24----------
in losing him but you do have a choice


---------41:26----------
in letting him go yeah right I don't


---------41:31----------
know if that makes sense but it and it's


---------41:35----------
not that letting him go means that you


---------41:37----------
don't love him and it's not that letting


---------41:38----------
him go doesn't mean that you miss him


---------41:40----------
and that you envision a life where


---------41:42----------
because I mean this is the thing right


---------41:44----------
every time you look at a Christmas photo


---------41:46----------
of like the four of you guys and


---------41:48----------
everyone's smiling there's like one


---------41:50----------
person missing and that's gonna make I


---------41:54----------
mean you're you're empathic and you're


---------41:57----------
gonna look at those smiles and you're


---------41:59----------
gonna be able to tell that in that


---------42:00----------
Christmas photo no one is smiling


---------42:02----------
genuinely and when you look at other


---------42:05----------
photos and you see those people smiling


---------42:07----------
you can tell the difference between snow


---------42:09----------
if their eyes yeah right


---------42:11----------
genuine fake smile fake smile yeah


---------42:20----------
what's this it's our it's hard to look


---------42:22----------
at it that's really yeah and so when you


---------42:29----------
are home and everyone goes through the


---------42:31----------
motions it's because there's the thing


---------42:33----------
there's this like miasma of something


---------42:38----------
missing before we continue is there


---------42:43----------
anything wrong with the microphone I can


---------42:45----------
everything's perfect I haven't checked


---------42:48----------
yeah usually I check more yeah I think


---------42:52----------
everything's fine on my own


---------42:53----------
okay good okay um so where was I going I


---------43:00----------
was talking about how I can start doing


---------43:01----------
laundry and things I'm yeah okay so I


---------43:04----------
was listening you talked to destiny and


---------43:07----------
you were talking about how everyone has


---------43:10----------
been asking you about psychedelics and I


---------43:11----------
was swimming it's cuz I brought it up


---------43:13----------
and that it's it's a little bit annoying


---------43:15----------
for you actually that everyone maybe


---------43:17----------
that everyone's asking about


---------43:19----------
psychedelics cuz you don't view it as


---------43:22----------
the way to climb the mountain right it


---------43:24----------
was an out yeah yeah uh because it just


---------43:27----------
kind of gets you to the peak of the


---------43:29----------
mountain right away and you want people


---------43:31----------
to more slowly learn with meditation and


---------43:37----------
some other ways to how to calm their


---------43:40----------
mind something I thought took the condom


---------43:41----------
on yeah I heard you explaining to him


---------43:43----------
yeah probably not saying how you said it


---------43:45----------
exactly but I want to say that I think


---------43:51----------
that's so Simon saved my life because


---------43:55----------
since I wouldn't have had the pain


---------43:58----------
from a state of depression to to believe


---------44:04----------
that I could be happy and since it got


---------44:07----------
me to the top of the mountain right away


---------44:08----------
and I saw happiness and I realized it


---------44:11----------
was possible then it uh


---------44:15----------
gave me hope yeah that's why I was


---------44:20----------
wondering what you think I was wanting


---------44:21----------
what you think about that I mean I I


---------44:23----------
think that's great that that happened to


---------44:25----------
you I think so to be clear I don't want


---------44:28----------
people to use psychedelics or not use


---------44:30----------
psychedelics I think so here's so here's


---------44:36----------
what I think about psychedelics so the


---------44:37----------
first thing to understand is that


---------44:38----------
there's a new wave of treatments being


---------44:41----------
studied in psychiatry psilocybin MDMA


---------44:45----------
ketamine these are traditionally like


---------44:48----------
drugs of abuse but they're not like


---------44:51----------
necessarily euphoric right so ketamine


---------44:53----------
and psychedelics aren't necessarily like


---------44:55----------
euphoric MDMA can be done dimma is but


---------44:59----------
and so we're starting to realize like as


---------45:02----------
a scientific psychiatric and neuro


---------45:04----------
scientific community that these have


---------45:06----------
therapeutic value so I don't dispute


---------45:08----------
that at all I've had patients of my own


---------45:11----------
who have had so one of my patients has


---------45:14----------
had an opiate addiction or just all


---------45:16----------
kinds of addictions since the age of 13


---------45:19----------
and he's like around 30 now and he's


---------45:21----------
comfortable with me sharing this general


---------45:23----------
stuff on the Internet because he wants


---------45:26----------
to you know let people know and and so


---------45:29----------
he's been struggling with all kinds of


---------45:30----------
treatments has seen like all kinds of


---------45:32----------
psychiatrists and stuff including myself


---------45:33----------
and was still struggling and then went


---------45:36----------
to down to like Costa Rica or something


---------45:40----------
in a got treatment with ibogaine and it


---------45:42----------
was like transformative for him and so I


---------45:45----------
think these ibogaine is like another


---------45:47----------
it's like an herb that is like sort of


---------45:50----------
hallucinogenic but ayahuasca sort of but


---------45:53----------
the other thing that ibogaine does is


---------45:54----------
reduce the severity of opiate withdrawal


---------45:57----------
symptoms which can make people feel like


---------45:59----------
they're dying


---------45:59----------
so opiate withdrawal is a really really


---------46:01----------
like painful process but it also has


---------46:03----------
psychedelic qualities I'm not advocating


---------46:05----------
first for its use it's not fda-approved


---------46:07----------
there really aren't many studies around


---------46:08----------
it or anything like that but I


---------46:12----------
it's not that I want people to do


---------46:13----------
something or I don't want people to do


---------46:15----------
something I think there's clear evidence


---------46:16----------
that there's value and I think that


---------46:19----------
there are shortcomings so for example I


---------46:23----------
went and I hung out on my discord the


---------46:25----------
other day which is actually really cool


---------46:26----------
so I didn't realize that our discord had


---------46:28----------
it now as like thousands of people in it


---------46:29----------
and yes yeah and so I was like I was


---------46:33----------
like wow like let me just go hang out


---------46:34----------
cuz I used to hang out on my discord all


---------46:36----------
the time when there were like eight


---------46:37----------
people there in like 2019 but um and and


---------46:41----------
so I went on there people were talking


---------46:45----------
in this one guy mentions he says like


---------46:47----------
yeah I think like the psilocybin is


---------46:48----------
great because this one guy lost 200


---------46:50----------
pounds after using psilocybin I thought


---------46:52----------
that's so cool and he was a friend of


---------46:54----------
mine oh okay yeah so he so yeah I think


---------46:58----------
they mentioned something about that and


---------46:59----------
and so they were kind of talking about


---------47:01----------
debating like the benefits of like


---------47:03----------
meditation or psilocybin and if you can


---------47:05----------
get there with psilocybin and lose 200


---------47:06----------
pounds and this guy lost 200 pounds from


---------47:08----------
psilocybin I introduced them to it yeah


---------47:10----------
so then why why why bother meditating


---------47:13----------
and I think that's fine too so like I'm


---------47:15----------
not disputing that people have had


---------47:17----------
positive experiences in fact the data


---------47:18----------
suggests that people have positive


---------47:19----------
experiences with some of these


---------47:22----------
substances the question is what is the


---------47:25----------
probability that someone if I take a


---------47:28----------
hundred people who are overweight and I


---------47:30----------
give them psilocybin what is the


---------47:32----------
probability that they'll lose weight


---------47:35----------
you're asking me yeah I mean I think


---------47:38----------
that's the question III think because


---------47:41----------
you're asking this question that it


---------47:43----------
seems like you have never tried it I've


---------47:46----------
never tried so incitement


---------47:47----------
yeah so if you had you would think it's


---------47:50----------
pretty high no I'm not you step back


---------47:53----------
yeah yeah maybe you're not saying it


---------47:55----------
slow yeah yeah as it helps you step back


---------47:57----------
from your day-to-day perspective and day


---------48:00----------
to day you might be thinking something


---------48:01----------
like oh I really want cheesecake or a


---------48:03----------
Snickers bar but then if you are on cell


---------48:06----------
Symon


---------48:06----------
you're looking at your life is a little


---------48:10----------
more long-term and you're thinking oh if


---------48:12----------
I don't eat a Snickers bar or cheesecake


---------48:14----------
right now I'll feel better in the future


---------48:17----------
and you can really feel it you really


---------48:20----------
see that that's true and that's why it


---------48:24----------
helped my friend lose 200 pounds yeah so


---------48:27----------
I'm not I don't mean that question so I


---------48:29----------
recognize that often times people who


---------48:31----------
ask those kinds of questions imply that


---------48:33----------
the number is low I'm not implying that


---------48:35----------
the number is low I'm actually I was


---------48:37----------
thinking you I wasn't necessarily okay


---------48:39----------
so for example I think the number would


---------48:40----------
be I mean I have no idea I think the


---------48:45----------
number would be I don't know okay we


---------48:48----------
have we need a base I think would be


---------48:50----------
higher than if you gave them any other


---------48:51----------
treatment possible so for example like


---------48:55----------
there's one study on MDMA where they


---------48:57----------
just took normal healthy people and they


---------48:59----------
in a controlled substance old


---------49:02----------
environment they give them it gave them


---------49:03----------
MDMA and they had therapists like


---------49:07----------
process whatever they experienced


---------49:09----------
through the MDMA yeah and then something


---------49:12----------
like they it was a small sample size so


---------49:14----------
like 25 people but like 80 or 90% of the


---------49:17----------
people thought it was one of the most


---------49:18----------
positive experiences in ever in their


---------49:21----------
life and I think none of these were at


---------49:23----------
any history of MDMA excuse so they I


---------49:26----------
mean use so they kind of like they


---------49:28----------
ranked it up there with like the birth


---------49:30----------
of their children and things like that


---------49:31----------
in terms of like how significant it was


---------49:33----------
yeah you mind opening I think it helps


---------49:37----------
you remember how much you love other


---------49:39----------
people things like that but MDMA you


---------49:42----------
can't really take that all the time so


---------49:44----------
yeah be like a once in a while


---------49:47----------
transformative experience but if you


---------49:51----------
take it all the time I think it destroys


---------49:52----------
your serotonin receptors


---------49:55----------
whereas with mushrooms there haven't


---------49:58----------
been enough studies but you can take it


---------49:59----------
way more often and it doesn't have


---------50:01----------
adverse effects that have yet been


---------50:03----------
documented right yeah so so I mean my


---------50:07----------
general take first of all is that we


---------50:09----------
don't know but there does seem to be


---------50:11----------
good suggestions of therapeutic and


---------50:15----------
useful indications I mean I have lots of


---------50:17----------
friends who have used to Lucinda gins


---------50:19----------
and stuff like that and really love them


---------50:20----------
and and swear by the experiences so I


---------50:22----------
want you to try psilocybin at least once


---------50:26----------
because then I give you so much


---------50:27----------
perspective I mean it is getting


---------50:28----------
fda-approved right then you need to know


---------50:30----------
what you're dealing with if you're


---------50:31----------
talking to a patient who's gonna try it


---------50:33----------
after it's after it's completely legal


---------50:36----------
for the pressure uh-huh then for you to


---------50:39----------
really put yourself in their mindset you


---------50:41----------
would have to have tried it once and I


---------50:43----------
think if you try it and I it would make


---------50:46----------
me really happy because then I feel like


---------50:48----------
I can dive deep with you and relate so


---------50:51----------
let's just unpack that for a second do


---------50:53----------
you think you'd be open to that um I'm


---------50:57----------
open to talking about it okay okay so


---------51:00----------
let's first start with do you think that


---------51:04----------
let's start with this you're you're


---------51:06----------
assuming that you you have a very


---------51:08----------
important assumption right which is that


---------51:10----------
if I better if I haven't experienced


---------51:12----------
myself my ability to help other people


---------51:14----------
is improved yes so I agree with that


---------51:20----------
assumption in I agree with that


---------51:22----------
assumption so part of the reason that


---------51:23----------
like I work and resonate with gamers as


---------51:25----------
opposed to people who are addicted to


---------51:26----------
heroin or alcohol is because I know what


---------51:29----------
it's like to play video games for like


---------51:30----------
16 hours a day and have my life go


---------51:33----------
nowhere whereas I haven't had quite that


---------51:35----------
experience with alcohol and I think that


---------51:37----------
those experiences are different so I


---------51:38----------
agree with that and at the same time


---------51:40----------
then you've also related to to loss of a


---------51:42----------
family member and that helped me talk to


---------51:44----------
you sure but I think the loss of a so my


---------51:47----------
experience of losing my dad was very


---------51:49----------
different from you losing your brother


---------51:51----------
so I would say yeah but yeah I think it


---------51:55----------
was actually very very different so this


---------51:57----------
I think is one of the dangers right is


---------51:59----------
that you assume that my loss was similar


---------52:02----------
to your loss but I don't think any were


---------52:03----------
similar at all because I barely grieve


---------52:05----------
for my dad at all


---------52:06----------
and it was kind of a weird so I was I


---------52:09----------
was very sad for a brief period of time


---------52:10----------
and it was a grief but I kind of watched


---------52:12----------
my grief in a very detached way and


---------52:15----------
really wasn't very I mean I was upset


---------52:16----------
like I felt the sadness and I felt the


---------52:18----------
loss but I also was bizarrely detached


---------52:21----------
from it in the same way that you're sort


---------52:23----------
of describing in psilocybin you're like


---------52:25----------
oh I don't want to eat a Snickers bar in


---------52:26----------
your power like the power of that


---------52:28----------
Snickers bar to alter your life and your


---------52:31----------
thinking is low and that's how I felt


---------52:34----------
about my dad's grief that I was grieving


---------52:36----------
but you know I saw everyone around me


---------52:38----------
being affected and I just actually felt


---------52:40----------
a deep sense of peace underneath all of


---------52:43----------
the grief I felt like a really profound


---------52:46----------
and it was one of the most positive


---------52:48----------
transformative experiences for me in


---------52:50----------
terms of like securing me in my


---------52:52----------
meditation practice why did you feel a


---------52:54----------
deep sense of peace but did you feel a


---------52:57----------
sense of peace because you were able to


---------52:58----------
deal with it so well I don't think I was


---------53:00----------
dealing so dealing with it is of the


---------53:02----------
mind so the thing that the reason that


---------53:04----------
was so powerful for me is because there


---------53:06----------
is something that I found within myself


---------53:08----------
which was calm and neutral and peaceful


---------53:10----------
which sometimes when you meditate like


---------53:12----------
if people have been meditating on my


---------53:14----------
stream and stuff like that and even when


---------53:15----------
we meditate sometimes you can find some


---------53:17----------
degree of like this weird like no mind


---------53:19----------
peaceful place and I thought that that


---------53:22----------
would be shattered by grief because


---------53:26----------
generally speaking the more emotional I


---------53:29----------
became positive or negative the more you


---------53:31----------
shatter kind of like this peaceful


---------53:33----------
meditative state does that make sense


---------53:36----------
maybe not okay no it does because the


---------53:39----------
use you talked about how the meditative


---------53:42----------
state is when the mind is often omit


---------53:45----------
yeah so the really fascinating thing is


---------53:48----------
I saw that that that thing within me


---------53:50----------
that felt like blissful and peaceful was


---------53:54----------
there despite the grief so my whole


---------53:58----------
understanding of like mind in this thing


---------54:01----------
being separate I had read about it and I


---------54:03----------
had experienced it in a lot of different


---------54:04----------
ways but really crystallized during that


---------54:08----------
that part of my life when I watched it


---------54:10----------
when I first saw my dad's corpse and


---------54:12----------
like I was overwhelmed that like that's


---------54:14----------
it he's actually gone and you can see


---------54:17----------
him and I remember like touching his


---------54:18----------
face and he


---------54:19----------
was like cold like an ice cube and it's


---------54:22----------
such a strange experience to like have


---------54:25----------
someone who you don't even realize like


---------54:27----------
you touch people all the time especially


---------54:30----------
your family members and they're always


---------54:33----------
like warm and soft right like it's kind


---------54:36----------
of weird like when you shake someone's


---------54:37----------
hand their hand isn't cold it's like


---------54:39----------
there's life in there and like when I


---------54:41----------
touched him I remember thinking like


---------54:43----------
that life is gone in such a shocking I


---------54:46----------
mean it sort of hit me there I I saw him


---------54:48----------
but it was really when I touched him


---------54:49----------
that I was sort of like it hit me that


---------54:52----------
this guy is gone and that he will never


---------54:54----------
be here again and I'll never be able to


---------54:56----------
talk to him and I had a lot of grief and


---------54:59----------
stuff not really so much for my loss of


---------55:03----------
him but the thing that I was the most


---------55:04----------
upset about is that he was I remember


---------55:07----------
the day that I got in medical school he


---------55:09----------
just started crying because I had been


---------55:11----------
struggling to get into medical school


---------55:12----------
for a while and he was kind of worried


---------55:13----------
it's really cute like that and I hadn't


---------55:15----------
seen him cry like that I mean he just


---------55:17----------
like broke down and he said that you're


---------55:19----------
gonna be amazing


---------55:19----------
he's like nothing is gonna stop you now


---------55:21----------
you are amazing yeah you're really good


---------55:24----------
at what you do you helped me a lot yeah


---------55:27----------
I've talked to a lot of psychiatrist and


---------55:30----------
he saw that right he saw that like you


---------55:33----------
know when I mean I had a 2.6 GPA and was


---------55:35----------
struggling to get into medical school I


---------55:37----------
never thought I'd be faculty at Harvard


---------55:38----------
Medical School and and he said like


---------55:41----------
nothing is gonna be able to stop you and


---------55:43----------
that you should do good and you should


---------55:45----------
help people that's really cute yeah


---------55:48----------
and so what-what I was sad about is


---------55:51----------
actually that he didn't get to see that


---------55:53----------
so eight months after I got into medical


---------55:56----------
school he passed away and and so the


---------56:00----------
thing that makes me sad like I remember


---------56:02----------
like the day that that I match Tennessee


---------56:08----------
be happy I'm sorry I won't my dad to see


---------56:12----------
me happy before he does good hope you


---------56:15----------
see me happy now yeah so I come back to


---------56:20----------
my earlier question reckful is do you


---------56:22----------
want to have kids


---------56:26----------
think now if I could stay happy then and


---------56:30----------
let's say like five years go by and I am


---------56:34----------
still stable mmm


---------56:35----------
and yeah I would want to yeah yeah so


---------56:37----------
I'm not you know pressuring you to have


---------56:39----------
children but I think it's it captures a


---------56:41----------
lot of I think if you decide that that's


---------56:44----------
the right thing for you and you have


---------56:46----------
children one day I think a lot of the


---------56:48----------
things that we're talking about in terms


---------56:50----------
of your dad being able to see you truly


---------56:52----------
happy you know it's gonna bring up a lot


---------56:55----------
of sense of sorrow and loss but there's


---------56:57----------
gonna be like the other side of the coin


---------56:59----------
and and you you know the goal here is to


---------57:03----------
live like an integrated life where you


---------57:05----------
have sorrow and pain and suffering and


---------57:08----------
you also have not just endurance because


---------57:12----------
most people just tank their way through


---------57:14----------
it right but that you have like you have


---------57:17----------
joy and and accomplishment and that all


---------57:22----------
of these things like life is about all


---------57:24----------
of those things and the more that you


---------57:28----------
bring all of those things together the


---------57:32----------
more complete your life will be and the


---------57:34----------
goal of life is not to not the avoidance


---------57:37----------
of pain and suffering right because


---------57:38----------
that's what we gravitate towards we want


---------57:40----------
an easy job we want more money we want


---------57:42----------
more comfort we want people to love us


---------57:44----------
we want to be like respected and loved


---------57:46----------
and all this kind of stuff but you want


---------57:49----------
the whole spectrum the shitty and the


---------57:52----------
gun yeah I feel that because like I was


---------57:57----------
saying before well yeah the days that


---------58:01----------
it's hard for me to put it to words but


---------58:03----------
the days where I'm crying about


---------58:04----------
something make life feel meaningful for


---------58:07----------
sure what I really want from life I want


---------58:13----------
to feel a wonderful connection with


---------58:16----------
people i working on Neverland it's been


---------58:21----------
making me feel like I'm with


---------58:25----------
together to accomplish a goal that feels


---------58:28----------
amazing and I don't you don't get that


---------58:32----------
as much from streaming cuz streaming is


---------58:34----------
more of a solo job for most people and


---------58:40----------
it's isolating whereas the game


---------58:43----------
developments a wholesome and happy I


---------58:46----------
love it so that's why I've tried to


---------58:49----------
transition a little bit yeah still like


---------58:52----------
streaming once in a while though because


---------58:52----------
sharing emotion feels great yeah and and


---------58:56----------
so like this is the thing that really


---------58:57----------
blows my mind it's like we've always


---------58:59----------
thought that I mean this isn't therapy


---------59:01----------
but that generally speaking the this the


---------59:04----------
sharing of emotions and like airing you


---------59:07----------
know our deepest darkest feel feelings


---------59:10----------
and thoughts and stuff should be done in


---------59:11----------
private like what the [ __ ] man doing in


---------59:13----------
a public that's really yeah it's the


---------59:15----------
worst to just keep it private yeah I


---------59:17----------
think so I think in in my mind like this


---------59:20----------
stuff grows and this is kind of what I


---------59:22----------
was saying and and you would express


---------59:24----------
some confusion because I don't think I


---------59:26----------
was being clear but that like these


---------59:27----------
things like our negative feelings when


---------59:29----------
they exist within us and we don't show


---------59:32----------
them to the world they actually compound


---------59:34----------
and there's a really interesting example


---------59:37----------
of this that two sides one is that if


---------59:40----------
you think about trauma so when I work


---------59:42----------
with people who have a history of trauma


---------59:43----------
and they like you know if they've been


---------59:45----------
like abused as children and the abuse is


---------59:46----------
ongoing its private and it kind of like


---------59:49----------
lives inside them and no one ever sees


---------59:52----------
it and it just eats them alive in the


---------59:54----------
longer time that goes on and the more


---------59:57----------
they keep it within them like the worse


---------59:58----------
and worse it gets even if the trauma


---------60:00----------
stops at some point as long as that


---------60:02----------
thing is within them it just grows it's


---------60:05----------
like a cancer the other really


---------60:08----------
interesting thing is if you look at the


---------60:10----------
spiritual practice of mantra or mantra I


---------60:13----------
think that actually operates under the


---------60:15----------
same principles so a month or is


---------60:16----------
something that is chanted in secret so


---------60:18----------
you're given a month row by a guru and


---------60:20----------
then you chant it you don't tell anyone


---------60:22----------
what it is in my experience of mantra


---------60:25----------
has been like the more private that I


---------60:26----------
keep it like the more it sort of grows


---------60:30----------
within me and it's kind of like it


---------60:31----------
doesn't I don't let it out the only


---------60:33----------
difference is that it's positive instead


---------60:34----------
of negative which is kind of like really


---------60:35----------
interesting but I think that


---------60:38----------
just this general principle about human


---------60:41----------
beings in psychology that like what is


---------60:43----------
within us like we don't let it out it


---------60:45----------
kind of compounds yeah and I think that


---------60:48----------
there's a big difference between even


---------60:50----------
though the emotions that you feel when


---------60:52----------
you read that thing because I think I


---------60:56----------
mean you knew what you were getting into


---------60:58----------
but something within you gravitate it


---------61:01----------
like you just pulled that out right like


---------61:03----------
you were like you're like I mean I'm


---------61:05----------
sure you've thought about it but like no


---------61:06----------
one else at least I mean I had no


---------61:08----------
inkling I don't know if you told me you


---------61:10----------
know it's kind of like I didn't tell you


---------61:11----------
yeah so like no I knew I wanted to share


---------61:13----------
it yeah so like you shared it and then


---------61:15----------
you there's some part of you that knows


---------61:17----------
it's kind of like you know if you give a


---------61:20----------
a 1 year old like a glass of water and


---------61:23----------
they're thirsty they're gonna drink it


---------61:24----------
there's some part of you that is hungry


---------61:26----------
for licious and to share yeah and to not


---------61:30----------
have it be like stuck within you because


---------61:33----------
it's been stuck within you for a long


---------61:35----------
time yeah it really is and so I think


---------61:38----------
this is different this reading is


---------61:40----------
different this reading has the sense of


---------61:44----------
metabolism to me that you're turning it


---------61:46----------
from one thing into another thing


---------61:51----------
turning it from one thing into another


---------61:53----------
thing so I'm trying to turn this ball of


---------61:56----------
grief and loss into into what I mean I


---------62:07----------
don't I don't think that it stops being


---------62:11----------
grief or loss to be clear it's just it


---------62:17----------
becomes like a positive grief or loss


---------62:19----------
like I don't know how else to put it so


---------62:21----------
when I think about you know the work


---------62:23----------
that I do like I was directionless and


---------62:25----------
purposelessness purposely did not


---------62:28----------
purpose and in that direction and we do


---------62:30----------
we do need to think of a way to wear


---------62:31----------
this because it's it makes sense to


---------62:35----------
share the grief it becomes a positive


---------62:37----------
thing that we don't know where it right


---------62:40----------
yeah so I mean I I can tell you kind of


---------62:42----------
what I I don't know specifically about


---------62:43----------
grief but I think like what happens is


---------62:45----------
the negative parts of us and this is so


---------62:48----------
what I've come to realize is the things


---------62:50----------
that we view is negative become a part


---------62:53----------
of who we are and that allows us to be


---------62:55----------
the person that we need to be and the


---------62:58----------
person that we need to be is what doing


---------63:01----------
your Dharma is tautomerize duty or


---------63:02----------
responsibility I could not do my Dharma


---------63:05----------
unless I was the summation of all of my


---------63:08----------
experiences up until this point right so


---------63:11----------
I don't think now I feel like part of my


---------63:13----------
duty is to help other depressed people


---------63:16----------
who have been in my experience


---------63:17----------
absolutely right so yeah and it wouldn't


---------63:19----------
it wouldn't have happened yes this is


---------63:23----------
what's important about Dharma it's not


---------63:25----------
about pain it's not about comfort it's


---------63:29----------
about like when the first time we talked


---------63:31----------
reckful my life was a summation of


---------63:34----------
experiences where I needed to be


---------63:36----------
something for you and I could not be


---------63:40----------
that thing for you unless I take in my


---------63:42----------
negative experiences and turn them into


---------63:44----------
something that you could relate to or


---------63:48----------
that I could relate to within you that I


---------63:50----------
you know I took the person that I am


---------63:52----------
including all of the good and all of the


---------63:54----------
bad and that's what allows me to be the


---------63:56----------
person that I am because I do understand


---------63:58----------
her and I do understand loss and I do


---------64:00----------
understand directionless and in your


---------64:04----------
case grief and loss you know seem like


---------64:08----------
negative things and they absolutely are


---------64:12----------
negative things but they're also not


---------64:13----------
negative things they're just a thing and


---------64:15----------
whether it's negative or positive is a


---------64:18----------
value judgment that the mind places upon


---------64:21----------
it which you should understand since


---------64:24----------
you've done psilocybin that negative and


---------64:28----------
positive is not real it's what we


---------64:31----------
attribute to it and that a thing is just


---------64:33----------
to think somebody just gifted as


---------64:37----------
bazillion subs on my stream I don't even


---------64:39----------
know Charlotte ninety-three thank you


---------64:41----------
for that by the way yeah people people


---------64:45----------
supporting uh dr. K and content like


---------64:48----------
this I think it is very important and


---------64:50----------
since dr. K has decided to yeah you sent


---------64:54----------
a lot of your colleagues we're doubting


---------64:56----------
that this would be a good idea for you


---------64:57----------
to go online and do this and I'm really


---------64:59----------
happy you did it because you're a AoE


---------65:01----------
healing instead of single target yes


---------65:04----------
they still don't know yeah they'll find


---------65:08----------
out yes that'd be ridiculous


---------65:17----------
but I right before that right before I


---------65:21----------
said that I had something to tell you


---------65:22----------
what were you just talking about well so


---------65:28----------
early are you asking me about psilocybin


---------65:30----------
and then we kind of got off on on the


---------65:32----------
tangent of grief and loss in parma


---------65:34----------
purpose like understanding that things


---------65:36----------
are just before just before someone


---------65:38----------
gifted about you so that there is no


---------65:40----------
difference between positive and negative


---------65:42----------
that like those are valid only apply


---------65:45----------
yeah this gets a little difficult for me


---------65:49----------
because we can start you can you could


---------65:55----------
say that about more and more things in


---------65:59----------
life that there's no such thing as this


---------66:00----------
right there's no such thing as the


---------66:04----------
United States we made it up right there


---------66:06----------
borders we made up in her head right and


---------66:08----------
we just wrote it down that it exists or


---------66:10----------
there's no such thing as money it's just


---------66:12----------
numbers that we write down that exist


---------66:15----------
because we wrote him down and companies


---------66:17----------
no such thing right I mean sort of right


---------66:21----------
yeah we could say there's no such thing


---------66:22----------
you can keep saying there's no such


---------66:23----------
thing about a lot of things but these


---------66:25----------
things are inter subjective things that


---------66:29----------
do they exist for us but objectively


---------66:31----------
they don't exist no so what I'm talking


---------66:33----------
about so I'm not talking about right


---------66:35----------
right I know I know I know it's a little


---------66:37----------
different you're saying there's no such


---------66:38----------
thing as a positive or negative


---------66:39----------
experience it's at what we attribute to


---------66:41----------
it so and somebody else sorry it


---------66:48----------
people are just gifting just gigantic


---------66:51----------
amounts of subs so thanks low DPM thank


---------66:54----------
you


---------66:55----------
like people are gifting with fifty or


---------66:57----------
hundred subs so that isn't say thank you


---------67:01----------
guys so though such things a positive or


---------67:09----------
negative experience so reckful yeah yeah


---------67:15----------
I'm trying to think it through I have to


---------67:17----------
critically think about it don't think


---------67:19----------
don't think close your eyes


---------67:20----------
sit up straight now before we do this


---------67:23----------
okay notice keeps reading anyway I can't


---------67:26----------
blow my nose but I'm also sick I'm sick


---------67:28----------
don't worry about it next time go to


---------67:30----------
next go I want to do it I want to do


---------67:32----------
this bridge I just we won't do breathing


---------67:34----------
that no I want to do it I love it was


---------67:37----------
good but I just keep my feel bad I keep


---------67:38----------
going I hear but you'll have things to


---------67:40----------
talk about with them well I've got I'll


---------67:41----------
get a drink I'll think so by the Solow


---------67:44----------
DPM dude you have gifted like gigantic


---------67:47----------
amounts of subs several times so I'm


---------67:50----------
very grateful for your support and also


---------67:57----------
let me I don't know how to delicately


---------68:05----------
ask this but do you need help because


---------68:10----------
like something tells me that if


---------68:12----------
something is resonating with you and


---------68:15----------
this deeply and you need help just let


---------68:20----------
me know right so I'm not trying to say


---------68:23----------
that I don't appreciate your support but


---------68:24----------
like there's a part of me that just


---------68:26----------
wanders a little bit about


---------68:29----------
you know what like is it just that


---------68:32----------
you're just a super positive supportive


---------68:34----------
person who wants to see the world become


---------68:35----------
a better place like I can completely


---------68:37----------
understand that 90% of the chance is


---------68:40----------
that that's what's going on but there's


---------68:44----------
a small part of me that sometimes says


---------68:46----------
that the people who go out of their ways


---------68:49----------
to help others are the ones who have


---------68:52----------
felt hurt really bad


---------68:55----------
right so if I think about like people


---------68:58----------
who do like trauma support and things


---------69:02----------
like that there are people who have


---------69:03----------
experienced trauma before and and so


---------69:07----------
there's a part of me that actually like


---------69:09----------
feels some strange sense of compassion


---------69:10----------
like I'm very grateful for all the


---------69:13----------
support you're providing and stuff like


---------69:14----------
that but at the same time like I just


---------69:15----------
wonder you know because a lot of times


---------69:19----------
pain and suffering can turn into


---------69:22----------
something really positive I mean that's


---------69:23----------
exactly what we're talking about but if


---------69:27----------
you do need help you know let me know


---------69:28----------
and it's okay to need help and thank you


---------69:34----------
so yeah I'm talking I'm talking to


---------69:38----------
reckless chair yeah so I think we did we


---------69:49----------
did what we did we did the hype train


---------69:52----------
and now we're getting lots of subs


---------69:53----------
okay so diagnose the chair so in order


---------69:56----------
to diagnose this chair we must use this


---------69:59----------
accent or should we do the Indian one we


---------70:02----------
can talk about it okay so the chair has


---------70:04----------
is an Everland chair do you see that he


---------70:07----------
has it he sees the video game yes to


---------70:10----------
surround himself this is the video game


---------70:12----------
and we will do the meditation well now I


---------70:15----------
feel like I felt inspired to do


---------70:16----------
meditation but now reckful is gonna come


---------70:18----------
back and I don't know what to do now I'm


---------70:23----------
uninspired


---------70:32----------
[Music]


---------70:34----------
because I feel like sometimes I get


---------70:36----------
inspired to like teach meditation but


---------70:38----------
now it's like the rhythm is broken I


---------70:43----------
know right we talked about this last


---------70:45----------
time it's like he spends a lot of time


---------70:47----------
in the bathroom blowing his nose he was


---------70:50----------
washing his face last time so I mean


---------70:51----------
he's probably just peeing also I think


---------70:56----------
part of the reason that reckful could be


---------70:58----------
feeling better is because he has


---------71:00----------
sunlight now do you guys remember the


---------71:01----------
dungeon that used to stream from before


---------71:03----------
it was like dark and now there's like


---------71:06----------
light which is amazing do you guys feel


---------71:13----------
depressed you should get your vitamin D


---------71:14----------
checked go talk to your primary care


---------71:16----------
physician about that very common


---------71:18----------
especially in northeastern climate like


---------71:20----------
northern climates also if you're


---------71:23----------
dark-skinned so if you're like have dark


---------71:27----------
skin like your Indian or Hispanic or


---------71:29----------
Latino or African or african-american or


---------71:32----------
whatever or Southeast Asian Filipino and


---------71:36----------
you live in like the northern hemisphere


---------71:38----------
you have to be careful because our


---------71:41----------
bodies are very inefficient at producing


---------71:43----------
vitamin D because we lived in climates


---------71:45----------
where there was a lot of sun exposure so


---------71:47----------
if you live in a climate where there's a


---------71:49----------
whole lot of light chances are you're


---------71:51----------
more vitamin D deficient than your


---------71:55----------
Caucasian friends so if you're like


---------71:57----------
Scandinavian like Scandinavian people


---------71:59----------
have like a very good vitamin D


---------72:00----------
production because they just don't get a


---------72:02----------
whole lot of light whereas like people


---------72:04----------
who are brown like myself have very poor


---------72:06----------
vitamin D per production so get it


---------72:09----------
checked


---------72:14----------
you


---------72:18----------
so someone is up dojo blue thanks for


---------72:22----------
the subs I guess while we're waiting for


---------72:25----------
reckful I'm just gonna thank people for


---------72:27----------
subs Andy Milonakis


---------72:31----------
thanks for the subs bro


---------72:37----------

---------72:42----------
where I'm confused


---------72:46----------
who's Andy Milonakis it sounds are they


---------72:49----------

---------72:50----------

---------72:51----------

---------73:46----------
juice on the carpet like can we just I


---------73:49----------

---------73:51----------

---------73:55----------
okay


---------73:59----------
oh [ __ ] sorry it's just cuz I wanted to


---------74:06----------
read chat and anyway I was gonna like


---------74:14----------
get all ready to meditate but now I just


---------74:16----------
I I feel like my rhythm is broken we can


---------74:18----------
go we can finish our conversation about


---------74:19----------
psilocybin then maybe we can meditate


---------74:21----------
yeah I think we're talking 2ls soon okay


---------74:28----------
okay umm sorry but I I was gonna


---------74:31----------
meditate in a particular way but I


---------74:32----------
forgot what that was cuz I just got


---------74:34----------
thrown off base I was thinking maybe we


---------74:35----------
could just finish our conversation about


---------74:37----------
so psilocybin and that way before I've


---------74:39----------
been doing that breathing exercise you


---------74:40----------
told me this is up yeah good how do you


---------74:44----------
like it I'm not sure I'm doing exactly


---------74:46----------
correctly okay so can you do it one time


---------74:48----------
yeah sure so show me what you're doing


---------74:51----------
actually let's let's start there you


---------75:10----------
should stop at like 33


---------75:20----------
you


---------75:22----------
good yeah so are you contracting your


---------75:25----------
stomach are you abdominal breathing


---------75:26----------
because I see a lot of chest movement so


---------75:29----------
so when you breathe in Tibet yes sir I


---------75:33----------
mean like not like bad but like Bali


---------75:37----------
breathe so you want abdominal so you


---------75:39----------
want abdominal contraction more than


---------75:41----------
chest how do I do that so this is what I


---------75:44----------
want you to do sit up straight and I


---------75:47----------
want you to as you breathe in push your


---------75:51----------
belly out as far as it'll go


---------75:53----------
okay sit up straight as I breathe in


---------75:57----------
push my belly out as far as it will go


---------75:59----------
okay here we go


---------76:02----------
wait I said breathe in push my belly up


---------76:04----------
yeah you feel that you can expand it


---------76:07----------
just pull


---------76:13----------
yeah that's right good so so okay try


---------76:17----------
less hard just in a more relaxed manner


---------76:20----------
so just as you breathe in just your your


---------76:23----------
navel is going out your bellybutton is


---------76:24----------
moving out right so imagine that your


---------76:26----------
bellybutton is pulling out and you're


---------76:29----------
sucking the air in through a vacuum does


---------76:32----------
that work better


---------76:37----------
yeah well he's worried I'm getting


---------76:42----------
tricked into thinking I'm doing it but I


---------76:43----------
could stick my belly out or whatever you


---------76:45----------
know so like like you know imagine


---------76:46----------
you're letting your paunch hang out and


---------76:48----------
you're just taking like a nice big


---------76:50----------
breath like you've just eaten you know


---------76:53----------
like some good Texas barbecue you just


---------76:55----------
went to the Salt Lick and then you're


---------76:57----------
like if I stand up can we know if I'm


---------77:00----------
doing it better yeah you have to turn to


---------77:01----------
the side though


---------77:02----------
okay sure okay so I'm gonna turn to the


---------77:07----------
side okay yeah


---------77:10----------
can't see my face does it matter no no


---------77:13----------
we don't see your face we need to see


---------77:14----------
her okay here we go


---------77:18----------
good okay so here's the okay so okay and


---------77:23----------
when you breathe out close your eyes


---------77:26----------
don't look close your eyes imagine


---------77:28----------
you're pulling your belly button towards


---------77:32----------
your spine as you breathe out and you're


---------77:34----------
expelling all of the air out of your


---------77:36----------
chest I'm pulling my belly button


---------77:41----------
towards my spine okay does that make


---------77:51----------
sense or is the imagery confuse does it


---------77:54----------
make sense it's not like I have a [ __ ]


---------77:56----------
it's not like I have a solid frame of


---------77:59----------
understanding of what you're saying but


---------78:00----------
I could kind of try and yeah yeah I'm


---------78:02----------
just I'm just saying so breathe in and


---------78:04----------
out and let your belly move in when you


---------78:06----------
breathe in let me start belly move out


---------78:09----------
you okay oh someone has a good


---------78:16----------
suggestion lay on the floor you put a


---------78:18----------
book on your stomach


---------78:19----------
that's a great suggestion all right


---------78:27----------
is it bad if I don't own a book just put


---------78:30----------
put something on your stomach something


---------78:34----------
that we can see yeah that great that's


---------78:45----------
okay


---------78:46----------
just lay down good we can see you good


---------78:55----------
good and out there we go let him let him


---------79:00----------
all the way down all the way down all


---------79:01----------
the way down there we go this has gotta


---------79:19----------
be hilarious for people who are just


---------79:21----------
trying to don't like what the [ __ ] is


---------79:22----------
going on okay we're gonna kill right


---------79:31----------
okay no breathing no breathing reckful


---------79:34----------
that's enough so this is a horrible


---------79:43----------
attempt at meditation is what this is


---------79:44----------
okay that's okay just bring the chair


---------79:46----------
back you shouldn't you shouldn't do


---------79:48----------
breathing meditations when you're sick


---------79:49----------
dude it's not good yeah it's okay okay


---------79:56----------
also people are like super super


---------79:58----------
confused about what's happening which is


---------80:00----------
great sure what were you talking okay so


---------80:04----------
we're talking about getting you to try


---------80:05----------
psilocybin yes so let's just so let's


---------80:07----------
take a step back the reason that I was


---------80:09----------
asking you to do this so we can we can


---------80:10----------
we're gonna or both of your nostrils


---------80:13----------
equally clogged the right ones a little


---------80:18----------
more clogged okay so we're gonna do that


---------80:20----------
same left gang right gang thing that we


---------80:21----------
did last time yeah at the end but we'll


---------80:24----------
talk about psilocybin and the point that


---------80:26----------
I was going to make with meditation is


---------80:28----------
that when you meditate you experience


---------80:30----------
the sensation the sensation is not good


---------80:32----------
or bad


---------80:33----------
right like so life is just experiences


---------80:36----------
and we tend to I mean my argument falls


---------80:39----------
short even in my own head whenever I


---------80:41----------
think we tend to pick one experiences as


---------80:43----------
good or bad yeah so I would I would


---------80:46----------
associate it with good the meditation


---------80:48----------
experience because it's calming and I


---------80:51----------
think it releases endorphins maybe it


---------80:53----------
seems like it does you you it's


---------80:54----------
something something feels like it's


---------80:55----------
tingling in my brain after I meditate it


---------80:57----------
feels really yes so I mean this is an


---------81:00----------
association work we're deciding that


---------81:01----------
it's good no no but I think the reason


---------81:04----------
it's good is because we sit with an


---------81:05----------
experience without associations that's


---------81:07----------
what feels good like we what we feel


---------81:11----------
what feels good is when our mind is not


---------81:13----------
associating or placing value judgments


---------81:15----------
on things


---------81:16----------
monka hmm right and and so when we


---------81:20----------
meditate it actually we're just sitting


---------81:22----------
with an experience fully and that's why


---------81:24----------
I'm like mindful eating or like mindful


---------81:27----------
like instagramming or mindfully like


---------81:29----------
watching the sunset is so great because


---------81:31----------
like the more that you just do something


---------81:33----------
without like your mind a tributing a


---------81:38----------
value judgment to it so my favorite


---------81:39----------
exercises that I ask my patients to step


---------81:41----------
in dog [ __ ] so we work our way up to you


---------81:44----------
really


---------81:44----------
yeah barefoot so what we do is like I


---------81:48----------
like that because because the thing is


---------81:49----------
like if you think about the experience


---------81:51----------
of stepping and dog [ __ ] is not bad


---------81:53----------
right like the actual sensation of


---------81:55----------
stepping in dog [ __ ] is not bad yeah


---------81:57----------
actually it's probably kind of smushy in


---------81:59----------
a nice way


---------82:00----------
it's just like it's just like if you


---------82:01----------
stick your toe in the mud but stepping


---------82:04----------
in dog [ __ ] is but yeah but the


---------82:09----------
experience is different from the value


---------82:13----------
that we apply to it so you don't they're


---------82:15----------
like safety concerns too because if


---------82:17----------
we've got a caught on your foot or


---------82:18----------
something you could get infected but my


---------82:21----------
point is that like the that we apply a


---------82:23----------
lot of attributes to the experiences


---------82:26----------
that we have yeah and in my experience


---------82:29----------
my experience has been that the more you


---------82:31----------
can sit with an experience purely the


---------82:34----------
less bad it becomes and that's sitting


---------82:36----------
with an experience purely is sort of a


---------82:39----------
relatively like enjoyable blissful State


---------82:41----------
and when you decide I'm saying that


---------82:43----------
sitting with an aren't you saying that


---------82:45----------
the experience of sitting with an expiry


---------82:48----------
without thinking about whether it's good


---------82:50----------
or bad is a good experience yes yes


---------82:53----------
that's exactly what I'm saying


---------82:55----------
and I would argue that when you think


---------82:57----------
about the way that you describe so for


---------83:01----------
example I just got a $100 donation so


---------83:04----------
thank you all tomorrow and and so I


---------83:07----------
think that that's a good thing but if I


---------83:08----------
were fully tranquil that would be no


---------83:10----------
different than getting a $1 donation


---------83:13----------
total my dad said you broke my brain


---------83:15----------
reckful broke I think that's what he


---------83:17----------
meant ready yeah so that he broke my


---------83:19----------
brain I mean if you just think about it


---------83:22----------
like even-even and you can try this that


---------83:26----------
you can take experiences that you


---------83:28----------
normally so my the example that I use is


---------83:30----------
like also I take like this very bitter


---------83:32----------
like Indian herb so I don't know if you


---------83:34----------
guys have ever heard of neem yeah but


---------83:36----------
neem is is a particular plant and it's


---------83:39----------
like super super bitter you just eat a


---------83:42----------
neem leaf it's an awful experience until


---------83:44----------
you do it fully mindfully and then if


---------83:49----------
you do it fully mindfully like it's


---------83:51----------
actually not that bad it's just super


---------83:53----------
it's like the most bitter thing you've


---------83:54----------
ever tasted but bitterness in and of


---------83:56----------
itself is not necessarily bad right okay


---------83:59----------
so on psilocybin you'll do everything


---------84:02----------
you could do everything very mindfully


---------84:04----------
and you'll just taste something to be


---------84:06----------
like oh actually why why is it that I


---------84:08----------
never enjoy this exactly you'll you'll


---------84:11----------
drink you'll drink it and you'll think


---------84:12----------
oh yeah yeah exactly exactly so you so I


---------84:16----------
think psilocybin creates separation


---------84:21----------
between the mind and the self yes right


---------84:24----------
and and so that people find to be


---------84:27----------
peaceful and blissful and enlightening


---------84:30----------
so like not only do you gain more


---------84:32----------
knowledge but you gain peace and you


---------84:36----------
gain some degree of enjoyment mm-hmm and


---------84:39----------
and so that's also like I've always


---------84:41----------
thought it's weird that like moksha


---------84:43----------
which is the word for enlightenment like


---------84:44----------
gets translated as different things it


---------84:46----------
gets a little translated as bliss it


---------84:49----------
gets translated as liberation or freedom


---------84:51----------
and it gets translated as enlightenment


---------84:53----------
and so one is like huh Nirvana is


---------84:57----------
Nirvana moksha same thing yeah it's also


---------84:59----------
a Nirvana right yeah


---------85:00----------
yeah and so it's just weird that like


---------85:04----------
one word has like you know if you think


---------85:06----------
about it like freedom and happiness or


---------85:08----------
like two different dimensions of things


---------85:10----------
right it's not like the same category


---------85:12----------
but in this state of mind if you've done


---------85:15----------
psilocybin like you kind of know what I


---------85:16----------
mean that like there's sort of bliss and


---------85:18----------
there's like you know more things and


---------85:21----------
you feel better and knowing and feeling


---------85:23----------
can kind of like there's a state of mind


---------85:25----------
where knowing and feeling can like Co it


---------85:28----------
like peace and knowledge sort of come


---------85:30----------
hand-in-hand which is not usually how we


---------85:32----------
think about peace and knowledge I know


---------85:34----------
what you're talking about yeah yeah so


---------85:36----------
as to my personal take on on meditation


---------85:38----------
versus psilocybin so I think that


---------85:41----------
psilocybin


---------85:42----------
is has less research to support it so


---------85:45----------
generally speaking when people meditate


---------85:47----------
regularly for a long period of time it


---------85:49----------
does a lot of things to your brain yeah


---------85:52----------
and I think that those things are


---------85:54----------
probably more reliable based on my


---------85:56----------
experience of hearing people talk about


---------85:58----------
psilocybin then then yeah but you need


---------86:02----------
to have the experience too okay so I


---------86:04----------
think it's probably very similar I don't


---------86:06----------
know I agree with you though there's


---------86:08----------
thousands of years of people have been


---------86:11----------
meditating for thousands of years so and


---------86:13----------
passing down the knowledge right so I'll


---------86:15----------
give you so I'll give you a prime


---------86:18----------
example of why I think meditation is


---------86:20----------
probably better than psilocybin so the


---------86:23----------
state is the same so I think once you


---------86:26----------
achieve is the same is the same or


---------86:28----------
arguably people say that in meditation


---------86:30----------
you can get two states higher than


---------86:31----------
psilocybin although you know unclear


---------86:33----------
what that means but the one thing that


---------86:35----------
you don't get from psilocybin is a


---------86:37----------
practice at concentration and the focus


---------86:39----------
of your mind so I don't think that's so


---------86:41----------
that's not true


---------86:42----------
I got to stop you there okay you do get


---------86:45----------
practice in concentration and focus of


---------86:47----------
your mind because house has you stepping


---------86:49----------
back and realizing all the time that you


---------86:53----------
aren't being mindful constantly you're


---------86:55----------
just like you're it makes you present no


---------86:59----------
so I get the making you present okay god


---------87:01----------
you're getting I need you to try it I


---------87:04----------
need you to try it that's why yeah


---------87:06----------
you'll do it okay so we can go to


---------87:09----------
twitchcon is in Amsterdam and we could


---------87:11----------
you could borrow the car saying I'm


---------87:12----------
gonna do psilocybin I'm saying


---------87:14----------
okay please stay we can we can legally


---------87:16----------
purchase it it's truffles


---------87:19----------
over-the-counter and Amsterdam okay we


---------87:22----------
could we can in a twitchcon and I'll


---------87:24----------
hang out with you we'll talk


---------87:25----------
it'll be great we could stream I don't


---------87:26----------
know if I can stream it off to a switch


---------87:27----------
if they think it's okay but that'd be


---------87:31----------
cool so some people are saying this


---------87:33----------
can't be real


---------87:34----------
tell me more about tell me more about


---------87:36----------
why you think that you train your


---------87:38----------
concentration through psilocybin okay um


---------87:44----------
so okay so after I take so Simon here's


---------87:52----------
my experience I will wake up feeling


---------87:58----------
I'll wake up feeling a bit empty every


---------88:01----------
day a little bit I wake up with low not


---------88:05----------
not too much motivation and all those


---------88:09----------
trying to really put myself there I


---------88:11----------
guess I have time to think about it okay


---------88:14----------
and I'll take it and then after it hits


---------88:20----------
I take it every single day so I'm on it


---------88:23----------
right now


---------88:24----------
always on it it's not a big dose it's


---------88:27----------
not I don't get high I take a 1 gram


---------88:30----------
which people get high on like 3.5


---------88:32----------
usually and I probably built the


---------88:33----------
tolerance um once I'm on it then I'm


---------88:39----------
able to do the tasks that I usually


---------88:42----------
would find impossible to do I wasn't


---------88:45----------
always able to do them it also took me


---------88:47----------
changing my mindset so now I'm able to


---------88:49----------
clean or do laundry or organize my room


---------88:51----------
or plan ahead in ways that were hard for


---------88:55----------
me before ok and just just like I told


---------88:59----------
you my friend Greek took psilocybin and


---------89:01----------
decided to lose 200 pound or decided you


---------89:02----------
want to lose weight and lost hundred


---------89:03----------
pounds or you heard that elsewhere I


---------89:07----------
didn't even tell you then I'm able to


---------89:11----------
think oh if I do this if I clean my if I


---------89:14----------
organize my room it will everything will


---------89:17----------
just feel better in the future I'm not


---------89:20----------
thinking moment to moment I'm able to


---------89:22----------
zoom out and also yeah and I think yeah


---------89:25----------
I'm able to also think I'm also hired


---------89:30----------
I'm not I'm not quite getting it the


---------89:33----------
explanation there I can't do it so it's


---------89:36----------
really hard to explain yeah go ahead


---------89:38----------
so so let me let me try to tell you what


---------89:40----------
I'm hearing and how I'm interpreting


---------89:41----------
that which could be wrong because I have


---------89:44----------
a tried solicitor so I think what you're


---------89:46----------
talking about is the after-effects of


---------89:48----------
something called Samadhi


---------89:50----------
so Samadhi is a state of temporary


---------89:52----------
enlightenment and when people have


---------89:54----------
Samadhi they change and their outlook


---------89:57----------
changes which means their behavior


---------90:00----------
changes and what they can accomplish


---------90:01----------
changes it's like a moment of


---------90:04----------
realization that changes the way that


---------90:07----------
you move through the world so like with


---------90:09----------
my patient who was on ibogaine they had


---------90:12----------
an experience where they saw like the


---------90:15----------
addiction within them is like this


---------90:17----------
serpent that was like coiling around


---------90:19----------
inside them and like eating different


---------90:21----------
parts of them and like they took that


---------90:23----------
serpent out and they like they like shed


---------90:26----------
it and it wriggled and it fell off of


---------90:28----------
them and then they formed like felt like


---------90:31----------
and then like there


---------90:33----------
it changed the way that they interacted


---------90:36----------
with substances in the future from that


---------90:37----------
single moment in time is that what


---------90:40----------
you're describing like their behaviors


---------90:42----------
change and they're the product of their


---------90:45----------
mind in terms of what it decides to do


---------90:47----------
and doesn't do changes from this


---------90:49----------
singular experience there's so much more


---------90:51----------
to it than that okay could be because


---------90:53----------
that singular experience gives hope the


---------90:56----------
singular experience makes you realize


---------90:58----------
you can be happy because when you're sad


---------91:01----------
you think it's impossible you can't see


---------91:03----------
a reality where you would be happy I


---------91:05----------
would feel doesn't matter what I do I've


---------91:08----------
tried traveling I've tried streaming


---------91:09----------
I've had a lot of fans you know I've got


---------91:12----------
a lot of money I've I've tried to live


---------91:14----------
in a nice place and no matter what I do


---------91:17----------
it doesn't feel good I can't feel


---------91:20----------
happiness I've had a girlfriend who I


---------91:22----------
really felt close to and loved and we


---------91:27----------
were traveling together in Japan which


---------91:30----------
is my favorite place to be and I still


---------91:32----------
wasn't happy and now if I take


---------91:35----------
psilocybin all those same experiences


---------91:38----------
become meaningful and I feel like I'm a


---------91:41----------
full whole human being I feel like there


---------91:43----------
was something missing in my my brain and


---------91:46----------
it connects it and it makes it work and


---------91:47----------
it makes me feel these feelings that


---------91:50----------
other people must be experiencing okay


---------91:52----------
so that's very useful to hear I think


---------91:56----------
that that's a broader conversation so


---------91:58----------
that concerns me because in order to


---------92:00----------
engage in life it sounds like you need


---------92:02----------
psilocybin so that just bothers me right


---------92:06----------
so my hope is that there is a way for


---------92:08----------
you to engage in life without psilocybin


---------92:11----------
to have those fulfilling experiences


---------92:13----------
without it right that would be great


---------92:15----------
that's a value judgment that I place but


---------92:18----------
let me just would be great but I don't


---------92:20----------
mind then some people are like oh I want


---------92:24----------
to feel reliant on any substance or


---------92:25----------
something yeah so but I mean I'm also


---------92:27----------
reliant on eating food every day I will


---------92:29----------
die if I don't do that so eating one


---------92:31----------
extra food every day a mushroom


---------92:33----------
I don't yes I don't want to go down that


---------92:36----------
road right now what I want to focus on


---------92:38----------
is what I was saying about training your


---------92:40----------
concentration so this is something that


---------92:43----------
I'm not sure that psilocybin doesn't


---------92:44----------
making fun of my logic that logic


---------92:46----------
doesn't work


---------92:47----------
come no let's forget about forget about


---------92:50----------
the logic please everyone's calling me a


---------92:53----------
drug addict can we address that dog that


---------92:58----------
they're all calling me a drug addict I


---------92:59----------
feel like it should be addressed I mean


---------93:05----------
we can I think it's gonna take more time


---------93:15----------
and energy than I have the inclination


---------93:16----------
for right now okay um do you think I'm a


---------93:22----------
drug addict what does that mean what do


---------93:28----------
you mean by the word addict that I'm


---------93:31----------
doing something over and over that will


---------93:33----------
have an effect on me long-term I think


---------93:40----------
what you're doing is not healthy I'll


---------93:42----------
put it that way okay so I don't know


---------93:45----------
what effects so like scientifically we


---------93:47----------
don't know know what the chronic effects


---------93:49----------
of psilocybin use are right we just


---------93:51----------
don't know and we all have different it


---------93:54----------
my legend you don't think it's not


---------93:55----------
healthy you don't know because they


---------93:57----------
don't know yeah so I think what you're


---------94:00----------
doing is not healthy I don't know if


---------94:01----------
what you're doing will have oh there's


---------94:03----------
difficulty no no no but you don't know


---------94:05----------
if it's not exactly so I think what


---------94:08----------
you're doing is unhealthy for a whole


---------94:09----------
host of reasons but that doesn't


---------94:12----------
necessarily have to do with you being


---------94:14----------
dependent on a substance because


---------94:16----------
generally speaking psilocybin is not a


---------94:18----------
substance that you form a physiologic


---------94:20----------
dependence to right so like when we


---------94:23----------
think about addiction we think about


---------94:24----------
someone whose determinant developed a


---------94:26----------
physiologic tolerance to a substance so


---------94:29----------
I'm addicted to caffeine because if I


---------94:32----------
don't have caffeine I have withdrawal


---------94:34----------
right drink caffeine I don't drink


---------94:37----------
alcohol so the other problem with this


---------94:42----------
this conversation the reason that I'm


---------94:44----------
hesitant to engage in it is because it's


---------94:46----------
not about logic right there there's way


---------94:49----------
more here than logic there's there's


---------94:51----------
values there's judgments


---------94:53----------
there's perception yeah there's sense


---------94:55----------
I'd like to explore all those but for


---------94:57----------
all of those yeah


---------94:59----------
next week because that's a long


---------95:01----------
conversation what I want is zeroing on


---------95:03----------
just because and maybe no one else gives


---------95:06----------
a [ __ ] about this but I feel like it's


---------95:07----------
important because you have people ask


---------95:09----------
questions about the difference between


---------95:10----------
meditation in psilocybin okay so the


---------95:14----------
meditation offers lots of benefits and


---------95:16----------
it's not just the state of Samadhi so


---------95:19----------
the state of Samadhi is I think what


---------95:20----------
psilocybin gives you which is sort of


---------95:21----------
like a state of self outside of the mind


---------95:24----------
which gives you a sense of peace and


---------95:26----------
realization fine arguably meditation


---------95:31----------
leads to other kinds of benefits right


---------95:34----------
so they're like spiritual powers which


---------95:36----------
people claim that you can gain through


---------95:39----------
meditation I won't comment on those


---------95:42----------
today although people are super


---------95:43----------
interested about that we can have a we


---------95:45----------
can talk about that I don't know if


---------95:47----------
psilocybin lets you do those things the


---------95:51----------
the thing that I will be very concrete


---------95:53----------
about is that there is a particular


---------95:55----------
practice of meditation the first stage


---------95:56----------
of meditation is dhaarana which is not


---------95:58----------
actually a state of mind it's a practice


---------96:00----------
so when I sit down and I say focus on


---------96:03----------
your breath and my mind starts to wander


---------96:05----------
and I train my mind to come back to the


---------96:09----------
breath and it wanders again and I


---------96:11----------
trained it to come back and it wanders


---------96:12----------
again and I train it to come back every


---------96:15----------
time my mind wanders it's like doing a


---------96:17----------
mental pushup to focus my attention back


---------96:20----------
on the thing you're getting better at


---------96:22----------
focusing your attention I agree and it's


---------96:23----------
so it's like basically like going to the


---------96:25----------
gym for your mind because you're going


---------96:27----------
through a particular redirection of


---------96:30----------
attention time and time and time again


---------96:32----------
and what that means is that when I


---------96:34----------
intend my mind to go in a particular


---------96:37----------
direction I get better at training the


---------96:41----------
mind to follow my commands yes so I was


---------96:44----------
arguing that I do the same thing on


---------96:45----------
psilocybin because I start my day and


---------96:47----------
I'll train my mind - okay here's


---------96:49----------
allocate my time in a certain way I need


---------96:51----------
to here I need to work on Everland for


---------96:53----------
two hours right now I need I've never


---------96:54----------
been able to like you know schedule


---------96:56----------
things or because because I started


---------96:58----------
doing it I'm able to schedule things all


---------96:59----------
the time so I mean I can have every


---------97:01----------
system because here's the not on


---------97:04----------
psilocybin are you still better at that


---------97:06----------
stuff


---------97:07----------
yes it's lat having some lasting effects


---------97:10----------
when I'm not on it


---------97:11----------
so I am still a little better but no I


---------97:13----------
don't I can't like clean my room or


---------97:16----------
organize things or stick be a super


---------97:21----------
punctual but when I'm on it I can be


---------97:23----------
really punctual yes for this meeting


---------97:26----------
then we were you were right yeah you


---------97:27----------
were absolutely yeah and so I think that


---------97:31----------
that's so that I don't know I mean cuz


---------97:34----------
it's kind of like you're saying like I


---------97:35----------
can function on caffeine right but I


---------97:39----------
can't function so more it's a very


---------97:41----------
similar effect of caffeine actually yeah


---------97:42----------
so but that implies to me so that's not


---------97:44----------
how meditation works though because


---------97:46----------
meditation like no but right so it's


---------97:49----------
giving me the caffeine feeling of I can


---------97:52----------
function but it's also giving me the


---------97:54----------
perspective feeling the step back


---------97:56----------
feeling that I can direct my attention


---------97:57----------
feeling maybe you can also direct your


---------98:00----------
attention on caffeine better yeah


---------98:01----------
probably


---------98:01----------
let me put it this way there is some you


---------98:03----------
don't think I'm doing the mental


---------98:04----------
push-ups


---------98:05----------
I don't push ups that's IIIi I'm trying


---------98:08----------
to figure out if I am yes yeah so I do I


---------98:10----------
want you to try it maybe you'll know I


---------98:12----------
don't know yeah and if you're doing the


---------98:17----------
mental push-ups that'll help advance


---------98:19----------
people's knowledge of the connection or


---------98:23----------
the similarities between suicide and


---------98:25----------
meditation just by you trying it once I


---------98:27----------
can figure it out


---------98:28----------
yeah so we also need to have a


---------98:29----------
conversation of why it's so important


---------98:31----------
for you that I try psilocybin right so


---------98:34----------
like what does that mean to you because


---------98:36----------
like I'm getting these a lot I can see


---------98:38----------
that right so yeah yeah yeah and why


---------98:41----------
it's so important to you and I because I


---------98:44----------
want I want to know if I'm going on the


---------98:46----------
correct life path by trying this


---------98:47----------
everyday


---------98:48----------
basically yeah right now you're in a


---------98:50----------
disagreement that I am okay and then the


---------98:54----------
the FDA approval is leaning towards


---------98:56----------
maybe this will be a yeah right but you


---------99:04----------
think I'm doing something on a healthy I


---------99:05----------
want base I think if you try it but


---------99:08----------
didn't we just have a notion about how


---------99:10----------
things like make us the people that we


---------99:12----------
are and that things that may be


---------99:14----------
perceived as negative yes we did so I


---------99:19----------
think that you're on the wrong path you


---------99:20----------
asked me a question and I'm not talking


---------99:23----------
to you about psilocybin I want to know


---------99:24----------
yeah I want to know I wanted you're the


---------99:26----------
one who's asking me do you do I think


---------99:28----------
it's unhealthy you're the one who wants


---------99:29----------
me to try it's alright I value your


---------99:31----------
opinion I value your opinion so much on


---------99:34----------
this topic and the only way I can really


---------99:37----------
get your opinion is if you try okay so I


---------99:41----------
think we should have two conversations


---------99:42----------
now one is about why it's so important


---------99:44----------
to you that I tried psilocybin and the


---------99:46----------
second what's we're having or no in the


---------99:48----------
second is you know this whole issue of


---------99:51----------
whether you're an addict or not and if


---------99:53----------
you want to talk about that those may be


---------99:54----------
related okay


---------99:57----------
but anyway I think yeah I mean I think


---------100:01----------
those are both full conversations I'm


---------100:03----------
more than happy to have I'm I'm thrilled


---------100:05----------
that you're very interested in it and


---------100:07----------
I'd love to have those conversations and


---------100:09----------
it sounds like we've got more stuff to


---------100:10----------
talk about I just kind of have to wrap


---------100:13----------
up in a little bit and I was gonna see


---------100:14----------
how that makes sense yeah it's been


---------100:15----------
through hours people want to have


---------100:19----------
questions do you do people have


---------100:22----------
questions let me just look real quick


---------100:24----------
let's uh let's answer to a question


---------100:26----------
everything yeah I can look at some


---------100:28----------
questions too anyone have any questions


---------100:29----------
I'll read them in here fastest four


---------100:35----------
hours of your life yeah sorry okay guys


---------100:38----------
can you


---------100:39----------
be fun of me for trying to get a


---------100:43----------
psychiatrist to take drugs please I'm


---------100:45----------
sorry I don't I'm not offended and I


---------100:49----------
don't think it's an appropriate thing if


---------100:51----------
people want to make fun like you know


---------100:52----------
twitch chat is twitch chats they're


---------100:53----------
gonna make fun of what they want to make


---------100:54----------
fun of I know it's kind of funny it's


---------100:56----------
pretty funny


---------100:57----------
I think it's actually a really important


---------100:58----------
conversation but I do think twitch chat


---------101:00----------
is picking up on something that there's


---------101:02----------
almost there's a very amused this word


---------101:07----------
but it feels right there's some


---------101:08----------
desperation within you for me to try


---------101:10----------
psilocybin like that's what it feels


---------101:11----------
like


---------101:12----------
like I feel yes because as soon as you


---------101:14----------
do I I and I don't want to be too pushy


---------101:16----------
which I being them too pushy for sure


---------101:18----------
but I know that as soon as you try it


---------101:20----------
you'll be able to tell me if I am doing


---------101:21----------
these mental push-ups if you tell me I


---------101:23----------
am doing the mental push-ups I'll feel


---------101:24----------
better every single day so here's the


---------101:27----------
problem that I like this in in two


---------101:29----------
seconds reckful you need to stop living


---------101:32----------
your life based on my validation you


---------101:34----------
have to decide for yourself right that's


---------101:38----------
the fundamental problem so I've already


---------101:40----------
decided for myself I want to do it I


---------101:41----------
don't think you have then then the


---------101:44----------
reason I'm here outside for other


---------101:45----------
opinion because you see addict to do the


---------101:48----------
same thing I'm doing


---------101:49----------
I'd like some actual heroin addict would


---------101:52----------
do what I'm doing and decide for himself


---------101:54----------
exactly so there's a part of your


---------101:56----------
opinion there is a part of you that has


---------101:57----------
doubt and you were looking for me to


---------102:00----------
settle that doubt I'm not gonna play


---------102:02----------
that yes


---------102:03----------
no I didn't present this right so it


---------102:06----------
doesn't mean that we can't talk about it


---------102:07----------
again but my initial reaction is that


---------102:09----------
you're looking for a green light from me


---------102:12----------
which the problem with that is not


---------102:13----------
whether I give you a green light or the


---------102:15----------
red light the problem that I have with


---------102:16----------
that is that like reckful you need to


---------102:18----------
stop looking to me for green lights this


---------102:20----------
is a decision like you have to come to


---------102:22----------
on your own huh I kind of like looking


---------102:25----------
at you for green I know and I'm gonna


---------102:26----------
give you the green lights that I'm ready


---------102:28----------
to give you but for the rest of it let's


---------102:30----------
talk about it later


---------102:30----------
let's do Q&A okay dodj sure Q&A I'm


---------102:35----------
gonna stealth and disappear


---------102:37----------
I'm getting him to try it by the way


---------102:38----------
you'll see which gun so I have a few


---------102:43----------
questions here that I can ask so


---------102:48----------
[Music]


---------102:50----------
let me just see if these are for


---------102:57----------
I really think some don't don't worry


---------103:01----------
about it reckful seriously I think you


---------103:03----------
so I think twitch chat is on to


---------103:05----------
something and we're gonna explore that


---------103:06----------
in our next interview because next week


---------103:09----------
yeah I think we should talk about it but


---------103:11----------
it's not I don't think we do Sundays


---------103:13----------
from now on yeah we can let me try can


---------103:16----------
we do can we talk about that do Sunday's


---------103:18----------
yeah if you can't do Sunday's I'll do


---------103:20----------
Friday's it's no I I think I should be


---------103:22----------
able to do something okay it's just


---------103:24----------
gonna have to be not this time right oh


---------103:27----------
wait do you guys like Friday's shot you


---------103:30----------
guys really like Friday's I guess that's


---------103:33----------
a good QA what day do you guys like the


---------103:35----------
best for this oh they love Fridays okay


---------103:37----------
well do Fridays if he's what Friday


---------103:39----------
later in the day work better for you


---------103:42----------
know this was great timing okay so some


---------103:47----------
what we kind of talked about this a


---------103:48----------
little bit how are you not crying after


---------103:50----------
reckful read that so people are


---------103:52----------
wondering if I'm because they were


---------103:53----------
noticing I was smiling and I was


---------103:55----------
sadistic here yeah so reckful I'll kind


---------103:57----------
of ask again I know we kind of talked


---------103:58----------
about it but what are you person like


---------104:00----------
how does it feel to you when I smile you


---------104:02----------
know what we're talking like how does


---------104:04----------
that feel to you well the way I answer


---------104:07----------
it last time was I thought that when


---------104:09----------
you're smiling it means that something


---------104:10----------
clicked in your brain that you realized


---------104:13----------
you're gonna be able to help me but you


---------104:15----------
said that what you when you were smiling


---------104:17----------
you feel hope for me yeah did I see a


---------104:22----------
lecture you feel hope for me do you


---------104:24----------
let's hope for me now nothing I'm a drug


---------104:26----------
addict I think it's all it's all part of


---------104:32----------
it so reckful it's all part of your road


---------104:34----------
man it's all part of your yeah right


---------104:36----------
okay I mean it's it you know I I do my


---------104:40----------
best not to judge and like this whole


---------104:43----------
like addict or not I yeah so I think


---------104:45----------
sometimes I do like click right so


---------104:47----------
sometimes it's kind of an intellectual


---------104:48----------
like it's like right before I like it's


---------104:51----------
like AG Adam like it's right before yeah


---------104:54----------
and so sometimes it is that sort of like


---------104:56----------
intellectual things clicking into place


---------104:58----------
but a lot of times it's just hope and


---------105:00----------
it's kind of bizarre cuz like I


---------105:02----------
sometimes I used to get bothered by it


---------105:04----------
when like people would come into my


---------105:05----------
office and they'd like start crying and


---------105:07----------
stuff and I'd be sitting there grinning


---------105:08----------
like an idiot and then I've asked them


---------105:10----------
how does it feel to you that I'm


---------105:11----------
grinning like an idiot while you're


---------105:12----------
crying and they're like it actually


---------105:13----------
feels really good okay and so their sake


---------105:17----------
I could see it could be interpreted the


---------105:18----------
wrong way but most people who know you


---------105:20----------
would not interpret throw away yeah so I


---------105:22----------
have a question for you that you can ask


---------105:23----------
your your uh your base and your own time


---------105:27----------
as well I uh so I was gonna surprise you


---------105:29----------
but I think it's actually better if you


---------105:31----------
end up telling me and talking about it


---------105:34----------
I'm gonna put you in Everland


---------105:36----------
okay you're gonna be in the game cool


---------105:38----------
and you can have your own building or


---------105:40----------
you could be meditating on a mountain I


---------105:42----------
whatever you prefer and if you have a


---------105:44----------
building what would it be what would you


---------105:46----------
want it to be and you could talk you


---------105:49----------
could talk to your chat about it and


---------105:51----------
they can help you decide in another time


---------105:53----------
okay so I feel like I already have an


---------105:56----------
answer for you


---------105:57----------
okay what is it and it's and if this is


---------106:00----------
a cop-out I'm gonna ask chat because I


---------106:02----------
feel like I don't think this is a


---------106:03----------
cop-out but I think I think it should be


---------106:05----------
whatever you think it should be I won't


---------106:08----------
okay I want that I want you to build it


---------106:10----------
so like whatever you whatever inspired


---------106:12----------
me to put you into the game like put me


---------106:14----------
into the game in the image that you feel


---------106:16----------
is appropriate okay great I got it okay


---------106:19----------
yeah great thank you nice so I have a


---------106:24----------
question here is it okay to meditate


---------106:26----------
after smoking weed


---------106:28----------
so marijuana I think is a whole


---------106:30----------
different ballgame so marijuana I'm not


---------106:32----------
a big fan of I'm not either


---------106:34----------
I marijuana also has a lot of good


---------106:38----------
treatment uses so for example like the


---------106:40----------
best evidence for marijuana I have some


---------106:41----------
legend coma right


---------106:43----------
not just glaucoma so like the most


---------106:45----------
important clinical benefit that I've


---------106:47----------
seen from marijuana is people who have


---------106:48----------
opiate addiction and start using


---------106:51----------
marijuana reduce their dependency on


---------106:53----------
opiates okay and so like from a public


---------106:56----------
health standpoint like people are dying


---------106:58----------
like I said they think 76 people every


---------107:01----------
hour died from opiate overdose or 176 or


---------107:04----------
something like that and so any any


---------107:07----------
substance that causes people to use less


---------107:10----------
opiates I think there's there's room for


---------107:11----------
I have some patients that have


---------107:14----------
depression and use marijuana from time


---------107:16----------
to time it's kind of funny because they


---------107:17----------
like they you know they come here and we


---------107:18----------
do like meditation and all that kind of


---------107:20----------
stuff and then one day like months after


---------107:22----------
we've worked together like by the way I


---------107:23----------
smoke pot from time to time it really


---------107:25----------
helps me feel better and yeah then I ask


---------107:27----------
okay how much do you smoke and I'm like


---------107:29----------
okay like what you know you're gonna


---------107:31----------
live your life I think you can get the


---------107:33----------
downsides of it or it's difficult to


---------107:35----------
have motivation yes so yeah this is the


---------107:40----------
real problem with with marijuana is that


---------107:42----------
marijuana is a cannabinoid and a lot of


---------107:46----------
the receptors around behavior and habit


---------107:50----------
I have to do with cannabinoids and this


---------107:52----------
gets like super complicated but


---------107:53----------
basically when we look at and so I think


---------107:57----------
the real problem with chronic marijuana


---------107:58----------
use is that it it destroys your


---------108:01----------
motivational circuitry and so like if


---------108:03----------
you have trouble finding a job or you


---------108:05----------
have trouble studying or things like


---------108:07----------
that by destroys it's unclear how much


---------108:10----------
damage it does and what that what that


---------108:12----------
looks like but it really hampers


---------108:14----------
people's abilities to have an intention


---------108:17----------
and follow-through with that intention


---------108:18----------
for productivity I've seen that


---------108:21----------
firsthand a lot of my friends and so the


---------108:23----------
people make counter arguments right


---------108:25----------
because they say like oh you have like


---------108:26----------
so I I have someone you know I work with


---------108:28----------
someone who I'm sure this is not going


---------108:30----------
to be identifying but I've worked with


---------108:32----------
people that like major places like


---------108:34----------
Goldman Sachs and Google who use


---------108:36----------
marijuana on a daily basis and the


---------108:39----------
counter-argument is but there are super


---------108:40----------
successful people who were


---------108:42----------
these institutions in use marijuana on a


---------108:44----------
daily basis and I say yes that's correct


---------108:46----------
that's true at the same time I think is


---------108:50----------
a clinician and you have to is a


---------108:52----------
clinician you play the odds right so the


---------108:54----------
question is it might take a hundred


---------108:56----------
people and I give them marijuana and I


---------108:58----------
take a hundred people and I don't give a


---------109:00----------
marijuana


---------109:01----------
what are the likelihoods that they'll


---------109:03----------
end up in certain places I would bet


---------109:06----------
anything that they'd be more of them


---------109:09----------
would be less motivated and that's what


---------109:10----------
we see so there's data to suggest that


---------109:12----------
right which doesn't mean that an


---------109:14----------
individual it doesn't like and this is a


---------109:16----------
big problem is for a long time people


---------109:18----------
thought that marijuana affected IQ they


---------109:21----------
like kills brain cells or whatever I've


---------109:23----------
never seen a situation where I think it


---------109:24----------
affects like raw IQ I think what effects


---------109:27----------
is executive function which is like your


---------109:31----------
frontal lobes which is like being able


---------109:33----------
to plan and execute complicated tasks


---------109:35----------
and it affects motivation it engenders


---------109:38----------
sort of habitual circuitry in your brain


---------109:40----------
so when we and I know that I said this


---------109:43----------
is complicated but I'm gonna go into it


---------109:44----------
because I can't help myself


---------109:45----------
so when we first start to do an action


---------109:48----------
and that action feels good that is


---------109:52----------
mediated by dopamine in something called


---------109:54----------
the meze olympic circuit so early on


---------109:57----------
actions like when I wake up and I have


---------110:00----------
my first cup of coffee ever in life or


---------110:02----------
let's not use copy let's use alcohol for


---------110:04----------
example and maybe this is a bad example


---------110:07----------
because alcohol does things to your


---------110:08----------
brain so forget about the effects of


---------110:10----------
alcohol in the brain actually let's use


---------110:12----------
video games video games so when I first


---------110:16----------
play a video game and I say like oh this


---------110:18----------
is lots of fun that's dopamine acting in


---------110:20----------
my mind in my brain okay so dopamine


---------110:23----------
reinforces a behavior the experience of


---------110:27----------
pleasure but what happens when people


---------110:29----------
become addicted to games as they play


---------110:32----------
the game for like 10 hours a day and if


---------110:35----------
you ask them an hour 7 are you actually


---------110:37----------
having fun they say no like they don't


---------110:42----------
remember yesterday where they played 14


---------110:44----------
hours of Diablo as being like one of the


---------110:47----------
best days of their life but I do


---------110:49----------
remember like land parties where I still


---------110:52----------
remember like the land party where I


---------110:53----------
play left 4 dead and it was like a


---------110:56----------
last man like I remember that it was so


---------110:58----------
much fun I was with my friends we were


---------111:00----------
trying to survive from zombies it was


---------111:02----------
like a blast


---------111:02----------
I remember specific gaming experiences


---------111:05----------
of my life because they release dopamine


---------111:08----------
over time a games on a couch feels with


---------111:11----------
friends is so fun and I ever lay maybe I


---------111:13----------
want to make some sort of my lead artist


---------111:16----------
Frank is really passionate about this to


---------111:17----------
make some sort of game that gets people


---------111:19----------
to do couch co-op's again cool because


---------111:21----------
yeah I hang out to friends but so so at


---------111:25----------
the beginning of a behavior it gets


---------111:27----------
reinforced by dopamine over time that


---------111:30----------
neurotransmitter changes and it becomes


---------111:32----------
a cannabinoid so endocannabinoids have


---------111:35----------
to do with actions related to habit


---------111:37----------
formation so once something becomes


---------111:39----------
habitual you don't enjoy it anymore but


---------111:41----------
you do it anyway right so if we think


---------111:43----------
about like a behavior everyone thinks


---------111:46----------
that behaviors are reinforced by


---------111:48----------
dopamine and pleasure circuitry because


---------111:49----------
by now gamers are pretty smart and


---------111:51----------
they're into neuroscience and they're


---------111:52----------
into drugs of you know so like the study


---------111:55----------
about the brain and the reading about


---------111:56----------
the brain everyone knows about dopamine


---------111:57----------
what people don't know is that if you


---------111:59----------
think about a bit habit so if you think


---------112:01----------
about a habit like you don't enjoy the


---------112:02----------
things that you do habitually and the


---------112:05----------
reason for this why gaming's become less


---------112:07----------
fun yes because what happens is it


---------112:10----------
starts to engender


---------112:12----------
the the neurotransmitters involves or


---------112:14----------
cannabinoids which have to do with


---------112:15----------
habits and no longer have to do enjoy


---------112:17----------
with enjoyment so I think when you flood


---------112:19----------
your brain with cannabinoids now this is


---------112:21----------
my theory we don't really know so we


---------112:24----------
know that that marijuana reduces


---------112:25----------
motivation we know that marijuana is a


---------112:28----------
cannabinoid we know that there are some


---------112:29----------
circuits of the brain and I'm gonna have


---------112:31----------
to brush up on this and get back to you


---------112:32----------
guys because I'm a little bit rusty so


---------112:34----------
take this take what I say with a grain


---------112:35----------
of salt and we know that so we know the


---------112:37----------
neurotransmitters of cannabinoids and we


---------112:39----------
know that marijuana reduces motivation


---------112:43----------
so my hypothesis is that since you're


---------112:47----------
flooding your brain with cannabinoids


---------112:48----------
you're reinforcing a habit cycle around


---------112:53----------
whatever the marijuana behavior is which


---------112:55----------
generally speaking is not productive and


---------112:58----------
so my sense is that like cannabinoids


---------113:01----------
are not good because alright it's not


---------113:03----------
everything everything in medicine and


---------113:06----------
everything is what in your body has like


---------113:07----------
a benefit


---------113:08----------
risk analysis well in this situation


---------113:11----------
good for you you want people to be


---------113:13----------
motivated in whatever if someone wanted


---------113:15----------
to just you know chill yes forever yes


---------113:19----------
and that would be good for that yes yeah


---------113:22----------
I I be but I don't think yeah I mean I


---------113:24----------
don't think that would be good for them


---------113:25----------
because I think what they would be doing


---------113:26----------
is chilling and now this gets back to


---------113:28----------
the question should I use marijuana


---------113:29----------
before I meditate so let's think about


---------113:31----------
why someone would want to use marijuana


---------113:33----------
before they meditate chances are the


---------113:35----------
reason that marijuana before meditation


---------113:37----------
makes meditation way more productive


---------113:38----------
which it does for many of the people


---------113:40----------
that I've taught is that it quiets your


---------113:42----------
mind for you right so then what happens


---------113:45----------
is when you sit down to meditate you


---------113:47----------
feel like you have a more productive


---------113:48----------
meditation session because the marijuana


---------113:51----------
is reducing the activity of your mind


---------113:54----------
but if we think about it part of the


---------113:56----------
benefit of meditation is being able to


---------113:59----------
wrestle with your mind in its current


---------114:01----------
state so it's basically like what


---------114:03----------
marijuana does is it's like if you go to


---------114:05----------
the gym and you're trying to train your


---------114:07----------
attention and concentration and your


---------114:09----------
ability to follow through and I talked


---------114:11----------
about this last Sunday I are not last


---------114:14----------
Sunday but the last sunday stream I did


---------114:15----------
was all about tadhana


---------114:16----------
and tadhana is basically like why I


---------114:18----------
think people struggle to accomplish


---------114:20----------
their goals and it's it's not what's hot


---------114:24----------
ona means is focus and just as an


---------114:26----------
example so if I wake up on January first


---------114:29----------
2020 and I say I have a new year's


---------114:31----------
resolution and I'm gonna lose a hundred


---------114:34----------
pounds and if you stop and you look at


---------114:36----------
the mind in that moment their resolve is


---------114:40----------
a hundred percent it's not like


---------114:41----------
half-assed it's a hundred percent right


---------114:44----------
their passion for their goal is like


---------114:46----------
complete and pure and wonderful what


---------114:51----------
they're lacking is concentration of the


---------114:53----------
mind its focus because the next day then


---------114:56----------
the mind is a hundred percent towards


---------114:57----------
working out and the next day you're no


---------114:59----------
longer pointing in that direction you're


---------115:01----------
pointing in this direction so I think


---------115:03----------
what people think of is a lack of


---------115:05----------
willpower is not actually willpower it's


---------115:08----------
not the ability to overcome willpower is


---------115:11----------
the ability to like overcome your


---------115:12----------
internal impulses I think it's actually


---------115:14----------
a lack of focus so a human that the


---------115:17----------
average person does not get to choose


---------115:19----------
what direction their mind points so you


---------115:22----------
got


---------115:22----------
about your mind as a flower with you


---------115:24----------
there and so on January 1st rain the


---------115:26----------
rain the ability to focus it with


---------115:29----------
meditation yes so on January 1st my


---------115:32----------
flashlight is pointing towards weight


---------115:33----------
loss and on January 2nd I move my


---------115:35----------
flashlight to pictures of cats on


---------115:37----------
YouTube and the pattern uh is the


---------115:40----------
practice of training your mind to put


---------115:42----------
the flashlight where you want and so if


---------115:45----------
we think about meditation why do people


---------115:48----------
want to use marijuana with meditation


---------115:49----------
it's because it it's less trouble to


---------115:52----------
focus your flashlight which in turn


---------115:54----------
makes it easier to get to states of


---------115:56----------
Samadhi and people think about


---------115:57----------
productive meditation as states of


---------116:00----------
Samadhi right which is like the no mind


---------116:01----------
state or whatever so people think like


---------116:03----------
marijuana assists their meditation in a


---------116:06----------
sense it does because it is easier to


---------116:08----------
facilitate that but I think what you're


---------116:10----------
doing is you're missing out because


---------116:11----------
you're going to the gym and instead of


---------116:13----------
like lifting a 50-pound weight you're


---------116:16----------
taking all the weight off and you're


---------116:17----------
making it easy for you to do Carl's got


---------116:20----------
yeah so I don't think marijuana is is


---------116:22----------
good to use in terms of an assistive aid


---------116:25----------
for meditation but I fully understand


---------116:27----------
why people do it because people don't


---------116:29----------
understand that you know meditation is a


---------116:32----------
lot of different stuff and it's not just


---------116:34----------
getting to the state of no-mind and


---------116:36----------
blissed-out that that's not all that


---------116:38----------
meditation is for there are a lot of


---------116:39----------
other benefits of meditation yeah


---------116:42----------
another thing marijuana also helps you


---------116:46----------
fall asleep but I think it's the same


---------116:48----------
thing it's just you can use the same


---------116:49----------
analogy it's you're getting worse sleep


---------116:52----------
when you you sleep after we die don't


---------116:56----------
think you get to REM as often i watch


---------116:58----------
the Matthew Walker and some sleep expert


---------117:02----------
talk about it and it's it when you're


---------117:06----------
trying to sleep from wheat with weed


---------117:08----------
kind of feel like it's very difficult


---------117:10----------
for a talker when trying to sleep with


---------117:11----------
weed it's also like you're taking all


---------117:12----------
the weights off at the gym and just


---------117:13----------
falling asleep but yeah you're not


---------117:15----------
getting good sleep you like my mind's a


---------117:20----------
little exhausted yeah - - so I'm gonna


---------117:23----------
do - yeah questions yeah I have a before


---------117:28----------
anyone forgets uh-uh


---------117:29----------
you guys should follow him yeah so he's


---------117:33----------
he


---------117:34----------
that healthy gamer GG it's here I


---------117:36----------
actually think you should rebrand this a


---------117:40----------
little and have like a picture of


---------117:41----------
yourself somewhere yeah at least people


---------117:43----------
have told me that maybe maybe your name


---------117:45----------

---------117:46----------
think maybe your name because you


---------117:48----------
already have healthy gamer GG once and


---------117:50----------
now it's twice I think maybe your name


---------117:51----------
would be better like dr. kono ji all


---------117:53----------

---------117:54----------
how do you pronounce your last name Cano


---------117:56----------

---------118:16----------
that cuz I opened his twitch stream and


---------118:19----------

---------118:23----------

---------119:01----------
[Laughter]


---------119:02----------
TV slash reckful right yeah you got it


---------119:05----------

---------119:13----------
didn't know what your actual name on on


---------119:15----------
twitch was right cuz like a lot yeah


---------119:19----------
like cuz I know your reckful cuz I mean


---------119:21----------
I remember watching your PvP videos from


---------119:23----------
a decade ago which by the way or still


---------119:26----------
taken down from YouTube I know I saw I


---------119:28----------
looked at your YouTube channel yeah


---------119:29----------
that's all I told I told so I was on it


---------119:32----------
wasn't on my channel the video you've


---------119:34----------
seen I guess reckful 3 is probably the


---------119:35----------
one you saw is 5 million views yeah


---------119:37----------
yes it wasn't on my own channel it was


---------119:40----------
on a small channel with like 20k subs


---------119:43----------
called complexity gaming it's my sponsor


---------119:45----------
at the time but they apparently got


---------119:48----------
dude for some intro they used some


---------119:51----------
sounds of something on there so and it


---------119:53----------
was cool dealing with yeah it'll be back


---------119:56----------
up something can we just do two or three


---------119:58----------
more questions yes you do it okay so


---------120:02----------
people are saying that why do yo keys


---------120:04----------
and India smoke cannabis regularly and


---------120:06----------
religiously so this is a great question


---------120:08----------
so not all Yogi's in fact I'd say the a


---------120:12----------
very small minority of Yogi's use


---------120:14----------
cannabis and it is used as part of their


---------120:16----------
spiritual practice so the Yogi's who use


---------120:19----------
cannabis are part of a kind of tradition


---------120:23----------
called aghori sadhana Gor means fear ah


---------120:27----------
Gor means without fear so they do things


---------120:31----------
they live what they basically do so this


---------120:33----------
is actually a great question because we


---------120:34----------
were talking earlier about how that


---------120:36----------
experience is just an experience and it


---------120:38----------
isn't like good or bad and good or bad


---------120:41----------
is what we attribute to it so the goal


---------120:43----------
of their sadhana is to do practices that


---------120:46----------
normally engender fear and to do them


---------120:49----------
with tranquility so the the the Gauri


---------120:52----------
Baba's who are also apparently really


---------120:54----------
good at giving boons and cursing people


---------120:56----------
so they do use marijuana sometimes


---------121:00----------
they're like Himalayan Yogi's that use


---------121:01----------
marijuana as well but I think most of


---------121:03----------
the pictures that people see are often


---------121:05----------
times of naked Yogi's who are covered in


---------121:08----------
ash and are smoking pot and are unclean


---------121:13----------
so these people live in cemeteries they


---------121:17----------
coat themselves with the ash from


---------121:19----------
cremated bodies and they also do things


---------121:22----------
like eat meat drink alcohol and


---------121:24----------
sometimes practise cannibalism so like


---------121:27----------
there in the reason that they engage in


---------121:29----------
all of these things is to like do these


---------121:31----------
practices with like complete tranquility


---------121:34----------
of mind and it's kind of like stepping


---------121:36----------
and auction so stepping in dog [ __ ] is


---------121:38----------
my like version of a gory sadhana the


---------121:43----------
other thing about a gory sadhana is it


---------121:45----------
is recommended by a guru for a


---------121:46----------
particular period of time so you don't


---------121:48----------
you're you're not a Nagori you don't


---------121:51----------
become an Agora sod that and I could be


---------121:52----------
wrong about this just based on my


---------121:54----------
exploration let's do it for a small


---------121:56----------
amount of time yeah not a small amount


---------121:57----------
I'm usually a decade so they're they're


---------121:59----------
like lifelong Oh


---------122:01----------
so they like they'll spend 23 years


---------122:03----------
doing like regular practice right at the


---------122:05----------
age of 40 they go and they live in a


---------122:08----------
cemetery for about a decade and smoke a


---------122:09----------
bunch of pot and then they come back and


---------122:11----------
then they give up on again okay yeah


---------122:16----------
just NBD ten years of eating people so I


---------122:22----------
I don't think that generally speaking


---------122:24----------
Yogi's use Janice which is marijuana


---------122:27----------
regularly okay so if I if I wanted to


---------122:32----------
watch you step in dog [ __ ] you'd say yes


---------122:35----------
sure that'll do okay awesome adoption is


---------122:44----------
that something people are interested in


---------122:45----------
seeing no yeah where do you where do you


---------122:47----------
draw the line so you won't eat people I


---------122:49----------
assume that's correct yeah


---------122:53----------
what would you do that they do I mean I


---------122:58----------
drink alcohol and I eat meat but I don't


---------123:01----------
I don't do it as part of my sadhna I


---------123:03----------
just do it because I you know enjoy it


---------123:05----------
from time to time so I'm not interested


---------123:07----------
in doing it gory sadhana that's not my


---------123:09----------
path my path I decided I would go for


---------123:11----------
tea sad that I was something ever


---------123:12----------
happened to my wife and kids and like


---------123:14----------
all of my material attachments were gone


---------123:16----------
I'd probably I'll become a monk again


---------123:18----------
and their Gauri is not gonna maybe a


---------123:19----------
part of that but see but yeah can I do


---------123:27----------
one more question reckful this one's


---------123:28----------
kind of about you know of course I'm


---------123:30----------
enjoying this listening do you think


---------123:31----------
reckful is looking for an easy way out


---------123:33----------
of his depression if so do you think


---------123:35----------
that his approach to his depression


---------123:37----------
ultimately leading to the route if so do


---------123:41----------
you think that is his approach to his


---------123:43----------
depression ultimately leading to the


---------123:45----------
route of his depression I understand


---------123:47----------
okay


---------123:47----------
so I think the question is do you think


---------123:49----------
reckful is looking for an easy way out


---------123:51----------
of his depression and do you think that


---------123:53----------
looking for an easy way out of your


---------123:56----------
depression is the root of why you're


---------123:58----------
depressed that's what I think the


---------124:01----------
question is I hope it's a no what do you


---------124:05----------
think do you think you're looking for an


---------124:07----------
easy solution to your depression I was


---------124:09----------
looking for any solution so that part


---------124:10----------
he's right but it's not the reason I'm


---------124:12----------
depressed I was depressed to start with


---------124:13----------
you


---------124:14----------
so I don't think that you're looking for


---------124:17----------
an easy solution in fact even though


---------124:19----------
this solution feels good and remember


---------124:20----------
boys and girls were not treating or


---------124:22----------
diagnosing any medical illness I think


---------124:25----------
that what you're doing would you


---------124:28----------
describe this as easy no I mean I've


---------124:34----------
[ __ ] cry my eyes out yeah so I think


---------124:37----------
like people need to remember that right


---------124:38----------
like so what reckful is doing requires


---------124:41----------
just gigantic


---------124:43----------
balls of steel like it's not easy I have


---------124:46----------
really big balls yeah are they made of


---------124:49----------
steel blows the question I hope so I'll


---------124:52----------
have to pound hate them in a non-medical


---------124:54----------
way when we meet an instrument we're


---------125:01----------
just gonna kill him right now but okay


---------125:03----------
so what here's what I think is going on


---------125:05----------
with ruffle I don't think that there's


---------125:06----------
an easy solution to his depression and I


---------125:08----------
think that what he's doing is hard not


---------125:11----------
just because he's doing it publicly


---------125:12----------
doing it publicly sure is hard but I


---------125:14----------
think the really hard thing and what is


---------125:17----------
really amazing and what I respect and


---------125:19----------
why I'm invested in continuing to work


---------125:20----------
with you is because you're grappling


---------125:23----------
with the things that are difficult to


---------125:24----------
grapple with right like you're zoning in


---------125:27----------
to the raid and you know that there's


---------125:31----------
like a gigantic raid boss on the other


---------125:33----------
side and you're zoning in and I don't


---------125:34----------
think that like yeah I've always wanted


---------125:36----------
to be challenged in that way yeah and


---------125:39----------
when I play games I try to do the


---------125:41----------
hardest thing in the game and I try to


---------125:42----------
beat it right and I think so I'll try to


---------125:44----------
do that with my own life absolutely and


---------125:46----------
so I think that what you're trying to do


---------125:47----------
is not easy in fact it's hard it's very


---------125:50----------
hard so grappling with like the dark


---------125:52----------
parts of ourself grappling with that


---------125:54----------
inner thing that you know is painful and


---------125:56----------
difficult because it's safe right like


---------125:58----------
it's it's safe to actually just continue


---------126:00----------
to be depressed and you psilocybin and


---------126:02----------
kind of like hang out and but but


---------126:05----------
actually like dealing with your feelings


---------126:07----------
and facing your feelings and talking


---------126:09----------
about your loss and also like talking


---------126:11----------
about their they're like undertones of


---------126:12----------
stuff that we haven't even explicitly


---------126:14----------
talked about which is like what is the


---------126:16----------
conversation that you're gonna have with


---------126:17----------
your family because that's gonna have to


---------126:18----------
happen at some point yeah my one


---------126:21----------
disagreement with what you said is it's


---------126:23----------
safe to continue just being depressed


---------126:25----------
and yeah


---------126:26----------
you hadda doing psilocybin to the list


---------126:28----------
yeah there's this feeling where you can


---------126:31----------
just stay in bed over and over day after


---------126:34----------
day and just watch a show and only get


---------126:37----------
up to pee and just do it or we'll just


---------126:38----------
watch twit should just do it


---------126:40----------
mmm a month in a row you know and you


---------126:42----------
just like can't get out of this you just


---------126:45----------
do it over and over but I disagree that


---------126:47----------
it's you can't you can't it's not


---------126:50----------
possible to do suicide but in that


---------126:52----------
situation and then not get yourself out


---------126:54----------
of it


---------126:54----------
cool from my experience for me it


---------126:59----------
wouldn't it be possible it's not the


---------127:00----------
same for everyone


---------127:01----------
yeah for Greek it wouldn't be possible


---------127:03----------
either and for any of my other friends


---------127:05----------
we've tried it it's now like 20 or so


---------127:10----------
people so 20 years money would not be


---------127:12----------
possible to just stay in bed and be


---------127:15----------
depressed okay cool that's Mike yeah so


---------127:18----------
I don't think it's an easy you need a


---------127:19----------
clinical trial of a couple thousand


---------127:22----------
people would be great I mean and I don't


---------127:26----------
think that his depression is ultimately


---------127:27----------
due to you know him trying to look for


---------127:30----------
easy outs for his depression I don't


---------127:31----------
think so at all I mean I don't even know


---------127:34----------
that what we're talking about is even


---------127:35----------
truly been depression because anyway but


---------127:38----------
I think you've definitely got a some


---------127:40----------
scar so you have some kind of a lot of


---------127:43----------
pent up emotions around you know the


---------127:46----------
loss of your brother and and the zombie


---------127:49----------
on the inside and stuff like that so


---------127:52----------
anyway okay so let's meditate and then


---------127:57----------
we'll wrap up for the day you said I


---------128:00----------
shouldn't meditate when I'm sick yeah so


---------128:01----------
you can meditate I'm gonna try to do a


---------128:03----------
meditation that has no breathing though


---------128:05----------
so it's not a breath oriented meditation


---------128:08----------
okay or at least let me think about that


---------128:10----------
how can I do a non breathing meditation


---------128:13----------
what am I gonna do okay we're gonna do


---------128:18----------
that we did this one a couple weeks ago


---------128:19----------
what we're gonna do this one again it's


---------128:21----------

supportive finger there that it's giving


---------129:26----------
so normally I mean you guys at home


---------129:29----------
don't have to use these two fingers


---------129:30----------
because this is the middle one is the


---------129:32----------
operative one so the main thing is that


---------129:34----------
the middle one is out and what I want


---------129:36----------
you middle there needs to be up yeah so


---------129:38----------
there's a spot that's like just right


---------129:40----------
above your eyebrows and in the middle of


---------129:43----------
your forehead and I want you to just


---------129:45----------
hover don't touch no touching hover


---------129:48----------
hover your finger you're wiped just just


---------129:53----------
like a centimeter away from your


---------129:56----------
forehead so just that spot but don't


---------129:58----------
touch


---------129:58----------
yeah so you guys just find that spot


---------130:02----------
okay a little bit hot little bit higher


---------130:04----------
reckful a little bit higher yeah a


---------130:07----------
little bit lower me you see from the Sun


---------130:09----------
yeah I can see from the front okay so I


---------130:11----------
want you guys to just train yourself to


---------130:14----------
do that okay but you don't want to touch


---------130:16----------
now put your hand down so now what we're


---------130:18----------
gonna do put your hand down now what


---------130:21----------
we're gonna do I want you guys to just


---------130:22----------
remember that because I'm gonna ask you


---------130:23----------
to put your finger over your third eye


---------130:25----------
in a second we're gonna do some deep


---------130:28----------
relaxing breathing first and then we're


---------130:31----------
going to do the the third eye thing and


---------130:36----------
then so what I mean by that is like so


---------130:39----------
put your finger over your third eye so


---------130:40----------
I'll ask you to do that and then we're


---------130:42----------
going to stop the


---------130:45----------
so I'm gonna ring the bell to signal the


---------130:47----------
start of the practice and ring the bell


---------130:48----------
to signal the end of the practice and at


---------130:51----------
the end of the practice you should open


---------130:52----------
your eyes okay so go ahead and close


---------130:55----------
your eyes right now when the bell rings


---------130:55----------
close your eyes okay now what I want you


---------131:00----------
to do is take a deep breath in and out


---------131:11----------
in


---------131:17----------
out in out


---------131:35----------
good now continue breathing slowly and


---------131:38----------
feel the straightness of your spine and


---------131:43----------
with each breath in feel your body


---------131:46----------
expand your shoulders expand your chest


---------131:49----------
expand and with each exhalation let your


---------131:54----------
body relax


---------131:59----------
so I want you to envision your spine


---------132:01----------
like a pole and your body is like


---------132:07----------
clothing that's hanging on the pole and


---------132:10----------
with each relaxation with each


---------132:12----------
exhalation let your body sort of hang


---------132:16----------
off of the pole


---------132:18----------
but the poll should remain straight Paul


---------132:23----------
acknowledges


---------132:28----------
you


---------132:33----------
you


---------132:38----------
and I want you to take a moment to hear


---------132:41----------
the sound of your breath


---------132:54----------
you


---------132:57----------
you


---------133:01----------
and now place your finger on your third


---------133:04----------
eye


---------133:04----------
remember not to touch keep it like a


---------133:08----------
centimeter or two away ideally not


---------133:12----------
touching hair or any skin


---------133:20----------
and focus on the sensation of your


---------133:24----------
forehead


---------133:28----------
you


---------133:30----------
you


---------133:37----------
focus on that point on your forehead


---------133:44----------
try your best not to think about what


---------133:47----------
you're doing or what's happening you


---------133:48----------
just focus on the sensation keep your


---------133:51----------
arm there


---------133:53----------
you


---------133:56----------
we'll practice for a bit


---------133:59----------
about two minutes


---------134:01----------
you


---------134:04----------
you


---------134:15----------
direct all of your attention towards


---------134:18----------
that point


---------134:21----------
you


---------134:24----------
you


---------134:44----------
and now let your hand come down and


---------134:46----------
relax and continue to focus your


---------134:49----------
attention on your third eye direct your


---------134:53----------
concentration into it you may notice


---------135:00----------
some residual feeling just feel what it


---------135:09----------

---------135:58----------

---------137:08----------

---------137:11----------

---------137:13----------
Friday after work feel renewed actually


---------137:21----------
calmed me down I leveled up that weird


---------137:26----------
headache for a moment okay so not all


---------137:30----------
techniques work for all people some


---------137:32----------
people in my chat so one person


---------137:34----------
described it when I you know when I did


---------137:35----------
this when the stream was relatively


---------137:37----------
small and I could actually read the


---------137:38----------
messages one person described it as


---------137:40----------
charging a laser beam does that make


---------137:41----------
sense to anyone so people are just


---------137:47----------
saying weirdest feeling I've ever had


---------137:48----------
some feeling some people are saying yes


---------137:51----------
some people are saying no some people


---------137:53----------
are saying kinda


---------137:55----------
and so some people experience something


---------137:57----------
like a tingling sensation which is fine


---------137:59----------
and if you don't feel any of those


---------138:01----------
things that's fine too don't worry about


---------138:02----------
it there are a hundred and twelve


---------138:08----------
different techniques of meditation one


---------138:10----------
of which each supposedly is going to be


---------138:13----------
like natural and give people sort of an


---------138:15----------
easy access to Samadhi which is a


---------138:17----------
spiritual experience and so if this is


---------138:20----------
not the one that works for you that's


---------138:21----------
okay it doesn't mean that you're doing


---------138:22----------
anything wrong it's just different


---------138:24----------
things work for different people and so


---------138:29----------
if you did experience a sensation I


---------138:30----------
would say that this is a good technique


---------138:32----------
to practice so do it at home do it for a


---------138:35----------
few minutes at a time


---------138:36----------
you okay reckful yeah okay


---------138:40----------
