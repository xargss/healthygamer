---------00:00----------
can you guys believe that this account


---------00:01----------
is a throwaway that was made in the


---------00:02----------
1700s


---------00:04----------
wow so i forgot how to socialize titled


---------00:07----------
pretty much says it all the most


---------00:09----------
i usually do in a friendly conversation


---------00:12----------
is an occasional quip and most of the


---------00:14----------
time i sit on the sidelines watching


---------00:15----------
everyone else do what they do


---------00:17----------
my brain simply goes blank when i have


---------00:20----------
to consider how to express myself


---------00:23----------
i don't even know what chatting with


---------00:24----------
people means i'm on the spectrum so it's


---------00:27----------
probably some innate some parts innate


---------00:29----------
disadvantage in some parts in experience


---------00:32----------
from what i could gather i have some


---------00:34----------
sort of fear of getting in other


---------00:36----------
people's way or not having anything to


---------00:38----------
contribute or otherwise cannot tell how


---------00:40----------
they will react


---------00:41----------
there's also this sense of feeling like


---------00:43----------
they will have to accommodate me in my


---------00:44----------
strangeness as well as that of having


---------00:47----------
rest some resting [ __ ] face and a


---------00:49----------
tendency to glare


---------00:51----------
i do find as long as all parties have


---------00:53----------
some well-defined role in the


---------00:55----------
interaction eg cashier or customer and


---------00:58----------
in fact have some semblance of willpower


---------00:59----------
when troubling other people is not a


---------01:02----------
significant risk


---------01:04----------
honestly speaking i don't know where to


---------01:05----------
begin from here aside from tackling it


---------01:07----------
head-on by forcing myself into random


---------01:09----------
conversations wherever i feel like it


---------01:11----------
there should be some way to at least


---------01:12----------
make that process less jarring


---------01:14----------
so porn throwaway i certainly hope we


---------01:16----------
can make this process less jarring from


---------01:18----------
you for you


---------01:19----------
so what we're going to do


---------01:21----------
in order to make it instead of just


---------01:22----------
saying forcing yourself into random


---------01:23----------
conversations


---------01:25----------
we're going to start by understanding


---------01:29----------
why it's difficult for you to socialize


---------01:31----------
understand what's going on in your brain


---------01:33----------
that makes it come up with a blank


---------01:35----------
because here's the problem right like


---------01:37----------
when you try to socialize


---------01:38----------
your brain draws a blink


---------01:41----------
and so it becomes really really hard to


---------01:42----------
socialize if your brain is drawing a


---------01:44----------
blank so let's start by understanding


---------01:46----------
how does your brain draw blank where


---------01:47----------
does that blank come from why is it


---------01:49----------
coming up link and if we can understand


---------01:51----------
how it draws a blank and then we can


---------01:53----------
understand how to change that so it no


---------01:55----------
longer comes up blank then the process


---------01:57----------
should be a lot easier for you and you


---------01:59----------
won't have to force yourself into stuff


---------02:01----------
okay


---------02:03----------
so let's start by understanding a little


---------02:05----------
bit about how brains draw blinks


---------02:08----------
so


---------02:10----------
when i set a task


---------02:12----------
my brain tends to come up with how to


---------02:15----------
accomplish it right so if i say


---------02:17----------
man i'm really thirsty i don't need to


---------02:19----------
say that i think i'm really thirsty and


---------02:21----------
then my brain is like oh there's a water


---------02:22----------
cup here


---------02:26----------
problem solved right so our brain when


---------02:29----------
we set a task


---------02:31----------
our brain will operationalize that task


---------02:34----------
so the term opera opera


---------02:37----------
operate


---------02:39----------
operationalizing


---------02:41----------
is the process of breaking apart


---------02:45----------
one large task into its individual


---------02:48----------
components it's the execution component


---------02:51----------
okay


---------02:54----------
so


---------02:56----------
i'll give you all an example so if i you


---------02:59----------
know i have a six-year-old and a


---------03:00----------
four-year-old and their brain's ability


---------03:03----------
to operationalize tasks is like


---------03:06----------
different so i can tell my six-year-old


---------03:08----------
go pack a bag for the weekend and she


---------03:10----------
can like take that complex task


---------03:13----------
and if i tell her what like if i give


---------03:15----------
her the goal her brain will tell her


---------03:18----------
what to do so the brain is like okay i


---------03:20----------
have to go get clothing i have to go


---------03:21----------
grab my toothbrush i need to go get


---------03:23----------
something to read i need to go get this


---------03:25----------
i need to get toys so the brain will


---------03:27----------
like execute and won't come up blank


---------03:30----------
if i tell my four-year-old go pack a bag


---------03:32----------
for the weekend her brain is gonna be


---------03:34----------
like


---------03:35----------
i don't know what that is like


---------03:37----------
if i break it down for her she can


---------03:39----------
understand it


---------03:40----------
but she can't operationalize the task


---------03:43----------
she can't like break it apart okay


---------03:46----------
so if you're drawing a blank in


---------03:49----------
in social situations the problem is that


---------03:51----------
the goal that you have your brain


---------03:53----------
doesn't know how to get there


---------03:55----------
which in turn leaves two solutions one


---------03:57----------
is we can try to operationalize towards


---------04:00----------
the goal or or


---------04:03----------
what i think is going to be simpler


---------04:05----------
is we can change the goal in our mind so


---------04:07----------
that the brain can follow suit with like


---------04:09----------
what it's supposed to do


---------04:11----------
okay


---------04:12----------
so for example


---------04:14----------
humanity in general is becoming less


---------04:17----------
able to operationalize so if we look at


---------04:19----------
society and especially how our brain


---------04:21----------
functions


---------04:22----------
more stuff is being done for us so this


---------04:25----------
is absolutely true for gamers so if you


---------04:27----------
look at video games they're very good at


---------04:29----------
like close-ended problem solving


---------04:31----------
so the game will give you the goal and


---------04:34----------
will give you the pieces for the goal


---------04:35----------
and will allow you to assemble them to


---------04:37----------
get there so a good example of this is a


---------04:39----------
puzzle in a video game a puzzle in a


---------04:41----------
video game has a set solution and all


---------04:42----------
the pieces are given to you you just


---------04:44----------
have to like put them together in the


---------04:45----------
right way


---------04:46----------
the problem is that like so games will


---------04:48----------
also give you like you know like markers


---------04:50----------
right so they'll be like okay go here


---------04:51----------
and talk to this person first then go


---------04:53----------
there and talk to their it like lays


---------04:54----------
everything out for you you never have to


---------04:56----------
figure out what to do


---------04:58----------
whereas like if you look at life it's


---------05:00----------
like


---------05:01----------
how many jobs should i apply for like


---------05:03----------
how many applications should i figure


---------05:05----------
out i don't know


---------05:06----------
like in an mmo it's like fill out 10


---------05:08----------
applications like go deliver these 10


---------05:10----------
applications these 10 people like go do


---------05:12----------
this fetch quest it breaks everything


---------05:13----------
apart for you and it's not just games


---------05:15----------
right it's also things like technology


---------05:17----------
so


---------05:18----------
you know when i log into netflix or i


---------05:19----------
load up youtube like i don't even have


---------05:21----------
to figure out what to watch


---------05:23----------
like youtube will tell me what to watch


---------05:25----------
it'll be like hey what do you feel like


---------05:26----------
right now here's this list of choices


---------05:28----------
what do you want to learn about today


---------05:30----------
i don't have to like decide for myself


---------05:32----------
what i want to learn about i'm just


---------05:34----------
going to log into reddit or i'm going to


---------05:36----------
log into youtube and it's going to do


---------05:37----------
all that work for me


---------05:39----------
so the process of like


---------05:41----------
breaking apart a problem and doing


---------05:43----------
open-ended problem solving like if i'm


---------05:45----------
trying to figure out what to major in


---------05:48----------
even that is like narrow right because


---------05:50----------
the college provides me with majors


---------05:52----------
on a broader level it's like what do i


---------05:54----------
do with my life like no one knows how to


---------05:56----------
answer that question because as a


---------05:58----------
society we are having things broken down


---------06:00----------
into choices for us it's all multiple


---------06:02----------
choice there's no like free answer


---------06:04----------
anymore right it's like what are you


---------06:05----------
going to major in are you going to go


---------06:06----------
into college or you can go to trade


---------06:07----------
school you're going to do this you


---------06:08----------
become a crypto bro like what are you


---------06:10----------
doing


---------06:11----------
so as our brain


---------06:13----------
has had to do less abstract open-ended


---------06:16----------
problem solving because literally most


---------06:18----------
of the time it is like


---------06:21----------
being prompted to react to stuff


---------06:24----------
like these kinds of things happen where


---------06:26----------
our brain doesn't know like what am i


---------06:28----------
supposed to do in a social interaction


---------06:29----------
it's like what what are what are the


---------06:31----------
goals of the social interaction like i'm


---------06:33----------
confused like where's the quest marker


---------06:35----------
what am i supposed to do like i need


---------06:37----------
someone to explain this to me and we can


---------06:39----------
even see that this person clearly is


---------06:41----------
this way because look look at this


---------06:44----------
i do find as


---------06:46----------
as long as all parties have some


---------06:48----------
well-defined role in the interaction the


---------06:50----------
quest has been given to me


---------06:54----------
your quest is to go and purchase a bell


---------06:56----------
pepper very good i can do that i know


---------06:59----------
what the goal is i know exactly how to


---------07:01----------
interact i'm going to go and present


---------07:02----------
them to the hand the cashier the bell


---------07:04----------
pepper


---------07:04----------
they will ring up the bell pepper i


---------07:06----------
shall pull out the wallet


---------07:07----------
i shall give them the money i shall take


---------07:09----------
the bell pepper i shall say thank you i


---------07:11----------
shall smile and i shall move on with my


---------07:13----------
day success quest completed gain 300 xp


---------07:16----------
so we can see that this person does fine


---------07:18----------
as long as there are bounds to the


---------07:20----------
conversation


---------07:22----------
right but i don't even know what


---------07:23----------
chatting


---------07:25----------
what chatting with people means


---------07:27----------
it's like so this is a situation where


---------07:29----------
we have forgotten how to socialize


---------07:31----------
because chatting is a sandbox game it's


---------07:34----------
like what's the point there's no quest


---------07:35----------
marker like i don't understand


---------07:37----------
chatting is a sandbox game


---------07:39----------
like what's the point there isn't a


---------07:40----------
point and now your brain gets super


---------07:42----------
confused it's like how do i how do i


---------07:45----------
operationalize how do i get from point a


---------07:47----------
to point z and there there is no point z


---------07:49----------
there's just like i don't understand


---------07:50----------
where i'm supposed to go and then the


---------07:52----------
brain draws up blank


---------07:53----------
doesn't mean you're dumb or anything on


---------07:55----------
the contrary it's it's a it's a huge


---------07:57----------
problem where people are like forgetting


---------07:59----------
how to socially interact because we're


---------08:01----------
so many everything is a multiple choice


---------08:03----------
so even like tinder right like i forget


---------08:05----------
how to talk to people if i use tinder


---------08:07----------
and we see it on tinder by the way


---------08:10----------
right where it's like now the app is


---------08:11----------
just gonna give me people and i have to


---------08:13----------
swipe right or swipe left


---------08:15----------
i never have to approach anyone and then


---------08:16----------
they will send me a text and i will


---------08:18----------
respond and it's like everything is


---------08:19----------
being done for us so social we're


---------08:21----------
forgetting how to socialize


---------08:24----------
so


---------08:25----------
this is where if you're in this


---------08:26----------
situation the main thing that you really


---------08:28----------
need to do


---------08:30----------
is understand what the goal of the


---------08:32----------
interaction is right so we're going to


---------08:34----------
talk a little bit about this


---------08:35----------
so when you're chatting with someone


---------08:37----------
this is the goal


---------08:39----------
it's a brief opportunity to get to know


---------08:41----------
the other person


---------08:43----------
okay this is the way that i want you to


---------08:44----------
think about it this is just a chance for


---------08:46----------
you to figure out is this someone that i


---------08:48----------
want to interact with in the future or


---------08:49----------
not that should be goal number one and


---------08:51----------
so then your brain will be like okay


---------08:52----------
well how do i figure that out well it's


---------08:53----------
like maybe ask them some questions about


---------08:55----------
themselves


---------08:56----------
so you know you introduce yourself and


---------08:58----------
then you're like hey can you tell me a


---------08:59----------
little bit about yours i mean that's a


---------09:00----------
hard question to answer


---------09:01----------
but you can say like you know what are


---------09:03----------
you excited for in 2022 that's a great


---------09:06----------
like


---------09:06----------
opener what are you worried about in


---------09:08----------
2022


---------09:10----------
right you can even go like you don't


---------09:12----------
even have to ask a question


---------09:14----------
you can even say like some neutral


---------09:15----------
response like man i can't believe it's


---------09:17----------
20 22. it's crazy the other person could


---------09:19----------
be like yeah it's crazy


---------09:21----------
it's like so what what are you you know


---------09:22----------
what's 2022 looking like for you


---------09:25----------
so you can just like


---------09:27----------
just start to ask a couple of questions


---------09:29----------
and remember the goal is just to figure


---------09:30----------
out like do i want to hang out with this


---------09:31----------
person ever again


---------09:34----------
second thing is to think a little bit


---------09:36----------
about your goal


---------09:38----------
yourself in the interaction so this is


---------09:40----------
where it's an opportunity to share a


---------09:42----------
little bit about yourself that's the


---------09:44----------
purpose of chatting it's not like you're


---------09:46----------
not trying to get this person to like


---------09:47----------
you it's to just share a little bit


---------09:49----------
about yourself right so man i can't


---------09:51----------
believe it's like 20 22 it's nuts


---------09:53----------
they're like yeah man it's nuts i'm like


---------09:54----------
yeah i've got like


---------09:56----------
you won't believe like towards the end


---------09:57----------
of 2021 i made this post about gender


---------09:59----------
dynamics and like a ton of people that i


---------10:02----------
you know like hanging out with


---------10:04----------
went nuts and so now i'm trying to


---------10:06----------
figure out like what to do with that


---------10:08----------
so you kind of you kind of just share


---------10:10----------
something about yourself right so like


---------10:12----------
you're it's an opportunity for for you


---------10:15----------
to share a piece of yourself


---------10:18----------
just don't share d's nuts


---------10:20----------
okay and then if you share something


---------10:22----------
like that you'll see what the other


---------10:23----------
person does so this is like the


---------10:25----------
socialization is about hitting the ball


---------10:27----------
across the net and then you'll see what


---------10:28----------
they hit back


---------10:30----------
okay so it's an opportunity to get to


---------10:33----------
know someone and it's an opportunity to


---------10:35----------
share a piece of yourself


---------10:36----------
and the main thing to understand about


---------10:38----------
these brief social interactions is that


---------10:40----------
they're brief that nothing has to come


---------10:42----------
out of them if you understand how to


---------10:43----------
chat like nothing has to come out of


---------10:45----------
this understand that this person is


---------10:47----------
going to be alive for the next 50 or 60


---------10:48----------
years


---------10:50----------
just assume that for a moment that


---------10:52----------
you're going to be alive for the next 50


---------10:53----------
or 60 years


---------10:54----------
in the grand scheme of things you have


---------10:56----------
one moment in time where the two of you


---------10:58----------
are together and you have an opportunity


---------11:00----------
to exchange something which could turn


---------11:02----------
into a second conversation or friends or


---------11:05----------
whatever


---------11:06----------
but at the end of the day like if you


---------11:09----------
say something wrong like that's not that


---------11:10----------
big of a deal it's not like you've


---------11:12----------
ruined this person's life they're going


---------11:13----------
to go on and live their life you're


---------11:15----------
going to go on and live your life and at


---------11:16----------
the end of the day this is just a brief


---------11:18----------
chance meeting


---------11:20----------
right


---------11:21----------
it's like


---------11:23----------
if i walk outside and i look at a tree


---------11:25----------
this is a brief interaction between me


---------11:28----------
and the tree the tree doesn't really


---------11:29----------
care that i appreciate it or don't


---------11:31----------
appreciate it i don't really care that


---------11:33----------
the tree appreciates me or doesn't


---------11:34----------
appreciate me we're just in each other's


---------11:36----------
presence we're just going to kind of


---------11:37----------
chill for a little bit together and then


---------11:39----------
we're going to go our separate ways


---------11:41----------
so when it comes to chatting it's just


---------11:42----------
an opportunity to


---------11:44----------
have your life


---------11:47----------
very very gently intersect with someone


---------11:49----------
else's life and something could come out


---------11:51----------
of that meeting or nothing the high


---------11:53----------
likelihood is nothing is going to come


---------11:55----------
out of the meeting which is totally fine


---------11:56----------
and that's what life is it's a string of


---------11:59----------
experiences that have no real


---------12:01----------
consequences


---------12:02----------
right that's what the majority of life


---------12:04----------
is every time i take a breath


---------12:06----------
it's not going to transform the world


---------12:09----------
every time i take a walk around my house


---------12:10----------
it's not going to transform the world


---------12:12----------
every time i meet another human being


---------12:14----------
i'm not going to transform their life


---------12:15----------
they're not going to transform mine


---------12:17----------
it's just a tiny little opportunity for


---------12:19----------
you to get to know someone else and for


---------12:21----------
you to share a little bit about yourself


---------12:23----------
that's all it is


---------12:25----------
and once you begin to realize that it


---------12:27----------
actually doesn't matter what happens


---------12:29----------
today like it doesn't i'm not going to


---------12:30----------
ruin this person's life i'm not going to


---------12:33----------
save their life they're not going to


---------12:35----------
ruin my life they're not going to save


---------12:36----------
my life you can sort of be a little bit


---------12:38----------
relaxed right so what's the purpose of a


---------12:39----------
sandbox game


---------12:40----------
is to build something cool it's like a


---------12:42----------
multiplayer sandbox game where it's like


---------12:44----------
i'm going to put some stuff together and


---------12:45----------
like i'll see if you want to put some


---------12:46----------
similar stuff together


---------12:48----------
and if you want to build a hot and i


---------12:50----------
want to build a car like you're building


---------12:51----------
your hut and i'm going to build my car


---------12:52----------
and i'm like that's okay


---------12:54----------
eventually what will happen if you


---------12:56----------
enter into sandbox games with enough


---------12:58----------
people is i will build a car and then


---------13:00----------
you will build a car too and then i'll


---------13:01----------
walk over it'll be like wow that's a


---------13:02----------
really cool car i never thought about


---------13:04----------
making the wheels purple i always


---------13:06----------
assumed i would make the wheels black


---------13:08----------
and the other person is like no no man


---------13:09----------
purple wheels are so much better than


---------13:10----------
black wheels i'll be like


---------13:12----------
cool


---------13:13----------
i never thought about that oh maybe i'll


---------13:14----------
make a red wheel i was like yeah that's


---------13:16----------
dope make a red wheel


---------13:18----------
and then suddenly like you have a friend


---------13:21----------
right


---------13:24----------
and so this is this is how social


---------13:26----------
interaction works


---------13:28----------
so if you're struggling to understand


---------13:29----------
social interaction


---------13:31----------
first thing to understand is that our


---------13:33----------
brain has been


---------13:35----------
sort of shaped


---------13:36----------
by


---------13:38----------
too much choice so instead of figuring


---------13:40----------
things out for ourselves whether it be


---------13:41----------
quest markers and video games or going


---------13:44----------
on to youtube or twitch and like it


---------13:46----------
tells you what to enjoy right even today


---------13:47----------
like you guys are showing up to this


---------13:49----------
lecture you're watching this video and


---------13:50----------
it's like you didn't decide hey this is


---------13:52----------
what i want to seek out you just like


---------13:54----------
showed up on youtube or on twitch or


---------13:56----------
whatever and dr k chose what they're


---------13:58----------
going to talk about so you're just given


---------13:59----------
the choice


---------14:00----------
and so social interaction can become


---------14:02----------
very very difficult because there's not


---------14:03----------
a clear choice to make there's not a


---------14:05----------
clear goal and so like your mind draws a


---------14:07----------
blank because the way that your mind


---------14:09----------
populates with thoughts is that it has a


---------14:11----------
particular target and then it figures


---------14:13----------
out how to get there so if i'm thirsty


---------14:15----------
i'm gonna drink some water


---------14:18----------
it has a goal and then it sets up the


---------14:20----------
steps so if your mind is drawing a blank


---------14:22----------
that means that you don't know what goal


---------14:23----------
to set


---------14:25----------
and so if you want a very simple goal to


---------14:26----------
set if you want to understand what's the


---------14:27----------
purpose of chatting


---------14:29----------
the purpose of chatting is to have an


---------14:31----------
opportunity to get a window into someone


---------14:33----------
else's life


---------14:34----------
get a window into their thought process


---------14:36----------
to learn a little bit about them and to


---------14:38----------
share a little bit about yourself


---------14:40----------
and out of the thousand people that


---------14:42----------
you're going to meet in the next three


---------14:44----------
years


---------14:45----------
a handful of those that'll turn into


---------14:47----------
something else but you don't need to


---------14:48----------
seek that out you don't need to look for


---------14:50----------
it you don't need to be tied to it it's


---------14:52----------
just an opportunity for you to you know


---------14:54----------
interact with another human being and if


---------14:56----------
nothing comes of it so be it


---------14:58----------
right


---------15:02----------
questions


---------15:04----------
ah so this is a great question


---------15:06----------
so high cardio is asking what if it's a


---------15:08----------
grill and by that i assume you mean girl


---------15:11----------
so i know this is going to be kind of


---------15:12----------
mind-blowing


---------15:14----------
very difficult to understand


---------15:16----------
but the genitalia of the person that


---------15:18----------
you're talking to makes no difference


---------15:20----------
with how you should interact with them


---------15:25----------
i know it's shocking


---------15:27----------
that just because they have genitals


---------15:28----------
that are different from yours or maybe


---------15:30----------
they're the same and and you're in


---------15:32----------
you're lesbian who knows


---------15:33----------
assuming a heteronormative perspective


---------15:36----------
there but i don't know many lesbians


---------15:37----------
that refer to other women as grills


---------15:39----------
so maybe that's a safe assumption on my


---------15:41----------
part


---------15:42----------
makes no difference


---------15:44----------
shocking


---------15:46----------
that humans are humans


---------15:47----------
and the genitals don't matter


---------15:52----------
don't treat them differently


---------15:54----------
treat them like humans


---------15:56----------
they can like cars too just like get


---------15:58----------
into the sandbox game and build what you


---------16:00----------
want to build let them build what they


---------16:01----------
want to build


---------16:02----------
and interact with them as people


---------16:05----------
the genitalia does not need to define


---------16:07----------
the interaction


---------16:09----------
shocking i know


---------16:12----------
confusing i know


---------16:15----------
humans first i understand that some


---------16:17----------
people struggle with that that that's


---------16:19----------
that makes sense


---------16:20----------
but then the question is like where does


---------16:21----------
that struggle come from right so if you


---------16:23----------
have difficulty talking to


---------16:25----------
the opposite sex or girls or the sex


---------16:27----------
that you're attracted to however


---------16:30----------
where does that difficulty come from


---------16:32----------
that difficulty comes from


---------16:34----------
setting a goal that you don't know how


---------16:36----------
to execute right so now like i'm playing


---------16:38----------
a sandbox game or i'm playing let's say


---------16:40----------
skyrim


---------16:42----------
and


---------16:43----------
i'm given a quest of


---------16:45----------
you know mine a thousand minerals and a


---------16:47----------
thousand gas


---------16:49----------
and then i get super confused because


---------16:51----------
like i don't know how to accomplish that


---------16:52----------
in this game like it gets confusing for


---------16:54----------
me i don't know how to do this then i


---------16:56----------
get anxious


---------16:58----------
right because it's like so stop playing


---------17:00----------
that game like don't worry about and


---------17:02----------
don't have an expectation to the


---------17:03----------
interaction don't try to do something


---------17:05----------
because they're a girl like that's where


---------17:06----------
the problem is coming from the problem


---------17:08----------
is coming from the goal that you set for


---------17:10----------
yourself


---------17:11----------
the expectation that you set for


---------17:13----------
yourself


---------17:14----------
the demand that you put on yourself that


---------17:15----------
this expectation should go a certain way


---------17:17----------
it's like no this is just a brief


---------17:19----------
interaction with another random human


---------17:20----------
being and the more that you can reframe


---------17:22----------
towards that the easier it will be to


---------17:24----------
talk to like women


---------17:30----------
right does that make sense it's all like


---------17:32----------
up in here


---------17:39----------
who randomly meets 300 people a year so


---------17:41----------
like


---------17:42----------
i don't know if you guys are


---------17:43----------
participating in chat but there seemed


---------17:44----------
to be 5 315 people right now each of


---------17:47----------
whom is interacting with you


---------17:49----------
and people are adding each other right


---------17:51----------
so like oh like i'm an indoor like


---------17:54----------
you're interacting with like 5 000


---------17:55----------
people right now


---------17:58----------
right like you're interacting with


---------17:59----------
people all the time


---------18:01----------
sure no no no no hold on a second hold


---------18:03----------
on a second before you guys discount


---------18:05----------
this kind of interaction this is real


---------18:07----------
you can hop on discord afterward you're


---------18:09----------
going to talk to other people like you


---------18:10----------
meet 300 people a year on discord


---------18:12----------
through games and through twitch don't


---------18:13----------
tell me otherwise


---------18:16----------
right and people will respond to each


---------18:17----------
other on chat people will answer each


---------18:19----------
other's questions like those


---------18:20----------
interactions and that's easy why because


---------18:22----------
there's no expectation


---------18:25----------
right you all get that


---------18:28----------
we meet more people now than we used to


---------18:30----------
we have more opportunities for


---------18:31----------
interaction than we used to


---------18:32----------
this is the big paradox of like being


---------18:34----------
online is that there's like way more


---------18:36----------
people to meet and it's like somehow


---------18:38----------
it's way harder to meet them it's kind


---------18:41----------
of weird but you can't you i can


---------18:42----------
absolutely do it right you can have a


---------18:43----------
meaningful conversation with someone i


---------18:45----------
actually think that the discord is


---------18:46----------
really good at this where it's like


---------18:47----------
because people can sort of offer support


---------18:49----------
they can like meet for a moment in time


---------18:51----------
and there's no expectation that's why


---------18:52----------
it's so easy to hang out with people on


---------18:54----------
discord because you're not expecting


---------18:55----------
anything from them


---------19:11----------
you
