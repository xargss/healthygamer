---------00:01----------
oh oh man


---------00:03----------
i'm a little bit nervous no um


---------00:07----------
it's a really normal feeling yeah


---------00:10----------
so so yeah i wanted to ask a question


---------00:13----------
related to um


---------00:16----------
to a recent social situation i lived


---------00:20----------
uh and i think i think it's kind of


---------00:23----------
uh correlated with my dharma but


---------00:27----------
we're gonna get to that i guess so


---------00:32----------
so so yeah every time i screw up


---------00:36----------
it takes me a long time to wake up even


---------00:38----------
though


---------00:39----------
i can live in the moment at times


---------00:42----------
i tend to remember what i did to to the


---------00:44----------
person i'm looking at if they're close


---------00:46----------
um because i want forgiveness and i have


---------00:49----------
to change myself so it doesn't happen


---------00:53----------
um i have to find myself in


---------00:59----------
in a situation where i want to talk to


---------01:00----------
the person in person


---------01:02----------
about that but but i have i have a hard


---------01:05----------
time doing so


---------01:06----------
because i see it inappropriate when when


---------01:09----------
the other person


---------01:10----------
has already moved on after the issue was


---------01:13----------
taken care of


---------01:15----------
on the phone to the chat or voice


---------01:17----------
messages


---------01:19----------
um while being


---------01:23----------
stressful situations i tend to analyze


---------01:26----------
every detail


---------01:27----------
what i think was done right and wrong i


---------01:30----------
did it all the time


---------01:32----------
and and when i think i find problems


---------01:35----------
problems i want to solve solve them as


---------01:37----------
soon as possible so


---------01:38----------
so my mind is not filled with them when


---------01:40----------
i'm alone


---------01:42----------
uh then dancing


---------01:46----------
uh producing music doing things with


---------01:49----------
friends


---------01:50----------
meditate sometimes and and in this case


---------01:54----------
working


---------01:54----------
with a friend of mine in a project we


---------01:57----------
have hopes of


---------01:58----------
for it succeeding sometimes it helps but


---------02:02----------
it's even cathartic but it's not enough


---------02:04----------
because


---------02:05----------
then because i returned to the


---------02:10----------
to the to the process of of analysis


---------02:18----------
okay so let me let me ask you a question


---------02:21----------
so it sounds to me like


---------02:23----------
you spend a lot of time going over


---------02:26----------
mistakes that you think you made in your


---------02:28----------
head


---------02:29----------
when it relates to interacting with


---------02:31----------
other people


---------02:32----------
yes okay yes so


---------02:36----------
let me ask can you just tell us like an


---------02:38----------
example of like a mistake that you made


---------02:40----------
with someone and what kind of thoughts


---------02:41----------
you were having


---------02:42----------
yeah yesterday um a friend of mine i


---------02:45----------
mean


---------02:46----------
um her father went to the hospital and


---------02:49----------
and i started to


---------02:51----------
to ask to ask to ask if uh


---------02:55----------
how how was she feeling like uh


---------02:58----------
how to how how she was dealing with it


---------03:02----------
like


---------03:03----------
in a moment that it was inappropriate


---------03:05----------
for her and and i didn't know it until


---------03:08----------
uh until last night when


---------03:11----------
when another friend of flowers told me


---------03:13----------
hey man


---------03:15----------
you went too far like um she she didn't


---------03:18----------
like


---------03:19----------
at all the


---------03:22----------
that you tried that you tried to um


---------03:26----------
to to search for


---------03:30----------
how she was filmed and


---------03:33----------
and can you walk me through the


---------03:36----------
conversation that you had with her


---------03:39----------
[Music]


---------03:41----------
with a friend who told me that i screwed


---------03:44----------
up


---------03:46----------
the the the the the conversation you had


---------03:48----------
with the original person about the


---------03:50----------
hospital and how they were handling it


---------03:52----------
oh yeah um when she was at a hospital i


---------03:55----------
asked her


---------03:58----------
um


---------04:06----------
i mean how many times like what what


---------04:07----------
like how many questions did you ask her


---------04:12----------
that i can remember just one like uh how


---------04:16----------
how are you feeling uh


---------04:19----------
and you thought that that was asking too


---------04:22----------
much


---------04:24----------
no not at all i wanted to to support her


---------04:28----------
and so and so it sounds like your friend


---------04:31----------
thought that what you said was


---------04:32----------
inappropriate


---------04:34----------
um yep and


---------04:38----------
do you agree with your friend uh


---------04:45----------
it depends on how you look at it like uh


---------04:47----------
at the moment


---------04:48----------
she didn't feel good at all because she


---------04:51----------
her mind


---------04:52----------
she was thinking of her father basically


---------04:55----------
you know the person who


---------04:56----------
yeah who was harmed and um


---------05:00----------
in that sense yeah it was thank i think


---------05:03----------
it was technically inappropriate but uh


---------05:08----------
but uh so and what do you go by what


---------05:12----------
what do you how should i address you


---------05:14----------
adam


---------05:15----------
my name is adam adam with an m or an n


---------05:19----------
yeah it is with an n okay can you


---------05:22----------
so adam here here is my initial thought


---------05:25----------
okay and i'm sorry that


---------05:26----------
maybe this won't be very helpful but


---------05:29----------
so first is that you know i would


---------05:33----------
how can i say this so i would be really


---------05:36----------
paying attention to


---------05:38----------
what are the drivers inside you


---------05:41----------
at each step of the way so


---------05:44----------
you know like let me just give you an


---------05:47----------
example so we sometimes have people in


---------05:49----------
our community


---------05:51----------
want to help other people but they don't


---------05:53----------
want to help other people


---------05:57----------
they want to help other people for their


---------05:59----------
own sake


---------06:00----------
like i need to feel good about myself


---------06:03----------
in order to feel good about myself i


---------06:05----------
need to help someone else


---------06:07----------
so they're helping other people almost


---------06:10----------
become selfish


---------06:12----------
and and like sometimes like those people


---------06:14----------
really don't like respect


---------06:15----------
boundaries well because they're like oh


---------06:17----------
i can really help you i can really help


---------06:18----------
you like i need you


---------06:20----------
to let me help you


---------06:23----------
and and so sometimes like people will


---------06:26----------
not feel confidence or won't feel good


---------06:28----------
about themselves


---------06:29----------
unless they are able to help other


---------06:31----------
people


---------06:33----------
yeah so i think it's worthwhile


---------06:35----------
exploring


---------06:36----------
whether you fall into that so when


---------06:38----------
you're trying to think


---------06:40----------
yeah i think i've fallen into that


---------06:42----------
sometimes yeah


---------06:43----------
right so that's something that you need


---------06:44----------
to be really careful about and just kind


---------06:46----------
of notice that


---------06:48----------
and and sometimes you know for people


---------06:50----------
because i i mean what you're describing


---------06:51----------
doesn't sound inappropriate to me it


---------06:53----------
sounds like


---------06:55----------
you know you had a friend that was going


---------06:56----------
through a tough time and you just asked


---------06:58----------
them one question


---------07:00----------
about how they're feeling and then like


---------07:02----------
yeah you know having an issue


---------07:05----------
like uh i can remember uh how much into


---------07:08----------
detail i went


---------07:09----------
right now yet you can or cannot


---------07:13----------
i cannot yeah that's okay so so that's


---------07:16----------
why we're gonna just


---------07:17----------
you know so what the situation you're


---------07:20----------
describing doesn't sound inappropriate


---------07:22----------
to me


---------07:23----------
so even if it's not inappropriate we can


---------07:25----------
still lay out


---------07:26----------
like how to approach the problem okay so


---------07:29----------
one is that you know


---------07:30----------
if your desire to help other people


---------07:32----------
comes from


---------07:34----------
a need that you have to help other


---------07:36----------
people


---------07:38----------
then that's not really good it's not


---------07:40----------
healthy


---------07:41----------
because people may not need your help


---------07:44----------
but you


---------07:45----------
are like trying to force your help on


---------07:46----------
them that's one option


---------07:49----------
second thing to think a little bit about


---------07:51----------
is that you know when your friend


---------07:52----------
like maybe your friend like maybe the


---------07:54----------
problem is with your friend it may not


---------07:55----------
be


---------07:55----------
you at all it could be that your friend


---------07:57----------
is behaving you know that really what


---------07:58----------
you asked was completely okay and you


---------08:01----------
you know your friend just thinks it was


---------08:03----------
inappropriate but it's not really


---------08:04----------
inappropriate


---------08:05----------
so then the question becomes if your


---------08:07----------
friend says something


---------08:09----------
why do you trust their word instead of


---------08:12----------
your own judgment


---------08:18----------
yeah that's tough right now


---------08:21----------
right so like it's a little bit


---------08:25----------
unclear but i think at the end of the


---------08:29----------
day the most important thing adam is


---------08:31----------
is to just to to think a little bit


---------08:33----------
about what's driving you on the inside


---------08:37----------
you know like so even when and i think


---------08:39----------
your original question was about


---------08:40----------
how you overthink things when you have


---------08:43----------
interactions with people


---------08:46----------
and so so like if we think about


---------08:47----------
overthinking


---------08:49----------
what is the root of that overthinking


---------08:51----------
like what are you concerned about


---------08:54----------
when you're overthinking like when


---------08:55----------
you're thinking about this like what


---------08:57----------
i i don't know how to say this but like


---------08:59----------
you know when you have anxiety over


---------09:01----------
something


---------09:02----------
you're usually afraid of a particular


---------09:04----------
thing happening


---------09:06----------
and so all of your overthinking is going


---------09:08----------
to revolve


---------09:09----------
around something that could happen does


---------09:12----------
that make sense


---------09:15----------
yeah what is the thing that you're


---------09:17----------
afraid of


---------09:18----------
that will happen


---------09:22----------
um


---------09:22----------
[Music]


---------09:26----------
the the person uh


---------09:30----------
ends up not being able to to deal with


---------09:34----------
many many stressful stressful situations


---------09:36----------
or bad situations


---------09:39----------
so you're concerned about how the person


---------09:41----------
is going to end up


---------09:42----------
not what they're going to think about


---------09:44----------
you know


---------09:47----------
yeah how the person is going to end up


---------09:50----------
and so you think that something that you


---------09:53----------
you told them


---------09:54----------
is going to like actually cause them


---------09:55----------
harm


---------09:57----------
no i don't think


---------10:01----------
i don't think that at those moments you


---------10:04----------
know and


---------10:04----------
then what i'm saying is disgusting or


---------10:08----------
it's gonna cause harm like uh


---------10:11----------
at the moment i um i recognize it


---------10:15----------
because


---------10:16----------
i an amount of harm but


---------10:19----------
in the long term i'm not sure either


---------10:23----------
i i i'm starting to lose you a little


---------10:25----------
bit adam


---------10:26----------
what are you when you overthink a


---------10:28----------
situation


---------10:30----------
what what like help me understand can


---------10:32----------
you tell me what your actual thoughts


---------10:34----------
are


---------10:37----------
can you repeat when uh when i when you


---------10:39----------
overthink something so here's what i


---------10:41----------
understand


---------10:42----------
yeah so what's an example of the kind of


---------10:44----------
thoughts that you have


---------10:48----------
like uh for example from


---------10:50----------
[Music]


---------10:52----------
like if the person if if i detect the


---------10:55----------
person has uh


---------10:56----------
problems with with codependence for


---------10:59----------
example


---------11:01----------
uh i think on how


---------11:04----------
how how can i help them


---------11:09----------
deal with uh with a certain situation


---------11:12----------
so so they don't depend on others and


---------11:14----------
and they


---------11:16----------
and they and they for example accept uh


---------11:19----------
how things are


---------11:20----------
and uh and


---------11:27----------
so you try to help people with their


---------11:28----------
codependence


---------11:30----------
yeah that's one example okay yeah


---------11:33----------
because in this case with this friend of


---------11:35----------
mine i detect


---------11:36----------
codependence uh from her


---------11:39----------
you know from and how does she respond


---------11:42----------
to that


---------11:43----------
um when we talk about it and she's not


---------11:46----------
dealing with uh with a hard situation


---------11:49----------
like yesterday's


---------11:50----------
it's fine like she she told me like it's


---------11:53----------
okay that


---------11:54----------
we talk about those things when uh


---------11:58----------
what she said when it's about the past


---------12:00----------
that when i when i'm dealing with


---------12:01----------
something


---------12:02----------
hard for me um


---------12:06----------
it bothers me what bothers you about


---------12:10----------
that


---------12:10----------
no no it bothers her i mean i i was


---------12:14----------
i was talking from her from her angle


---------12:16----------
like


---------12:17----------
so adam and i i'd start by like this


---------12:20----------
issue which is like why you have to


---------12:22----------
bring up the codependents in the first


---------12:24----------
place


---------12:26----------
right now right so so like this is where


---------12:29----------
i


---------12:30----------
i think like you said you fall into this


---------12:31----------
category of people who like need to


---------12:34----------
like there are people who are fixers


---------12:37----------
right so people


---------12:38----------
who like need to fix other people


---------12:43----------
um yeah as well as myself


---------12:47----------
yeah so i think this is where a lot of


---------12:49----------
times like being a fixer


---------12:50----------
comes from the inability to fix yourself


---------12:58----------
um yeah it could be yeah


---------13:02----------
so this is where like what's gonna


---------13:03----------
happen is like you're gonna you're gonna


---------13:06----------
you know go around trying to fix all the


---------13:08----------
problems in the world


---------13:10----------
instead of like like to make up for the


---------13:13----------
fact that you can't like fix yourself


---------13:21----------
well i i spent a lot of time


---------13:24----------
uh trying to well


---------13:28----------
fix myself and how's that working


---------13:36----------
in many in many areas


---------13:41----------
it's working on some in some areas but


---------13:43----------
not not


---------13:44----------
not on others like


---------13:48----------
i used to or i tend to um


---------13:52----------
to to be like


---------13:55----------
i can fix things on my own


---------13:59----------
and uh and i think i have a hard time to


---------14:02----------
not just for help but to to um


---------14:06----------
move on with the process of getting help


---------14:10----------
how do you feel about getting help


---------14:14----------
yeah how do you feel about getting help


---------14:19----------
um


---------14:23----------
right now i mean right now you mean


---------14:28----------
like so when it comes to your problems


---------14:31----------
how do you feel about you getting help


---------14:33----------
from other people to fix your problems


---------14:36----------
oh uh sometimes it feels good


---------14:40----------
i mean at the moment it's stressful but


---------14:42----------
what's stressful about it


---------14:45----------
um


---------14:45----------
[Music]


---------14:49----------
i i think that they burned my lives away


---------14:53----------
that's how i see it they what they burn


---------14:56----------
my lies away


---------14:59----------
burn your what away my lies i'm sorry


---------15:03----------
um oh they burn your lies away when you


---------15:07----------
get help from other people


---------15:11----------
yeah and how do you feel about having


---------15:13----------
your lies burned away


---------15:15----------
um stressful


---------15:20----------
yeah so adam i think that this is like


---------15:24----------
gonna be a little bit complicated but


---------15:27----------
here's what i think okay so i think


---------15:30----------
you've got to be like really careful


---------15:31----------
here because i think that you're falling


---------15:33----------
into this trap of like


---------15:37----------
you know you're so eager to help other


---------15:40----------
people


---------15:41----------
and you're you really want to like like


---------15:42----------
it's a good thing right because you want


---------15:44----------
to make the world a better place


---------15:46----------
you want to protect people from


---------15:47----------
suffering you want to point out to other


---------15:49----------
people the problems that you have


---------15:52----------
but i'm reminded of what they say on


---------15:54----------
airplanes which is put your own oxygen


---------15:56----------
mask on before you


---------15:58----------
you help someone else with theirs yeah


---------16:01----------
yeah i agree and so i think a lot of


---------16:03----------
this stuff is like weird like projection


---------16:07----------
is is kind of like what we think about


---------16:09----------
in psychology which is like


---------16:10----------
you're trying to go out and fix all


---------16:12----------
these other people's problems


---------16:13----------
but it seems like you're hesitant to


---------16:16----------
have other people look at yours


---------16:18----------
and as long as you're fixing the rest of


---------16:20----------
the world like you don't have to worry


---------16:21----------
about fixing yourself


---------16:24----------
whereas i think what you need to do is


---------16:26----------
do it the other way like focus on


---------16:28----------
yourself first


---------16:30----------
and i i know this sounds weird adam but


---------16:33----------
like i don't try to help anyone


---------16:36----------
i know and and what i've found is that


---------16:39----------
like when people


---------16:40----------
need your help it's part it's like


---------16:43----------
like their job to come to you and ask


---------16:46----------
for it


---------16:47----------
like you don't go around trying to force


---------16:49----------
people


---------16:50----------
into improving their lives


---------16:53----------
and and oftentimes when i see people who


---------16:56----------
do that that has to do more with like


---------16:58----------
themselves and it has to do with the


---------16:59----------
other people now i think buried


---------17:01----------
like it throughout all this stuff you


---------17:03----------
sound to me like a very


---------17:05----------
genuinely caring person and that you


---------17:07----------
want to wake make the world the better a


---------17:09----------
better place


---------17:10----------
and the world needs more people like you


---------17:13----------
and so i think it's wonderful that you


---------17:15----------
have all those qualities


---------17:17----------
but i think that you have to really put


---------17:18----------
your own mind in order


---------17:21----------
for you to be able to like see someone


---------17:24----------
objectively


---------17:26----------
because as long as you have all these


---------17:27----------
issues like going on in your head


---------17:30----------
your mind is gonna warp what you see


---------17:32----------
from the rest of the world


---------17:36----------
and it's hard to describe but like i've


---------17:37----------
just seen that you know people who are


---------17:39----------
really capable of helping someone else


---------17:42----------
have their own houses in order first


---------17:45----------
yeah yeah yeah i i'm aware of that and i


---------17:49----------
try to apply it


---------17:51----------
but i see i see i see i fail when


---------17:55----------
this kind of situations happen like when


---------17:56----------
i screw up it's like uh


---------17:59----------
what if i was to focus on on them when


---------18:01----------
they didn't mean


---------18:03----------
me right so then the question becomes


---------18:05----------
how does it feel


---------18:06----------
to not be needed by them um


---------18:10----------
when i'm aware it's like uh oh crap they


---------18:13----------
don't mean me but


---------18:14----------
i have my own things like i'm gonna


---------18:16----------
leave them alone it takes me time but


---------18:18----------
at that at that time at that moment in


---------18:20----------
time i wasn't aware at all


---------18:23----------
yeah i thought i was doing actually


---------18:24----------
actually good


---------18:26----------
of course and i think that's what i mean


---------18:27----------
i think you're a caring person but i i


---------18:29----------
think that something about the way that


---------18:31----------
your mind is working


---------18:33----------
your ego is getting involved with your


---------18:35----------
caring


---------18:38----------
right so like what i'm detecting from


---------18:40----------
what you're saying and i could be wrong


---------18:41----------
here because i don't really have a


---------18:42----------
complete picture


---------18:44----------
i understand but but what i'm kind of


---------18:46----------
hearing is that like helping other


---------18:47----------
people


---------18:48----------
is like a part of your identity


---------18:51----------
and at that point it's no longer about


---------18:53----------
them it's actually about you


---------18:56----------
and usually when that happens


---------19:00----------
like you can end up hurting people


---------19:04----------
right which is what you're afraid of


---------19:11----------
when when in when it becomes about me


---------19:14----------
helping people instead of about them yup


---------19:18----------
mm-hmm yeah yeah sometimes it happens


---------19:21----------
i i'm i do my best to acknowledge the


---------19:26----------
fear


---------19:26----------
and to and to think logically like um


---------19:31----------
so i'm gonna i can do it might happen


---------19:34----------
that i harm this person at this moment


---------19:36----------
but if this doesn't happen or if i don't


---------19:38----------
do it yeah that that's the so i don't


---------19:40----------
that's how this stuff can could happen


---------19:42----------
yeah so but that's not your problem


---------19:45----------
well yeah right that's their life and so


---------19:48----------
like the main question that i have for


---------19:50----------
you and i think you've got to be careful


---------19:51----------
there


---------19:52----------
which is oh it looks like we got it


---------19:54----------
right so i'll i'll be with you guys in


---------19:55----------
just a second we're just wrapping up


---------19:57----------
okay


---------19:57----------
so adam here's what i'd say like i think


---------19:59----------
it goes back to when when it comes to


---------20:01----------
helping


---------20:02----------
other people helping you you said


---------20:04----------
something about lies


---------20:06----------
that your lies are like seen through


---------20:11----------
um yeah i mean sometimes i don't agree


---------20:14----------
with what they say


---------20:16----------
and and that is stressful too yeah so


---------20:20----------
so i think that's time yeah that's where


---------20:23----------
i think you need to do the work


---------20:28----------
okay so it's not about whether they're


---------20:29----------
right or wrong but what i really want


---------20:31----------
you to do is


---------20:32----------
stop focusing on other people and focus


---------20:35----------
on yourself


---------20:35----------
first and even if they're right or wrong


---------20:39----------
don't turn away from other people


---------20:41----------
helping you


---------20:42----------
and even when it comes to helping other


---------20:45----------
people


---------20:46----------
notice that that driver is like kind of


---------20:48----------
like a hunger inside you like it almost


---------20:50----------
feels like


---------20:51----------
a hunger to me that you need to help


---------20:54----------
other people


---------20:55----------
yeah and and so just be a little bit


---------20:58----------
careful about that


---------21:00----------
mm-hmm okay because like you


---------21:03----------
you know if you're satisfying your own


---------21:05----------
hunger you're not really helping other


---------21:07----------
people


---------21:09----------
like sure other people can benefit from


---------21:11----------
it it's true


---------21:13----------
and and so just be and and this is where


---------21:15----------
like i think part of the problem is like


---------21:17----------
i don't know if you're okay being


---------21:18----------
selfish but i think like


---------21:20----------
you need to learn how to be selfish yeah


---------21:22----------
i'm okay with being selfish


---------21:24----------
okay good so so i i mean


---------21:27----------
something about everything that you're


---------21:29----------
saying adam is is the takeaway that i'm


---------21:31----------
hearing from you and i'm i apologize if


---------21:33----------
i'm not


---------21:34----------
you know able to understand your


---------21:35----------
situation quite as well


---------21:37----------
it's okay i i think that you should stop


---------21:40----------
like look at yourself more and try to


---------21:42----------
help yourself more


---------21:44----------
and then as you grow as a person other


---------21:47----------
people will


---------21:48----------
come to you yeah for help


---------21:51----------
you shouldn't seek it out like when you


---------21:54----------
have your own life in order


---------21:56----------
other people believe me will show up


---------21:59----------
yeah something happens good yeah so


---------22:02----------
those are the people you should focus on


---------22:04----------
helping but it's not the kind of thing


---------22:05----------
where you go around and like hunt people


---------22:07----------
down and try to help them like it's nice


---------22:09----------
to be a caring friend


---------22:10----------
it's nice to help people when they come


---------22:12----------
to you


---------22:14----------
but you know i'd really focus on helping


---------22:16----------
yourself first and like put that oxygen


---------22:19----------
mask on before you start


---------22:20----------
dealing with someone else yes


---------22:24----------
okay yeah yeah i'm yeah i'm in the


---------22:27----------
process


---------22:28----------
good that's that's the point yeah yeah


---------22:30----------
and i think i think being a part of this


---------22:31----------
conversation is a part of that process


---------22:33----------
so i really commend you for coming on


---------22:35----------
today


---------22:37----------
oh what does command mean


---------22:40----------
command means i think you did an awesome


---------22:42----------
job and i'm very happy that i think you


---------22:44----------
did a good job


---------22:46----------
thank you yeah thank you for uh for


---------22:48----------
letting me in right


---------22:50----------
yeah i think it's great i think a lot of


---------22:51----------
people can resonate and


---------22:54----------
and hearing hearing your situation like


---------22:56----------
a lot of people can relate to that


---------22:58----------
yeah um i also have another issue


---------23:02----------
it's part of helping myself okay indeed


---------23:07----------
um some many times uh


---------23:10----------
i feel that vote in my heart in regards


---------23:13----------
to physical affection right


---------23:14----------
it affects me when when people i i have


---------23:17----------
an emotional


---------23:18----------
emotional connection with uh go to their


---------23:21----------
homes and i can


---------23:22----------
and i cannot even hug them and and many


---------23:25----------
times when i wake up


---------23:27----------
in the morning some


---------23:30----------
like um sometimes uh


---------23:36----------
you know thinking about the things that


---------23:38----------
i can work on


---------23:39----------
like music or or dancing it helps


---------23:42----------
but uh it's taking me a while to wake up


---------23:45----------
lately i'm sorry i don't unders i don't


---------23:50----------
quite understand it sounds like you have


---------23:51----------
trouble


---------23:52----------
not being able to hug people when you


---------23:55----------
leave


---------23:57----------
um yeah to


---------24:01----------
to hack people to receive uh


---------24:05----------
that kind of affection it's hard for you


---------24:07----------
to receive the affection or it's hard


---------24:09----------
for you to not receive the affection


---------24:12----------
it's hard for me to receive the


---------24:14----------
affection what makes it


---------24:16----------
what makes it hard when people hug you


---------24:20----------
no no not at that moment like uh when


---------24:24----------
when people hug me and people that i'm


---------24:27----------
i feel a deep connection with hug me i


---------24:30----------
have no problem


---------24:31----------
uh the problem i have is that i feel


---------24:35----------
that i feel um that i'm lacking in


---------24:38----------
general


---------24:39----------
of affection that i mean more do you


---------24:44----------
sometimes


---------24:46----------
i want more affection so what's wrong


---------24:48----------
with that


---------24:50----------
nothing there's nothing wrong so what's


---------24:52----------
that's part of


---------24:54----------
uh that


---------24:57----------
uh that i think i'm not getting


---------25:00----------
enough that is a problem


---------25:07----------
what are we going to do about it good


---------25:10----------
question


---------25:13----------
adam are you are you in a romantic


---------25:15----------
relationship right now


---------25:17----------
no when was the last time you were in


---------25:19----------
one or have you been in one


---------25:22----------
um that has been established uh


---------25:26----------
actually never uh i had a friend of mine


---------25:30----------
um from whom i will receive a lot of


---------25:34----------
affection


---------25:35----------
uh but she was i felt a lot of


---------25:39----------
toxicity like uh she had serious issues


---------25:42----------
like


---------25:43----------
suicide and this kind of stuff


---------25:46----------
and how did it feel to receive affection


---------25:49----------
from someone who had a lot of issues


---------25:52----------
um at those moments felt


---------25:55----------
good it felt good


---------25:59----------
yeah and what i mean what do you think


---------26:02----------
about it now


---------26:04----------
um that part was okay like uh


---------26:09----------
there is nothing about happening why


---------26:11----------
don't you think you've had a girlfriend


---------26:20----------
because i i haven't exposed myself


---------26:23----------
enough


---------26:26----------
okay yeah i haven't


---------26:29----------
shown my guts enough like you say


---------26:34----------
and what keeps you from showing your


---------26:35----------
cuts


---------26:37----------
um right now nothing


---------26:42----------
in general um many many kinds of fears


---------26:46----------
like uh


---------26:47----------
i want to be able to to dance in public


---------26:49----------
more and to sing


---------26:51----------
in public more and i'm very scared about


---------26:54----------
those things


---------26:56----------
and i want to do it because i do them


---------26:58----------
because i love them


---------27:00----------
and what keeps you from dancing and


---------27:02----------
singing in public


---------27:05----------
i don't know how to organize an event


---------27:07----------
here where i live


---------27:10----------
for example so it sounds like you're


---------27:13----------
you're not afraid of dancing and singing


---------27:14----------
in public you just haven't had the


---------27:16----------
opportunity


---------27:18----------
um yeah it feels that way


---------27:21----------
yeah what is not dancing and singing in


---------27:24----------
public have to do with finding a


---------27:25----------
girlfriend


---------27:30----------
[Music]


---------27:33----------
i related those topics as being of


---------27:35----------
authentic


---------27:36----------
and uh and that's using those things


---------27:40----------
as as means to to attract people


---------27:43----------
so do you feel like you need to do those


---------27:45----------
things to attract


---------27:46----------
girls


---------27:50----------
not exclusively like those are options


---------27:55----------
but those are the options that you think


---------27:56----------
about so i asked you about a girlfriend


---------27:58----------
and you started talking about dancing


---------28:00----------
and singing in public


---------28:01----------
yeah the answer to the girlfriend is no


---------28:03----------
like uh


---------28:05----------
i've never had a formal girlfriend


---------28:09----------
is that because is that because you


---------28:11----------
haven't danced and sung in public


---------28:14----------
no no no no it's not because of that so


---------28:17----------
so


---------28:17----------
okay this is the thing adam i want you


---------28:19----------
to notice a little bit about


---------28:20----------
how you're answering my questions yeah


---------28:23----------
okay so like i ask


---------28:26----------
so first of all yeah so i think that you


---------28:29----------
i think that


---------28:31----------
you know part of so the helping thing it


---------28:33----------
sounds to me like maybe you


---------28:35----------
you know you derive a lot of your


---------28:38----------
self-esteem


---------28:39----------
and a lot of your worth out of helping


---------28:41----------
other people


---------28:43----------
which can be wonderful but i think that


---------28:46----------
you've got to be a little bit careful


---------28:47----------
because that's still


---------28:49----------
it's really about your ego it's not


---------28:51----------
about the other person


---------28:53----------
the second thing is that it sounds to me


---------28:55----------
like you're hungry for affection and in


---------28:58----------
the past you've


---------28:59----------
received affection from people that like


---------29:02----------
have


---------29:02----------
some challenges or facing some problems


---------29:04----------
and maybe they're not really in a


---------29:06----------
relationship


---------29:07----------
i mean they're not in in the right mind


---------29:10----------
or right


---------29:10----------
place to be in a relationship but those


---------29:13----------
are the people that you've had affection


---------29:14----------
from in the past


---------29:17----------
um yeah right yes


---------29:21----------
so i like i i think this sounds kind of


---------29:23----------
weird but like i i


---------29:24----------
i think you need someone to love and i


---------29:26----------
think someone


---------29:27----------
you need to be loved by someone i agree


---------29:31----------
and that's where like all this savior


---------29:32----------
[ __ ] like all that savior complex and


---------29:34----------
stuff like let that stuff go it sounds


---------29:36----------
to me like


---------29:37----------
what you really need is like you need


---------29:39----------
someone to love


---------29:41----------
and take care of and in turn you need


---------29:43----------
someone to love and take care of you


---------29:47----------
yes and this is where i think for


---------29:49----------
whatever reason


---------29:50----------
i i don't think that you're


---------29:54----------
you're afraid that whatever you are


---------29:57----------
is not good enough


---------30:00----------
no and and so that's where you like


---------30:02----------
that's where you need to do the work


---------30:05----------
right because if i ask you like why you


---------30:07----------
have a girlfriend and you're like there


---------30:08----------
aren't events where i can sing and dance


---------30:10----------
in public like what


---------30:13----------
you know it's kind of a weird answer


---------30:16----------
yeah it is


---------30:17----------
and so what i'm hearing from that like i


---------30:18----------
i don't mean to make fun of you i'm not


---------30:20----------
i'm


---------30:20----------
really not trying to make fun of you


---------30:22----------
there but i know i know


---------30:24----------
and so it's kind of like it almost says


---------30:26----------
to me that


---------30:27----------
you know you'll be worthy of attracting


---------30:30----------
someone


---------30:30----------
when you can display your best qualities


---------30:34----------
and that's when like you'll find a


---------30:35----------
girlfriend is when you can do these


---------30:37----------
things but i want you to be really


---------30:38----------
careful there


---------30:39----------
because like you know life is full of


---------30:41----------
all kinds of stuff that we don't do


---------30:43----------
because it's not the perfect timing i'll


---------30:46----------
i'll


---------30:47----------
apply to college when i know i can get a


---------30:49----------
4.0 gpa


---------30:51----------
i'll find a girlfriend once i'm in shape


---------30:54----------
i'll go to the gym once i exercise


---------30:56----------
enough at home so that i don't embarrass


---------30:58----------
myself when i go to the gym


---------31:01----------
oh yeah you know like all these kinds of


---------31:03----------
things we're like we don't want to do


---------31:05----------
stuff


---------31:05----------
until we're ready and if we really look


---------31:08----------
at this like what does ready mean


---------31:10----------
what ready means is that it alleviates


---------31:12----------
our anxiety because we're afraid of


---------31:14----------
failure


---------31:15----------
and so in order to deal with that fear


---------31:17----------
of failure and that fear of rejection


---------31:20----------
i'm going to become adam is going to be


---------31:21----------
such a [ __ ] sexy mess


---------31:23----------
he's going to be so hot singing and


---------31:25----------
dancing in public that the girls


---------31:27----------
won't be able to restrain themselves and


---------31:30----------
if you really think about it like what


---------31:32----------
does that mean it means that you wanna


---------31:33----------
like you're not


---------31:34----------
ready to put yourself out there until


---------31:36----------
you know


---------31:38----------
that they're gonna love you and that day


---------31:40----------
will never come


---------31:42----------
i know and so what you really need to


---------31:45----------
work on is


---------31:46----------
like your anxiety and fear


---------31:49----------
about like how you're not lovable yet


---------31:53----------
because you're absolutely lovable bro


---------31:56----------
yeah i know and so just give people the


---------31:59----------
opportunity


---------32:00----------
to love you yeah yeah yeah


---------32:03----------
i uh i tried


---------32:08----------
i tried to to to to do that


---------32:11----------
some days ago when uh when a friend of


---------32:13----------
mine was like um


---------32:15----------
we talked about the meeting and and she


---------32:18----------
just randomly


---------32:19----------
she she went to to her boyfriend adam


---------32:22----------
you know she didn't think about anyone


---------32:24----------
else listen


---------32:24----------
you gotta stop having these like


---------32:26----------
friend-zoned relationships with women if


---------32:28----------
you're interested in a woman and she's


---------32:29----------
got a boyfriend


---------32:30----------
go bark like go to a different woman and


---------32:33----------
if you like a girl


---------32:34----------
[ __ ] ask her out yeah


---------32:38----------
yeah and if she turns you down like


---------32:42----------
understand that it's gonna hurt and


---------32:44----------
you're gonna feel unlovable again


---------32:46----------
which is what you're afraid of in the


---------32:48----------
first place which is why you need to


---------32:49----------
sing and dance in front of them


---------32:51----------
because you're afraid they won't accept


---------32:52----------
you the way that you are


---------32:54----------
and when you get hurt log on to our


---------32:56----------
discord and tell people that you just


---------32:58----------
got rejected to


---------32:59----------
by a woman and that you feel that like


---------33:01----------
you're unlovable


---------33:02----------
and let us help you and then go and ask


---------33:05----------
out another girl


---------33:07----------
and stop trying to help people to get


---------33:09----------
them to fall in love with you


---------33:12----------
just let them fall in love with you


---------33:13----------
because of who you are not because you


---------33:15----------
helped them


---------33:16----------
overcome their codependency yeah


---------33:22----------
yeah i never thought i never thought


---------33:24----------
about


---------33:25----------
about all of this that way like i'm


---------33:31----------
um i'm very fine if uh if i actually had


---------33:35----------
a fear of


---------33:36----------
uh being unlovable


---------33:41----------
yeah i think you do


---------33:48----------
but you are lovable which is why it's so


---------33:50----------
[ __ ] sad


---------33:52----------
because you're a great i know i i know i


---------33:54----------
am yeah


---------33:56----------
but there's a part of you that believes


---------33:57----------
that you're not yeah


---------34:00----------
that's right


---------34:03----------
so that's what you got to work through


---------34:04----------
