---------00:00----------
i want to talk to you guys a little bit


---------00:01----------
about our coaching program


---------00:03----------
and mental health in general and like


---------00:05----------
what's going on with the world


---------00:06----------
and what's going on with us why are we


---------00:10----------
sad why are we stuck


---------00:11----------
why are we depressed why are we lonely


---------00:13----------
all this stuff we're just going to talk


---------00:15----------
about it for a few minutes


---------00:16----------
and just think a little bit about what


---------00:17----------
healthy gamer does as an organization


---------00:20----------
so first thing to consider is that


---------00:21----------
mental health is getting worse


---------00:23----------
all over the world it's now surpassed


---------00:26----------
cardiovascular disease


---------00:28----------
and cancer in terms of causing the most


---------00:30----------
morbidity and mortality


---------00:32----------
which means that the cost of mental


---------00:34----------
health in terms of like lost work days


---------00:36----------
and


---------00:37----------
impairing like people's education and


---------00:39----------
stuff like that


---------00:41----------
as well as mortality is now worse than


---------00:44----------
cancer and cardiovascular disease


---------00:46----------
so like what's going on there right why


---------00:49----------
is like why is mental health getting


---------00:50----------
worse like isn't the world getting


---------00:52----------
better like aren't we like advancing as


---------00:54----------
society and


---------00:55----------
sure in some ways but why is that


---------00:58----------
so mental health is getting worse right


---------01:00----------
now and what our society does to deal


---------01:02----------
with that is essentially like


---------01:04----------
psychiatric treatment right


---------01:06----------
so if you have a mental illness then you


---------01:08----------
should go see a psychiatrist or


---------01:10----------
therapist and then they'll help


---------01:12----------
you with that and that's certainly true


---------01:14----------
and i'm a psychiatrist so i'm a big


---------01:16----------
believer in psychiatric treatment


---------01:18----------
but i think part of the problem is that


---------01:19----------
somewhere along the way


---------01:22----------
mental stress became like illness and


---------01:25----------
what i mean by that is that if we think


---------01:26----------
about like depression right


---------01:28----------
so an illness is something that when


---------01:30----------
you're like body or brain


---------01:32----------
does something that it's not supposed to


---------01:34----------
that's ill


---------01:35----------
so it's like a malfunction of your mind


---------01:38----------
or your brain


---------01:39----------
and sometimes something like depression


---------01:41----------
can be caused by a malfunction


---------01:43----------
sometimes what happens is when when


---------01:45----------
people feel like


---------01:46----------
lost or they feel depressed or they feel


---------01:49----------
stuck


---------01:50----------
it's not like a malfunction it's not


---------01:52----------
like their life is actually going


---------01:53----------
wonderful


---------01:54----------
and something in their brain tells them


---------01:56----------
that they're awful human beings


---------01:58----------
that's what real clinical illness looks


---------02:00----------
like it's like


---------02:01----------
if you think about someone like


---------02:02----------
schizophrenia for example you know


---------02:05----------
there isn't a whole lot of evidence that


---------02:07----------
the devil is possessing the people


---------02:09----------
around them but that's what they believe


---------02:11----------
it's like their mind is not congruent


---------02:13----------
with with reality


---------02:15----------
the challenge that we face nowadays is


---------02:17----------
that


---------02:18----------
a lot of our depression is actually


---------02:20----------
congruent with reality


---------02:21----------
especially if you look at like gen z and


---------02:23----------
millennials like the world that we live


---------02:25----------
in


---------02:26----------
and the reality that we face is actually


---------02:28----------
depressing


---------02:30----------
if you're 23 years old and like


---------02:32----------
struggling to find a job


---------02:34----------
and feel alone and like don't know what


---------02:36----------
to do with yourself


---------02:38----------
and don't know like where to go


---------02:41----------
how to put your life together how to


---------02:43----------
find motivation


---------02:44----------
that's not an illness like there isn't


---------02:46----------
some part of your brain that's like


---------02:48----------
malfunctioning that's just


---------02:50----------
that's life and so this is the problem


---------02:52----------
right is because then like you have a


---------02:54----------
generation of people like us who get


---------02:55----------
told oh like you're mentally ill


---------02:57----------
so go see a psychiatrist or therapist


---------02:59----------
and then you go see a psychiatrist and


---------03:01----------
therapist


---------03:02----------
and they diagnose you with depression


---------03:03----------
they start you on a on a pill and they


---------03:05----------
send you home and then you like play


---------03:07----------
video games all day


---------03:08----------
browse reddit watch youtube whatever


---------03:10----------
like it doesn't


---------03:12----------
and the pill doesn't fix your life


---------03:13----------
because that's not


---------03:15----------
what it does and so the first issue is


---------03:18----------
that like sure mental health is getting


---------03:20----------
worse in this country and like


---------03:21----------
psychiatrists and therapists


---------03:23----------
are not cutting yet that's been my


---------03:25----------
experience as a psychiatrist


---------03:27----------
so let's just think about so the average


---------03:29----------
age of a psychiatrist is older than 50


---------03:31----------
years old


---------03:32----------
right so if you go to them and you say


---------03:34----------
yeah like


---------03:35----------
you know you're talking to them about


---------03:36----------
like twitch like they're not gonna


---------03:38----------
understand what you're talking about


---------03:39----------
the second thing is that sometimes it


---------03:40----------
can take months like two months three


---------03:43----------
months four months to see a psychiatrist


---------03:44----------
or therapist


---------03:45----------
it can be quite expensive so therapists


---------03:48----------
will cost


---------03:49----------
anywhere from like a hundred to four


---------03:51----------
hundred dollars per session


---------03:53----------
psychiatrists will charge anywhere


---------03:55----------
between like


---------03:56----------
200 for a 30 minute appointment up to


---------03:59----------
like


---------03:59----------
400 or 500 at least in the united states


---------04:02----------
you know they don't understand gaming


---------04:03----------
they don't understand social media they


---------04:05----------
don't understand like fomo and things


---------04:07----------
like that right they're going to


---------04:08----------
diagnose you with edible complexes and


---------04:10----------
depression


---------04:11----------
psychiatry is too old too slow


---------04:14----------
and too effective ineffective


---------04:17----------
it just doesn't work well it's just it's


---------04:19----------
just not doesn't work great


---------04:22----------
and so this is why we started our


---------04:25----------
coaching program


---------04:27----------
because a lot of what you guys struggle


---------04:29----------
with is not


---------04:31----------
illness but is like actually congruent


---------04:34----------
with reality


---------04:35----------
that you don't know what you're doing


---------04:36----------
with your life you don't know what your


---------04:38----------
purpose is you don't know how to get


---------04:39----------
control of your life you play too many


---------04:41----------
video games


---------04:42----------
you struggle with depression you


---------04:43----------
struggle with anxiety etc right that's


---------04:45----------
that's why we started the coaching


---------04:46----------
program to help you with all of those


---------04:48----------
things


---------04:48----------
because the story that i heard time and


---------04:50----------
time and time again


---------04:52----------
so when i started when i appeared on the


---------04:53----------
internet in a while dr k appeared


---------04:56----------
i would tell people hey man like you


---------04:57----------
should go see a therapist bro like they


---------04:59----------
can help you with the depression men


---------05:01----------
and then what i the the story that i got


---------05:03----------
back was i did go see a therapist


---------05:05----------
and i spent like two weeks talking to


---------05:07----------
them and they had no clue what was going


---------05:08----------
on


---------05:09----------
like with me like they didn't understand


---------05:11----------
anything


---------05:12----------
they were like just stop playing just


---------05:14----------
like play video games less bro


---------05:17----------
that's that's what they got right so a


---------05:19----------
lot of psychiatric treatment just hasn't


---------05:21----------
been affected


---------05:23----------
this is actually known in the


---------05:24----------
psychiatric literature so i'm going to


---------05:26----------
show you guys something okay


---------05:27----------
so the journal of the american medical


---------05:29----------
association antidepressant drug effects


---------05:32----------
and depression severity


---------05:33----------
a patient-level meta-analysis here's the


---------05:35----------
main thing that i want to show you guys


---------05:37----------
okay


---------05:39----------
so this is a good paper published in a


---------05:40----------
reputable journal


---------05:43----------
okay among so this is a scale


---------05:46----------
this is a depression scale the hamilton


---------05:48----------
d


---------05:50----------
depression scale cohen d effect sizes


---------05:52----------
for the difference between medication


---------05:54----------
and placebo were estimated to be less


---------05:56----------
than 20


---------05:57----------
what this means is that antidepressant


---------06:00----------
medication


---------06:01----------
has a less than 20 percent improvement


---------06:04----------
compared to placebo so like the effect


---------06:07----------
size of antidepressant medication


---------06:09----------
is less than 20 in this meta-analysis


---------06:12----------
done in the journal of the american


---------06:14----------
medical association


---------06:16----------
okay estimates of the magnitude of


---------06:19----------
superior superiority


---------06:21----------
of medication over placebo increased


---------06:24----------
with increases in baseline depression


---------06:26----------
severity


---------06:27----------
so what that means is that the more


---------06:28----------
depressed you are


---------06:30----------
the more medication helps but on average


---------06:32----------
it's a it's a less than 20


---------06:34----------
improvement and let's think about why


---------06:36----------
this would be


---------06:38----------
and i think the reason for this is


---------06:39----------
because when people go to


---------06:41----------
a psychiatrist when they're depressed


---------06:43----------
not all of them are mentally ill


---------06:45----------
so the pill works if you have a


---------06:46----------
neurochemistry imbalance but a lot of


---------06:48----------
people just have


---------06:49----------
like a congruent depression it's like a


---------06:52----------
depression that


---------06:53----------
fits with what's going on with your life


---------06:56----------
right now you should be depressed you're


---------06:57----------
not mentally ill


---------06:58----------
your life is just going nowhere so


---------07:00----------
that's why you're bummed man so let's


---------07:01----------
look


---------07:02----------
at another paper okay so this is the new


---------07:03----------
england journal of medicine


---------07:05----------
the most reputable medical journal in


---------07:08----------
the world


---------07:08----------
so what this paper is talking about is


---------07:10----------
the idea that antidepressants are like


---------07:12----------
not as effective as


---------07:13----------
as we think they are so what this means


---------07:15----------
is that if you look at


---------07:17----------
according to the published literature so


---------07:19----------
studies on antidepressants


---------07:21----------
it appeared that 91 94


---------07:24----------
of trials were positive so if you look


---------07:26----------
at all of the studies on antidepressant


---------07:28----------
medication 94


---------07:30----------
of them are positive but if you look at


---------07:32----------
fda analysis


---------07:34----------
so this is all of the data that was


---------07:35----------
submitted to the fda


---------07:38----------
that not necessarily published you know


---------07:40----------
so like if a drug company does a trial


---------07:42----------
they have to submit their data to the


---------07:43----------
fda


---------07:44----------
but they don't have to publish it fda


---------07:46----------
analysis only 51 percent of trials are


---------07:48----------
positive and so if you look at the


---------07:50----------
effect size of antidepressant medication


---------07:52----------
was anywhere between 11 and 69


---------07:55----------
11 to 69 for drugs and 32


---------07:59----------
overall so one study tells us that


---------08:01----------
antidepressant medication is less than


---------08:03----------
20


---------08:04----------
improvement the this study shows us that


---------08:06----------
generally speaking antidepressant is 32


---------08:09----------
improvement so it's like 20 to 30


---------08:10----------
percent and why is that it's because


---------08:13----------
lots of depressed or sad people are


---------08:15----------
going to see psychiatrists and they're


---------08:17----------
being given pills and the pill doesn't


---------08:19----------
fix it because not everyone has a


---------08:21----------
neurochemistry imbalance


---------08:22----------
so psychiatry is like we're struggling


---------08:24----------
we're failing you guys are going to


---------08:26----------
psychiatric offices


---------08:27----------
and then they're giving everyone


---------08:28----------
medications not everyone but a lot of


---------08:31----------
psychiatrists


---------08:32----------
are primarily what we call


---------08:33----------
psychopharmacologists so they see


---------08:35----------
patients for 15 to 20 minutes


---------08:36----------
per visit they'll see three to four


---------08:38----------
patients per hour and they primarily


---------08:40----------
prescribe medication


---------08:41----------
and the improvement that they're giving


---------08:43----------
people is 20 to 32


---------08:44----------
so something is not working right the


---------08:46----------
system is not working


---------08:48----------
the best that we have to offer and this


---------08:50----------
is me too like i'm [ __ ]


---------08:52----------
faculty at harvard medical school and


---------08:54----------
like when i prescribe an antidepressant


---------08:55----------
medication


---------08:56----------
it's not like my numbers are better my


---------08:58----------
numbers are still 20 to 30


---------09:00----------
that's just how it is so like what's


---------09:03----------
wrong


---------09:04----------
so this is cool so somewhere along the


---------09:07----------
way what someone realized is that like


---------09:10----------
okay if someone has a problem you can


---------09:12----------
take a well-trained psychiatrist who has


---------09:14----------
never


---------09:15----------
lived a day in the life of that person


---------09:18----------
and try to give them like


---------09:19----------
expert knowledge but if you really want


---------09:21----------
to help people


---------09:23----------
it turns out that people who have actual


---------09:25----------
experience are actually effective at


---------09:27----------
helping people so this is where peer


---------09:29----------
delivered recovery support services come


---------09:31----------
in


---------09:32----------
so on one end of the spectrum we have


---------09:34----------
psychiatrists


---------09:35----------
so these are like highly trained


---------09:37----------
individuals


---------09:38----------
that have never really experienced


---------09:40----------
addiction


---------09:41----------
and on the other hand of the spectrum we


---------09:43----------
have aaa sponsors like alcoholics


---------09:45----------
anonymous sponsors


---------09:46----------
who have lived it with addiction their


---------09:48----------
entire life but have no formal training


---------09:50----------
and so what happened is someone had this


---------09:52----------
like brilliant idea like what if we take


---------09:54----------
aaa sponsors


---------09:56----------
and we start training them we give them


---------09:58----------
something like a training of what a


---------10:00----------
psychiatrist has


---------10:01----------
and a peer delivered a peer support


---------10:04----------
specialist was born


---------10:05----------
and it turns out that this is an


---------10:07----------
effective and


---------10:08----------
and cost effective and treatment size


---------10:11----------
effective intervention that if you take


---------10:13----------
someone who's lived with something like


---------10:15----------
video game addiction or alcohol


---------10:16----------
addiction


---------10:17----------
and you put them through training and


---------10:18----------
you equip them to help another human


---------10:20----------
being


---------10:21----------
a combination of their personal


---------10:22----------
experience plus formal training is


---------10:25----------
actually very effective


---------10:27----------
so there are a lot of methodological


---------10:29----------
limitations so this study is from 2015


---------10:30----------
so there's more data on this


---------10:32----------
now the body of evidence suggests


---------10:34----------
salutatory effects on


---------10:36----------
participants there are better papers


---------10:38----------
that sort of suggest that


---------10:40----------
peer support interventions work so this


---------10:43----------
is where our coaching program was born


---------10:45----------
so it was born from a couple of ideas


---------10:47----------
the first is that


---------10:48----------
what holds us back in life and why we


---------10:51----------
feel


---------10:52----------
depressed or anxious isn't necessarily a


---------10:54----------
medical illness and doesn't necessarily


---------10:56----------
need a medical intervention right so


---------10:58----------
what our coaches target is like how do


---------11:00----------
you find


---------11:00----------
motivation how do you stop


---------11:02----------
procrastinating how do you overcome


---------11:05----------
like feelings of like game uh guilt or


---------11:08----------
shame


---------11:09----------
right how do you stop playing video


---------11:11----------
games how do you understand yourself


---------11:13----------
better so that you can play the game of


---------11:14----------
life better


---------11:16----------
that's what our coaching program is for


---------11:18----------
that's why it was built


---------11:19----------
it's because mental health is too old


---------11:21----------
too slow


---------11:22----------
too expensive and also mis-targeted


---------11:26----------
so our coaching program was developed


---------11:28----------
specifically because what i realized is


---------11:30----------
like


---------11:31----------
what we need is like an army of peer


---------11:33----------
support specialists we need an army of


---------11:34----------
people who understand what you've been


---------11:36----------
through


---------11:37----------
and then they need to learn like a


---------11:39----------
distillation


---------11:40----------
of the best of what like psychotherapy


---------11:42----------
techniques and motivational interviewing


---------11:44----------
and a couple of these other


---------11:45----------
evidence-based interventions and if we


---------11:47----------
can put those two things together


---------11:49----------
can they help so now what i'd like to do


---------11:51----------
is answer that question for you guys


---------11:54----------
so here is data from our coaching


---------11:55----------
program here


---------11:57----------
is the change


---------12:01----------
in purpose and meaning after


---------12:04----------
four weeks of group coaching so this is


---------12:06----------
group coaching personal coaching free


---------12:07----------
coaching


---------12:08----------
okay so after four weeks people have a


---------12:11----------
12


---------12:12----------
increase in a sense of purpose and


---------12:13----------
meaning after one month of group


---------12:15----------
coaching 14


---------12:16----------
increase after eight weeks and 20


---------12:18----------
increase


---------12:19----------
in purpose and meaning after 12 weeks of


---------12:22----------
group coaching


---------12:23----------
their sense of control over their life


---------12:25----------
increases by about nine percent


---------12:28----------
the negative effects of video games go


---------12:30----------
down by about eleven percent


---------12:32----------
the positive effects of video games go


---------12:34----------
down by about one percent


---------12:36----------
they have a 15 reduction in anxiety and


---------12:39----------
a 17


---------12:39----------
reduction in depression after 12 weeks


---------12:43----------
of group coaching so like


---------12:44----------
remember what's the effect size of


---------12:46----------
antidepressant medication on depression


---------12:48----------
do you guys remember


---------12:50----------
so personal coaching so this is


---------12:52----------
interesting right


---------12:53----------
so if we look at eight weeks of group


---------12:55----------
coaching


---------12:56----------
and eight weeks of personal coaching we


---------12:59----------
see that personal coaching


---------13:00----------
has a 20 improvement in meaning after


---------13:03----------
eight weeks


---------13:04----------
so these people get more than a six


---------13:06----------
percent versus seven percent


---------13:08----------
agency or control negative effects of


---------13:11----------
video games ten percent versus fourteen


---------13:13----------
percent


---------13:14----------
and this is pretty cool like they


---------13:15----------
actually enjoy video games more at the


---------13:17----------
eight week mark


---------13:19----------
the positive effects of video games are


---------13:20----------
actually improved which is something


---------13:21----------
that


---------13:22----------
really no one else looks at besides us


---------13:24----------
because the rest of the world just


---------13:25----------
thinks about video game addiction


---------13:26----------
er video games bad what i've come to


---------13:29----------
realize is that video games have


---------13:30----------
positive


---------13:31----------
good things and bad things about video


---------13:33----------
games 17 reduction in anxiety 17


---------13:36----------
reduction in depression now if you


---------13:38----------
compare the 12-week mark


---------13:39----------
right so group coaching catches up and


---------13:41----------
then theoretically even like


---------13:43----------
personal coaching drops down a little


---------13:45----------
bit


---------13:46----------
um at the 12-week mark we're not really


---------13:48----------
sure why that is


---------13:49----------
i think some of this may be sampling


---------13:51----------
bias which i can get into details but


---------13:53----------
but generally speaking group coaching


---------13:55----------
catches up to personal coaching at 12


---------13:57----------
weeks


---------13:58----------
and the other thing is i don't know if


---------13:59----------
you guys know this but about a third of


---------14:01----------
our coaching hours


---------14:02----------
are free coaching so we also looked at


---------14:05----------
free coaching


---------14:06----------
so this is pretty interesting right so


---------14:08----------
if you look at free coaching is personal


---------14:09----------
by the way


---------14:11----------
so our free coaching cohort actually


---------14:14----------
improves more than our paid coaching


---------14:16----------
cohort


---------14:16----------
so like the question that we wondered is


---------14:18----------
like is our free coaching


---------14:21----------
lower quality than our personal coaching


---------14:23----------
and it turns out that the answer


---------14:25----------
is no in theory it's maybe even superior


---------14:28----------
i don't i think there's some issues with


---------14:29----------
this data but


---------14:30----------
generally speaking it means that if


---------14:31----------
you're if you're a free coaching client


---------14:33----------
you're not getting the shaft


---------14:34----------
okay so don't worry about it the point


---------14:37----------
here though is that if you look at these


---------14:38----------
effect sizes like i mean all these like


---------14:40----------
numbers 19


---------14:41----------
versus 18 you know 19 here 14


---------14:45----------
here whatever the ballpark is that like


---------14:48----------
it's about 20


---------14:49----------
right like like there's about a 20


---------14:52----------
reduction


---------14:53----------
15 18 reduction 18


---------14:56----------
reduction 20 reduction like it's


---------14:59----------
somewhere around 20


---------15:00----------
so our our coaching program works so


---------15:02----------
people were wondering okay how do we


---------15:05----------
measure this so here's an example


---------15:08----------
of like the kinds of data we collect so


---------15:10----------
when we're trying to assess for


---------15:12----------
purpose or meaning we ask people does


---------15:14----------
your life


---------15:15----------
lack direction my life that lacks


---------15:17----------
direction my life has purpose i'm


---------15:19----------
excited to get out of bed in the morning


---------15:21----------
i have forward momentum in life i feel


---------15:23----------
stuck in life so like


---------15:24----------
these are the things that get 20 percent


---------15:27----------
better after eight weeks


---------15:29----------
and when you guys are thinking about


---------15:30----------
like 20 so i i know that


---------15:32----------
you know we make it sound like 20 isn't


---------15:34----------
very big but let me tell you as a


---------15:35----------
clinician a 20


---------15:37----------
improvement in depression is huge right


---------15:39----------
so just think about this like what if


---------15:41----------
you


---------15:41----------
you know you're you weighed 20 less


---------15:44----------
or 20 more than you do what if you were


---------15:46----------
20 taller or 20


---------15:48----------
shorter 20 is a big difference and


---------15:50----------
especially when it comes to something


---------15:52----------
like depression because


---------15:53----------
all it takes is like you to start moving


---------15:56----------
in the right direction for you to start


---------15:58----------
taking care of yourself better


---------15:59----------
so there's like a cumulative a 20


---------16:02----------
improvement


---------16:02----------
in meaning from week to week even if


---------16:06----------
it's a 20


---------16:07----------
increase if you have more meaning in


---------16:11----------
your life when you wake up if you're


---------16:12----------
excited to


---------16:13----------
if you're 20 more excited to get out of


---------16:15----------
bed every morning


---------16:16----------
that's going to be an effect that will


---------16:18----------
build up over the course of a year


---------16:20----------
and your life will start to change so


---------16:23----------
twenty percent


---------16:24----------
i'm happy with these are the kinds of


---------16:26----------
things so like this is like closer to a


---------16:27----------
ten percent improvement right


---------16:28----------
i'm too dis undisciplined to make


---------16:30----------
meaningful change


---------16:31----------
unfortunately we only help that by about


---------16:33----------
ten percent we're working on that by the


---------16:35----------
way we're working on improving our


---------16:36----------
intervention to help with this


---------16:38----------
right so this is the kind of data that


---------16:40----------
we collect so this is why we do coaching


---------16:43----------
and this is why we did this like we


---------16:45----------
started this whole thing because


---------16:47----------
because you all need help and is a


---------16:49----------
society


---------16:50----------
my profession and myself included or


---------16:53----------
failing you guys


---------16:54----------
psychiatry is failing y'all and that's


---------16:56----------
why we started this you know


---------16:57----------
this coaching program was built


---------17:01----------
on your support and so i i felt like it


---------17:03----------
was important to share with you guys


---------17:06----------
why we're doing what we're doing what


---------17:08----------
we're doing and


---------17:09----------
what the data looks like and and i hope


---------17:11----------
you guys it's kind of funny right


---------17:12----------
because


---------17:13----------
i mean we showed you the data like i


---------17:14----------
didn't sugarcoat anything like that's


---------17:16----------
the actual data and so there


---------17:18----------
are weird things in the data like


---------17:19----------
personal coaching like


---------17:21----------
you know purpose drops by one percent


---------17:23----------
from week eight to week 12. so like we


---------17:25----------
don't know what's going on there


---------17:26----------
i i don't really know um but that's the


---------17:29----------
actual data and i think our program is


---------17:31----------
successful and people


---------17:32----------
you know people are grateful for having


---------17:35----------
worked with a coach like their life


---------17:36----------
is starting to transform because of the


---------17:38----------
work that they do with their coach


---------17:40----------
and our coaches are highly dedicated


---------17:43----------
people


---------17:44----------
really smart because that's the thing


---------17:45----------
like we pull from our population right


---------17:47----------
so like gamers are smart


---------17:48----------
you give them like someone to help and


---------17:50----------
you say like hey


---------17:51----------
if you show up one hour a week and you


---------17:54----------
give


---------17:55----------
everything all of your attention all of


---------17:57----------
your compassion and all of your


---------17:59----------
intelligence


---------18:00----------
to one person you can make a difference


---------18:02----------
in their life


---------18:03----------
and our coaches wake up every day and


---------18:05----------
they like they knock it out of the park


---------18:07----------
and what they do is these are these are


---------18:08----------
noobs from the internet with a few


---------18:10----------
months of training


---------18:12----------
have effect sizes that are arguably


---------18:14----------
comparable


---------18:15----------
to the breakthrough drugs of like


---------18:19----------
big pharma right and it's like noobs


---------18:21----------
from the internet and it's because they


---------18:23----------
care and it's because they try


---------18:24----------
and it's because the kind of help that


---------18:26----------
we deliver


---------18:28----------
is actually design it's coaching it's


---------18:30----------
not medical treatment


---------18:31----------
it's not designed to treat depression


---------18:33----------
it's designed to like


---------18:35----------
help you move forward in life because


---------18:37----------
sometimes you guys may be depressed but


---------18:39----------
that doesn't mean you're mentally ill it


---------18:41----------
just means that


---------18:42----------
your life is like not that great right


---------18:45----------
now


---------18:45----------
so make it worth living and that's what


---------18:48----------
our coaches are there to help you do


---------18:49----------
they're there to help you understand how


---------18:52----------
you work


---------18:53----------
and so once you understand how you work


---------18:55----------
you can play the game of life


---------18:57----------
in the way that you want it's about


---------19:00----------
applying


---------19:01----------
self understanding to building the life


---------19:03----------
that you want to


---------19:05----------
and that's what we're doing and so thank


---------19:08----------
you guys very much
