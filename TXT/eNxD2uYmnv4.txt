---------00:00----------
right right you started off as a


---------00:01----------
deprived so you had no gear


---------00:04----------
so when you get because you're running


---------00:07----------
around in a loincloth at a club


---------00:09----------
I'm a slow-rolling deprived for


---------00:11----------
something yeah like if someone deserves


---------00:16----------
a break it's you buddy


---------00:23----------
so bulliest is that what I'm calling you


---------00:27----------
today buddy or Matt either one okay one


---------00:31----------
doesn't bother me so Matt thanks for


---------00:33----------
coming on thank thanks for coming on


---------00:36----------
stream man you're welcome I mean yeah


---------00:38----------
like I said earlier should Google won


---------00:40----------
hey thinking use them no worries so tell


---------00:42----------
us a little bit about what's going on


---------00:44----------
and and what's going on in your life and


---------00:46----------
how we can be helpful for you I mean


---------00:51----------
it's like a lot of things right I I'd


---------00:55----------
say like I kind of struggle with like


---------00:57----------
moving forward in life and having a


---------00:59----------
purpose and sort of like just knowing


---------01:04----------
what to do with myself okay motivation


---------01:07----------
definitely one big thing okay and so


---------01:12----------
when you say it's a lot of different


---------01:13----------
things that sounds to me kind of like


---------01:15----------
one thing what do you mean with that


---------01:19----------
well having so it sounds like you just


---------01:21----------
don't know what to do with yourself like


---------01:22----------
right that's why you don't have


---------01:24----------
motivation like you don't know what


---------01:25----------
you're what you don't know what you're


---------01:26----------
doing in life yeah okay yeah that's fair


---------01:29----------
enough yeah so why is it that we if if


---------01:35----------
you just don't know what's going on like


---------01:36----------
why do we come up with multiple answers


---------01:38----------
like how do you think that works say


---------01:44----------
that it again well okay let me ask you


---------01:46----------
this so the basic problem is that your


---------01:48----------
directionless in life right right but


---------01:52----------
when I asked you what's bringing you on


---------01:54----------
you say it's a lot of different stuff


---------01:59----------
right right right so let's just let's


---------02:02----------
just explore for a second why it is that


---------02:05----------
we feel like a lot of different things


---------02:06----------
are going wrong when there's just one


---------02:08----------
root problem um maybe sort of the


---------02:12----------
symptoms of that absolutely absolutely


---------02:15----------
so let me ask you something Matt do you


---------02:18----------
feel like you're overwhelmed I'd say so


---------02:22----------
I think I'm pretty overwhelmed with


---------02:24----------
everything yeah right so I want you to


---------02:27----------
just notice for a second that even


---------02:29----------
though there's one problem that the


---------02:32----------
feeling of being overwhelmed makes you


---------02:35----------
think that there are a thousand


---------02:36----------
different


---------02:37----------
like you see all of the symptoms and


---------02:40----------
that's exactly what feeling overwhelmed


---------02:41----------
does when we feel overwhelmed we take


---------02:44----------
one problem and we can see all of the


---------02:46----------
different things going on with it


---------02:48----------
and that overwhelms us and also


---------02:51----------
paralyzes us you're smiling


---------02:52----------
why are you smiling either I don't know


---------02:56----------
awkwardness or just okay realizing what


---------02:58----------
you're saying okay so how do you feel


---------03:01----------
right now


---------03:03----------
ank yes okay what what do you mean by


---------03:08----------
anxious um just being on streams like


---------03:12----------
share 50 people or whatever sort of


---------03:14----------
thing okay Wow there are 50 people


---------03:17----------
okay well we'll lose viewership soon


---------03:19----------
don't worry thanks for coming on and


---------03:22----------
being honest with us because I think


---------03:24----------
this helps a lot of people so thank you


---------03:25----------
for doing that yeah no worries so what


---------03:27----------
is it that feels overwhelming um it's


---------03:39----------
you're just trying to figure out cuz I


---------03:41----------
feel like there's so many options with


---------03:43----------
like what to do with my life and it's


---------03:44----------
also like I don't really know how to


---------03:46----------
find that or even figure out what I'm


---------03:49----------
doing or what I'm doing wrong or yeah


---------03:52----------
you know what I mean yeah so I'm here


---------03:55----------
what I'm hearing from you is that you


---------03:56----------
don't know where to start


---------03:57----------
I'd say yeah that's a pretty pretty


---------04:01----------
accurate yeah so so I think that the


---------04:05----------
challenge here is that I think Matt


---------04:07----------
you're a smart guy and so the problem


---------04:08----------
with being a smart guy is that you can


---------04:11----------
see many different options right like


---------04:12----------
you're you're a hypothetical analytical


---------04:14----------
capability you can say to yourself oh I


---------04:17----------
could do this or I could do this or I


---------04:18----------
could do this or I could do this but


---------04:20----------
then it's hard for you to figure out


---------04:22----------
which one to actually do right so what


---------04:27----------
do you what do you think it is that so


---------04:31----------
tell me what don't you like about your


---------04:33----------
life right now and only I feel


---------04:40----------
myself all the time I don't like feeling


---------04:44----------
like there's a lot of like chaos and


---------04:46----------
things that are I can't


---------04:47----------
I struggle they do like do the dishes or


---------04:50----------
clean my room and do my laundry like so


---------04:52----------
much stuff that regular people can just


---------04:54----------
you normally not feeling like I have a


---------04:57----------
purpose or goal definitely as well okay


---------05:00----------
how do you feel about yourself it's been


---------05:03----------
slowly getting better but I don't think


---------05:05----------
I a lot of time I just don't feel good


---------05:09----------
in general not kind of applies to myself


---------05:11----------
as well


---------05:11----------
looking like what just not liking who I


---------05:14----------
am or I've been I've been able to look


---------05:16----------
in the mirror and like lay like how I


---------05:17----------
look more recently but just like um


---------05:19----------
being beating myself up over mistakes


---------05:22----------
and stuff like that okay do you feel


---------05:26----------
like you're kind of a bad person at


---------05:29----------
times be like you're a waste of space no


---------05:35----------
I don't think I'm a waste of space but


---------05:37----------
okay yeah I mean I generally say I'm a


---------05:42----------
pretty decent person like I try not to


---------05:44----------
be a crappy person but I mean everyone


---------05:46----------
is good for you man so but everyone what


---------05:49----------
everyone has their moments right and


---------05:51----------
like everyone can mess up and do things


---------05:53----------
that aren't good right yeah and it


---------05:56----------
sounds like you've been practicing yet


---------05:58----------
forgiving yourself for those moments um


---------06:01----------
[Music]


---------06:03----------
yeah kind of I think so somewhat okay so


---------06:12----------
oddly enough I'm not hearing anything


---------06:14----------
that makes me think of so it sounds like


---------06:18----------
you have kind of a low estimation of


---------06:20----------
yourself right help me understand what


---------06:25----------
kind of thoughts you have I mean I can


---------06:31----------
be like very critical of myself over


---------06:33----------
things that are like dumb or like well


---------06:37----------
okay hold on so why do you think they're


---------06:41----------
dumb I think I don't know something


---------06:47----------
aren't important so do you see what


---------06:50----------
you're doing right there


---------06:51----------
you're being critical of the way that


---------06:53----------
you're critical of yourself because


---------06:55----------
you're calling them dumb great right you


---------06:58----------
see that it's a whole whole thing yeah


---------07:00----------
yeah it's like a whole meta level thing


---------07:02----------
yeah so what are you critical of


---------07:06----------
yourself about it's hard to think okay


---------07:17----------
okay so let me help you out so you


---------07:20----------
mentioned earlier that you struggled to


---------07:23----------
do a lot of things that normal people


---------07:25----------
can do right like what like yeah like do


---------07:30----------
my dishes and I was going to the gym for


---------07:32----------
a while but then I stopped I'm okay and


---------07:34----------
broke up and like doing recycling like


---------07:37----------
doing just like the general things like


---------07:39----------
showering every day and okay brush my


---------07:42----------
teeth like take care taking care of


---------07:44----------
yourself yeah or not taking care of


---------07:46----------
yourself right yeah and and is that


---------07:49----------
something that what so do you this is


---------07:52----------
gonna sound weird do you think that


---------07:53----------
that's a dumb thing to be mad at


---------07:55----------
yourself about or an appropriate thing


---------07:57----------
to be mad at yourself about no that's


---------07:59----------
that's appropriate okay so I want you to


---------08:04----------
just notice the critical nature of your


---------08:06----------
mind right it's like your mind has


---------08:08----------
actually like a mode of operation what


---------08:10----------
what game your gamer yeah what do you


---------08:13----------
play I was playing Dark Souls earlier I


---------08:15----------
also play a lot of like MMOs I grew up


---------08:17----------
on like Korean MMO is like maplestory


---------08:20----------
and stuff like that okay


---------08:21----------
okay so you know in Dark Souls we have


---------08:25----------
different loadouts right right so right


---------08:28----------
now your mind has equipped the self


---------08:30----------
critical loadout right and so it doesn't


---------08:34----------
matter like what you know it's like you


---------08:39----------
know so I would say the self critical


---------08:41----------
loadout is almost like slow rolling in


---------08:43----------
Dark Souls like it doesn't matter what


---------08:45----------
armor you're wearing if you're slow


---------08:47----------
rolling you're slow rolling so you can


---------08:49----------
try to change as many different things


---------08:51----------
as you want to about your equipment but


---------08:53----------
if you're if you're slow rolling it's


---------08:54----------
always gonna be slow lowering it's the


---------08:56----------
only thing that your mind knows how to


---------08:57----------
do right so you can be self-critical


---------09:00----------
like so the


---------09:01----------
first thing that I want you to do if if


---------09:03----------
you want to be free from your


---------09:05----------
self-critical thoughts there are a


---------09:06----------
couple of things that we're gonna work


---------09:08----------
on the first thing though is just to


---------09:10----------
notice what your mind is doing right


---------09:12----------
because this phone okay so a lot of


---------09:18----------
times like we operate based on what our


---------09:21----------
mind tells us to do but we don't really


---------09:23----------
question the operations of our mind it's


---------09:29----------
like if you wake up one day and you


---------09:30----------
decide like okay I don't feel like


---------09:31----------
showering you sort of fight a little war


---------09:33----------
with your mind but you never try to


---------09:34----------
understand like why is it that I am


---------09:36----------
don't want a shower you try to fight


---------09:41----------
your mind you don't try to understand it


---------09:42----------
right so the first thing that I want you


---------09:46----------
to do is just try to catch yourself when


---------09:47----------
you make a self critical thought and


---------09:49----------
we're gonna talk some more and I'm gonna


---------09:51----------
keep an eye out for it and I want twitch


---------09:53----------
chat to keep an eye out for it okay


---------09:55----------
okay I'm not actually watching twitch


---------09:57----------
chat but I don't know I mean anything


---------09:59----------
okay since we were saying don't was just


---------10:00----------
yeah don't watch twitch chat so alright


---------10:06----------
the first thing is just I want you to


---------10:08----------
notice the the self-critical mind and


---------10:10----------
notice how like your neurons have


---------10:11----------
basically locked into a pattern of self


---------10:14----------
judgment and the reason that this is a


---------10:16----------
problem like if you are judging yourself


---------10:18----------
and you're critical towards yourself


---------10:19----------
what do you think that does for your


---------10:21----------
motivation does not help okay so I want


---------10:29----------
you to now we're gonna expand that a


---------10:31----------
little bit do you think it motivates you


---------10:32----------
to do some things yeah


---------10:37----------
I'd see sometimes yeah yeah like what


---------10:49----------
don't blink


---------10:51----------
okay that's okay so so it's it's it's


---------10:54----------
it's good enough that I think you're


---------10:56----------
aware that maybe somewhere in there


---------10:58----------
there's some kind of motivation you're


---------10:59----------
just not able to figure out what it is


---------11:01----------
and so let me help you out so this is


---------11:02----------
what I want you to understand Matt when


---------11:05----------
you wake up to play video games like if


---------11:08----------
you play video games all day like what I


---------11:09----------
want you to think about for a moment and


---------11:11----------
appreciate is not it's not that you lack


---------11:13----------
motivation it's just that you're


---------11:15----------
motivated to play video games all day


---------11:17----------
like if you think about like if you're


---------11:19----------
if you're playing video games so much


---------11:23----------
that you're not like let's say showering


---------11:25----------
or brushing your teeth or taking out the


---------11:26----------
recycling that's actually a very high


---------11:29----------
degree of motivation you're so motivated


---------11:31----------
to play games that you're you're letting


---------11:34----------
all this other basic stuff like fall to


---------11:36----------
the side like imagine I was an artist


---------11:38----------
and I went into my studio and for three


---------11:42----------
days and three nights I shat in a bucket


---------11:45----------
I didn't brush my teeth and I didn't


---------11:47----------
shower and I produced this great work of


---------11:48----------
art we would call me highly motivated


---------11:52----------
right yeah but like so the first thing


---------11:56----------
is that for you to understand that you


---------11:57----------
actually have a lot of motivation it's


---------11:59----------
just not in the direction that you want


---------12:01----------
so this is where I think negative


---------12:04----------
emotions and negative feelings about


---------12:06----------
yourself are gonna motivate you to do


---------12:08----------
some things and mainly what they're


---------12:10----------
gonna motivate you towards us to be


---------12:11----------
avoidant right let's just say you


---------12:18----------
wouldn't yeah yeah right so give us some


---------12:20----------
examples help us understand that so for


---------12:25----------
example my I got in a car accident with


---------12:29----------
my with my ex like a pretty the end of


---------12:33----------
September okay and my parents didn't


---------12:35----------
know about it until like two-week nerds


---------12:38----------
like a weaker - yeah I think about a


---------12:41----------
week ago like last weekend sort of


---------12:43----------
things because I was just like so scared


---------12:46----------
of like how they would react that I just


---------12:48----------
didn't didn't tell them okay so let's


---------12:53----------
think of


---------12:54----------
that for a second so when you're afraid


---------12:56----------
of how they're going to react how can I


---------13:01----------
say this so that sounds like a


---------13:07----------
reasonable fear or your parents rough


---------13:09----------
with you sometimes I'd say so


---------13:12----------
okay can you tell us a little bit about


---------13:19----------
that um I know my brothers in here as


---------13:24----------
well so you can probably really sort of


---------13:27----------
but I think kind of my last brother yeah


---------13:31----------
my thoughts on it or I say my might I


---------13:36----------
saw my dad recently cuz he lives he


---------13:38----------
lives in the province over so like kind


---------13:40----------
of far and he can be very he can be very


---------13:46----------
like abrasive I guess he can be very


---------13:48----------
negative like hard to hard to get along


---------13:51----------
with cuz he's always like complaining


---------13:52----------
about stuff or I mean he's been better


---------13:56----------
like he's been more supportive but


---------13:58----------
that's like weird more recent uh-huh


---------14:01----------
sometimes I would like I would visit him


---------14:02----------
and I'd be like I don't want to be here


---------14:04----------
because just because of the way he acts


---------14:05----------
like it's hard to be around him for like


---------14:07----------
a long period of time how does it how


---------14:09----------
does that feel when you're around him it


---------14:12----------
just feels weird I mean and it like he


---------14:15----------
feels just awkward sort of thing I feel


---------14:17----------
like what feels weird about it


---------14:22----------
just I think my


---------14:23----------
relationship with him so it's like I


---------14:25----------
don't know how to how to act run him


---------14:27----------
like to dream like a friend really be


---------14:28----------
dad like okay it's just odd yeah it


---------14:33----------
sounds like you don't know what you're


---------14:36----------
supposed to do when you're with him


---------14:37----------
right like you don't know what to say or


---------14:40----------
you don't know how to actor yeah it's I


---------14:46----------
see it's generally kind of what it feels


---------14:48----------
like with family and I feel like when I


---------14:50----------
when I tried to be


---------14:52----------
I tried to be like honest sometimes it


---------14:55----------
can get me in trouble or can you help me


---------14:59----------
understand that so like I basically I


---------15:04----------
had a whole big argument with my parents


---------15:07----------
the other day over like I was kind of


---------15:11----------
talking about my mental health with my


---------15:12----------
mom and she didn't um she's like oh do


---------15:17----------
you think your your mental health


---------15:19----------
affects your motivation I was like yeah


---------15:20----------
she said where do you think that comes


---------15:22----------
from and I'm like well I think when you


---------15:24----------
guys got divorced those kind of the


---------15:26----------
whole catalyst for everything right or


---------15:28----------
the starting point because that's in my


---------15:31----------
mind that's where I think it was like


---------15:33----------
where it started from


---------15:34----------
and what do you mean by that what


---------15:37----------
started with what how old are you and


---------15:39----------
your parents got divorced probably 7 or


---------15:44----------
8 yeah look at seven six seventy tumor


---------15:46----------
in those three years and what do you


---------15:49----------
think it was that started I think like


---------15:52----------
just sort of like a downward spiral of


---------15:54----------
uh of me not feeling good about myself


---------15:58----------
and not doing like things I should be


---------16:01----------
doing like my homework or just kind of


---------16:06----------
yeah just not feeling good all the time


---------16:08----------
or not I'm doing like good about


---------16:11----------
anything or sort of just the depression


---------16:15----------
sort of thing I think okay when you say


---------16:18----------
the depression sort of things so it


---------16:20----------
sounds like you started to not do the


---------16:23----------
things that you were supposed to do it


---------16:25----------
sounds like you started to feel bad


---------16:27----------
about yourself I'd say so long it's hard


---------16:32----------
my memories kind of been messed up over


---------16:35----------
the over the years they used to be a lot


---------16:37----------
better


---------16:38----------
but so I don't really remember a lot of


---------16:41----------
it but I know that was like the starting


---------16:44----------
point what do you remember um I just


---------16:57----------
remember feeling like really alone in my


---------16:59----------
life


---------16:59----------
for a long time mm-hmm like it's


---------17:03----------
probably the biggest thing what is it


---------17:07----------
like to feel alone just I don't know


---------17:15----------
like there's nobody supports you or


---------17:17----------
nobody cares about you enough to like


---------17:20----------
wonder how you're feeling or or how


---------17:22----------
you're doing there mm-hmm and you did


---------17:27----------
your parents did your parents ever talk


---------17:29----------
to you about how the divorce was


---------17:30----------
affecting you not really I don't think


---------17:34----------
so


---------17:37----------
and you started feeling pretty alone


---------17:39----------
around the age of 7 or 8 mm-hmm yeah


---------17:42----------
that I feel sorry right go ahead oh I


---------17:47----------
was saying because um it was like that


---------17:50----------
and then moving a lot and having like a


---------17:53----------
new stepdad who wasn't the greatest I


---------17:55----------
know also with her stuff right so kind


---------17:58----------
of compounded I guess okay tell me about


---------18:02----------
moving well I moved from Alberta to to


---------18:08----------
to BC in probably I don't know how about


---------18:13----------
how long later like within a year of the


---------18:15----------
divorce so it was like I had I had lost


---------18:18----------
all my friends and hmm


---------18:24----------
was it hard to make new friends at the


---------18:29----------
at the


---------18:30----------
I went to it wasn't too bad but I moved


---------18:34----------
to and after that I moved to an area


---------18:36----------
that's like primarily East Indian people


---------18:39----------
so like people similar to your ethnicity


---------18:41----------
and because I'm like a white kid it was


---------18:44----------
harder to make friends right so that's


---------18:48----------
kind of part of it I think as well not


---------18:51----------
having as many friends wow that sounds


---------18:54----------
kind of rough cuz it sounds like you


---------18:55----------
actually made the first transition okay


---------18:57----------
made some friends and then it sounds


---------19:01----------
like your mom and stepdad up and moved


---------19:03----------
again yeah just when things were going


---------19:06----------
well for you yeah you're making an


---------19:08----------
adjustment and life kicks you when


---------19:10----------
you're when you're just about to get up


---------19:12----------
right intends to I find yeah for sure


---------19:15----------
that's definitely you cut you kind of


---------19:17----------
talk about a downward spiral I think


---------19:19----------
that'll do it yeah sorry man that sucks


---------19:23----------
that's okay it's in the past I guess I


---------19:28----------
think it's in the present yeah what I


---------19:33----------
well I mean yeah it's still if all that


---------19:36----------
stuff still affects me right so yeah I


---------19:37----------
think it's yeah isn't yeah I think it's


---------19:39----------
important to acknowledge that mm-hmm


---------19:42----------
because what does that say about you as


---------19:44----------
a person that it still affects me or


---------19:49----------
yeah because remember I mean somewhere


---------19:54----------
along the way we were talking about how


---------19:55----------
you're like not a it's not that you're


---------19:58----------
not a good person but that you can't you


---------20:02----------
know you're kind of [ __ ] up yeah


---------20:04----------
right that's the sentiment that I get


---------20:07----------
it's not that you're a bad person it's


---------20:08----------
just that you're kind of [ __ ] up


---------20:11----------
let's say so yeah and so what I'm kind


---------20:15----------
of curious about is like do you deserve


---------20:18----------
a little bit of slack I think so but I


---------20:23----------
mean when I try to be honest with like I


---------20:26----------
think he's so what I when I tried to be


---------20:31----------
honest with my parents about that like


---------20:33----------
they just got angry and thought I was


---------20:35----------
like blaming them for everything that


---------20:36----------
I'd done and stuff I was like kind of


---------20:39----------
understandable I mean I talked to about


---------20:41----------
it with my therapist a little okay and I


---------20:43----------
can understand why


---------20:44----------
got mad but it's like I don't know but I


---------20:47----------
just want them to kind of understand


---------20:48----------
that like everything had an effect on me


---------20:51----------
mm-hmm but I don't think that's probably


---------20:53----------
I don't think it's gonna happen so yeah


---------20:55----------
I think it can be rough it can be hard


---------20:58----------
for parents to understand that it can be


---------21:02----------
hard for one human being to understand


---------21:04----------
that my actions can affect you and that


---------21:09----------
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's


---------21:11----------
my fault but that at the same time it


---------21:14----------
can be hard for you right you know it


---------21:18----------
can be very hard for parents to not hear


---------21:20----------
blame when you kind of talk about


---------21:22----------
something like a divorce which may have


---------21:24----------
been the right move on some level still


---------21:27----------
like I mean some some things are gonna


---------21:28----------
be shitty and like that's just how it is


---------21:30----------
it doesn't mean that it's necessarily


---------21:31----------
their fault right so do you think you


---------21:38----------
deserve some slack I think so


---------21:44----------
but I mean yeah at the same time I feel


---------21:46----------
like I'm still pretty critical of myself


---------21:47----------
because of yeah right since there's the


---------21:50----------
slow roll right so so when we think a


---------21:57----------
little bit about what you've been


---------21:58----------
through like it's reasonable to think


---------22:00----------
that you know you're not just [ __ ] up


---------22:02----------
everything I mean I think you've been


---------22:04----------
dealt a kind of a rough hand right right


---------22:06----------
you started off as a deprived so you had


---------22:09----------
no gear it's when you get because you're


---------22:13----------
running around in a loincloth in a club


---------22:15----------
I'm a slow rolling deprived for saying


---------22:17----------
yeah like if someone deserves a break


---------22:22----------
it's you buddy


---------22:23----------
cuz you managed to slow roll in a


---------22:25----------
loincloth like that's not easy to do in


---------22:27----------
dark school so why don't you give


---------22:33----------
yourself a break cuz I feel like I could


---------22:39----------
be doing more to help myself


---------22:41----------
but I'm not I don't know how and what is


---------22:44----------
that that's the slow roll right see that


---------22:48----------
mm-hmm you're you're you're not doing


---------22:52----------
good enough you're [ __ ] it up


---------22:54----------
we could be helping yourself more Matt


---------22:59----------
why don't you help yourself more there


---------23:02----------
it is again so I mean I think the hard


---------23:05----------
thing is like you know these thoughts


---------23:07----------
that you have are kind of like a hedge


---------23:09----------
maze like everywhere you turn it's just


---------23:10----------
hedge hedge hedge


---------23:11----------
everywhere you turn it's like critical


---------23:13----------
critical critical right right it's hard


---------23:17----------
to get anywhere when you're slow rolling


---------23:19----------
just takes a long time yeah and so what


---------23:26----------
do we what do we do about that


---------23:28----------
I don't know okay how do you think if


---------23:39----------
you were your friend what would you do


---------23:41----------
[Music]


---------23:47----------
still don't know okay I'll just


---------23:51----------
Asya my situation I don't know it's just


---------23:53----------
weird to think about I don't know what I


---------23:57----------
would even do I probably help someone


---------23:59----------
but I don't know how I'd help them okay


---------24:02----------
so oddly enough Matt that's the first


---------24:06----------
fast roll you've done I want to point


---------24:11----------
out what you did right so like you said


---------24:13----------
like I don't know how I would help them


---------24:15----------
but I would I want to help they deserve


---------24:19----------
help I just don't know how that's not


---------24:24----------
self-critical that's actually like


---------24:26----------
acknowledgement you see that if not you


---------24:33----------
got to let me know I would even by its


---------24:35----------
acknowledgment so I think that you're in


---------24:38----------
a tough situation and you don't know how


---------24:40----------
to move forward but there's a big


---------24:43----------
difference between the slow roll which


---------24:45----------
is why don't you know how to move


---------24:46----------
forward Matt right and I don't know how


---------24:49----------
to move forward do you see the


---------24:51----------
difference between those two statements


---------24:52----------
yeah what's the difference once more


---------24:57----------
constructive in what way


---------25:02----------
it's not just me beating myself you


---------25:04----------
I think the other thing is it's an


---------25:07----------
acknowledgement of where you are because


---------25:10----------
all of your self-critical thoughts are


---------25:12----------
about where you should be


---------25:15----------
does that make sense yeah you should be


---------25:18----------
helping yourself more you should be


---------25:19----------
taking care of yourself better you


---------25:21----------
shouldn't let all this stuff from the


---------25:22----------
past affect you we can we can replace


---------25:24----------
all those self-critical thoughts with


---------25:26----------
the word shut there's actually a big


---------25:29----------
difference between I should be helping


---------25:31----------
myself more and I don't know how to help


---------25:33----------
myself even though that sounds like a


---------25:36----------
statement of ignorance I actually think


---------25:38----------
it's a statement of knowledge it's I


---------25:41----------
know that I don't know what to do right


---------25:45----------
that I actually think is incredibly


---------25:47----------
powerful that may not feel like it but I


---------25:50----------
think that's the first step for it and


---------25:52----------
sort of saying hey like I'm sort of


---------25:53----------
stuck here I'm not hearing any blame I'm


---------25:57----------
not I'm not hearing like why am I stuck


---------25:59----------
here like why did I end up in this place


---------26:01----------
why didn't I why couldn't I get out of


---------26:03----------
this place you're just kind of saying


---------26:05----------
like well here I am I don't really know


---------26:09----------
what to do here I have the slow rolling


---------26:12----------
deprived it's gonna be hard it's gonna


---------26:16----------
be hard to beat anything if I'm slow


---------26:19----------
rolling around with the you know with


---------26:22----------
the obese body type in Dark Souls can't


---------26:25----------
even begun dear yeah gun dears Hardman


---------26:29----------
yeah I died to him three times every


---------26:31----------
other class I've beaten in one try as


---------26:33----------
pontiff so gun dears in three right


---------26:38----------
there's the gun dieren wait yeah yeah


---------26:42----------
yeah but the way to beat gun deer is


---------26:45----------
just to hand your club and you don't


---------26:46----------
need to roll he's got a stun his ass


---------26:49----------
he's got he's got low fatigue right or


---------26:52----------
whatever that is guard brain or whatever


---------26:54----------
Pulis aminah yeah just go to town and


---------26:57----------
that's what you got a dude stop slow


---------26:59----------
rolling just go to town start picking up


---------27:04----------
the clover yes yeah yeah so what is


---------27:06----------
picking up the club for you what does


---------27:07----------
that mean doing something


---------27:14----------
that feels like I'm moving forward I


---------27:16----------
guess yeah


---------27:18----------
I would even stop but take a step back


---------27:20----------
from feels like you're moving forward


---------27:22----------
just do something move forward what does


---------27:24----------
that mean practically


---------27:27----------
um like yeah I just try to do something


---------27:34----------
that will lead to something better I


---------27:36----------
guess yeah what does that mean I don't


---------27:44----------
know what's something that you're not


---------27:46----------
doing right you've mentioned a couple of


---------27:48----------
concrete things right like what if you


---------27:51----------
meant sure like what like cleaning my


---------27:56----------
room okay what in your room needs to be


---------27:59----------
cleaned I need to do my laundry and


---------28:03----------
dishes and stuff laundry and dishes how


---------28:05----------
long does that take


---------28:08----------
there's a lot of laundry so let's take a


---------28:11----------
while but I think the dishes would take


---------28:13----------
me a maybe like a half hour and how long


---------28:15----------
how are you gonna do your laundry like


---------28:22----------
just put it in the washing machine and


---------28:24----------
then the dryer okay so we're gonna do a


---------28:27----------
little bit of meditation because I hear


---------28:29----------
people on stream want to do more


---------28:30----------
meditation okay okay so I want you to


---------28:34----------
close your eyes sit up straight


---------28:36----------
I want you to tell me how you feel right


---------28:38----------
now um I don't know kind of anxious a


---------28:47----------
little I think but okay anxious


---------28:50----------
generally okay what do you feel in your


---------28:52----------
body just like my hands I guess okay so


---------29:00----------
I just want you to take a snapshot of


---------29:02----------
how you feel right now


---------29:03----------
I want you to notice that there's some


---------29:04----------
anxiety but I would guess that there's a


---------29:06----------
certain heaviness which you've gotten


---------29:08----------
used to feeling mm-hmm right does that


---------29:12----------
make sense to you yeah I do so you kind


---------29:16----------
of feel heavy although other time I'd


---------29:18----------
say yeah okay so I want you to check


---------29:20----------
your incumbrance right now and just make


---------29:22----------
a mental note of what it is


---------29:24----------
okay okay that's what we're gonna do so


---------29:28----------
now I want you to open your eyes you


---------29:31----------
have dishes in your room yeah okay so


---------29:34----------
you have was the washing machine being


---------29:37----------
occupied no okay you know where I'm


---------29:40----------

nobody go do dishes and wash yeah so I


---------29:45----------
want you to come back in ten minutes


---------29:46----------
do what you can ten minutes okay can go


---------29:50----------
put in a load of laundry you have a


---------29:51----------
phone or something yeah just set a timer


---------29:55----------
okay and and go put in a load of laundry


---------29:59----------
and do as many dishes as you can okay


---------30:04----------
right so what are we doing right now


---------30:06----------
you're you're equipping that Club like


---------30:07----------
you made the mistake of like hitting the


---------30:09----------
the right direct d-pad button so you


---------30:12----------
swapped out the club for the fists and


---------30:14----------
then it's like we got a straight sword


---------30:17----------
yeah for the broken straight so are


---------30:18----------
there it is and that's not gonna work


---------30:21----------
cuz that's not gonna hurt the not enough


---------30:23----------

---------30:40----------
like this in my life who motivates me to


---------30:41----------

---------30:50----------
to think about the same thing right


---------30:52----------

---------30:56----------
how you feel feel the energy in your


---------31:05----------

---------31:08----------
fatigue like focus on your lower back


---------31:10----------

---------31:24----------
eyes and and just feel the way that you


---------31:27----------

---------31:30----------
around if you've already done yeah if


---------31:34----------
you don't understand what I'm saying


---------31:35----------
that's okay


---------31:37----------
look around at the things that you need


---------31:39----------

---------32:49----------
you guys to follow along and up straight


---------32:53----------
front of you let your heels touch gather


---------33:01----------
and then arms up touch your biceps


---------33:10----------
secret here feel the stretch


---------33:17----------
and touch your toes but yours let your


---------33:25----------
head hang


---------33:35----------
let the weight of your body drag you


---------33:37----------
down


---------33:49----------
[Music]


---------34:07----------
okay but the weight of your body hang


---------34:11----------
down now put your palms by your feet


---------34:16----------
straight line and extend one knee back


---------34:19----------

---------34:25----------
should be aligned your other foot should


---------34:28----------
be back put the other foot back you're


---------34:36----------
gonna kind of be push-up position now


---------34:45----------
lay down on the ground put your forehead


---------34:48----------

---------34:54----------
bit now push up put your hips to the


---------35:01----------
ground push off you want hips on the


---------35:06----------
ground and you want your back bent


---------35:07----------
elbows bent is fine main goal is that


---------35:13----------

---------35:58----------
forward yourself hang arms up


---------36:19----------
close your eyes take a deep breath


---------36:31----------
alright yeah I I realize that that's


---------36:52----------
probably not the ideal way to do yoga


---------36:54----------
because you guys can't you know that's


---------36:57----------
gonna be tough but so I'm gonna had to


---------37:16----------
do this in the restroom so I could


---------37:22----------
dishwashing screen okay yeah so si


---------37:42----------
excess I like it that you can't touch


---------37:44----------
your toes be the change that you want to


---------37:49----------
see in the world I want to see a bunch


---------37:51----------
of inflexible gamers trying to touch


---------37:54----------
their toes not a bunch of flexible yoga


---------37:56----------
teachers actually touching their toes so


---------38:01----------
I have a question for you guys what do


---------38:02----------
you guys think how do you guys think


---------38:04----------
that bully Asst is gonna feel when he


---------38:07----------
comes back anyone have any idea okay


---------38:22----------
let's see alright so we'll see but he's


---------38:33----------
got about a minute or two and then um


---------38:37----------
well I mean I think his laundry's gonna


---------38:40----------
be in the washing machine for a while


---------38:41----------
longer yeah so what do you guys think


---------38:47----------
about that like what are we really doing


---------38:53----------
here like aren't we supposed to be


---------38:54----------
talking about his feelings I'm a


---------38:57----------
psychiatrist isn't that what we talk


---------38:59----------
about


---------38:59----------
doesn't he need therapy talking about


---------39:02----------
how he's depressed his parents are


---------39:03----------
divorced he feels alone


---------39:11----------
how does this work why am I doing this


---------39:13----------
and the other question is so how is it


---------39:24----------
that twitch chat so I'm just gonna read


---------39:25----------
out loud


---------39:26----------
exhausted much better lifted lighter


---------39:28----------
accomplished accomplished motivated


---------39:30----------
refreshed and slightly put proud anxious


---------39:33----------
at peace mini quest completed better


---------39:36----------
dishes aren't nagging him anymore


---------39:38----------
relieved to energized at beat the time


---------39:48----------
nice


---------39:52----------
okay so did you guys hear what he said


---------40:01----------
What did he say I said it Oh am I


---------40:05----------
supposed to say out all right what did


---------40:07----------
you say to beat the timer nice yeah I


---------40:12----------
didn't think I was gonna hear you say


---------40:14----------
the word nice and the way that you did


---------40:16----------
over the course of our session today


---------40:19----------
what does that make sense


---------40:21----------
Oh cuz uh what how did you what is what


---------40:25----------
is that nice what does that mean how's


---------40:28----------
that feels like a good feeling yeah how


---------40:33----------
do you feel right now better in what way


---------40:37----------
yeah feel like I accomplished something


---------40:39----------
did something that I needed to do


---------40:42----------
close your eyes okay how do you feel um


---------40:49----------
a little better yeah just kinda happy


---------40:56----------
excited okay how's your encumbrance a


---------41:04----------
little better but I still feel happy


---------41:06----------
yeah it's a bully açaí think you have a


---------41:11----------
lot of work how do you man I think sorry


---------41:15----------
how do you feel about that


---------41:26----------
I don't know indifferent maybe mm-hmm


---------41:33----------
what happens to that feeling of slight


---------41:35----------
excitement as you start to think about


---------41:37----------
the problems ahead it's like oh [ __ ]


---------41:42----------
absolutely right that's the feeling all


---------41:46----------
right that's the feeling so now this is


---------41:48----------
the big revelation so like if we if I


---------41:51----------
wanted to sell you guys a false sense of


---------41:54----------
joy and hope I wouldn't have asked you


---------41:56----------
what do you think about the future we


---------41:58----------
would have stopped the stream with how


---------41:59----------
do you feel you say better and then I


---------42:01----------
say cure rise and walk you were cured my


---------42:04----------
friend I have fixed but that's not how


---------42:07----------
it works so now we're gonna wait back


---------42:09----------
into the ship and when you start


---------42:13----------
thinking about changing your life you


---------42:15----------
start to feel like this is insignificant


---------42:18----------
right right yeah so now we're gonna do


---------42:23----------
the real teaching okay okay which is


---------42:26----------
what is the difference between how you


---------42:28----------
felt sixty seconds ago and how you feel


---------42:31----------
now or actually not not what is the


---------42:33----------
difference so you understand you feel


---------42:35----------
different you felt good sixty seconds


---------42:36----------
ago now I'm making you feel worse again


---------42:38----------
right indifferent means that the evil


---------42:42----------
ogre that has been lurking in your mind


---------42:44----------
is starting to come out again and it's


---------42:46----------
like like you feel conflicted because


---------42:48----------
you feel hope and that Specter is still


---------42:51----------
there does that make sense I don't think


---------42:54----------
it's truly indifference I think it's


---------42:55----------
conflict right yeah okay okay so what so


---------43:05----------
let's just think about what the mind was


---------43:06----------
doing when you were feeling good and


---------43:08----------
what the mind was doing when you started


---------43:11----------
to feel bad was your your mind in the


---------43:14----------
past present or future when you were


---------43:16----------
feeling good present and when I asked


---------43:22----------
you what does this mean for you going


---------43:24----------
forward where is your mind future yeah


---------43:31----------
yeah and when you're critical about


---------43:33----------
yourself where is your mind pastor


---------43:39----------
beautiful okay so now I just want you to


---------43:45----------
appreciate that for a second


---------43:47----------
and now we're gonna do I want you to do


---------43:53----------
another experiment for us okay and then


---------43:55----------
we're gonna move to QA bulliest unless


---------43:57----------
you want to like talk about your parents


---------43:58----------
and stuff but my mom and I can talk more


---------44:01----------
about it I feel low that like the best


---------44:04----------
way to help you right now is to actually


---------44:05----------
have you do to notice this for a minute


---------44:08----------
so I'm gonna ask you to continue still


---------44:11----------
have more [ __ ] to clean yeah okay so


---------44:15----------
we're gonna we're gonna transition to


---------44:19----------
we're gonna transition to QA but I want


---------44:22----------
you to pay attention to something and I


---------44:23----------
want you to check back in with us in


---------44:25----------
about 15-20 minutes half an hour I want


---------44:28----------
you to do more work and then up and try


---------44:30----------
to notice where your mind is like as you


---------44:35----------
do more work like try to get a sense of


---------44:37----------
okay is my map mine in the past the


---------44:38----------
present or the future and then I want


---------44:42----------
you to come back on in about 15-20


---------44:43----------
minutes after we answer a few questions


---------44:44----------
and then we're gonna talk some more and


---------44:47----------
I want you to try to notice as you start


---------44:50----------
to feel bad where does your mind go okay


---------44:55----------
okay do you have thoughts about what the


---------44:58----------
punch line is or do you want to just


---------45:00----------
wait until we get to the like until you


---------45:02----------
actually do it well I'm sure the punch


---------45:05----------
line is future bad president good okay


---------45:09----------
so experiment right so this is what I


---------45:12----------
want you guys to do at home as well as


---------45:13----------
like understanding intellectually what


---------45:16----------
the punch line is is helpful but what


---------45:19----------
really needs to be done is an


---------45:20----------
experiential understanding in Sanskrit


---------45:23----------
there are two words for knowledge Vidya


---------45:25----------
and yawn Vidya means information Vidya


---------45:29----------
is transmissible in its objective Gian


---------45:32----------
is experiential personal and subjective


---------45:38----------
our society Matt which one do you think


---------45:42----------
our society values more probably the


---------45:49----------
the former yeah Vidhya right yeah


---------45:53----------
information and objective I completely


---------45:56----------
agree with you but if you want to change


---------45:58----------
your life Vidya doesn't do it


---------46:00----------
information does not change your life


---------46:03----------
experience changes your life so knowing


---------46:06----------
the punch line in feeling the punch line


---------46:08----------
or two different things right like


---------46:11----------
you're a smart guy and I bet I could


---------46:13----------
have asked to a chat about like you know


---------46:14----------
past present future but I just want you


---------46:16----------
to appreciate for a moment that when you


---------46:19----------
were living in the present you actually


---------46:21----------
started to feel better


---------46:24----------
you felt excitement twitch at was saying


---------46:28----------
that you looked happy okay like you were


---------46:31----------
smiling but that wasn't an anxious I'm


---------46:33----------
embarrassed because I'm [ __ ] talking


---------46:34----------
to the Internet smile that was like that


---------46:37----------
oh I actually did something today smile


---------46:38----------
those are two different things


---------46:40----------
and then just think about all of the


---------46:43----------
times that you're feeling bad where is


---------46:45----------
your mind somewhere else yeah so now go


---------46:51----------
and test it right so go and continue to


---------46:54----------
do work and check back with us in 15-20


---------46:56----------
minutes okay oh do some recycling huh


---------47:00----------
okay so like how long what are you doing


---------47:04----------
will be doing 15 minutes 20 minutes help


---------47:06----------
me understand what are we doing uh let's


---------47:13----------
try 15 I'm sure there's more stuff I


---------47:14----------
could do anyways okay 15 yeah plenty of


---------47:19----------
stuff I could do okay


---------47:20----------
so we'll check back with you in 15 okay


---------47:23----------
I'll set the timer and then I'll just


---------47:24----------
put music in or whatever okay okay so


---------47:30----------
Vidya and beyond good job dude go for it


---------47:39----------
buddy


---------47:39----------
I think we can talk about your feelings


---------47:41----------
when you get back awesome okay okay


---------47:44----------
we're gonna jump to Q&A for a little bit


---------47:50----------
all right so for


---------47:52----------
question


---------48:07----------
okay our dude is back so we're gonna


---------48:14----------
switch alright so I don't know how much


---------48:35----------
of our congressmen do you catch any of


---------48:36----------
our conversation I heard like uh


---------48:41----------
basically like the latter half of that


---------48:44----------
last thing about girls okay so the


---------48:50----------
question that we had was about like


---------48:51----------
should you focus on yourself or should


---------48:53----------
you ask girls out um but let's come back


---------48:56----------
to the present so tell me how you feel


---------48:58----------
Matt pretty okay what does that mean


---------49:02----------
like not a crappy just okay kind of okay


---------49:07----------
um observant or something like


---------49:14----------
unconscious beautiful right so this is


---------49:18----------
something that's actually really cool


---------49:19----------
that's happening


---------49:20----------
so now you've you've noticed that


---------49:23----------
there's a third way of operating it's


---------49:25----------
not good or bad but that there's


---------49:27----------
actually like there's perpendicular


---------49:29----------
movement on that axis like earlier we


---------49:31----------
were talking about feeling good or


---------49:33----------
feeling bad and now you've discovered


---------49:34----------
that there's a third layer like there's


---------49:36----------
like a layer up here does that make


---------49:38----------
sense yeah and you're just watching


---------49:40----------
yourself right and that that thing


---------49:44----------
doesn't feel good or bad right okay I'm


---------49:52----------
going to ask


---------49:53----------
you something do you feel peaceful yeah


---------49:57----------
I'd say peaceful is a good word for it


---------49:59----------
right so this is something that's really


---------50:02----------
important to understand peacefulness and


---------50:05----------
suffering is on a different axis from


---------50:08----------
emotion excitement happiness joy sadness


---------50:12----------
self-loathing all of those operate over


---------50:15----------
here and peacefulness and suffering are


---------50:20----------
up here okay do you do you it's sort of


---------50:27----------
like a neutral feeling right yeah like


---------50:31----------
you're watching yourself right yeah so


---------50:34----------
that's the first step to something


---------50:35----------
called vairagya or detachment there's


---------50:40----------
space you used to be all here and now a


---------50:42----------
piece of you has moved over here and


---------50:45----------
it's kind of like a weird neutral like


---------50:48----------
it doesn't feel bad it doesn't feel


---------50:49----------
joyous but it sort of feels good it's


---------50:52----------
kind of chill it's like peace how often


---------50:58----------
do you feel like that um


---------51:05----------
not often


---------51:06----------
I wouldn't think absolutely I think this


---------51:09----------
is a relatively new experience for most


---------51:11----------
people now the question is how did you


---------51:15----------
get there not sure yeah but so let's


---------51:26----------
just let's just understand what's


---------51:27----------
happening you're starting to feel a


---------51:28----------
little bit peaceful you don't know


---------51:31----------
exactly how it happened you're kind of


---------51:33----------
okay with it it's not excitement but how


---------51:39----------
would you would you be okay feeling this


---------51:41----------
way for eight hours a day yeah


---------51:48----------
yeah fair enough yeah I think so


---------51:51----------
probably ha yeah


---------51:54----------
what do you mean by it so when you when


---------51:56----------
you're hesitating is it because you want


---------51:57----------
to feel that way more or feel that way


---------51:59----------
less um I don't know I don't like


---------52:02----------
sitting in one emotion let's say like


---------52:04----------
okay I can it I guess yeah so I don't


---------52:07----------
think this is actually an emotional


---------52:09----------
state or for the record I think this is


---------52:12----------
separate that's what I was trying to


---------52:13----------
explain to you is that like pieces up


---------52:14----------
here but your emotions can actually be


---------52:16----------
bouncing around you can you can actually


---------52:19----------
cultivate the sense of peace while


---------52:21----------
you're feeling happy or while you're


---------52:23----------
feeling sad right and I know that that's


---------52:26----------
when you say right you understand she or


---------52:29----------
you're just logically I mean with me no


---------52:31----------
that makes sense


---------52:32----------
okay so please explain this to us what


---------52:35----------
do you mean by that how is that possible


---------52:38----------
what do you feel I know it's new to you


---------52:42----------
but like Justin stumble through the


---------52:44----------
words baby um like you kind of feel


---------52:48----------
things yeah like down here but like


---------52:50----------
there you're sort of more aware and like


---------52:53----------
thinking about how they affect you and


---------52:55----------
like I'm probably more logical playing I


---------52:59----------
guess okay I want you to pay attention


---------53:01----------
to what you said how they affect you


---------53:04----------
right there is a difference between your


---------53:10----------
negative emotions and you which until


---------53:14----------
this moment I'm not sure you appreciate


---------53:15----------
it because you used to be your negative


---------53:18----------
emotions does that make sense yeah but


---------53:23----------
now you're noticing that your negative


---------53:25----------
emotions are not actually who you are


---------53:27----------
they are over there and you were over


---------53:29----------
here I know it's kind of weird and


---------53:34----------
abstract but like I really got to know


---------53:35----------
if you're with me or if you're not with


---------53:37----------
me because it's only a Tamati sense make


---------53:39----------
sense right so how does it feel to be


---------53:41----------
separate from your negative emotions


---------53:43----------
like good yeah so if you heard of this


---------53:49----------
thing called enlightenment yeah I mean I


---------53:54----------
think once you've heard of it yeah so


---------53:57----------
what's your understanding of what the


---------53:58----------
[ __ ] does that even mean yeah that's


---------54:01----------
kind of


---------54:02----------
I'll give you so now Matt you've taken


---------54:06----------
the first step forward because


---------54:08----------
enlightenment is when all of your


---------54:10----------
emotions become fully separated from who


---------54:13----------
you are and that separation is permanent


---------54:17----------
so that the the small inkling of peace


---------54:21----------
that you have now becomes your default


---------54:24----------
state and encompasses your entire


---------54:25----------
awareness that's what enlightenment is


---------54:31----------
right so somehow somehow you've started


---------54:36----------
to cultivate a sense of detachment and


---------54:38----------
separation from your negative a negative


---------54:39----------
emotions and you don't know how you did


---------54:41----------
it so what what do you think happened


---------54:48----------
look at the [ __ ] like what did you do


---------54:50----------
I don't know I was just thinking about


---------54:53----------
random stuff and I was like listening to


---------54:55----------
music doing it okay so were you in the


---------55:00----------
past the present of the future I'd say


---------55:04----------
more so the present okay I was like


---------55:07----------
thinking about stuff that like yeah I


---------55:09----------
was like thinking about like this dream


---------55:10----------
and just like answers to questions and


---------55:13----------
random stuff oh no okay so your mind was


---------55:17----------
active but you were like kind of


---------55:18----------
reflecting yeah and maybe like


---------55:21----------
daydreaming a little okay your mind was


---------55:24----------
operating and you got some more work


---------55:26----------
done yeah I did like a lot of okay


---------55:31----------
groceries and stuff and how do you how


---------55:34----------
do you feel right now like peaceful yeah


---------55:41----------
okay so I'll take it


---------55:45----------
okay so what does this mean for you


---------55:48----------
going forward Matt have we cured you no


---------55:54----------
of course not of course not


---------55:57----------
it's a step in the right direction there


---------56:01----------
we go I'll take it


---------56:02----------
so now the question becomes what's the


---------56:04----------
next step I'm ready it's not rhetorical


---------56:10----------
actually asking oh not sure probably a


---------56:21----------
girl but I want to do with my life or


---------56:23----------
something oh that's not a step buddy


---------56:25----------
that's uh that's a man II know that's


---------56:28----------
like that's like that's like saying okay


---------56:31----------
like what's the next step and you're


---------56:32----------
saying like okay I'm gonna climb to the


---------56:33----------
top of Mount Everest figuring out what


---------56:35----------
you want to do in life is not a step


---------56:37----------
that's the goal that's like what you


---------56:41----------
reflect back on when you're 80 years old


---------56:43----------
on your deathbed that's when you figure


---------56:45----------
that out what's the next step


---------56:49----------
Matt how did you get to this peaceful


---------56:53----------
place doing stuff and thinking


---------56:57----------
absolutely doing stuff and thinking


---------57:01----------
that's the motto you're absolutely right


---------57:06----------
action and reflection that's a fancy


---------57:11----------
self-help meditation yoga hippie Whole


---------57:15----------
Foods magazine action and reflection but


---------57:21----------
really what it is is doing stuff and


---------57:23----------
thinking so what are you gonna do what


---------57:24----------
what is some stuff that you can do see


---------57:33----------
there's an easy answer this question


---------57:35----------
what needs to be done


---------57:37----------
right actually give me an answer


---------57:45----------
probably clean more or beautiful or what


---------57:51----------
I mean there's like plenty of things


---------57:54----------
that could be doing right so there's no


---------57:55----------
like one right answer absolutely


---------57:58----------
so just pick something so cleaning and


---------58:00----------
what else pick one more thing well I


---------58:04----------
wanted to like kind of figure out what I


---------58:07----------
want to do is streaming because I open


---------58:08----------
streaming but maybe edit videos or


---------58:11----------
something but I feel like that'd be it


---------58:13----------
later


---------58:14----------
because I want to figure out what I'm


---------58:15----------
gonna do with that first so okay so how


---------58:17----------
does one figure out what one wants to do


---------58:23----------
uh no clue okay


---------58:27----------
I'd start by talking to someone about


---------58:34----------
what so you want to figure out what you


---------58:37----------
want to do with streaming right yeah so


---------58:40----------
I defined a sounding board so like try


---------58:45----------
to find someone that you can talk to


---------58:46----------
about streaming right okay


---------58:49----------
like who can you talk to about streaming


---------58:55----------
like my friends or something yeah I mean


---------58:59----------
is that actually something you could do


---------59:01----------
yeah I mean I could do it yeah okay so


---------59:06----------
clean talk to your friends about


---------59:08----------
streaming and then what was the other


---------59:11----------
thing you said you said do things and


---------59:13----------
and what and think oh thank you okay so


---------59:20----------
what are you gonna reflect on uh not


---------59:27----------
sure okay


---------59:28----------
that's perfectly fine so I'm gonna tell


---------59:30----------
you what I want you to do so you did


---------59:32----------
something that was a little bit more


---------59:33----------
than thinking you did some noticing and


---------59:36----------
so if you want to cultivate that


---------59:38----------
peaceful sense within yourself it's not


---------59:41----------
about thinking it's about awareness or


---------59:43----------
noticing you paid attention to what you


---------59:46----------
were feeling and thinking you observed


---------59:49----------
it and do you see how paying attention


---------59:53----------
could pay paying attention does that


---------59:55----------
happen in the past the present or the


---------59:56----------
future president absolutely so I just


---------60:00----------
want you to pay attention pay attention


---------60:02----------
to your thoughts pay attention to your


---------60:05----------
physical sensations pay attention to


---------60:07----------
music whatever you were paying attention


---------60:09----------
to just think about like what were you


---------60:10----------
actually paying attention to where was


---------60:13----------
your attention focused over the last


---------60:15----------
fifteen minutes okay and as long as you


---------60:20----------
can notice and you can act and you can


---------60:25----------
clean then you're gonna start to feel


---------60:28----------
this way more and more and we can get


---------60:32----------
to as much psychological [ __ ] about


---------60:34----------
your parents and depression and all that


---------60:35----------
kind of stuff all that stuff has value


---------60:36----------
that's really what therapy is about


---------60:39----------
twitch is about changing which is about


---------60:42----------
changing your life therapy is about


---------60:45----------
feeling better so you have a therapist


---------60:50----------
right yeah


---------60:51----------
okay little counsellor I don't know it's


---------60:56----------
it's all yeah it's the same thing right


---------60:58----------
same difference okay any questions for


---------61:01----------
me uh not really no yeah good so I want


---------61:12----------
you to notice what was that was that a


---------61:13----------
fat roll or slow roll I'm sorry


---------61:16----------
slow roller pastoral that was a fast


---------61:19----------
roll right but just think about that


---------61:23----------
like you were making a statement about


---------61:24----------
your ignorance but it was actually a


---------61:26----------
fast roll you're like I strongest II or


---------61:31----------
yes yes my friend that's exactly what it


---------61:36----------
is how does it feel to be honest about


---------61:42----------
your ignorance good let's say yeah this


---------61:47----------
was pretty good see that's [ __ ] weird


---------61:49----------
shouldn't you be ashamed about showing


---------61:52----------
the internet how ignorant you are no you


---------61:59----------
should be but you're not so this is the


---------62:02----------
other thing that I want to explain to


---------62:03----------
all of you guys out there your negative


---------62:05----------
emotions have power over you as long as


---------62:08----------
they live in the darkness like what is


---------62:11----------
therapy how does therapy help people


---------62:13----------
you're talking about your negative [ __ ]


---------62:15----------
that you keep inside and we know that


---------62:18----------
that therapeutically helps people that's


---------62:19----------
what it does that's what it's for


---------62:22----------
increasingly enough Matt when you were


---------62:25----------
honest about the stuff that you suck at


---------62:28----------
in life you feel better right but when


---------62:33----------
you are not even honest and you judge


---------62:36----------
yourself and you talk about


---------62:37----------
hypotheticals and you talk about should


---------62:39----------
that's all inauthentic and that makes


---------62:41----------
you feel bad so be honest with yourself


---------62:44----------
and it's okay to sock


---------62:46----------
it's okay to be rejected it's okay to


---------62:48----------
fail it's okay to do all that stuff just


---------62:50----------
be honest with yourself and then cut


---------62:52----------
yourself a break right because like hey


---------62:55----------
what can you really expect when it comes


---------62:56----------
to good deer if you're like a [ __ ]


---------62:58----------
encumbered deprived with a club yeah not


---------63:02----------
gonna happen


---------63:03----------
Yeah right let's go cut yourself a break


---------63:07----------
and like acknowledge that you're gonna


---------63:09----------
need to grind for a little bit maybe


---------63:10----------
find yourself a decent weapon and like


---------63:12----------
some armor and a helmet and like a set


---------63:15----------
of gloves and then you can like you know


---------63:17----------
you can go back your life isn't over it


---------63:20----------
requires a little bit of grinding which


---------63:22----------
in this case is cleaning and talking to


---------63:24----------
your friends about streaming and


---------63:25----------
practicing like noticing and then you're


---------63:29----------
gonna like level up your meditation stat


---------63:31----------
and as your meditation stat goes up


---------63:34----------
you're gonna get no you're gonna get to


---------63:36----------
like you can get a mala which is like


---------63:38----------
you're a little um what's the thing this


---------63:40----------
the stick what are they called in Dark


---------63:43----------
Souls what let's stick like like no no


---------63:47----------
no not the torch the spell-casting items


---------63:49----------
catalyst catalyst that's for a talisman


---------63:52----------
though yeah yeah that's right that's


---------63:54----------
right


---------63:54----------
Oh talisman catalyst right it's like so


---------63:58----------
give yourself a little bit of time and


---------63:59----------
work at it and level up a little bit and


---------64:01----------
you can do it


---------64:02----------
mm-hmm I faith in you man thanks buddy


---------64:08----------
how does that how does it feel to hear


---------64:10----------
that um I don't know I whenever it


---------64:16----------
doesn't have an impact on me anymore I


---------64:17----------
feel like yeah I can tell you've never


---------64:22----------
said thanks buddy over the course of


---------64:23----------
this conversation like I couldn't just


---------64:28----------
say Oh sort of compliment snakes I don't


---------64:30----------
know react


---------64:31----------
there you go see that's inauthentic


---------64:33----------
thanks buddy is inauthentic I can smell


---------64:35----------
it from a [ __ ] mile away it's like


---------64:37----------
Jesus okay so if you don't know how to


---------64:40----------
accept a compliment that's a


---------64:41----------
conversation for a different day right


---------64:43----------
if you can't accept a compliment and you


---------64:45----------
can't accept that people have faith in


---------64:47----------
you it's because you don't see you don't


---------64:48----------
see worth in yourself you think I'm just


---------64:50----------
wrong


---------64:54----------
or you think I just don't get it anyway


---------64:57----------
conversation for a different way that


---------65:00----------
makes sense yeah yeah so we got to talk


---------65:04----------
about being unable to accept compliments


---------65:05----------

---------65:08----------

---------65:12----------

---------65:31----------
so thank you bad I think I think you


---------65:34----------

---------66:10----------
like you can't take out pontiff with


---------66:12----------
your slow rolling stick like you gotta


---------66:14----------
be you got to get yourself some loot and


---------66:16----------
that takes time and cut yourself a break


---------66:18----------
because you know your stats like you


---------66:20----------
forgot to spend your life is the


---------66:23----------
equivalent of not spending any of your


---------66:24----------
stats at level one it doesn't mean that


---------66:27----------
you're just permanently worse it's just


---------66:29----------
you've got to look like you know you got


---------66:30----------
