---------00:00----------
so overcoming an addictive behavior


---------00:02----------
overcoming sort of a toxic behavior


---------00:06----------
is not about trying to get rid of the


---------00:08----------
bad it's actually about getting rid of


---------00:10----------
the good


---------00:11----------
it's about giving up what this thing


---------00:13----------
does for you


---------00:14----------
and that starts with actually like you


---------00:17----------
know it starts with insight


---------00:19----------
and if you guys are curious the you know


---------00:21----------
i had to change tax for a second but the


---------00:23----------
the goal


---------00:24----------
of today's interview was insight not


---------00:27----------
change


---------00:27----------
in insight and awareness precedes change


---------00:30----------
so pushing someone to change when


---------00:32----------
they're not ready to change is never


---------00:33----------
going to work


---------00:38----------
hello not a whole lot what's up with you


---------00:43----------
a whole lot how are you congratulations


---------00:46----------

---------00:47----------

---------01:11----------
make sure that i'm not screwing


---------01:12----------
something up


---------01:13----------
he can text me if he needs something


---------01:15----------
because he just canceled the call so i


---------01:16----------
assumed that i fixed it


---------01:18----------
um sometimes i do that on my own and i


---------01:20----------
don't need someone's help to fix things


---------01:23----------
that guy but oftentimes i do need


---------01:26----------
people's help


---------01:27----------
me too so what have what uh have you


---------01:30----------
been maya


---------01:31----------
i've been really good um i yeah i'm just


---------01:34----------
i'm very busy


---------01:36----------
but it's good busy so it's fine


---------01:40----------
what's the difference between good busy


---------01:41----------
and bad busy


---------01:43----------
i'm busy with things that i want to do


---------01:45----------
versus


---------01:46----------
things that i don't want to be doing um


---------01:49----------
i was i was always bad busy in college


---------01:51----------
and


---------01:51----------
since then i've been good busy


---------01:54----------
so i guess that's good um and what have


---------01:57----------
you been up to recently


---------01:59----------
uh well i've recently founded this


---------02:00----------
non-profit i talked to


---------02:02----------
kruthie about it a little bit um but


---------02:05----------
yeah we uh i bought this property and


---------02:08----------
have been developing it


---------02:10----------
to bring animals onto there we have 12


---------02:11----------
ambassadors now


---------02:13----------
so doing a lot of husbandry doing some


---------02:17----------
content curation


---------02:18----------
education program curation and just


---------02:22----------
there's a lot of stuff that goes into


---------02:23----------
that that i'm learning about so


---------02:25----------
wow that's amazing can you tell me more


---------02:27----------
about that


---------02:29----------
yeah um so alves is a non-profit


---------02:32----------
uh exotic animal sanctuary and virtual


---------02:35----------
education


---------02:36----------
center in texas i wrote up wrote out the


---------02:38----------
business plan in like


---------02:41----------
uh december chat something like that


---------02:45----------
like december and it was a three-year


---------02:46----------
plan but it's more like a three-month


---------02:49----------
plan


---------02:50----------
with how fast it's been going uh i


---------02:52----------
bought a property it's about 15 acres in


---------02:54----------
austin and


---------02:56----------
um went and picked up ambassadors from


---------02:58----------
california


---------02:59----------
in april and


---------03:03----------
we've been making moves since then


---------03:06----------
so the idea is rescuing exotic animals


---------03:09----------
that are non-releasable


---------03:11----------
and then using them for education


---------03:13----------
programs uh teaching people about


---------03:15----------
conservation using those ambassadors


---------03:17----------
animal ambassadors and then also having


---------03:19----------
content creators come to my facility to


---------03:21----------
meet those animals as well


---------03:22----------
um and to learn about them and learn


---------03:24----------
about conservation


---------03:25----------
complex audiences all that jazz oh


---------03:28----------
that's awesome


---------03:29----------
thank you yeah i'm really proud of it


---------03:30----------
when you say ambassador are we referring


---------03:33----------
to


---------03:33----------
an animal or a person an animal i see


---------03:36----------
um so yeah an ambassador is just an


---------03:38----------
animal in captivity that


---------03:40----------
is used in education and is meant to


---------03:42----------
represent their wild counterpart


---------03:43----------
i see an ambassador for their species


---------03:46----------
got it


---------03:47----------
and and what kind of ambassadors do you


---------03:48----------
guys have so far


---------03:50----------
we have four parrots two chinchillas a


---------03:53----------
snake a bullfrog an emu


---------03:55----------
and two donkeys and a chicken


---------04:00----------
that's awesome yeah yeah


---------04:03----------
and jenkins become a fan favorite she's


---------04:05----------
a lot of fun


---------04:06----------
and and so how who i mean who takes care


---------04:09----------
of the animals


---------04:10----------
or the ambassadors sorry uh me and then


---------04:12----------
ella i have an


---------04:13----------
on-site animal care coordinator so she


---------04:15----------
lives there and and she does five days a


---------04:17----------
week


---------04:18----------
oh wow care of them and then i'm out


---------04:19----------
there every day as well so


---------04:21----------
there's just two of us right now doing


---------04:23----------
something making the world a better


---------04:25----------
place


---------04:26----------
yeah that is absolutely amazing maya


---------04:29----------
yeah it's been really fun um i


---------04:32----------
understand that that


---------04:34----------
ambassadors whether they be you know


---------04:36----------
animals or humans


---------04:38----------
tend to be quite expensive to take care


---------04:40----------
of


---------04:41----------
like they have a lot of costs associated


---------04:43----------
with them for sure


---------04:44----------
yeah we just did uh initial vet


---------04:47----------
appointments for those four pairs


---------04:48----------
nothing wrong with them but


---------04:49----------
just to get like a baseline and to get a


---------04:51----------
really thorough blood panel done


---------04:53----------
and all that is like two grand for for


---------04:56----------
the four of them


---------04:57----------
um so yeah wow yeah it's expensive


---------05:01----------
the the general upkeep though is not so


---------05:02----------
bad like our reptiles


---------05:04----------
one of our snake eats once every other


---------05:05----------
week you know it's it's really not that


---------05:07----------
expensive but


---------05:08----------
the the initial setup and and the


---------05:09----------
initial vet stuff is expensive my emu is


---------05:12----------
expensive because she keeps eating metal


---------05:14----------
um she's gotten two endoscopies in the


---------05:16----------
past


---------05:17----------
uh few months


---------05:20----------
wow she ate this ring wait this ring


---------05:26----------
had how did you get it back


---------05:29----------
endoscopy oh so you guys went in from


---------05:31----------
the mouth and pulled it out


---------05:33----------
yeah and then she ate a few screws and a


---------05:37----------
couple other things


---------05:38----------
a few months later which i don't even


---------05:40----------
know where she found them


---------05:41----------
um in dosby number two but got them all


---------05:45----------
out


---------05:45----------
so she's expensive


---------05:48----------
have you asked her considered asking her


---------05:50----------
why she keeps eating metal


---------05:52----------
yeah she just says she likes it okay


---------05:56----------
you know it's interesting because


---------05:57----------
there's actually i've i've worked with


---------05:58----------
with humans


---------06:00----------
who eat things that they're not supposed


---------06:02----------
to yeah well so for


---------06:04----------
i've never had a bird that's so bad


---------06:06----------
about that like i had the


---------06:08----------
i had the my ring on the ground um


---------06:10----------
because i just did not expect her to


---------06:12----------
swallow it at the time she was like


---------06:14----------
her body was like this big she's a chick


---------06:16----------
um so


---------06:17----------
watching her swallow the emu i didn't


---------06:18----------
even think it hurt the ring i didn't


---------06:19----------
even think it would fit in her mouth


---------06:21----------
um emu's and a lot of other birds


---------06:24----------
they'll eat pebbles and small rocks to


---------06:25----------
aid in digestion


---------06:27----------
the only thing i can think is that with


---------06:28----------
a combination of her being attracted to


---------06:30----------
shiny things


---------06:32----------
because she's a bird and then i don't


---------06:34----------
but i also


---------06:35----------
like i've worked with crows and other


---------06:36----------
corvids and stuff like that that love


---------06:38----------
shiny things but they would never


---------06:39----------
swallow it i really don't know it's it's


---------06:41----------
bizarre to me she's the first emu that


---------06:43----------
i've worked from


---------06:44----------
baby onwards um so i'm


---------06:48----------
i've learned that tendency the hard way


---------06:51----------
yeah wow i don't think you can find this


---------06:54----------
stuff in a book somewhere it's like


---------06:56----------
you know guide to emu care be careful


---------06:59----------
because they will eat


---------07:01----------
nails and small pieces of jewelry there


---------07:04----------
is


---------07:05----------
the only article i could find when i was


---------07:06----------
freaking out the first time she ate the


---------07:08----------
ring was


---------07:08----------
an emu in the uk that ate a pair of


---------07:11----------
diamond earrings or something


---------07:13----------
um and they couldn't get them out uh so


---------07:17----------
insurance got her a new pair of earrings


---------07:18----------
which is sweet and then


---------07:20----------
the emu passed them later so now she has


---------07:23----------
both i don't know if she wears the ones


---------07:24----------
that the emu passed but


---------07:27----------
i imagine that they they have a certain


---------07:30----------
you know


---------07:31----------
resale value to them yeah oh i'm sure


---------07:34----------
they do


---------07:34----------
that was big news yeah wow


---------07:38----------
interesting yeah yeah so


---------07:42----------
wow so you've been busy yes anything


---------07:45----------
sort of yeah so of you are you doing


---------07:47----------
like interviews throughout this month


---------07:49----------
is that just okay sweet nice


---------07:52----------
cool stuff why do you ask i'm just


---------07:55----------
wondering


---------07:57----------
because your team reached out to me said


---------07:58----------
that's the first time i've got i've


---------07:59----------
heard from you guys in that capacity so


---------08:01----------
i was like oh i bet they're doing


---------08:02----------
a bunch of people or talking to a bunch


---------08:04----------
of people yeah so i think actually our


---------08:06----------
usual stream


---------08:07----------
stuff is uh interviews is the backbone


---------08:10----------
of what we do you know because we try to


---------08:11----------
um


---------08:13----------
have so i've had so many individual


---------08:15----------
conversations that


---------08:17----------
cover the same thing the whole reason we


---------08:19----------
started streaming to begin with is to


---------08:20----------
sort of


---------08:22----------
uh you know share one person's


---------08:24----------
conversation with a bunch of people


---------08:26----------
specifically for the purpose because i


---------08:29----------
seem to have the same conversations over


---------08:30----------
and over and over again and the same


---------08:32----------
themes


---------08:32----------
or principles tend to pop up over and


---------08:34----------
over and over again


---------08:36----------
this has to be unique in terms of


---------08:38----------
conversations i've had on stream because


---------08:40----------
i haven't talked about ingesting things


---------08:41----------
but i have worked with patients who will


---------08:43----------
do things like ingest razor blades and


---------08:45----------
there you have


---------08:46----------
good stuff um you know and i try to ask


---------08:50----------
them why they do it and


---------08:51----------
that turns turns out to be an


---------08:53----------
interesting conversation


---------08:55----------
um that's a lot yeah i don't think she


---------08:58----------
does it for those reasons i think she's


---------09:00----------
just a little dank


---------09:02----------
but what does that mean a little dank a


---------09:04----------
little like


---------09:05----------
bit you know it's just not very bright


---------09:09----------
oh okay


---------09:13----------
well you know the emote feels dank man


---------09:15----------
have you seen that did you chat use that


---------09:17----------
yeah so i think i'm sure i've seen it i


---------09:19----------
don't know exactly what da i didn't know


---------09:21----------
that dank was not very bright i thought


---------09:22----------
it was like


---------09:24----------
a little bit you know not


---------09:27----------
dirty but it's like it's dank you know


---------09:30----------
it's like not clean it may be used like


---------09:34----------
that in other places or maybe i'm


---------09:35----------
thinking rank i don't know


---------09:37----------
um there's dank when i was in college


---------09:39----------
people would say dank is like that sick


---------09:41----------
like that's


---------09:42----------
dank or they would like sick isn't it


---------09:44----------
they would say yeah good sick


---------09:46----------
and they would say that like weed is


---------09:48----------
dank and that meant it was good


---------09:50----------
but since i've been on twitch it's like


---------09:51----------
feels dank man so it's like uh


---------09:54----------
i don't know just like little kid like


---------09:56----------
eating crayons


---------09:58----------
yeah it's kind of dank so the last time


---------10:01----------
i was a student


---------10:02----------
when someone is like that's sick like


---------10:04----------
that person is sick we would transfer


---------10:06----------
them to the icu


---------10:08----------
you know so different things yeah so but


---------10:11----------
dank means so dank is no longer means


---------10:13----------
sick it means


---------10:14----------
what well on twitch it means


---------10:18----------
kind of dumb kind of got it i think


---------10:21----------
other people still use it as like


---------10:25----------
cool well if if it means something on


---------10:27----------
twitch isn't that truly what it means


---------10:30----------
no i i don't know because it's it's so


---------10:34----------
interesting to see that


---------10:36----------
you know the the like i have you know


---------10:39----------
nieces and nephews that are normal


---------10:42----------
people


---------10:43----------
and to to realize that i actually speak


---------10:46----------
their lingo because they seem to be like


---------10:48----------
catching up to us


---------10:49----------
oh there you go yeah right so like i


---------10:51----------
think like like


---------10:52----------
salty is from gaming right i have no


---------10:56----------
idea


---------10:56----------
i'm not a gamer right and and then their


---------10:59----------
twitch


---------11:01----------
maybe i don't know i think it's a gaming


---------11:03----------
thing and then like other


---------11:04----------
you know regular people started using it


---------11:06----------
and i was like oh i actually understand


---------11:08----------
the lingo now there you go yeah i don't


---------11:12----------
know any


---------11:12----------
well i guess i do know some gamer lingo


---------11:14----------
because i'm on twitch but yeah


---------11:16----------
yeah um so my anything gamer


---------11:20----------
anything in particular you want to talk


---------11:21----------
about today or anything that i can help


---------11:23----------
you with


---------11:24----------
um yeah i


---------11:28----------
well stress but again it's kind of like


---------11:30----------
good stress because it's stuff that i


---------11:32----------
want to be doing so it's not like i want


---------11:33----------
to reduce


---------11:34----------
my workload um i have an inability to


---------11:38----------
relax


---------11:38----------
which has become kind of a toxic thing


---------11:41----------
for me


---------11:42----------
not recently it's always been like that


---------11:44----------
um okay not always but


---------11:46----------
since high school um so


---------11:51----------
yeah that's annoying that's the only


---------11:52----------
thing i can think of right now


---------11:54----------
i think can you tell me about your


---------11:56----------
inability to relax


---------11:58----------
yeah um i have a it is not an


---------12:02----------
actual term i've coined it in my head


---------12:04----------
just toxic


---------12:05----------
productivity i i always feel like i need


---------12:08----------
to be doing something


---------12:10----------
and if i'm not doing something i just


---------12:12----------
feel a lot of guilt i think that's


---------12:14----------
i think a lot of people deal with that


---------12:16----------
but


---------12:17----------
like a recent thing is i'll try to sit


---------12:20----------
on the balcony to relax


---------12:21----------
or just to like chill out um and the


---------12:25----------
only


---------12:26----------
way that i can allow myself to do that


---------12:28----------
is if i have like a really tall glass of


---------12:30----------
water and i tell myself that


---------12:32----------
if i'm drinking the whole glass of water


---------12:34----------
while i'm sitting here it's fine because


---------12:36----------
that's a productive thing to do but i


---------12:37----------
can't just sit there


---------12:38----------
does that make sense yeah absolutely


---------12:41----------
uh-huh so that


---------12:42----------
and then i've only i've recently started


---------12:46----------
using not recently i've been using


---------12:48----------
tick-tock for a while but


---------12:49----------
um like i'll scroll through tick-tocks


---------12:51----------
and that's kind of relaxing but the only


---------12:53----------
reason i allow myself to do that without


---------12:55----------
feeling bad is because


---------12:56----------
the videos that i like i show on stream


---------12:59----------
so it's like


---------13:00----------
you can justify it because it can be


---------13:03----------
used for work


---------13:04----------
right right yes driving too i can't


---------13:06----------
listen to music in the car anymore


---------13:08----------
because i don't feel like it's


---------13:10----------
productive use of my time i


---------13:11----------
only listen to audiobooks even if i


---------13:13----------
don't really want to listen to an


---------13:14----------
audiobook


---------13:15----------
i like i listen to audiobooks


---------13:18----------
because i feel like i'm learning


---------13:19----------
something yeah


---------13:21----------
you know toxic productivity is a huge


---------13:23----------
issue um


---------13:24----------
and and it's funny because we've uh we


---------13:27----------
recently started


---------13:28----------
like a an interesting pilot at healthy


---------13:30----------
gamer because


---------13:31----------
you know a lot of times we'll have


---------13:34----------
people who


---------13:35----------
so our community is actually quite


---------13:37----------
diverse


---------13:38----------
and what we actually discovered recently


---------13:41----------
not recently but what we've sort of


---------13:44----------
haven't addressed is that there are a


---------13:45----------
lot of people who are very productive in


---------13:47----------
our community


---------13:48----------
and so we actually sorry yeah diverse in


---------13:51----------
terms of like age


---------13:52----------
range or demographics so many things


---------13:54----------
okay so we started out when i started


---------13:56----------
streaming


---------13:57----------
you know and probably had like less than


---------13:59----------
10 000 followers it was like 95


---------14:02----------
male 5 sure female


---------14:05----------
um and now we're like 70 30 or even 65


---------14:09----------
35


---------14:09----------
i think is what our audience is uh our


---------14:12----------
age range has also recently expanded to


---------14:14----------
include like parents so like


---------14:17----------
you know there will be we have a just


---------14:19----------
wrapped up a parent pilot where we had


---------14:21----------
like


---------14:21----------
you know 50 year old 60 year olds who


---------14:24----------
are like


---------14:25----------
that's cool trying to we're trying to


---------14:27----------
explain to them you know


---------14:29----------
how to communicate with their kids and


---------14:31----------
stuff like that


---------14:32----------
and i think the other thing that that


---------14:34----------
we've started working on is sort of like


---------14:35----------
high performance so there are a lot of


---------14:37----------
people


---------14:37----------
you know on twitch or in our audience in


---------14:40----------
our community who are


---------14:41----------
software developers you know executives


---------14:44----------
things like that


---------14:45----------
and you know professional uh


---------14:50----------
you know professional athletes of


---------14:51----------
various kinds


---------14:54----------
and so we started like actually running


---------14:56----------
groups for them


---------14:57----------
and seeing if we can help them and i


---------14:58----------
think this toxic productivity actually


---------15:00----------
comes up there a lot


---------15:02----------
where people are you know i think toxic


---------15:05----------
productivity is a good phrase


---------15:08----------
um okay sweet i thought i made it up but


---------15:10----------
i'm glad to hear that i know i mean i i


---------15:12----------
think it's a


---------15:13----------
it's a yeah i you know so let me ask you


---------15:17----------
something when you say you


---------15:18----------
allow yourself to sit on the balcony


---------15:22----------
so like let's just look at that


---------15:24----------
construction for a second okay


---------15:29----------
who is the myself and who is doing the


---------15:31----------
allowing


---------15:33----------
um


---------15:33----------
[Music]


---------15:39----------
i don't know how to answer that question


---------15:41----------
do you understand like


---------15:42----------
yeah are we talking like a future


---------15:46----------
me and like my present self or something


---------15:48----------
i don't i don't know well yeah


---------15:49----------
it's a weird question right because so


---------15:51----------
you use the phrase i allow myself to sit


---------15:53----------
on the balcony


---------15:55----------
sure so like the reward is maya gets to


---------15:58----------
sit on the balcony


---------16:00----------
and it's almost like there's a child and


---------16:01----------
there's a parent in that


---------16:03----------
sentence right who's doing the allowing


---------16:06----------
and who's getting this it's like it's i


---------16:08----------
mean it's almost like a parent-child


---------16:09----------
kind of thing where it's like


---------16:10----------
mom can i sit on the balcony it's like


---------16:12----------
only if you drink a glass of water


---------16:14----------
because


---------16:15----------
that's being productive and you don't


---------16:17----------
have time to just sit on the balcony and


---------16:18----------
do nothing


---------16:19----------
that's actually that's interesting i


---------16:22----------
just made me think of


---------16:23----------
i uh i do kind of have that dichotomy


---------16:27----------
like


---------16:27----------
inside of because i am 22. you know i


---------16:30----------
just graduated college


---------16:31----------
um i still like want to go to bars and


---------16:34----------
drink and


---------16:35----------
stay up until you know two three


---------16:36----------
whatever with friends just


---------16:38----------
drinking and whatever but i also uh am


---------16:40----------
now i also now run a non-profit


---------16:43----------
so there's there's two very different


---------16:45----------
people


---------16:46----------
that like exist within myself so it's


---------16:48----------
probably an argument between the two


---------16:50----------
there's a part of me that wants to be


---------16:52----------
not productive and all of my peers the


---------16:54----------
people that i live with and and my


---------16:55----------
friends in texas as well are all


---------16:57----------
streamers


---------16:58----------
so they pretty much do whatever they


---------16:59----------
want you know


---------17:01----------
they don't have many responsibilities


---------17:03----------
besides eating sleeping and streaming


---------17:05----------
um and sometimes i wish i lived like


---------17:07----------
that you know sometimes i wish i could


---------17:09----------
just chill and


---------17:10----------
do whatever and um but that's just like


---------17:14----------
not the case


---------17:15----------
for me so yeah it's it's probably


---------17:19----------
between the i don't know if that makes


---------17:20----------
sense i think it makes a lot of sense


---------17:22----------
okay so i i think you see that a lot of


---------17:25----------
your social circle


---------17:27----------
can do this thing that's kind of like


---------17:28----------
you know i i do think it's actually


---------17:31----------
tends to be a little bit more


---------17:32----------
challenging for them because i think


---------17:33----------
like you


---------17:35----------
i imagine that they they don't just get


---------17:37----------
to have fun because fun


---------17:39----------
starts to become content and so they're


---------17:42----------
in the business of having fun


---------17:44----------
which sometimes changes how fun it is


---------17:48----------
um but i can definitely see that like


---------17:51----------
you're struggling with some kind of work


---------17:52----------
life


---------17:53----------
balance sort of things


---------17:56----------
is that fair to say yeah so why is it


---------18:00----------
important for you to listen to


---------18:01----------
audiobooks instead of music


---------18:05----------
i just have an endless need to learn


---------18:08----------
things which is great


---------18:09----------
um but it's too much you know like


---------18:12----------
sometimes i like i would like to just


---------18:14----------
chill and listen to music


---------18:16----------
but it's like why would i be listening


---------18:17----------
to music if i could be listening to and


---------18:19----------
i i don't listen to any fiction


---------18:21----------
audiobooks either it's always


---------18:22----------
non-fiction or it's like a survival


---------18:23----------
audiobook or it's like


---------18:25----------
something honestly just boring like


---------18:27----------
stuff that i don't really feel like i


---------18:28----------
want to know but i'll listen to


---------18:29----------
audiobooks on like


---------18:30----------
i listen to one on string theory i don't


---------18:32----------
[ __ ] care about string theory


---------18:33----------
you know like i was an ag major um but i


---------18:36----------
just feel like i


---------18:37----------
should know more i don't know i want to


---------18:40----------
know more about different uh


---------18:43----------
about different things and if i'm


---------18:45----------
driving and not learning i feel like


---------18:47----------
it's not a productive use of my time


---------18:48----------
yeah so we're gonna highlight one word


---------18:50----------
and i want you to pay attention for this


---------18:52----------
word should you should


---------18:56----------
know more where does


---------18:59----------
help me understand that why should you


---------19:02----------
know more


---------19:03----------
we go all the way back to our


---------19:04----------
conversation i you have so many


---------19:06----------
conversations but the last time we


---------19:07----------
talked we talked about uh where i grew


---------19:09----------
up so i grew up in the silicon valley


---------19:11----------
which is a very productive very high


---------19:14----------
achieving


---------19:17----------
location for schools this has some of


---------19:19----------
the best schools in the nation


---------19:21----------
and also some of the highest suicide


---------19:23----------
rates in the nation and they're


---------19:24----------
absolutely related


---------19:26----------
uh so i was not low achieving


---------19:29----------
in school i mean i graduated with uh


---------19:32----------
like a


---------19:33----------
well i graduated with a 4.2 weighted but


---------19:36----------
i


---------19:37----------
was not smart in uh school or i wasn't


---------19:41----------
like one of the smart ones


---------19:42----------
i just did fine um so


---------19:46----------
and like in elementary school you get


---------19:48----------
placed in advanced math classes or


---------19:49----------
normal math classes i was never in


---------19:50----------
advanced math classes


---------19:52----------
so it probably comes from there um just


---------19:54----------
like should be doing more


---------19:56----------
should uh should know more should be


---------19:58----------
higher achieving should be going to the


---------20:00----------
school should be doing this but


---------20:02----------
whatever that thanks for reminding me


---------20:05----------
that had slipped my mind yeah


---------20:07----------
no that's fine yeah of course um and


---------20:10----------
thank you for


---------20:10----------
drawing that connection because i i you


---------20:12----------
know sounds like something sunk in


---------20:16----------
yeah that makes sense and yeah so let's


---------20:19----------
let's


---------20:19----------
so it sounds like last time we sort of


---------20:22----------
got into


---------20:23----------
where the should comes from thank you so


---------20:24----------
much for refreshing my memory


---------20:27----------
and so if i'm hearing you correctly you


---------20:29----------
kind of grew up in a particular


---------20:30----------
environment where


---------20:32----------
comparison was important achievement was


---------20:34----------
important standards were high


---------20:36----------
big shoes to fill for sure and


---------20:40----------
you were not one of the chosen ones yeah


---------20:43----------
and so you have to work really hard to


---------20:46----------
enter the chosen one category


---------20:48----------
yeah i guess so um


---------20:52----------
what do you think about that um


---------20:57----------
i mean i'm doing fine i'm pretty proud


---------20:59----------
of myself where i am today


---------21:01----------
um and i


---------21:04----------
my parents wanted me to go to cornell


---------21:06----------
and i'm glad that i didn't because


---------21:08----------
i loved it at kelp i went to cal poly


---------21:10----------
san luis obispo


---------21:11----------
which is uh not nearly as hard to get


---------21:14----------
into as cornell and it's not an ivy


---------21:16----------
but i was so much happier there than i


---------21:18----------
would have been you know if i went


---------21:20----------
there and or if i went to cornell so i'm


---------21:23----------
happy with that choice


---------21:24----------
um so it's fine i don't know


---------21:28----------
i mean it definitely has contributed to


---------21:30----------
to the things that i'm talking about


---------21:32----------
today but


---------21:33----------
i'm not like upset about it what has


---------21:35----------
contributed to


---------21:36----------
the things you're talking about today


---------21:38----------
the need to compete


---------21:40----------
and compare and all that


---------21:44----------
yeah so when you say it's contributed


---------21:46----------
can you help me understand


---------21:47----------
how your need to be better


---------21:50----------
has shaped your life


---------21:56----------
um


---------21:58----------
yeah okay well let's i might it might


---------22:00----------
get a little muddy


---------22:02----------
so growing up we also talked a lot about


---------22:04----------
my sister


---------22:05----------
um my sister's 18 months older um and


---------22:07----------
she was very very high achieving all


---------22:09----------
throughout elementary middle and high


---------22:11----------
school


---------22:12----------
and she went to an ivy she went to upenn


---------22:15----------
mechanical engineering


---------22:16----------
um whatever and so she did really really


---------22:18----------
well in school and did really well


---------22:20----------
playing soccer


---------22:22----------
and so people knew her for those things


---------22:24----------
people knew me


---------22:25----------
as like the animal girl in high school


---------22:28----------
because we grew up on a farm


---------22:30----------
um and i would like bring animals to her


---------22:32----------
soccer games and i


---------22:33----------
um was really really into horsemanship


---------22:36----------
so i spent a lot of time a lot of time


---------22:38----------
training horses and all that


---------22:40----------
and i think i felt that i had a niche


---------22:43----------
there and i needed to excel


---------22:45----------
in animal things and what i was


---------22:48----------
interested in


---------22:49----------
to have like my own identity that was on


---------22:51----------
the same level as the one that she had


---------22:53----------
um and i think that that stuck with me


---------22:55----------
since


---------22:56----------
middle school or high school whenever


---------22:57----------
that started is just like being the best


---------22:59----------
in my thing


---------23:01----------
um so so you had to get an a plus in


---------23:04----------
something


---------23:05----------
exactly and it wasn't going to be


---------23:07----------
mathematics so you chose horsemanship


---------23:09----------
right yeah [ __ ] mathematics i i never


---------23:13----------
yeah i was terrible at math i still am


---------23:17----------
yeah so you should go unschooled have


---------23:19----------
you thought about that do you know what


---------23:20----------
that is


---------23:21----------
no what is that oh my gosh matt has miss


---------23:23----------
kiff has this show


---------23:25----------
called schooled do you know the show are


---------23:26----------
you smarter than a fifth grader


---------23:28----------
no okay it's basically like


---------23:31----------
you go on and they ask you questions


---------23:33----------
that are kindergarten level questions


---------23:34----------
first grade second grade third grade


---------23:36----------
right and the point is maybe this isn't


---------23:38----------
fair the point is kind of to make the


---------23:40----------
contestants look dumb because it's like


---------23:41----------
you can't answer a third grade question


---------23:42----------
but just because you don't remember


---------23:43----------
those things you know


---------23:45----------
um but he has it and then you can get


---------23:47----------
subs depending on how high you go and


---------23:49----------
then if you win there's a ten thousand


---------23:50----------
dollar competition at the end but that


---------23:51----------
would be really interesting


---------23:52----------
for you to go on and and see if i'm


---------23:55----------
smarter than a fifth grader


---------23:56----------
yeah essentially well it goes all the


---------23:58----------
way up through high school


---------24:00----------
um but most people get out about eighth


---------24:02----------
grade ninth grade interesting


---------24:05----------
yeah i'll definitely think about it but


---------24:06----------
i i'm not so sure that i would be so


---------24:08----------
optimistic because


---------24:10----------
i have an almost four year old and an


---------24:12----------
almost six-year-old and i'm pretty sure


---------24:14----------
that


---------24:14----------
you know they would outperform me in


---------24:15----------
many ways yeah i would do it


---------24:18----------
my three-year-old my three-year-old


---------24:19----------
yesterday told me that i need to eat


---------24:21----------
with my mouth closed


---------24:23----------
so you know i can check yeah i


---------24:26----------
i don't really know how to feel about


---------24:28----------
that because


---------24:29----------
on the one hand it's like wow we're like


---------24:31----------
you know she's learning manners


---------24:32----------
and stuff and also she's


---------24:36----------
you know being i don't


---------24:39----------
yeah it's it's i don't know


---------24:45----------
my older one is a little bit of a tyrant


---------24:48----------
oh yeah yeah she she recently discovered


---------24:51----------
that there's a job called a director


---------24:54----------
oh boy and that the job of the director


---------24:56----------
is to tell other people what to do


---------24:59----------
so she was like wait their whole job is


---------25:00----------
to direct people


---------25:02----------
and i was like yes that's correct and


---------25:03----------
she's like


---------25:06----------
she's she's power hungry she has the


---------25:08----------
desire to lord over others


---------25:10----------
i like it um that's sweet but yeah i'll


---------25:14----------
definitely i'm i'm a huge fan of of


---------25:16----------
miss kiff and and so that sounds like


---------25:18----------
fun


---------25:19----------
yeah um guy is amazing he really is


---------25:24----------
he's really good at what he does yes


---------25:28----------
i remember trying to convince him of


---------25:30----------
that some some time ago


---------25:32----------
oh for sure um yeah he also seems to


---------25:36----------
have grown a lot in confidence i've


---------25:37----------
caught


---------25:37----------
a couple of clips and and stuff of him


---------25:40----------
and he seems to be really doing amazing


---------25:42----------
yeah he's doing well for himself he


---------25:44----------
feels he feels good about it


---------25:45----------
yeah um but kind of going back to you


---------25:49----------
and developing a niche in horsemanship


---------25:52----------
right uh so i'm hearing that


---------25:55----------
you know early on you sort of decided


---------25:57----------
that you were going to be the best at


---------25:58----------
something


---------26:00----------
and then i can imagine the should in


---------26:02----------
your head


---------26:03----------
pushed you is that


---------26:06----------
fair to say yeah how did you feel


---------26:10----------
studying when you said you were an ag


---------26:12----------
major i assume you mean agriculture


---------26:14----------
yes okay agricultural communication well


---------26:17----------
agricultural education and


---------26:18----------
communications


---------26:19----------
is my major how did you feel about


---------26:21----------
having that as your major


---------26:24----------
i thought it was sick um it is


---------26:27----------
pretty good it was like cool okay


---------26:31----------
it was a it's pretty small major um


---------26:34----------
and all of my friends and my sister are


---------26:38----------
either mechanical engineers software


---------26:40----------
engineers electrical engineers or


---------26:42----------
uh engineer


---------26:45----------
medicine wonderful yeah all of them


---------26:50----------
if you really want to be try hard you


---------26:52----------
can do electrical engineering double


---------26:53----------
major pre-med


---------26:55----------
yeah or biomass biomed biomed


---------26:58----------
engineering


---------27:00----------
actually yeah biomed from biomed


---------27:02----------
engineering pre-med


---------27:04----------
there you go you can win all of the


---------27:06----------
prizes


---------27:07----------
it's very good um


---------27:11----------
yeah so all my friends were in there my


---------27:13----------
dad i think


---------27:15----------
deep down my dad probably wanted me to


---------27:16----------
be an engineer but knew that i would


---------27:18----------
never go into engineering um


---------27:20----------
so i just looked for a major that i


---------27:22----------
actually wanted to do and i


---------27:24----------
only applied to two schools and it was


---------27:26----------
cal poly and colorado state


---------27:28----------
fort collins or ag communications or


---------27:31----------
equine science


---------27:33----------
cool course science and so i'm hearing


---------27:37----------
that you've grown into someone that you


---------27:39----------
can be proud of


---------27:40----------
yeah yeah i think so and you've


---------27:42----------
accomplished a lot


---------27:44----------
yeah when you compare yourself to your


---------27:47----------
friends where are you


---------27:49----------
you doing good yeah most of them are


---------27:52----------
still in school


---------27:52----------
because uh they're they're pre-med


---------27:56----------
um or they're getting masters or


---------27:58----------
whatever so


---------27:59----------
yeah and you have started a non-profit


---------28:01----------
and built something


---------28:03----------
yeah you're not just a student right


---------28:06----------
thank god sorry chad if you're in school


---------28:08----------
stay in school school's great i hate it


---------28:10----------
god i'm so glad i'm not in college


---------28:11----------
anymore


---------28:13----------
i didn't hate college but i'm happy to


---------28:15----------
not be


---------28:17----------
in academics so why do you have to


---------28:19----------
listen to audiobooks when you're in the


---------28:21----------
car


---------28:22----------
that's like an interesting question i


---------28:25----------
guess i'm picking the books that i'm


---------28:26----------
reading


---------28:27----------
or listening to um


---------28:31----------
i don't know so i don't know because i


---------28:34----------
like learning


---------28:35----------
i don't like doing assignments that are


---------28:38----------
or that i thought were pointless i had


---------28:39----------
the whole like


---------28:41----------
a very subtle like [ __ ] the system thing


---------28:44----------
in my head but


---------28:45----------
i'm sure you like learning i have no


---------28:48----------
doubt of that in my mind


---------28:50----------
but i don't think you listen to audio


---------28:52----------
books because you like learning


---------28:55----------
what do you think i think you listen to


---------28:58----------
audio because


---------28:58----------
books because you should be learning oh


---------29:01----------
that's true


---------29:02----------
maybe yeah so if i were to tell you have


---------29:06----------
you


---------29:07----------
read harry potter no


---------29:10----------
any interest no do you like fiction


---------29:15----------
i don't know i've never i've never read


---------29:17----------
fiction in my own time


---------29:20----------
oh for school i've read fiction okay


---------29:22----------
what do you think about the idea of


---------29:24----------
reading fiction um


---------29:28----------
this is like i wish i wanted to because


---------29:30----------
i know that it it


---------29:32----------
like can be important honestly my


---------29:35----------
my first reaction is that i think it's


---------29:36----------
like watching movies and tv shows that


---------29:39----------
are fiction and i feel like that's a


---------29:40----------
waste of time but it's even more of a


---------29:42----------
waste of time because it takes longer


---------29:45----------
nice yeah so but i know that that's like


---------29:48----------
if we're gonna waste time we're gonna be


---------29:50----------
efficient about it right


---------29:52----------
yes yeah if we're gonna why would i


---------29:54----------
spend eight hours reading a book when i


---------29:56----------
could watch two hours reading a movie


---------29:57----------
we're going to optimize


---------29:59----------
our departure to the book while you're


---------30:02----------
getting somewhere


---------30:04----------
yeah right so always optimizing very


---------30:08----------
common in people with toxic productivity


---------30:11----------
also not necessarily a bad thing so i


---------30:12----------
think this is where um


---------30:14----------
you know your tendency to optimize is


---------30:16----------
probably something that's a


---------30:17----------
personality trait that will serve you


---------30:18----------
well i think the main thing is for us to


---------30:21----------
explore how you can get


---------30:22----------
in control of it instead of it being in


---------30:24----------
control of you


---------30:26----------
so let me ask you a question what do you


---------30:28----------
what would you say to a friend of yours


---------30:30----------
if they said yeah the only time i'm


---------30:32----------
allowed to sit outside


---------30:33----------
is if i have a very tall glass of water


---------30:35----------
so i can be productive


---------30:37----------
i hate that test i use that i use that


---------30:39----------
test in my head all the time


---------30:41----------
um can you tell me about it um


---------30:45----------
well just like you use in your head all


---------30:47----------
the time


---------30:48----------
uh like the the friend test


---------30:52----------
like if your friend was saying the


---------30:53----------
things that you're saying you know about


---------30:55----------
yourself what would you say to your


---------30:56----------
friend that kind of thing


---------30:57----------
what do you hate about that test because


---------31:00----------
it always shows that i'm


---------31:02----------
too hard on myself or that i'm not doing


---------31:04----------
what i would tell a friend to do


---------31:08----------
which is not like it's not a bad thing


---------31:09----------
it's a good test that's that's


---------31:11----------
why i use it but it is like a


---------31:16----------
i don't know i don't know how to


---------31:18----------
describe it


---------31:19----------
no no no can can i just think for a


---------31:22----------
second


---------31:23----------
for sure


---------31:26----------
[Music]


---------31:29----------
there's something oddly recursive about


---------31:31----------
what you just said


---------31:33----------
okay so like it's almost like


---------31:36----------
you should be doing better at passing


---------31:38----------
that test


---------31:41----------
you see that's actually that's true it's


---------31:44----------
the same thing


---------31:45----------
yeah it's like


---------31:48----------
yeah you're right okay so but


---------31:52----------
yeah so so then let's forget about that


---------31:53----------
test i don't but i


---------31:55----------
you know why do you think you would


---------31:58----------
advocate some things for your friends


---------32:01----------
as opposed or what what makes you have a


---------32:04----------
different standard for yourself


---------32:06----------
than other people oh


---------32:10----------
um we'll go into the whole like imposter


---------32:14----------
[ __ ]


---------32:14----------
i i feel like i'm extremely lucky to be


---------32:17----------
in the position that i'm in


---------32:18----------
um and i am i got i got lucky by there


---------32:21----------
being a redditor in my chat


---------32:22----------
when i was a small streamer that posted


---------32:23----------
me on lsf and then i met ms and then


---------32:25----------
like it went from there right


---------32:27----------
and i feel a ton of pressure because


---------32:31----------
um i have the platform that i do and


---------32:33----------
there aren't a lot of people doing


---------32:34----------
conservation education on twitch


---------32:36----------
um i call it an untapped reservoir all


---------32:38----------
the time not just because of the


---------32:39----------
fundraising potential but because of the


---------32:41----------
audience that we're reaching


---------32:42----------
that is like from the people that i know


---------32:46----------
in conservation education just


---------32:47----------
notoriously hard to reach


---------32:49----------
and educate um so i feel like i have


---------32:52----------
this opportunity to teach so many people


---------32:55----------
things that they wouldn't be learning


---------32:56----------
otherwise and so i need to do a really


---------32:58----------
good job at it


---------32:59----------
and i need to do it fast before the


---------33:01----------
platform dies or before


---------33:02----------
i get canceled or before i get banned or


---------33:04----------
before you know whatever before i lose


---------33:06----------
the opportunity


---------33:07----------
so i feel like because the platform that


---------33:08----------
i have i have to do good with it


---------33:10----------
and not not waste it


---------33:14----------
okay so we're gonna note a couple of


---------33:17----------
things okay


---------33:18----------
one is the sand and the hourglasses


---------33:20----------
running out


---------33:23----------
mm-hmm is that how it feels to you


---------33:26----------
um yeah i mean it's not super severe


---------33:29----------
it's not like i'm like


---------33:31----------
what if i only have a year left like i


---------33:33----------
think i have a good you know


---------33:34----------
5 10 15 years with what i'm doing right


---------33:38----------
now


---------33:39----------
um but eventually i know that


---------33:42----------
you know it's a social platform like


---------33:45----------
it'll change


---------33:46----------
or die or whatever and um


---------33:50----------
it doesn't sound to me like you are


---------33:52----------
behaving in a way in which you have 15


---------33:54----------
years left


---------33:56----------
that's true i don't know i don't know if


---------33:59----------
i have 15 years on twitch


---------34:00----------
i don't know how long i'm going to be


---------34:01----------
streaming for um


---------34:04----------
elvis my non-profit i'm not dropping in


---------34:06----------
the next


---------34:07----------
10 years i need to do it fast


---------34:10----------
can you help me understand that


---------34:14----------
um


---------34:17----------
i guess it's just because i feel like i


---------34:19----------
have the opportunity now it's the same


---------34:21----------
reason that i do so many sponsors


---------34:23----------
i like feel like i have to bankroll


---------34:26----------
right now while i have sponsorship


---------34:28----------
opportunities um


---------34:30----------
[Music]


---------34:31----------
i don't know just because it's like


---------34:33----------
there i also need to make money


---------34:35----------
um because i put all of my money that


---------34:39----------
i've made through streaming into the


---------34:40----------
property that i


---------34:41----------
purchased for the nonprofit um and my


---------34:43----------
parents helped me with the down payment


---------34:44----------
so now i owe my parents money


---------34:46----------
um and you know i gotta pay a mortgage


---------34:48----------
and i have to pay for my horse and i


---------34:50----------
have to pay


---------34:50----------
for my backpack and for rent and food


---------34:53----------
and


---------34:55----------
all that um so


---------34:58----------
so this may sound kind of weird maya but


---------35:00----------
there's what you need to do


---------35:03----------
there's so i don't doubt that the time


---------35:06----------
to strike is now


---------35:07----------
and strike while the iron is hot does


---------35:09----------
that make sense like you're like


---------35:10----------
this is an opportunity i have to do this


---------35:13----------
now i can get behind that 100


---------35:16----------
and i'd say go for it at the same time


---------35:19----------
there's a difference between


---------35:21----------
now is the time to act and feeling like


---------35:24----------
now is the time to act


---------35:27----------
okay does that make any sense to you can


---------35:30----------
you elaborate on that


---------35:31----------
yeah so i think um you do a really good


---------35:34----------
job of piecing things together so i'm


---------35:36----------
gonna go


---------35:36----------
like a little bit more theoretical so


---------35:39----------
the feeling of desperation is a feeling


---------35:42----------
right so if i have an opportunity that's


---------35:44----------
only available now i can take advantage


---------35:46----------
of the opportunity but whether i feel


---------35:48----------
desperate the the feeling of desperation


---------35:50----------
may be completely appropriate


---------35:53----------
but it's still a feeling right yeah and


---------35:56----------
and what i'm hearing the need for is


---------35:58----------
some separation between


---------36:00----------
taking advantage of the oper opportunity


---------36:03----------
and sort of


---------36:04----------
feeling desperate that now is only going


---------36:07----------
to be the only chance that you get


---------36:10----------
right so do you feel


---------36:13----------
desperate um


---------36:18----------
yeah i think so i think it's primarily


---------36:21----------
financially driven right now though like


---------36:23----------
if there was a sponsor that i didn't


---------36:25----------
necessarily want to do


---------36:26----------
i would do it um if it was like a


---------36:29----------
significant amount of money because


---------36:30----------
i don't think that that same deal will


---------36:32----------
come in the next like six months


---------36:34----------
yeah i can understand that so i think


---------36:37----------
that there's the financial reality and


---------36:39----------
then there's like


---------36:40----------
the way that you feel about it which i


---------36:41----------
think gets that's


---------36:43----------
a lot of what leads to toxic


---------36:45----------
productivity does that make sense


---------36:47----------
yep can you explain it to us


---------36:51----------
how those two things could be related


---------36:57----------
maybe i'm the thing that's sticking in


---------36:59----------
my head right now is like


---------37:01----------
the that they're two separate things is


---------37:04----------
there's like a positive and and doing


---------37:06----------
what's in front of you and taking the


---------37:07----------
opportunity and then


---------37:09----------
um feeling desperate about it and doing


---------37:12----------
it because of that feeling of


---------37:13----------
desperation


---------37:15----------
right so one of those is the productive


---------37:17----------
part one of those is the toxic


---------37:19----------
part right right so so


---------37:23----------
beautifully explained by the way i well


---------37:26----------
thank you i disagree but


---------37:28----------
thank you you should have done a better


---------37:30----------
job is that what you mean to say


---------37:32----------
yeah um but yeah and i guess it makes


---------37:35----------
everything that i go


---------37:36----------
it's not everything that i do is toxic


---------37:38----------
but um


---------37:40----------
being as productive as i am feels toxic


---------37:42----------
because it's all


---------37:43----------
like i have to do it now because like i


---------37:46----------
have the opportunity now so it's not


---------37:48----------
like i'm doing it just because it's like


---------37:49----------
sitting there and like now's the time


---------37:50----------
it's like you have to do this now do


---------37:52----------
this this is


---------37:53----------
there and what happens if you don't do


---------37:55----------
it now


---------37:57----------
um i don't make enough money or i lose


---------38:02----------
viewership or alves


---------38:04----------
doesn't do as well as i want um and then


---------38:06----------
what happens


---------38:09----------
and then well lots of different things


---------38:12----------
if it's the money thing i don't get to


---------38:13----------
pay my parents back which is


---------38:15----------
not gonna happen um if it's the


---------38:19----------
what are the other things i said uh


---------38:20----------
alvarez doesn't do as well i


---------38:22----------
have like a i have a couple tests that i


---------38:25----------
run in my head for that as well one of


---------38:27----------
or for just like when i'm around the


---------38:28----------
non-profit and one of them is


---------38:30----------
i have a conservation podcast also that


---------38:33----------
i'm doing monthly now i was doing it


---------38:34----------
weekly


---------38:35----------
and there's a lot of people that come on


---------38:37----------
there that i really really admire and


---------38:39----------
respect for their research or their


---------38:41----------
you know their what they do in education


---------38:43----------
or whatever and so i have that list of


---------38:45----------
people and i think


---------38:46----------
if they were watching my content right


---------38:48----------
now or they were seeing what i was doing


---------38:49----------
with this non-profit would i be proud or


---------38:51----------
would i be embarrassed


---------38:52----------
um so i would be embarrassed if i didn't


---------38:54----------
do well without vas


---------38:56----------
and for my reputation in in the industry


---------38:59----------
um


---------39:01----------
and then and then i remember the other


---------39:04----------
thing i said


---------39:06----------
if i was embarrassed and i didn't do


---------39:07----------
well in the industry uh then i feel like


---------39:09----------
i would have to stop climbing the ladder


---------39:12----------
you would have to stop climbing the


---------39:14----------
ladder


---------39:16----------
well no maybe i just get knocked down if


---------39:18----------
you i don't know i i would like


---------39:20----------
i would just what you initially said


---------39:22----------
even if it doesn't


---------39:24----------
right so then yeah


---------39:29----------
you would have to stop climbing the


---------39:31----------
ladder like that's an interesting


---------39:32----------
statement


---------39:35----------
yeah i don't know i guess i'd go back to


---------39:36----------
being an intern or i would go do


---------39:38----------
something else


---------39:41----------
i think you'd get a b maybe


---------39:45----------
in your thing god forbid i'm gonna be


---------39:49----------
yeah so what i'm hearing from you maya


---------39:54----------
is and let me know if this is i step out


---------39:56----------
of line okay


---------39:57----------
how are you feeling right now feeling


---------39:59----------
okay i'm fine okay yeah


---------40:00----------
what i'm hearing is that if you didn't


---------40:02----------
take advantage of this opportunity it


---------40:04----------
would all come crumbling down


---------40:08----------
all yeah i guess


---------40:12----------
i'm trying to think of what wouldn't but


---------40:14----------
yeah i don't really know


---------40:16----------
right so it's interesting because you


---------40:17----------
can think about all the things that


---------40:18----------
would come crumbling down even though if


---------40:20----------
we're if we're logical about it like


---------40:23----------
you're not going to get flattened by any


---------40:25----------
of this stuff like you can miss


---------40:26----------
opportunities things will go


---------40:28----------
not your way and you're going to do fine


---------40:31----------
yeah do you believe that about yourself


---------40:35----------
yeah that would be fine yeah kill myself


---------40:38----------
so that's not what well i'm not gonna


---------40:41----------
die


---------40:41----------
how else wouldn't i be fine i would i'd


---------40:43----------
be alive like


---------40:46----------
but i would i probably wouldn't be happy


---------40:49----------
okay


---------40:50----------
that was not what i was expecting to


---------40:51----------
hear


---------40:53----------
oh but by fine i meant that i think your


---------40:56----------
non-profit would continue to do well


---------40:59----------
and you would continue to grow i thought


---------41:01----------
you meant


---------41:02----------
like sorry i'm interrupting you a lot


---------41:05----------
nope no


---------41:06----------
i i appreciate it please please


---------41:08----------
interrupt what were you gonna say i


---------41:09----------
thought you meant if the non-profit


---------41:11----------
didn't work


---------41:12----------
and like my opportunity being like me


---------41:14----------
streaming and doing the non-profit


---------41:16----------
like if i had to like stop streaming for


---------41:18----------
whatever reason yeah and obvious dad


---------41:20----------
like that's what i thought you're


---------41:21----------
talking about


---------41:21----------
yeah so i know this sounds weird i think


---------41:23----------
you'd do fine if that happened


---------41:27----------
because what i'm putting what i'm the


---------41:29----------
reason i make that assessment is because


---------41:31----------
i think your commitment to


---------41:34----------
this mission is so resilient


---------41:39----------
that you would find a way to make a


---------41:41----------
difference


---------41:42----------
and if it wasn't this opportunity that


---------41:44----------
you're taking advantage of you'd


---------41:47----------
keep on floating around the space and


---------41:50----------
because you are


---------41:51----------
productive and because you are brilliant


---------41:53----------
and gifted and all of those other things


---------41:56----------
that you would find a way to move


---------41:58----------
forward


---------41:59----------
what do you think about that that's


---------42:02----------
probably true


---------42:03----------
i'm not sure that it would be in the


---------42:05----------
well probably would be in the same


---------42:06----------
industry i can't imagine


---------42:07----------
doing a different one but yeah i'd


---------42:09----------
probably find something else


---------42:11----------
to do but i can understand


---------42:14----------
that in your mind you may not


---------42:18----------
remember that all the time


---------42:22----------
yeah i mean i don't think about it but


---------42:24----------
what do you think about


---------42:28----------
just in general like when it comes to


---------42:32----------
not seizing opportunities


---------42:35----------
um


---------42:40----------
i don't know just like slowing down


---------42:43----------
like things with elvis like if i don't


---------42:45----------
seize an opportunity with alves like is


---------42:47----------
that going to slow down


---------42:48----------
the the development of the nonprofit and


---------42:51----------
like how fast i can get to doing


---------42:53----------
collaborations and how many ambassadors


---------42:54----------
we acquire


---------42:56----------
um and then for myself it's more like


---------42:58----------
money


---------42:59----------
do you want to slow down no


---------43:03----------
can you afford to slow down


---------43:07----------
um yeah really probably


---------43:10----------
yeah i think so um obviously it's


---------43:13----------
supposed to be a three-year plan i mean


---------43:14----------
it would be completely reasonable if it


---------43:16----------
took me three years to


---------43:17----------
to build out the facility that i'm


---------43:19----------
building um


---------43:20----------
but it doesn't sound like you can afford


---------43:23----------
to slow down


---------43:24----------
well not to me but in reality yeah


---------43:28----------
i could well we're talking to you okay


---------43:32----------
so so so let's talk about you know


---------43:36----------
forget about reality because who cares


---------43:37----------
about that okay for sure


---------43:43----------
why can't you slow down


---------43:46----------
because the more sponsors i do the


---------43:48----------
faster i make my money back


---------43:50----------
um and then the faster alves


---------43:53----------
develops the faster i have a


---------43:55----------
successfully running


---------43:56----------
non-profit that i'm really proud of


---------43:59----------
that's making an actual difference


---------44:01----------
right now it's just all temporary what's


---------44:04----------
the rush probably the like


---------44:08----------
amount of time that i feel like i have


---------44:10----------
to


---------44:12----------
make the difference like how long i'm


---------44:14----------
going to be streaming


---------44:15----------
or so i think we come back to the sand


---------44:18----------
and the hourglasses running out


---------44:20----------
mm-hmm and so this is where


---------44:24----------
hey how's this conversation going for


---------44:27----------
you by the way


---------44:28----------
good okay makes sense yeah yeah so


---------44:32----------
let me ask you something have you has


---------44:33----------
the sand and the hourglass run out for


---------44:35----------
you before


---------44:38----------
have you missed an opportunity that you


---------44:41----------
can never get back


---------44:46----------
i don't think so i can't think of


---------44:48----------
anything i mean maybe


---------44:50----------
maybe something small but no like big


---------44:52----------
life so nothing pops into your head when


---------44:54----------
i ask that question


---------45:02----------
no


---------45:04----------
it feels to me my when i'm talking to


---------45:06----------
you


---------45:07----------
that you're like you know the image that


---------45:09----------
i get in my mind is like a surfer who's


---------45:11----------
riding a really high wave that's going


---------45:13----------
to crash at some point


---------45:15----------
oh that's great to hear so


---------45:19----------
does that image resonate with you at all


---------45:22----------
um


---------45:25----------
i guess yeah it does kind of feel like a


---------45:29----------
peak


---------45:30----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------45:34----------
but i don't i mean i don't anticipate a


---------45:36----------
crash anytime soon


---------45:37----------
sure but eventually like for all


---------45:39----------
streamers


---------45:40----------
not all streamers can't speak for all


---------45:42----------
streamers but there's like a


---------45:44----------
we have this crazy opportunity while


---------45:46----------
we're this age you know we're streaming


---------45:47----------
and


---------45:48----------
you peek in viewership at some point you


---------45:50----------
just do you know like you get to a point


---------45:51----------
where you're like as big as you're gonna


---------45:53----------
be


---------45:53----------
you may get followers but like you'll


---------45:55----------
end up decreasing in viewership


---------45:57----------
eventually


---------45:58----------
um so there is like i don't know there's


---------45:59----------
there's a peak somewhere um and i do


---------46:01----------
feel like with the start of all this and


---------46:03----------
once elvis is running and i'm doing all


---------46:05----------
that content like


---------46:06----------
yeah like how do you


---------46:10----------
i don't know like how do you achieve


---------46:11----------
higher than that i don't know


---------46:14----------
it's kind of like uh this is a bad


---------46:16----------
example and i'm sure


---------46:17----------
he's completely fine but there was some


---------46:19----------
kid i don't even remember his name


---------46:20----------
that won that fortnight world cup or


---------46:22----------
something at age like 14 or something


---------46:25----------
15 was it yeah yeah


---------46:29----------
um when he did that my first thought was


---------46:33----------
like damn


---------46:34----------
if he's gonna be doing competitive


---------46:35----------
esports for the rest of his life and


---------46:37----------
fortnite is his game like


---------46:39----------
how is he ever gonna feel like he's


---------46:42----------
beat himself again i don't mean beat


---------46:44----------
himself like you know


---------46:46----------
like how can he ever top that right


---------46:49----------
yeah yeah so you said it feels like


---------46:50----------
you're at the peak


---------46:52----------
yeah well not right now i'm like


---------46:56----------
up there though i'm like a building


---------46:58----------
building up there


---------47:01----------
yeah i mean where do we go once we hit


---------47:03----------
the top of the peak


---------47:06----------
i don't know um i'll need to find other


---------47:10----------
things that i think are really


---------47:11----------
fulfilling and


---------47:12----------
and uh productive like i


---------47:15----------
for matt like he has otk ms giff


---------47:18----------
um has otk and he's gonna like continue


---------47:22----------
doing business


---------47:23----------
after he decides to not stream so much


---------47:25----------
anymore um


---------47:26----------
and so that'll be really fulfilling for


---------47:28----------
him and he'll take all of his experience


---------47:29----------
into there so he'll continue being


---------47:30----------
really successful


---------47:31----------
for me it's hard because my goal is


---------47:35----------
conservation education you know like i


---------47:37----------
want to teach as many people as possible


---------47:39----------
so the idea of going from streaming and


---------47:41----------
doing it on stream to like


---------47:42----------
tens of thousands to going to like if i


---------47:45----------
quit streaming and i go to


---------47:47----------
classrooms or something and teach kids


---------47:49----------
it'll just feel like less of an


---------47:51----------
impact because of like what i want to do


---------47:54----------
you know but i guess i could consult or


---------47:57----------
something and teach people about digital


---------47:58----------
conservation education that that might


---------48:00----------
be fulfilling


---------48:01----------
but not as fulfilling is actually doing


---------48:03----------
it maybe it would i don't know


---------48:10----------
so maya i'm hearing a lot of different


---------48:12----------
stuff


---------48:13----------
okay okay so here's what i'm hearing


---------48:16----------
all right now you do a really good job


---------48:19----------
of


---------48:20----------
sharing a statement or a feeling and


---------48:23----------
then putting a lot of context or


---------48:25----------
counterpoints around that


---------48:26----------
if you notice that you do that so like


---------48:28----------
for example you were like it


---------48:30----------
it feels like i met i asked you about


---------48:32----------
the surfer analogy and then you said


---------48:34----------
i feel like i'm at the peak and then if


---------48:36----------
i ask you do you feel like you're at the


---------48:37----------
peak and then you say not yet and then


---------48:39----------
you kind of add some context to know i


---------48:41----------
could do this and i could do this


---------48:42----------
so i think you have to be a little bit


---------48:44----------
careful in your mind because i think a


---------48:46----------
lot of your toxic


---------48:47----------
productivity the toxicity is coming from


---------48:50----------
that instinctual


---------48:51----------
response and then you do all of these


---------48:55----------
things to kind of like


---------48:56----------
wrap around it and kind of like


---------49:00----------
you know what i mean yeah yeah right so


---------49:03----------
just be careful about that because i


---------49:04----------
think if you don't


---------49:07----------
justifying your toxic productivity or


---------49:10----------
reassuring yourself


---------49:11----------
is not the same as like fixing the root


---------49:13----------
issue of like why you feel


---------49:15----------
a particular way so here's what i'm


---------49:17----------
hearing the first is that you carved out


---------49:19----------
your niche


---------49:20----------
right you were not the star student but


---------49:22----------
you found this thing in which you could


---------49:24----------
be a star it's a


---------49:25----------
plus you're 22 you're doing great you're


---------49:27----------
growing it's a lot of fun you're


---------49:29----------
genuinely dedicated


---------49:30----------
i absolutely see that and then there's


---------49:32----------
also like this kind of


---------49:34----------
tricky thing right because there's the


---------49:35----------
sand and the hourglass is running out


---------49:37----------
like you need to be learning more you


---------49:38----------
should be doing better it's got to be


---------49:40----------
better better better


---------49:42----------
we haven't really quite talked about


---------49:44----------
this


---------49:45----------
but i i get the sense that


---------49:48----------
you're both confident in yourself and


---------49:51----------
you have the echoes of not being


---------49:53----------
confident in yourself left over


---------49:56----------
so it's sort of like this idea where


---------49:58----------
like until i make it to a certain level


---------50:01----------
then i can rest easy we haven't quite


---------50:03----------
talked about that yet


---------50:05----------
but i would venture if we continue to


---------50:07----------
talk we would


---------50:08----------
eventually uncover this sort of idea


---------50:10----------
that once i


---------50:12----------
get to this point then i can relax do


---------50:15----------
you have that kind of thinking in your


---------50:16----------
mind


---------50:19----------
what does that point look like i have no


---------50:22----------
idea


---------50:23----------
yeah i haven't hit it yet i don't know


---------50:26----------
what it looks like


---------50:26----------
yeah so that's but you know what i mean


---------50:28----------
when i say like


---------50:30----------
there's a part of your mind that says


---------50:31----------
you can relax once everything gets


---------50:33----------
settled


---------50:34----------
yeah like once you're sure that it'll


---------50:36----------
last once the sand in the hourglass is


---------50:38----------
no longer running out


---------50:40----------
right once the house of cards gets you


---------50:43----------
know slathered and concrete and becomes


---------50:45----------
stable


---------50:47----------
so i think that's tricky because you


---------50:49----------
know i it


---------50:50----------
very insightful maya so i ask you what


---------50:52----------
does that look like and you're like i


---------50:53----------
have no idea and you never will


---------50:56----------
so this is the problem with toxic


---------50:58----------
productivity is like


---------50:59----------
even if i get to this peak i want to be


---------51:02----------
climbing i want to be growing i need to


---------51:04----------
be doing better because i don't quite


---------51:05----------
have 100


---------51:06----------
faith in myself and


---------51:10----------
then you're going to find another peak


---------51:11----------
to climb you can start doing consulting


---------51:13----------
you can do this you can do this it'll


---------51:14----------
never end


---------51:16----------
you can always find some way to grow


---------51:20----------
you can push yourself to be better and


---------51:22----------
learn more and stuff like that but as


---------51:24----------
long as like


---------51:25----------
but that's just the sand and the


---------51:26----------
hourglass is going to continue


---------51:29----------
like you're always going to feel like oh


---------51:30----------
now i have this consulting opportunity


---------51:32----------
and like someone else on tiktok is doing


---------51:34----------
conservation so like


---------51:35----------
my time has passed and there is another


---------51:38----------
22 year old and i'm haggard and old at


---------51:40----------
the age of 24.


---------51:41----------
right you know yeah and then unless i


---------51:43----------
start consulting then that person's


---------51:45----------
gonna do the consulting and then i


---------51:46----------
i will have you know there's new forms


---------51:49----------
of social media and the platform is


---------51:50----------
different


---------51:51----------
that kind of thinking can propagate


---------51:53----------
forever


---------51:57----------
so what do you think we do about this


---------52:03----------
i don't know i've uh


---------52:06----------
yet to figure it out i don't know i i


---------52:08----------
can't remember when i wasn't


---------52:12----------
i kind of think of like when i wasn't


---------52:14----------
like this because it definitely wasn't


---------52:16----------
in high school


---------52:18----------
um you definitely weren't like this in


---------52:20----------
high school or you were like


---------52:21----------
i was i was like this in high school and


---------52:23----------
i i was like this in middle school as


---------52:25----------
well


---------52:26----------
um i think at least since sixth grade um


---------52:32----------
so i don't know how to fix that


---------52:36----------
what were you like before the sixth


---------52:38----------
grade


---------52:39----------
um


---------52:40----------
[Music]


---------52:45----------
i don't know how to describe myself i


---------52:48----------
mean i


---------52:48----------
spent a lot of time outside um with at


---------52:52----------
the barn with my horse and


---------52:54----------
uh


---------52:57----------
had a lot of playdates and like showing


---------53:00----------
people the animals and whatever but


---------53:01----------
there was never like a


---------53:03----------
uh i need to get good at something


---------53:07----------
i just actually that's not true no it


---------53:10----------
goes further back because i did uh


---------53:12----------
figure skating um and felt really


---------53:14----------
competitive in that


---------53:16----------
so and i was like oh my gosh i was


---------53:19----------
little


---------53:21----------
before fourth grade


---------53:24----------
so then even further back


---------53:27----------
before that i don't know then i just


---------53:29----------
existed as like a child


---------53:30----------
i think i had aspirations i think i was


---------53:33----------
just like


---------53:33----------
trying things yeah so let me ask you


---------53:37----------
something what would it feel like


---------53:39----------
to relax


---------53:43----------
my first thought was stressful which is


---------53:45----------
terrible


---------53:46----------
it doesn't make sense you shouldn't feel


---------53:48----------
that way maya


---------53:49----------
right um


---------53:54----------
yeah no i don't know i think i just get


---------53:55----------
stressed out i think


---------53:57----------
uh


---------54:01----------
i don't feel like a waste of time yeah


---------54:03----------
so


---------54:04----------
what is it like to waste time how does


---------54:06----------
that


---------54:07----------
feel to you the thought of wasting time


---------54:11----------
stressful it like makes me itch okay so


---------54:14----------
stress is an umbrella term okay right


---------54:18----------
so like what what can you tell me more


---------54:20----------
about what would be stressful about you


---------54:24----------
taking a day off falling behind


---------54:27----------
and then having more to do the next day


---------54:30----------
or


---------54:32----------
not making money that day or not i don't


---------54:35----------
know


---------54:36----------
not talking to who i was supposed to


---------54:37----------
talk to that day or like letting people


---------54:38----------
down by not


---------54:41----------
doing everything talking to everybody um


---------54:45----------
yeah are you behind now


---------54:49----------
yeah a little bit not a lot


---------54:54----------
really yeah oh i mean in terms of like


---------54:58----------
tasks yeah how about


---------55:02----------
spiritually do you feel like you're


---------55:04----------
behind in life


---------55:07----------
no i don't think so either


---------55:11----------
have you been behind in life before


---------55:17----------
yeah um when i was


---------55:20----------
i my previous relationship i dated a guy


---------55:22----------
for five years and we started dating


---------55:24----------
when i was


---------55:26----------
15 um and then up through college


---------55:29----------
uh and i feel like we both kind of


---------55:31----------
paused


---------55:32----------
in that relationship you know which is


---------55:34----------
like kind of normal um so i do feel like


---------55:36----------
i was behind


---------55:37----------
there and then after that i did like


---------55:40----------
a lot of therapy um and


---------55:43----------
had like a year and some change of being


---------55:46----------
single and whatever and


---------55:48----------
um grown a lot since then but i was


---------55:51----------
yeah i felt like i was stunted back then


---------55:54----------
how did it feel to be stunted i didn't


---------55:56----------
know i was stunted so


---------55:59----------
um so at the time


---------56:02----------
it was just like how it was and then


---------56:04----------
after it was like damn


---------56:06----------
that's embarrassing


---------56:09----------
so i'm hearing another part of your


---------56:10----------
toxic productivity which is you're never


---------56:13----------
gonna fall behind again


---------56:16----------
yeah maybe right so you've been there


---------56:19----------
before


---------56:20----------
and you may not have noted at the time


---------56:21----------
but i think you knew it at the time


---------56:23----------
you understood on some level


---------56:26----------
that this was not good for sure and you


---------56:29----------
just didn't know any different back then


---------56:32----------
right but now that you know different i


---------56:33----------
think part of where i hear your


---------56:35----------
desperation coming from


---------56:36----------
is like never again


---------56:40----------
and i'm sort of hearing it i'm going to


---------56:43----------
connect some dots


---------56:44----------
here you let me know if these are fair


---------56:45----------
or unfair but like


---------56:47----------
i get the sense like you know this


---------56:48----------
desperation this wave crashing this like


---------56:52----------
there's just a lot of like imagery that


---------56:54----------
maybe i'm inflating so you got to let me


---------56:56----------
know you got to set me straight okay


---------56:58----------
if i'm being too dank but um


---------57:02----------
you know i i i get a lot of like weird


---------57:05----------
things smile like so i'm getting a


---------57:07----------
feeling of like fear i'm getting a fear


---------57:09----------
of


---------57:09----------
it's weird because i think these things


---------57:11----------
are co-exist


---------57:13----------
with confidence so like i'm getting some


---------57:15----------
sense of like it's going to come


---------57:16----------
crumbling down this is my a


---------57:18----------
plus i have to make it work you know i'm


---------57:20----------
actually i'm crushing those noobs who


---------57:22----------
are in


---------57:22----------
like applying to med school right now


---------57:24----------
because i'm out actually making the


---------57:25----------
world


---------57:26----------
a better place and and i can hold my


---------57:28----------
head up high


---------57:29----------
because i have an a plus and this is my


---------57:31----------
niche


---------57:33----------
and and there's all that kind of stuff


---------57:35----------
and like if that all comes like


---------57:36----------
crumbling down


---------57:37----------
because what i hear is really like a


---------57:38----------
desperation that it's all going to come


---------57:40----------
crumbling down


---------57:42----------
then who am i going to be i'm going to


---------57:43----------
be back to being stuck i'm going to back


---------57:44----------
to be


---------57:45----------
behind and this is where you assure me


---------57:47----------
that you're not going to kill yourself


---------57:49----------
but it's sort of it's interesting right


---------57:51----------
because it's like it's that's the


---------57:52----------
reassurance it sort of implies that


---------57:54----------
there's not


---------57:55----------
there's nothing in the middle yeah right


---------57:57----------
there's like where you are


---------57:59----------
now and there's no gray zone between


---------58:02----------
like don't worry i won't kill myself


---------58:03----------
and i'm crushing it and started a


---------58:06----------
non-profit and i'm accomplishing


---------58:08----------
so like this is a crazy thing right i


---------58:10----------
ask you are you behind and you're like


---------58:12----------
a little bit and then it's like you've


---------58:13----------
got a three-year plan which is you're


---------58:15----------
accomplishing in three months


---------58:16----------
so that's drastically ahead and


---------58:18----------
logically


---------58:19----------
if you were your friend you would say


---------58:21----------
maya you can afford to slow down you've


---------58:23----------
got


---------58:23----------
you know you've got about 33 months that


---------58:26----------
you're ahead


---------58:29----------
but that logical part like i don't think


---------58:31----------
you can


---------58:33----------
i think it's terrifying like stressful


---------58:35----------
is a good word


---------58:36----------
like what would it be like


---------58:40----------
to take a day off


---------58:45----------
i i just feel like i would be falling


---------58:47----------
behind if i did


---------58:50----------
um we'll see because i'm supposed to so


---------58:53----------
my birthday is on the 24th and


---------58:54----------
i want to it's kind of weird dumb


---------58:57----------
i just like want to go to a hotel that's


---------59:00----------
not far away because i don't want to be


---------59:01----------
too far away from the nonprofit and the


---------59:02----------
animals in case anything happens like i


---------59:04----------
don't want to actually travel


---------59:05----------
but i just want to sit in a hotel


---------59:06----------
because then i feel like i have an


---------59:07----------
excuse to not be on my pc and to not be


---------59:09----------
working


---------59:10----------
um but even then i guarantee i'm still


---------59:14----------
going to be


---------59:15----------
doing emails like on my phone and like


---------59:18----------
trying to be productive so


---------59:21----------
yeah i don't know if i actually had to


---------59:23----------
sit there and relax


---------59:25----------
without my phone or without like the


---------59:27----------
ability to work


---------59:28----------
i just don't think i would like it i


---------59:30----------
think i would panic yep


---------59:32----------
and what would your mind produce for you


---------59:34----------
in those moments


---------59:36----------
what kind of thoughts would you have


---------59:39----------
um


---------59:39----------
[Music]


---------59:43----------
well if it was my choice then it would


---------59:45----------
be guilt


---------59:46----------
if i was like forced into the situation


---------59:48----------
then i'd just be like


---------59:50----------
scared what would you feel guilty about


---------59:54----------
um not taking


---------59:58----------
like having a full day like that many


---------60:00----------
hours to do


---------60:01----------
things and to catch up on things and to


---------60:04----------
get ahead on things and not doing it


---------60:06----------
what's wrong with not getting ahead on


---------60:08----------
things


---------60:12----------
i leave more for myself the next day and


---------60:14----------
then the next day and the next day and


---------60:15----------
then it piles up and then i lose my mind


---------60:17----------
okay why do you have to do so much


---------60:22----------
because i have the opportunity now


---------60:28----------
yeah why did you start laughing there


---------60:31----------
it's like a circle


---------60:32----------
circuit yeah i have a full circle thing


---------60:36----------
yeah so this is where i think


---------60:40----------
my i know it sounds you're gonna hold on


---------60:43----------
can i think for a second


---------60:53----------
maya do you wanna do you do you want to


---------60:57----------
be


---------60:58----------
no longer toxically productive


---------61:02----------
i don't know i to be honest like i


---------61:04----------
cannot imagine myself


---------61:06----------
not moving as fast as i do okay i would


---------61:09----------
just feel bad about myself i feel like i


---------61:11----------
could do better


---------61:12----------
yep so the reason i because i i think


---------61:15----------
that this


---------61:15----------
this so the next the rest of this


---------61:17----------
conversation is useless


---------61:19----------
because because like i think it starts


---------61:22----------
with do you want to change


---------61:24----------
i wish i do wish that i could relax i


---------61:28----------
in college i was stre


---------61:31----------
we talked about this at the very


---------61:32----------
beginning it was like stress but it was


---------61:34----------
bad stress


---------61:35----------
because i didn't care about what i was


---------61:36----------
doing but in college i could go out i


---------61:39----------
would go out during golden hour and sit


---------61:40----------
there and just like watch


---------61:41----------
you know and really enjoyed that and


---------61:44----------
like


---------61:45----------
could soak it in whatever i would do art


---------61:46----------
projects just for fun like i would paint


---------61:48----------
stuff and


---------61:49----------
and whatever because all i had to do was


---------61:53----------
an assignment you know and then turn it


---------61:55----------
in and once i got done with if i did if


---------61:56----------
i wasn't done with all that i was like


---------61:58----------
i could not relax but once i was done


---------62:01----------
and i felt caught up with it i didn't


---------62:02----------
feel the need to excel past that


---------62:04----------
um so i would just sit


---------62:07----------
and chill and like soak in stuff i wish


---------62:10----------
that i could do that


---------62:10----------
now but now that i have


---------62:14----------
all the autonomy and i have like i know


---------62:16----------
what i have to do to get ahead


---------62:18----------
um i just feel like i constantly have to


---------62:21----------
be doing that does that make any sense


---------62:23----------
makes perfect sense okay yeah so i think


---------62:26----------
that


---------62:26----------
being in charge you know it's


---------62:29----------
interesting so when i was in residency


---------62:30----------
we work like 80 hours a week right and


---------62:32----------
that's a lot that's


---------62:34----------
so much and so then people would say


---------62:36----------
like oh like after you're done with


---------62:38----------
residency like you get to relax


---------62:40----------
right like you only have to work 60


---------62:41----------
hours a week and then i sort of did that


---------62:43----------
for a while and then i became my own


---------62:45----------
boss


---------62:46----------
and then it was like wow like if i don't


---------62:49----------
do this thing


---------62:50----------
it doesn't get done the earlier it gets


---------62:54----------
done


---------62:54----------
the better it is for everyone and the


---------62:57----------
only bottleneck to making the world a


---------62:59----------
better place


---------63:00----------
is my laziness


---------63:04----------
and so i better get up off my ass


---------63:05----------
because i can do all of these things i'm


---------63:08----------
the only one that can do them


---------63:09----------
and if they if i don't do them they


---------63:11----------
don't get done right


---------63:13----------
yeah that that part resonates yeah


---------63:18----------
so i i think i think it comes down to


---------63:21----------
consequences which is like what happens


---------63:23----------
if that stuff doesn't get done


---------63:30----------
um i mean for me


---------63:33----------
it's just like there are less people


---------63:36----------
learning about conservation and less


---------63:37----------
good is happening


---------63:39----------
for the planet um there's like


---------63:43----------
that group of people that's not going to


---------63:45----------
hear about not using this rodenticide


---------63:47----------
you know and they're going to use it and


---------63:48----------
then animals are going to die


---------63:51----------
um yeah so you have you have a real


---------63:54----------
op combo there because i think you have


---------63:58----------
your toxic productivity sand and the


---------64:00----------
hourglass is running out a touch of


---------64:01----------
imposter syndrome it'll all end and


---------64:04----------
in shambles the wave will crash that


---------64:07----------
part of your mind


---------64:08----------
then finds a very interesting poster


---------64:11----------
child


---------64:12----------
which is make the world a better place


---------64:14----------
and the two of those when combined


---------64:18----------
are very very difficult to argue against


---------64:23----------
but be careful because which one really


---------64:25----------
is it


---------64:27----------
right which one comes first is it the


---------64:30----------
feeling of the sand and the hourglass or


---------64:31----------
like you like relentlessly like


---------64:34----------
why do you sleep maya imagine how many


---------64:36----------
animals are dying


---------64:37----------
every hour you sleep i've actually


---------64:40----------
yeah i've struggled sleeping before


---------64:42----------
because of that


---------64:43----------
but that's because i'm also a wildlife


---------64:46----------
rehabilitator so


---------64:47----------
we have babies that we have to feed


---------64:48----------
throughout the night and stuff like that


---------64:50----------
and


---------64:50----------
yeah there there are nights where i'm


---------64:52----------
just like i cannot go to sleep that's


---------64:54----------
selfish


---------64:55----------
um but


---------64:58----------
which one is it more i mean i would


---------65:00----------
obviously like to say that it's


---------65:02----------
uh my drive to make the world better but


---------65:04----------
i'm honestly not sure


---------65:05----------
um i don't know which one


---------65:09----------
is more i would say i would say if i had


---------65:12----------
you know this is


---------65:13----------
you have to correct me but and i know


---------65:15----------
you don't know now but i i've seen this


---------65:17----------
a lot where i think toxic productivity


---------65:19----------
comes from like


---------65:19----------
a genuine mission that gets hijacked


---------65:23----------
by like a psychological need so there is


---------65:27----------
like a fear


---------65:28----------
you know and it's not and this is the


---------65:30----------
tricky thing is because i i can see that


---------65:31----------
you're confident in yourself like i can


---------65:33----------
see that you recognize objectively


---------65:35----------
that you have accomplished a lot and


---------65:38----------
that also makes things so much more


---------65:39----------
terrifying because like now you've built


---------65:41----------
up like it's this grand experiment where


---------65:43----------
you've borrowed money and it's happening


---------65:45----------
and it's real and there's stuff on


---------65:46----------
social media so you like can't


---------65:48----------
no take backs now you have ambassadors


---------65:51----------
that are relying on you


---------65:52----------
of people that are relying on you you


---------65:54----------
have you know all kinds of things that


---------65:55----------
are depending on you


---------65:58----------
so onward and upward and no looking back


---------66:02----------
and no slowing down


---------66:05----------
and if all we have to sacrifice is maya


---------66:08----------
so be it yeah i guess


---------66:12----------
so i want you to i think it starts with


---------66:15----------
first of all you you know whether you


---------66:16----------
want to slow down


---------66:19----------
right because i i don't think you do but


---------66:21----------
what i will tell you is that


---------66:24----------
i don't i know this sounds absolutely


---------66:26----------
crazy but i don't think you relaxing


---------66:28----------
will actually decrease your productivity


---------66:29----------
at all


---------66:32----------
well that's good because i don't want it


---------66:34----------
to


---------66:35----------
i know so this is sort of giving in to


---------66:38----------
it


---------66:38----------
but in my work of like so i do a lot of


---------66:41----------
work on optimizing performance


---------66:43----------
so case in point i work with some like


---------66:45----------
esports teams for example


---------66:47----------
and i don't know if you know this but


---------66:48----------
esports teams grind a lot


---------66:51----------
right grind it it took me months


---------66:56----------
to convince i do this with all the


---------66:59----------
esports teams i work with some of them


---------67:00----------
never get it


---------67:01----------
it took me months to explain to them


---------67:04----------
that playing 12 hours a day of pubs


---------67:06----------
does not actually make you better at the


---------67:08----------
game at your skill level


---------67:10----------
and there's this relentless sense that


---------67:12----------
you just have to grind grind


---------67:14----------
grind grime grind and the more you do


---------67:16----------
the better it is


---------67:18----------
right but i i think that


---------67:21----------
i know it sounds weird but i think that


---------67:23----------
like you can accomplish just as much


---------67:25----------
because i just don't think human beings


---------67:27----------
are you know optimally productive once


---------67:29----------
they cross a particular threshold


---------67:31----------
i think that doing things like re


---------67:33----------
relaxing is actually going to like boost


---------67:35----------
your productivity you know there are


---------67:37----------
studies that are done on


---------67:38----------
you know working five days a week versus


---------67:40----------
four days a week and people get the same


---------67:41----------
amount of stuff done


---------67:45----------
what do you think about that


---------67:49----------
i think it makes sense to me


---------67:53----------
but it's also like when i think about my


---------67:55----------
day-to-day and


---------67:56----------
what i want to do to be more productive


---------67:58----------
it's like if i meet this contractor


---------68:00----------
at my property today the floors will get


---------68:02----------
done today that means that the site is


---------68:05----------
more developed like if i call this like


---------68:07----------
you know dumpster roll off we'll get a


---------68:08----------
dumpster today so we can clean more


---------68:10----------
stuff out which makes


---------68:12----------
like which pushes pushes us further


---------68:14----------
along but the more that i do in a day


---------68:16----------
the farther we get you know i'm with you


---------68:19----------
a hundred percent


---------68:20----------
how does your understanding string


---------68:22----------
theory help your emu


---------68:24----------
oh my god it doesn't at all i i don't


---------68:26----------
know why


---------68:28----------
like i also don't know why i thought


---------68:31----------
that i could under i mean obviously i


---------68:32----------
don't understand that you can't


---------68:33----------
understand string theory without like


---------68:35----------
my physics knowledge is horrible um but


---------68:37----------
i was just like


---------68:38----------
i should know at least what this is


---------68:41----------
where does that come from why should you


---------68:44----------
know what that is


---------68:48----------
i don't know i guess i just don't feel


---------68:49----------
like i'm oh i just don't feel like i'm


---------68:51----------
competent enough like i feel like i


---------68:53----------
should know


---------68:53----------
like if someone asks me i'd just be like


---------68:55----------
i don't know and i don't want to feel


---------68:56----------
stupid


---------68:57----------
so i don't want to not know like i just


---------68:59----------
want to know everything


---------69:02----------
which is completely unrealistic but


---------69:05----------
see there you there you go again sharing


---------69:07----------
a feeling and then what do you do


---------69:09----------
uh it's not really qualifying is it um


---------69:12----------
like no it's good close enough


---------69:14----------
qualifying right right like you you


---------69:16----------
you you play you play tennis with


---------69:18----------
yourself you hit the ball across the net


---------69:20----------
and then you run over to the other side


---------69:21----------
and you hit it back


---------69:23----------
yeah yeah so why i think if you want


---------69:26----------
like i know this sounds kind of weird


---------69:27----------
but if you want to like


---------69:28----------
improve in this aspect you got to stop


---------69:30----------
running over to the other side of the


---------69:31----------
net


---------69:33----------
[Music]


---------69:34----------
so


---------69:38----------
i know this sounds kind of weird but do


---------69:40----------
you feel


---------69:42----------
stupid oh all the time yeah but that's


---------69:48----------
not new


---------69:49----------
i just did it again sorry continue


---------69:54----------
can you tell me about that


---------69:57----------
um


---------70:00----------
where when did i start feeling stupid


---------70:02----------
probably in


---------70:03----------
about sixth grade uh when no fourth


---------70:05----------
grade when we started


---------70:08----------
being accepted into advanced math


---------70:09----------
courses that's probably where it started


---------70:12----------
and oh and then in sixth grade i


---------70:14----------
couldn't pass my time stables for [ __ ] i


---------70:15----------
was like damn


---------70:16----------
i'm dumb as hell i probably started


---------70:19----------
there


---------70:20----------
and then uh i don't know same thing


---------70:22----------
through high school


---------70:23----------
just other people achieving more and


---------70:25----------
then


---------70:26----------
now uh just the people that i have on my


---------70:29----------
podcast


---------70:31----------
i have i mean i have the platform you


---------70:33----------
know and i'm


---------70:35----------
pretty good at like being a bridge


---------70:38----------
between


---------70:38----------
science and like the public you know


---------70:41----------
that's why i do the podcast and i have a


---------70:43----------
role there but i also


---------70:44----------
constantly feel like i'm not qualified


---------70:46----------
to be talking to the people that i talk


---------70:47----------
to and they know so much more than me


---------70:49----------
um and i feel dumb a lot of times when


---------70:52----------
i'm talking to them because they'll be


---------70:53----------
talking about something and i'm like i


---------70:54----------
don't know what that is or i don't know


---------70:55----------
what that means


---------70:56----------
and i know it's not my place to be the


---------70:58----------
scientist i'm literally not the


---------70:59----------
scientist on the podcast but


---------71:02----------
yeah okay


---------71:08----------
can i think for a second


---------71:17----------
so what do you do if you feel dumb


---------71:19----------
what's the answer


---------71:24----------
what do you mean like what do i so you


---------71:26----------
feel dumb all the time


---------71:28----------
how do you deal with that learn more


---------71:32----------
how's that working for you i still feel


---------71:35----------
dumb


---------71:36----------
i mean you can't learn everything


---------71:37----------
interesting right


---------71:39----------
yeah listening to the string theory book


---------71:40----------
just made me feel more stupid so


---------71:42----------
but nevermind


---------71:46----------
okay so let me ask you something every


---------71:49----------
time you catch yourself doing the


---------71:51----------
qualifier do you feel stupid there


---------71:54----------
i don't feel stupid i feel annoyed


---------71:58----------
okay that i didn't think about it before


---------72:02----------
i started it yep so that's sort of


---------72:05----------
that's sort of that feels the same okay


---------72:08----------
yeah dumb


---------72:09----------
right i'm not trying to put words into


---------72:11----------
your mouth but you gotta you gotta tell


---------72:13----------
me


---------72:14----------
right so we gotta be careful about that


---------72:15----------
because like inadvertently you're


---------72:17----------
actually pulling me into a situation


---------72:19----------
where i may make you feel stupid


---------72:22----------
oh you're fine i'll tell you


---------72:26----------
okay so let's just pause for a second


---------72:30----------
and think about this so if you feel dumb


---------72:33----------
and you you try to fix that by learning


---------72:35----------
right like when we feel a certain way


---------72:37----------
about ourselves we like


---------72:39----------
make efforts in the real world to change


---------72:42----------
it


---------72:43----------
and how effective is that


---------72:49----------
i i mean it depends i don't know um i'm


---------72:52----------
thinking like if it's like a very


---------72:53----------
specific topic


---------72:54----------
and you think that you're dumb in the


---------72:56----------
topic and then you learn about it then i


---------72:57----------
would feel no longer dumb


---------72:59----------
okay so how long have you felt dumb


---------73:04----------
at least fourth grade okay maybe maybe


---------73:06----------
before how


---------73:07----------
often do you feel dumb


---------73:11----------
um maybe like


---------73:15----------
every other day okay i don't i don't


---------73:18----------
think it's


---------73:18----------
daily but it's it may be okay maybe


---------73:21----------
daily so


---------73:22----------
and how much have you learned between


---------73:23----------
fourth grade and now


---------73:25----------
a lot absolutely so how do you


---------73:28----------
understand that


---------73:28----------
how do you understand the relationship


---------73:30----------
between learning a lot and feeling dumb


---------73:33----------
what can we conclude that learning more


---------73:37----------
doesn't make me feel not


---------73:38----------
dumb because i can't learn everything


---------73:40----------
yeah so then then the


---------73:42----------
tricky issue becomes what do we do with


---------73:44----------
the feeling of dumbness


---------73:49----------
i don't know do you want that to change


---------73:53----------
um wait i have to think about that


---------73:58----------
um do i want that to change


---------74:01----------
i it's my primary motivator to learn


---------74:04----------
i think um so


---------74:08----------
i don't know good answer i wanna


---------74:12----------
if i wanna not feel dumb i mean there's


---------74:14----------
times where i don't like feeling dumb


---------74:17----------
sure i hate feeling dumb on stream but


---------74:21----------
so we get we get to an interesting issue


---------74:23----------
here okay maya so i'm gonna


---------74:25----------
highlight this again i think a lot of


---------74:27----------
like whether you want to change or not a


---------74:29----------
lot of this is not


---------74:30----------
about how you change or failing to


---------74:32----------
change it's about wanting to change


---------74:34----------
because if i could give you a pill that


---------74:36----------
would make you no longer feel dumb would


---------74:38----------
you take it


---------74:40----------
no i think i'd be a dick if i took that


---------74:44----------
i don't want to be like a knower i don't


---------74:46----------
want to be a person that just like


---------74:47----------
thinks that they know everything


---------74:50----------
okay if i could take away the feeling of


---------74:52----------
being dumb


---------74:55----------
uh then yeah now that'd probably be good


---------74:58----------
i think i don't know


---------75:02----------
i don't know i feel like i don't know if


---------75:05----------
i need to feel dumb to


---------75:06----------
have the motivation to learn things


---------75:08----------
there we go right so now we get to


---------75:10----------
another really really important


---------75:12----------
principle


---------75:13----------
which is a lot of the suffering caused


---------75:15----------
by our mind is adaptive and helps us we


---------75:17----------
become dependent on it


---------75:21----------
because look at how far you've come


---------75:23----------
because you felt


---------75:26----------
dumb seriously i'm not kidding that's


---------75:29----------
not a joke


---------75:30----------
yeah i get it right because it's like


---------75:33----------
look at how inadequate you felt in the


---------75:34----------
fourth grade


---------75:36----------
right because it's kind of interesting


---------75:38----------
because you say that i wasn't


---------75:39----------
in any advanced classes like that


---------75:41----------
doesn't mean you're dumb it just means


---------75:43----------
you're normal


---------75:44----------
right right and and


---------75:48----------
even then it's like and so like this has


---------75:50----------
been your driving force to like


---------75:52----------
you know carve out your niche get an a


---------75:54----------
plus in horsemanship


---------75:56----------
when my noob friends are like still in


---------75:57----------
school with their head between books


---------75:59----------
like i'm gonna be out there like


---------76:01----------
saving the world and doing endoscopies


---------76:03----------
on emu's


---------76:04----------
[ __ ] i'm gonna be someone


---------76:08----------
yeah right and you are someone and


---------76:12----------
you've become someone


---------76:14----------
and yet you carry the feeling of dumb


---------76:15----------
with you and i think this is all like


---------76:17----------
feels related to me because it's sort of


---------76:19----------
like


---------76:20----------
i get the sense that if you miss out on


---------76:22----------
on an opportunity you don't have faith


---------76:24----------
in yourself to be able to recover


---------76:26----------
that like this is the chance right and


---------76:29----------
if i miss this opportunity and miss this


---------76:31----------
opportunity like everything is going to


---------76:32----------
come crumbling down like you'll


---------76:33----------
only feel that way if you don't have


---------76:36----------
faith in yourself to adapt to


---------76:38----------
circumstances and find a way forward


---------76:40----------
which i


---------76:40----------
i think you're gonna do fine like i


---------76:42----------
think that everything could come


---------76:43----------
crashing down around you i think you'd


---------76:44----------
be fine


---------76:45----------
it'd be hard psychologically but i think


---------76:47----------
that your actual commitment to your


---------76:49----------
mission


---------76:49----------
will find a way for you to make a


---------76:51----------
difference in the world


---------76:55----------
but i think what this is going to be


---------76:57----------
terrifying


---------76:58----------
but i think you have to be okay with


---------77:01----------
being dumb


---------77:05----------
what do you think about that


---------77:08----------
yeah i mean it's true i uh


---------77:12----------
i have that in i don't know how to make


---------77:15----------
this not a tangent


---------77:16----------
uh make it a tangent tangents are great


---------77:19----------
okay uh so in


---------77:23----------
when you work with animals there's one


---------77:25----------
of the things that i say all the time i


---------77:27----------
use the word nowhere as i feel like


---------77:28----------
there's learners and there's knowers


---------77:30----------
you know and for some reason in the


---------77:32----------
animal industry it's


---------77:34----------
super prominent like who's a knower and


---------77:37----------
who's a learner


---------77:38----------
uh you just get people that have been in


---------77:40----------
it for 20 years 30 years 40 years


---------77:42----------
whatever and then you have these new


---------77:43----------
people or


---------77:44----------
younger people that are just really


---------77:46----------
bright-eyed and really passionate and


---------77:48----------
are just learners and they want to learn


---------77:49----------
everything


---------77:50----------
and they end up getting shut down by the


---------77:51----------
knowers and then those kids burn out


---------77:53----------
i've seen it since i've started working


---------77:56----------
in animals


---------77:57----------
i've seen so many burnouts at every


---------77:59----------
single facility that i've worked at i've


---------78:01----------
seen a burnout


---------78:02----------
um and so when i'm leading people at the


---------78:05----------
rehab center because i'm on the board of


---------78:06----------
directors at the rehab center so i do


---------78:08----------
volunteers and stuff like that and i


---------78:10----------
always tell them like you're don't ever


---------78:12----------
feel dumb you know like it's


---------78:13----------
asking as many questions as you want you


---------78:15----------
know like we're all dumb like we don't


---------78:16----------
know what we're doing we're


---------78:17----------
like i'm still learning all the time i


---------78:19----------
still have to call people all the time


---------78:20----------
and ask questions about these birds


---------78:21----------
because i don't know this and i don't


---------78:22----------
know this


---------78:23----------
like i preach that i'm really annoying


---------78:25----------
about it annoying it's not the right


---------78:27----------
word but i like


---------78:28----------
hammer it in you know it's the same


---------78:30----------
thing at my facility


---------78:31----------
um i i tell people who are who are


---------78:33----------
helping at my facility like you


---------78:35----------
like none of us know what we're doing so


---------78:37----------
like ask as many questions you want


---------78:39----------
um that's why i didn't want to make it


---------78:42----------
to tangent because i forgot what your


---------78:43----------
actual question was


---------78:44----------
i think it was perfect okay so trust in


---------78:47----------
in the connections that your neurons


---------78:49----------
make


---------78:51----------
so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------78:54----------
so there's there's a certain maya who's


---------78:57----------
actually


---------78:58----------
confident in herself and is therefore


---------79:00----------
okay being dumb


---------79:03----------
and then there's another maya who's not


---------79:06----------
okay being dumb


---------79:07----------
because she actually doesn't believe in


---------79:08----------
herself so she has to be smart


---------79:14----------
true


---------79:17----------
yeah and then we kind of come back to


---------79:19----------
like which one do you want to be


---------79:23----------
um the first one okay ideally so


---------79:26----------
this is this is good because i think


---------79:28----------
we've we've this is


---------79:29----------
uh i've asked you a couple of times if


---------79:32----------
you want certain things do you want to


---------79:33----------
be less toxically productive you said no


---------79:36----------
you know do you do you want to be


---------79:40----------
stupid you said yes i want to feel dumb


---------79:43----------
because it's what drives me forward


---------79:45----------
and i think now we've hit a point where


---------79:47----------
like we can get on the same page about


---------79:49----------
like what you


---------79:50----------
want which is to recognize that actually


---------79:52----------
like


---------79:53----------
feeling dumb is completely independent


---------79:55----------
from the acquisition of knowledge


---------79:57----------
and that actually if we really pay


---------80:00----------
attention


---------80:02----------
most of your growth has come out of


---------80:04----------
places where you sort of


---------80:05----------
admit your ignorance as opposed to try


---------80:07----------
to fix it


---------80:08----------
right like there's a difference between


---------80:10----------
learning to not feel dumb


---------80:12----------
and like learning for the sake of like


---------80:14----------
wanting to understand something


---------80:18----------
i think the real challenge maya for you


---------80:20----------
is that you have so many different


---------80:22----------
conflicting things that co-exist that


---------80:24----------
you can be proud of yourself you know


---------80:26----------
you have your niche


---------80:27----------
you know you're good at what you do you


---------80:30----------
know that you're making an impact you


---------80:31----------
know that


---------80:32----------
every time you sort of support a learner


---------80:34----------
in the face of knowers


---------80:36----------
you're actually having a profound


---------80:38----------
downstream effect on conservation


---------80:42----------
right so and this is where i think like


---------80:43----------
frankly you got to let go of all of this


---------80:46----------
like i need to do it now otherwise like


---------80:48----------
you know


---------80:48----------
dogs won't be able to eat dinner tonight


---------80:52----------
because i i think is someone who's just


---------80:54----------
a little bit older and i got to play the


---------80:55----------
i'm older card on you now which is a


---------80:57----------
card that i generally hate playing but


---------80:59----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna play at this once


---------81:00----------
we'll see how you receive it okay if


---------81:02----------
it works but i i think my the amount of


---------81:05----------
impact that you're having


---------81:07----------
it's arrogant for you to think that


---------81:11----------
you know what impact that you're having


---------81:13----------
and that's


---------81:14----------
like cutting back a little bit is gonna


---------81:16----------
have such a profound impact on the world


---------81:18----------
like you just don't know


---------81:20----------
right like you have you have no idea how


---------81:22----------
much these little conversations that you


---------81:24----------
have when you're volunteering with


---------81:25----------
someone who's like excited about


---------81:27----------
conservation like


---------81:29----------
that can have such a huge impact on


---------81:32----------
thousands or tens of thousands or


---------81:34----------
hundreds of thousands of animals lives


---------81:36----------
right so how is the i'm older so i know


---------81:40----------
better card playing with you


---------81:42----------
what do you think about that and i think


---------81:45----------
at the end of the day i mean


---------81:46----------
i i think it's okay to be dumb it's okay


---------81:48----------
to be inexperienced and it's


---------81:50----------
everything's not going to come falling


---------81:52----------
apart around you


---------81:54----------
what do you think about that


---------81:58----------
it makes no sense i think that it is


---------82:01----------
fine for everybody except for me


---------82:04----------
because i like because i'm running my


---------82:06----------
own non-profit so i feel like i need to


---------82:08----------
be the person that knows you know nope


---------82:10----------
um but yes sir so so i think


---------82:14----------
do you think if i made that statement to


---------82:15----------
you before you launched your non-profit


---------82:17----------
you would have said something else


---------82:20----------
before i was started streaming i would


---------82:23----------
have agreed with you i think


---------82:25----------
but since you've started streaming it's


---------82:27----------
you no longer agree


---------82:29----------
so that's interesting right so i think


---------82:30----------
you have to pay attention because your


---------82:32----------
mind will come up with any justification


---------82:34----------
the justification will change


---------82:38----------
and and so that's okay so you know


---------82:41----------
what's it like to be the person who


---------82:44----------
can't slow down


---------82:49----------
i don't know i'm proud of it and it's


---------82:51----------
it's a lot


---------82:52----------
i do feel like there's a lot of things


---------82:54----------
that i'm missing i mean i still hang out


---------82:56----------
with my friends and whatever


---------82:57----------
but i


---------83:02----------
am not i feel like i still could be


---------83:05----------
living like a college kid and just like


---------83:07----------
doing whatever i want and like enjoying


---------83:08----------
my life


---------83:10----------
but i am i am enjoying my life but i'm


---------83:13----------
not


---------83:13----------
chilling you know and i never will be


---------83:15----------
ever again i don't think well it sounds


---------83:16----------
like you can't really afford to live a


---------83:18----------
college life


---------83:19----------
right i mean it sounds like the work


---------83:22----------
that you're doing is more important


---------83:24----------
yeah yeah so that's a


---------83:27----------
i don't know it's a good and a bad thing


---------83:30----------
i mean but net positive right


---------83:33----------
yeah not positive so you


---------83:36----------
what choice do you really have


---------83:40----------
no i mean i'm not going to change it i


---------83:43----------
guess this is like


---------83:44----------
yeah i don't know


---------83:47----------
yeah now i feel like i've just wasted


---------83:51----------
your time


---------83:52----------
because we just came back to i'm not


---------83:54----------
changing anything


---------83:55----------
so what's the point i don't know i


---------83:58----------
yeah i don't know do you think this is a


---------84:01----------
waste of time


---------84:02----------
no i got a lot of good things from it


---------84:04----------
but it's also not like i'm not leaving


---------84:06----------
with like a big like i'm gonna do this


---------84:07----------
this this


---------84:08----------
and make this change and then be better


---------84:10----------
like


---------84:11----------
it's much more abstract than that which


---------84:13----------
is good


---------84:14----------
but i i think that's what you like go


---------84:17----------
for


---------84:19----------
you go for different things i think you


---------84:22----------
probably don't care or not not that you


---------84:23----------
don't care but you're like


---------84:25----------
i don't think that you thought it was a


---------84:26----------
waste of time why don't


---------84:28----------
why wouldn't i why do i why do you think


---------84:31----------
i don't think this is a waste of time


---------84:34----------
well one because you're polite and two


---------84:37----------
um like you wouldn't be like yeah why


---------84:39----------
you just wasted my time


---------84:41----------
um but no we talked about some cool


---------84:43----------
stuff i made some cool connections


---------84:45----------
um in here and


---------84:50----------
i think i felt more i felt bad about the


---------84:53----------
toxic productivity thing


---------84:54----------
more than anything else until now i


---------84:57----------
don't


---------84:59----------
love it but i also realize that it's


---------85:00----------
helped me a lot instead of just being


---------85:02----------
like why am i like this


---------85:04----------
so that's a good thing


---------85:08----------
do you think that i want you to change


---------85:13----------
no


---------85:18----------
i don't know do you


---------85:29----------
let me think about that for a second


---------85:31----------
okay


---------85:33----------
i was trying to help you change


---------85:37----------
um but it took me a little while to


---------85:39----------
realize that you


---------85:40----------
don't want to change


---------85:44----------
and so that's okay


---------85:48----------
i'm not disappointed in that and i think


---------85:50----------
that one of the most important steps


---------85:51----------
that we can take


---------85:53----------
because you came in and you said this


---------85:55----------
thing is bad


---------85:57----------
and now we're saying this thing is good


---------86:00----------
no i still think it's bad


---------86:01----------
but i also think it's good now and


---------86:02----------
before i didn't think it was good at all


---------86:06----------
okay so


---------86:11----------
and that's a win


---------86:14----------
yeah okay so so here's what i'll share


---------86:18----------
with you maya i think that


---------86:19----------
um i know it sounds weird but you came


---------86:21----------
in thinking that toxic productivity is


---------86:23----------
bad and now you think that toxic


---------86:24----------
productivity is good


---------86:26----------
and i think that's a win too okay do you


---------86:30----------
and there's a simple reason for that


---------86:33----------
which is


---------86:34----------
you can come in and say i want to change


---------86:39----------
and then i can try to help you change


---------86:41----------
and what are you going to do


---------86:43----------
when i try to help you change


---------86:48----------
if we were actually like if we were if


---------86:51----------
you were like my therapist or something


---------86:52----------
we're doing this weekly and you're like


---------86:54----------
you got to do like you got to relax you


---------86:55----------
got to i'd just be frustrated


---------86:56----------
yeah i'd be like why are you telling me


---------86:58----------
to not do as many things as i want to do


---------87:01----------
yep right so so this is where like you


---------87:04----------
came here and you said toxic


---------87:05----------
productivity is bad


---------87:07----------
and then for a little while we played


---------87:08----------
the game of okay let's see if we can get


---------87:09----------
you to change and i think we came to a


---------87:11----------
very important revelation


---------87:13----------
because that toxic productivity is bad


---------87:16----------
but it also is good it comes with a


---------87:17----------
price it's double-edged sword


---------87:20----------
you know it's like eating a spicy curry


---------87:23----------
like it's good going down but it ain't


---------87:24----------
gonna be pleasant coming out


---------87:26----------
you know it's like you gotta you gotta


---------87:27----------
pay the price right


---------87:30----------
yeah and um or in the case of the emu


---------87:32----------
like oh that ring looks so shiny it's


---------87:34----------
gonna be so tasty


---------87:36----------
it's gonna help me digest so i i i think


---------87:39----------
oddly enough maya so like the first step


---------87:41----------
is being aware of like


---------87:43----------
what something does for you right


---------87:45----------
because i think if i tried to make you


---------87:46----------
change


---------87:47----------
then you would have just pushed back


---------87:48----------
over and over and over again


---------87:50----------
so i do think it's actually a success


---------87:52----------
and this is for everyone out there who's


---------87:53----------
listening like a lot of times


---------87:55----------
we have a behavior that we think


---------87:58----------
should change and we play the friend


---------88:00----------
game with ourselves


---------88:01----------
right and we're like oh what would i


---------88:03----------
tell my friend and i'd tell them this


---------88:05----------
but if you have a behavior that you


---------88:08----------
would tell a friend something and you


---------88:09----------
don't listen to it at all


---------88:10----------
you don't you know that's the game that


---------88:12----------
you lose all the time


---------88:14----------
that's a sign that you really need to


---------88:16----------
understand like what your motivations


---------88:18----------
are


---------88:19----------
because until you like understand that


---------88:21----------
you actually don't want it to change


---------88:23----------
it's never going to change interestingly


---------88:25----------
enough


---------88:27----------
knowing that you don't want it to change


---------88:29----------
is actually a step forward


---------88:31----------
it's better than pretending you want it


---------88:33----------
to change yeah and not actually want to


---------88:35----------
get to change


---------88:37----------
[Music]


---------88:38----------
and i i know it sounds crazy but i think


---------88:40----------
it's going to be easier for you to relax


---------88:42----------
when you go to the hotel room


---------88:45----------
yeah i think you're right


---------88:49----------
i'm very confused on why but i i do


---------88:51----------
agree with you


---------88:53----------
right so i i think it's so i think just


---------88:57----------
understand that you're not really ready


---------88:59----------
to change your toxic productivity


---------89:02----------
quite yet and that's okay that there's a


---------89:05----------
lot writing on there that you still have


---------89:07----------
a lot to prove


---------89:08----------
so be it you're not quite a hundred


---------89:10----------
percent confident in yourself


---------89:12----------
even though you clearly know that you


---------89:13----------
have a lot to be proud of


---------89:15----------
that while you are undereducated


---------89:17----------
compared to all of these experts these


---------89:19----------
experts are coming onto your podcast


---------89:22----------
and you clearly have something to offer


---------89:23----------
the world and you're really good at


---------89:25----------
organizing and putting all the stuff i


---------89:27----------
think you know all these things about


---------89:28----------
yourself


---------89:29----------
and coexisting with that is this sort of


---------89:32----------
like


---------89:33----------
i'm dumb everything is going to come


---------89:34----------
falling apart i'm going to peak


---------89:35----------
eventually


---------89:36----------
the platform will be destroyed and then


---------89:38----------
i don't know who i'm going to be don't


---------89:39----------
worry dr k i won't kill myself but like


---------89:41----------
i'm going to be in nothing


---------89:42----------
that is holding on to life for an


---------89:44----------
unclear reason


---------89:48----------
and that both of those things can


---------89:49----------
coexist like that's totally cool we'll


---------89:51----------
take both


---------89:52----------
of them what do you think about that


---------89:58----------
yeah i think that makes sense i don't


---------89:59----------
have very much to say about it but i do


---------90:01----------
like i i am understanding what you're


---------90:03----------
saying yeah


---------90:04----------
but if i elaborated i'd just be


---------90:06----------
repeating back what you said so


---------90:08----------
i get the sense that we're wrapping up


---------90:12----------
yeah i don't know i don't have other


---------90:13----------
things to to talk about


---------90:16----------
really um


---------90:22----------
yeah i mean is there something that you


---------90:24----------
want to discuss no no i it's just i


---------90:26----------
i think i think um i sort of signaled


---------90:30----------
i got the sense that we had reached a


---------90:32----------
good stopping point when you said


---------90:34----------
something like this has been a waste of


---------90:35----------
your time


---------90:38----------
honestly i'm also looking at the time


---------90:40----------
because they told me that you have a


---------90:41----------
commitment at


---------90:42----------
for my time so i was also like


---------90:45----------
ah or yeah i mean that's that's my


---------90:48----------
commitment to manage you don't have to


---------90:50----------
worry about it yeah


---------90:52----------
but um you know good luck with your


---------90:55----------
stuff i mean do you want to tell us like


---------90:56----------
is there somewhere that we can


---------90:58----------
go to learn more about your work or


---------90:59----------
anything like that


---------91:01----------
yeah um in my chat you can do command


---------91:03----------
alveos if you want um it's


---------91:05----------
a-l-v-e-u-s sanctuary on all platforms


---------91:09----------
so we do have a twitch channel we


---------91:10----------
haven't done anything on it um but


---------91:11----------
twitter instagram tick-tock


---------91:13----------
how did you come up with the name it's a


---------91:16----------
not a direct translation but it's


---------91:19----------
reservoir in latin


---------91:20----------
and my thing on my podcast is always


---------91:22----------
saying that switches on tapped reservoir


---------91:24----------
for doing good so that's cool


---------91:27----------
yeah well thank you very much for coming


---------91:29----------
on do you have any questions for me i


---------91:31----------
don't mean to boot you or anything but


---------91:34----------
i sort of feel like we're at a good


---------91:35----------
stopping point and we've learned


---------91:36----------
something today and that it may be a


---------91:38----------
little bit easier for you to relax


---------91:41----------
yeah um i don't think so i don't think i


---------91:45----------
have any questions


---------91:49----------
i do i do feel bad i feel like i i feel


---------91:51----------
like i was like


---------91:52----------
i just like walled you like i feel like


---------91:54----------
you're trying to help and i was just


---------91:56----------
like


---------91:57----------
i got it like i'm good i'm just gonna


---------91:59----------
keep doing what i'm doing but i don't


---------92:00----------
know i need to think about it more


---------92:02----------
offstream probably i i think it's okay


---------92:06----------
to do that


---------92:07----------
okay i'm not do you get the sense that


---------92:10----------
i'm disappointed or frustrated with you


---------92:13----------
no okay yeah i i i think you actually


---------92:17----------
did a good job of pointing out sometimes


---------92:19----------
people like oh my god dr k


---------92:21----------
i'm gonna change everything about my


---------92:22----------
life and fix me right


---------92:24----------
no that's not actually how change


---------92:26----------
happens and i think sometimes we


---------92:28----------
actually do a disservice because that's


---------92:30----------
what we


---------92:31----------
make it seem like change is like i think


---------92:33----------
you actually


---------92:34----------
illustrated how change really is


---------92:38----------
way more than some of our more like


---------92:42----------
histrionic streams right because there's


---------92:44----------
a lot of resistance it's a slow process


---------92:47----------
that like you come in pretending that


---------92:48----------
you want to change and you actually


---------92:50----------
don't


---------92:51----------
and part of that i think the reason that


---------92:52----------
you're more willing to


---------92:54----------
give up toxic productivity now is like


---------92:56----------
it's easy it's


---------92:57----------
it's hard to give up that which you


---------92:59----------
don't know has value


---------93:01----------
because what you really have to do maya


---------93:03----------
is sacrifice


---------93:04----------
your productivity you have to give


---------93:06----------
something up to relax


---------93:09----------
and i don't think you're ready to make


---------93:10----------
that sacrifice yet


---------93:12----------
no which is fine


---------93:16----------
okay sweet good luck and make the world


---------93:19----------
a better place


---------93:20----------
all right thank you so much i appreciate


---------93:22----------
it you're welcome bye all right i'll


---------93:24----------
talk to you


---------93:27----------
okay


---------93:30----------
sneaky sneaky
