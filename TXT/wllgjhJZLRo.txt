---------00:00----------
but I think the basic problem is that


---------00:02----------
you have a lack of experience in life


---------00:04----------
like just experiencing different things


---------00:05----------
and what you need to do is just go out


---------00:08----------
and do something like go do different


---------00:10----------
things they don't have to be good they


---------00:11----------
don't have to be bad but as you start to


---------00:14----------
do different things you are going to


---------00:15----------
develop a different sense of self from


---------00:18----------
the one that you have now and as you


---------00:21----------
change your sense of self your ability


---------00:23----------
to move in the world is going to change


---------00:34----------
so tell me a little bit what are we


---------00:36----------
calling you Andrew uh entry sign okay so


---------00:39----------
Andrew tell me a little bit about what's


---------00:41----------
going on and how we can help okay


---------00:49----------
so sorry I'm like really nervous right


---------00:54----------
now it's like a really fantastic yeah


---------00:56----------
yeah antastic


---------00:57----------
let's start there okay yeah let's start


---------00:59----------
there okay so what are you feeling when


---------01:01----------
you feel nervous uh my heart's beating


---------01:05----------
really fast I kind of excited okay I'm


---------01:10----------
shaking okay yeah


---------01:12----------
so let's let's just think about that so


---------01:14----------
the way that you're feeling right now


---------01:16----------
how does that affect your actions like


---------01:20----------
what is it making you want to do it's


---------01:23----------
making me not want to open it absolutely


---------01:27----------
right and I don't know if you were


---------01:29----------
planning on opening up or whatever but


---------01:31----------
so let's just notice that right so what


---------01:33----------
do you feel like doing


---------01:36----------
uh I mean just talking like there are


---------01:38----------
definitely things that I want to open up


---------01:40----------
and I want to talk about things but it's


---------01:41----------
just kind of it's like stick it stop


---------01:44----------
beautiful okay beautiful so stock is a


---------01:46----------
fantastic place to start I mean it's it


---------01:49----------
I'm just noticing I do this thing where


---------01:51----------
I you know I say it's been - I'm glad


---------01:53----------
that you're noticing where you are


---------01:54----------
because that's where we have to start so


---------01:56----------
the progress like the the path to moving


---------01:59----------
forward starts where you are and if you


---------02:03----------
if there's a part of you that doesn't


---------02:04----------
want to move forward like that's really


---------02:07----------
important to acknowledge because until


---------02:09----------
we recognize that like we can't move


---------02:11----------
forward if we just ignore it which is


---------02:13----------
what we do a lot of the times right


---------02:14----------
we're like I should move forward so let


---------02:17----------
me just like ignore this part of myself


---------02:19----------
and let me move forward but that's not


---------02:20----------
how it works so great so now we've got a


---------02:22----------
couple of options Andrew so you don't


---------02:25----------
feel like opening up right I I do but


---------02:29----------
it's hard I think I could like like just


---------02:31----------
power through it yes what I usually end


---------02:33----------
up doing that kind of stuff yeah so I'm


---------02:35----------
gonna give you an option okay I'm gonna


---------02:37----------
give you options one is we can try


---------02:39----------
meditating actually right now and see


---------02:42----------
what happens to those feelings of not


---------02:43----------
wanting to open up see what happens to


---------02:45----------
the feelings of nervousness


---------02:47----------
or I can talk to you in a way that


---------02:50----------
facilitates you opening up and kind of


---------02:51----------
easy into it uh let's do number two just


---------02:54----------
keep it moving okay so tell me a little


---------02:57----------
bit about what's going on and what


---------02:59----------
brings you on stream well I think the


---------03:04----------
first time I saw you was a clip on the


---------03:06----------
live stream fails subreddit and it was


---------03:08----------
it was really funny so I I just wanted


---------03:10----------
to check it out and I just ended up


---------03:12----------
really like liking the content and I


---------03:13----------
went on YouTube and watched all the


---------03:15----------
videos have been here maybe like since


---------03:17----------
from up announcer yeah


---------03:20----------
so what resonated with you about our


---------03:23----------
content um I mean just like a lot of


---------03:27----------
people who came on like I feel like I


---------03:29----------
could relate to a lot of their problems


---------03:30----------
so like what um I mean I think it


---------03:37----------
started off with like with like the game


---------03:39----------
addiction but just I mean just like life


---------03:41----------
things in general


---------03:42----------
it's kind of hard for me to I think of


---------03:44----------
like exactly like he's out sir so yeah


---------03:47----------
what is it that you'd like to talk about


---------03:49----------
today hmm maybe just how to move forward


---------03:57----------
in life great fantastic so I want to


---------04:02----------
just point something out to you do you


---------04:05----------
want to move forward in this


---------04:06----------
conversation absolutely and yet you


---------04:11----------
don't there's there's there's two parts


---------04:14----------
of me there's one part that that


---------04:15----------
absolutely wants to and I know that it


---------04:17----------
needs to be done but there's another


---------04:18----------
part that's like very hesitant to


---------04:19----------
fantastic so I think you are doing


---------04:22----------
something that's actually really cool


---------04:23----------
and gets me like psychologically excited


---------04:25----------
which is that like your problem in life


---------04:29----------
is that you're stuck and you're actually


---------04:30----------
facing a microcosm of that problem with


---------04:33----------
this conversation I can kind of see that


---------04:35----------
yeah that's funny like you see that yeah


---------04:38----------
like you you know you need to but you


---------04:42----------
don't feel like it does that mean tribe


---------04:47----------
maybe I feel like it but maybe I'm


---------04:49----------
scared absolutely so what are you scared


---------04:54----------
of in life


---------04:55----------
uh maybe like moving out of my comfort


---------05:01----------
zone


---------05:02----------
okay stepping up okay so what is


---------05:08----------
stepping up look like to you


---------05:10----------
that's a great question I I don't think


---------05:18----------
I know the answer that I think I feel


---------05:20----------
like there's things that I need to do


---------05:21----------
but I don't really know like what the


---------05:22----------
right thing to do is yeah so let's just


---------05:28----------
think about that for a second right okay


---------05:31----------
if I go to a restaurant and someone asks


---------05:35----------
me what would you like to order and I


---------05:39----------
say I don't know what am I gonna get


---------05:45----------
you're gonna get stares and they're


---------05:47----------
gonna wait for you to pick something out


---------05:49----------
yeah but like you don't know what you


---------05:53----------
want right right so you don't know what


---------05:56----------
progress even looks like maybe I have


---------06:00----------
like an idea of what progress could look


---------06:02----------
like and maybe I've tried some things


---------06:03----------
but sure yeah okay well I started to


---------06:12----------
recently go to the grocery store and


---------06:14----------
like buy fruits like ever were you


---------06:15----------
mentioning like pineapple is good and


---------06:17----------
you know that isn't stuff like that so


---------06:19----------
yeah just trying to eat a little better


---------06:22----------
and where you drink more water to do


---------06:24----------
that yeah I think I've been doing it for


---------06:27----------
a couple weeks now just buying buying


---------06:28----------
fruits at least you can start eating so


---------06:31----------
buying a fruit is like actually not like


---------06:33----------
eating the fruit is what we're going for


---------06:35----------
yeah it's it's it's definitely like a


---------06:37----------
multi-step process like leaving the


---------06:39----------
house going to the grocery store and


---------06:40----------
taking the fruit home and then eating it


---------06:43----------
you know it's yeah how do you feel about


---------06:45----------
that uh I feel good but maybe I feel


---------06:48----------
like I could do more


---------06:49----------
absolutely yeah so I'm gonna say I'm


---------06:54----------
gonna tell you what's on the other side


---------06:55----------
of


---------06:58----------
I could do more so there's another side


---------07:01----------
of that coin and I could do more is


---------07:03----------
maybe like a little bit optimistic can


---------07:05----------
you imagine what the pessimistic side of


---------07:07----------
that coin is um maybe like what I'm


---------07:14----------
doing doesn't matter absolutely right so


---------07:18----------
it I could do more the flip side of the


---------07:21----------
coin is I'm not doing enough okay yeah


---------07:24----------
is that how you feel sometimes yeah


---------07:27----------
actually no I think yeah for sure yeah


---------07:29----------
yeah I think so too yeah okay so you're


---------07:33----------
not like you're not cutting it right


---------07:34----------
like you should be cutting it you're not


---------07:35----------
cutting it you're just not yeah you're


---------07:37----------
not making it yeah yeah like Oh like


---------07:39----------
these are like baby steps like I should


---------07:40----------
be taking like big boy steps yeah so


---------07:43----------
yeah what I'm getting from you is that


---------07:45----------
the amount of progress or change that


---------07:47----------
you need to make in life is far greater


---------07:50----------
than what you're doing yes so it feels


---------07:54----------
like the progress that you're making on


---------07:56----------
the one hand seems like kind of cool and


---------07:58----------
on the other hand seems woefully


---------07:59----------
insufficient yes how long have you been


---------08:04----------
feeling that way mmm


---------08:11----------
feeling like just insufficient mm-hmm


---------08:16----------
like you should be doing more I think it


---------08:21----------
might have started after graduating


---------08:25----------
college but maybe even before that okay


---------08:27----------
but it didn't really start to sink in


---------08:30----------
until like much later yeah so that's


---------08:33----------
great I mean that it's not great I think


---------08:37----------
it's good that you noticed that this


---------08:39----------
feeling started in college which is very


---------08:42----------
common let me put it that way


---------08:44----------
mm-hmm so I Andrew like do you know what


---------08:47----------
what the age group what the most common


---------08:51----------
age group is of people who reach out to


---------08:53----------
me probably people around age like in


---------08:57----------
their mid-20s I would imagine yeah so


---------09:00----------
like the earliest is like 2021 why don't


---------09:03----------
you 16 or 17 year olds reach out to me


---------09:05----------
very much what do you think they don't


---------09:07----------
think about those kinds of things


---------09:07----------
they're still they're still young like


---------09:09----------
they're in school and they kind of have


---------09:11----------
like a path


---------09:12----------
and they can kind of like to have things


---------09:13----------
to do yeah so what starts to happen


---------09:15----------
around 20 or 21 did you start to think


---------09:18----------
about the future


---------09:19----------
oh sorry what are you saying yeah yeah


---------09:20----------
yeah right good yep and and so I'll tell


---------09:24----------
you like what I think it is is that when


---------09:26----------
you're 20 you're on the same path as


---------09:28----------
everyone else in college you may have


---------09:31----------
great upset or batter or grades that are


---------09:32----------
worse but when you're 21 like


---------09:34----------
something's there's like this little


---------09:36----------
like like the hair on your neck starts


---------09:38----------
to back up there's this little tickle of


---------09:39----------
doubt that starts because even though


---------09:41----------
you may be going to class like you're


---------09:42----------
not getting internships right yes you're


---------09:45----------
not doing like the extra stuff that


---------09:47----------
people are doing that you should be


---------09:49----------
doing yes yeah it kind of describes me


---------09:52----------
in school yeah yeah right and that


---------09:54----------
starts to scare you a little bit because


---------09:56----------
you're like oh like maybe I should be


---------09:57----------
doing more


---------09:58----------
but like I'm kind of going to class and


---------10:02----------
I'm gonna graduate but like these other


---------10:03----------
people are doing this additional stop so


---------10:05----------
you start to worry and then as you start


---------10:08----------
to get older so that's the first time


---------10:10----------
that you start to see that there's a


---------10:11----------
divergence between you and other people


---------10:13----------
yes and as you get older like what


---------10:16----------
happens


---------10:17----------
it's the gap gets bigger if there's a


---------10:19----------
there's a big difference and how is how


---------10:22----------
old are you now Andrew I am going to be


---------10:25----------
26 and about two months and how big is


---------10:29----------
the gap now injured it's pretty big so


---------10:32----------
why are you coming on stream today


---------10:34----------
Andrew um well that's very clever I like


---------10:39----------
how we're opening up here just to get


---------10:47----------
figure out what to do next you know like


---------10:49----------
I knew yeah I feel like I need help yeah


---------10:51----------
yeah but I mean can you be more specific


---------10:53----------
I guess like I feel like you're trying


---------10:54----------
to go somewhere yeah I am trying to go


---------10:56----------
somewhere twitch at is where I'm going


---------10:57----------
so yeah that's good so yeah when I was


---------11:00----------
the answer that I'm looking for is like


---------11:01----------
you're here to close that gap yeah right


---------11:06----------
like if it's if that's not it then let


---------11:08----------
me know like we sometimes make


---------11:10----------
hypotheses right we arrive at


---------11:12----------
conclusions you gotta let me know like


---------11:13----------
is that what you're here for is to close


---------11:14----------
the Hat um I feel like we can roll with


---------11:18----------
that yeah I'm like I feel like there's


---------11:20----------
lots of things that I'd like to fix but


---------11:21----------
we can start there yeah


---------11:22----------
let's turn okay let's talk about the


---------11:23----------
other ones sure


---------11:26----------
what else do you want to fix um I don't


---------11:32----------
know I think that's it like it just


---------11:33----------
boils down to like I don't feeling like


---------11:34----------
I'm like on track all night like I feel


---------11:37----------
like I'm uptight wait so is that what it


---------11:40----------
does boil down to or it doesn't because


---------11:43----------
if I mind our being off track and


---------11:45----------
getting on track is the same as closing


---------11:47----------
the gap yeah yeah it is yeah but yeah


---------11:50----------
yeah but then you're saying there's


---------11:52----------
other stuff I think the other stuff


---------11:56----------
boils down to that if that makes sense


---------11:58----------
okay sure so it all gets to down to that


---------12:01----------
it all comes down to that I think I'd


---------12:03----------
like to think that yeah so I think that


---------12:06----------
there's more so I think as good as


---------12:09----------
twitch Etta's and as good as we are I


---------12:11----------
think that there's a part of you that's


---------12:13----------
actually going towards that answer out


---------12:15----------
of safety okay is there something that


---------12:21----------
you're like kind of concerned about like


---------12:23----------
emotionally is there something that


---------12:24----------
gives you a lot of anxiety or concern


---------12:26----------
that you don't feel comfortable talking


---------12:28----------
about on stream um maybe some things but


---------12:34----------
they're not I don't think they're that


---------12:37----------
related I'm not sure yeah so Tom can you


---------12:40----------
tell me a little bit about those sounds


---------12:47----------
like the answer's no not right now


---------12:49----------
I feel like we can get there I feel like


---------12:51----------
we can get there yeah okay okay okay so


---------12:55----------
good so Andrew yes we can talk about


---------12:59----------
closing the gap but I don't think that's


---------13:03----------
gonna be what you need okay so I think


---------13:09----------
that that like we've got to explore this


---------13:11----------
out like with the other thing like I


---------13:13----------
don't know what it is I don't know


---------13:15----------
there's other things I guess but yeah


---------13:17----------
okay yeah because I don't know because I


---------13:20----------
I think you're right it all kind of


---------13:21----------
boils down to closing the gap but like


---------13:23----------
let me explain this to you so to get on


---------13:24----------
track in life you have to deal with all


---------13:26----------
the things that you don't want to talk


---------13:28----------
about yes agreed yeah so like let's talk


---------13:31----------
about one of those specifically instead


---------13:33----------
of this abstract concept so this is also


---------13:35----------
something to understand when we're


---------13:37----------
dealing with abstract concepts


---------13:39----------
what does that do to us like what does


---------13:41----------
that do to our mind okay yeah okay no I


---------13:44----------
I think I just had trouble like thinking


---------13:46----------
of like things so I went to school I'll


---------13:51----------
see this as Gracie I like that we


---------13:52----------
transition right I went to school and


---------13:55----------
ready to write out it when I graduate as


---------13:57----------
2012 sub up for three years and I


---------13:59----------
graduated with a degree in game design


---------14:03----------
and I came out the back end of it


---------14:04----------
thinking like oh [ __ ] like actually


---------14:06----------
don't know how to do any of this stuff


---------14:08----------
and I just for a year like I didn't do


---------14:10----------
anything I didn't work I just stayed at


---------14:12----------
home and played games all day and then


---------14:14----------
did you have fun I think um it's fun for


---------14:19----------
a little bit and I think it's fun when


---------14:20----------
you're playing it but like thinking


---------14:22----------
about it like I don't know if I


---------14:26----------
necessarily regret doing it okay yeah


---------14:31----------
but I ended up just taking up a retail


---------14:35----------
job and that's what I still do and I've


---------14:36----------
been doing that for the last three years


---------14:37----------
so I feel like you know like I went to


---------14:40----------
school and it's like I had this big


---------14:42----------
vision and this is the thing that I


---------14:43----------
wanted to do for the rest of my life and


---------14:44----------
then I finish it it's like wait I


---------14:46----------
actually don't know if I want to do it


---------14:48----------
or if I'm cut out for it or if I even


---------14:49----------
like to do it so yeah okay yeah you're


---------14:54----------
very good


---------14:55----------
I like this that was good well what


---------14:58----------
what's how we got there that we got


---------15:00----------
there


---------15:01----------
it came what's there how about me person


---------15:03----------
where we are where we're uh we're


---------15:06----------
dealing with the issues directly no I


---------15:07----------
said what's the issue requested the


---------15:09----------
issue is I don't have a sense of purpose


---------15:15----------
I guess like career-wise


---------15:17----------
yeah I think there's more to it than


---------15:20----------
that


---------15:20----------
I think that's that's your abstract


---------15:21----------
that's a saw I think here's the


---------15:23----------
operative words right so I don't know if


---------15:25----------
I want to do it I don't know if I'm cut


---------15:29----------
out to do it I don't know if I'm able to


---------15:31----------
do it yeah so I think that there's sure


---------15:36----------
like sense of purpose is once again an


---------15:38----------
abstract but I noticed something about


---------15:41----------
you Andrew which is that you go to


---------15:42----------
abstract concepts for like a feeling of


---------15:46----------
safety okay I can see that right so


---------15:51----------
this is sort of like and it's very


---------15:53----------
Commons because if we can make something


---------15:55----------
intellectual like if we start using our


---------15:57----------
intellectual or analytical mind what


---------16:00----------
part of our mind do we get to ignore the


---------16:02----------
feeling part absolutely


---------16:05----------
right so so I thought I didn't realize


---------16:08----------
you made some kind of breakthrough but


---------16:09----------
it seems like you made some kind of


---------16:11----------
breakthrough and I think I did yeah but


---------16:15----------
I think which what should what what I


---------16:17----------
when you said that I think the main


---------16:19----------
thing is you got in touch with like


---------16:21----------
somewhat like you put words to your


---------16:23----------
actual fears and what I'm hearing from


---------16:26----------
you is that you're conflating or


---------16:29----------
combining a sense of purpose with a


---------16:33----------
sense of capability


---------16:34----------
you're like mixing the two in your mind


---------16:36----------
right you're saying there's a difference


---------16:40----------
between I don't want to do this and I


---------16:42----------
don't think I can do it and I think your


---------16:45----------
real problem is that since you're not


---------16:48----------
sure you can do it you're not willing to


---------16:51----------
let yourself want to do it


---------16:55----------
mmm okay right so I'll give you guys


---------16:59----------
like just think like I think that was a


---------17:02----------
little bit confusing the way I said it


---------17:03----------
what did you understand


---------17:04----------
um well I only want to do it if I'm good


---------17:09----------
at it if I'm gonna be good absolutely


---------17:11----------
yeah absolutely right


---------17:13----------
yeah and what does that mean for you


---------17:15----------
like like just think about that as a


---------17:17----------
strategy it's not a very good one


---------17:20----------
because why not you don't do like you're


---------17:22----------
only good at the things that you know


---------17:24----------
how to do and if you don't try to do


---------17:25----------
things you don't know how to do you're


---------17:26----------
never gonna like you just you're not


---------17:28----------
good at things that you that you just


---------17:29----------
starting at it absolutely


---------17:31----------
so Andrew what's your [ __ ] problem


---------17:33----------
man I you're there you're gonna it's


---------17:38----------
gonna be that I need to try and do it


---------17:40----------
right I need to go and do something just


---------17:43----------
try it just do it


---------17:45----------
yeah sort of right so so like that's the


---------17:48----------
problem right so the problem is that you


---------17:51----------
lack confidence in yourself so you want


---------17:55----------
to do the thing that you know you can do


---------17:57----------
because like you don't have faith in


---------17:59----------
yourself that you'll be able to handle


---------18:00----------
it so you don't want to like go out so


---------18:04----------
like if I go hiking in the wilderness if


---------18:07----------
I have faith that I know how to find


---------18:09----------
food and water and navigate and build


---------18:11----------
shelter


---------18:11----------
I don't need certainty about what I'm


---------18:15----------
gonna encounter does that make sense


---------18:16----------
like I have faith in my skills to


---------18:19----------
survive what I'm hearing from you is


---------18:21----------
that you don't have faith in your skills


---------18:22----------
to survive so you're not willing to try


---------18:24----------
and then the most devastating thing that


---------18:27----------
you do to yourself is since you're if


---------18:30----------
you're afraid that you're not good it's


---------18:32----------
something you don't let yourself even


---------18:33----------
want and that's where the lack of


---------18:35----------
purpose comes from because you don't


---------18:37----------
even know what you want like I asked you


---------18:38----------
like what is like a good life look like


---------18:40----------
and you're like I don't know I think you


---------18:43----------
do know what you want I just don't think


---------18:45----------
you let yourself want what you want okay


---------18:48----------
you don't like myself okay so I think


---------18:54----------
for me like my experience was that I


---------18:57----------
went to school for three years for like


---------18:58----------
game design and then I came out the back


---------19:00----------
end and it's like I don't know how to do


---------19:03----------
anything and it's like okay well I kind


---------19:05----------
of tried in school and like maybe that


---------19:07----------
was proof to me like oh like


---------19:08----------
actually don't know how to do anything


---------19:11----------
or if I do if I don't I don't like it


---------19:12----------
cuz I did try right I tried for three


---------19:14----------
years but maybe I just didn't like I


---------19:15----------
didn't give it my full effort you look


---------19:20----------
if you give it your full effort I don't


---------19:22----------
think I did but I can't I can't I don't


---------19:26----------
know if I can say for sure like if I


---------19:28----------
feel like I did or not I feel like there


---------19:29----------
are times in school where I did and


---------19:31----------
times in school I did it but even when I


---------19:34----------
did even when I did I don't think I


---------19:35----------
necessarily enjoyed it like it wasn't


---------19:37----------
what I thought it was going to be okay


---------19:42----------
yeah period um I'm just gonna think for


---------19:46----------
a second is that okay yeah I'll just


---------19:57----------
think out loud for a second I'm trying


---------19:59----------
to get a sense of like we were talking


---------20:00----------
about something that wasn't game design


---------20:02----------
like I'm trying to move you away from


---------20:03----------
thinking about game design and you keep


---------20:05----------
coming to game design you keep coming to


---------20:08----------
college and so I'm trying to figure out


---------20:11----------
like what the significance of your


---------20:13----------
desire to talk about the way that you


---------20:15----------
feel around colleges I I think that


---------20:19----------
growing up as a kid like I always had


---------20:22----------
video games and that's what I grew up


---------20:24----------
thinking like all I wanted to do


---------20:25----------
something like game related like I do


---------20:26----------
something you know it's playing games or


---------20:28----------
making games or whatever and then I


---------20:29----------
actually went to school for it like like


---------20:32----------
my whole life like I'm climbing like the


---------20:33----------
mountain that's like like video games


---------20:35----------
like I'm gonna base my whole life around


---------20:36----------
this and then I get to the top and what


---------20:39----------
I get my kicked off like didn't blanking


---------20:41----------
like when with us is like he's coming up


---------20:44----------
in scar like kicks him off the mountain


---------20:46----------
yeah it's like that like I die does that


---------20:49----------
feel feels like I died like my like like


---------20:56----------
the Rudd guts whipped up from under me


---------20:57----------
like I got kicked like you watch I've


---------21:00----------
been watching people play jump King it


---------21:01----------
feels like that like you get to the top


---------21:02----------
and you fall off off the side of the map


---------21:04----------
and you you just hit the bottom okay


---------21:07----------
yeah that's some pretty powerful imagery


---------21:11----------
yeah do you feel like someone did that


---------21:15----------
to you


---------21:19----------
like myself I don't know I'm asking so I


---------21:24----------
came in the image it's all it's not like


---------21:25----------
Mufasa tripped and fell right it's like


---------21:28----------
he climbs to the top of the mountain and


---------21:30----------
then scar like sinks his claws into


---------21:33----------
mufasa's like hands and then flings him


---------21:37----------
off were you to flog off or did you just


---------21:40----------
slip I don't know


---------21:52----------
maybe a part of me wants to say that


---------21:53----------
like I set myself up for that like


---------21:57----------
there's a part of me that like wanted to


---------21:59----------
do it and then there was another part of


---------22:01----------
me that was like maybe you should try to


---------22:02----------
do something else instead because I


---------22:03----------
wasn't fully enjoying it


---------22:06----------
did someone [ __ ] you over me I guess


---------22:11----------
okay yes some something else that gets


---------22:15----------
me psychologically excited right because


---------22:16----------
like you are the scar and you are the


---------22:19----------
Mufasa yep yep I mean is that how you


---------22:26----------
feel like you feel like you did this to


---------22:27----------
yourself like I let myself down like I


---------22:32----------
kicked myself off is that how you feel


---------22:35----------
yeah kind of a little bit what's that


---------22:41----------
like it's almost kind of relieving in a


---------22:52----------
weird way how so like like it's within


---------22:58----------
my it's within my power to like to like


---------23:00----------
take action until I kind of do something


---------23:02----------
about it how do you feel about that


---------23:10----------
I think risk I think I'm still back to


---------23:13----------
not knowing if it's the thing that I


---------23:17----------
really wanted to do or if I should just


---------23:19----------
try to do something else yeah I'm gonna


---------23:30----------
think it for another second


---------23:31----------
yeah so Andrew I'm a little bit


---------23:35----------
surprised because you're making


---------23:38----------
revelations that I'm not I mean it's


---------23:41----------
clear because I was surprised when you


---------23:42----------
said it it's helpful or it feels good to


---------23:45----------
recognize that which I believe that's


---------23:50----------
just not the answer that I was expecting


---------23:51----------
so I'm trying to recalibrate a little


---------23:54----------
bit and try to understand your


---------23:56----------
perspective and on the flip side there's


---------23:58----------
a part of me that's like I don't have to


---------24:00----------
understand it seems to be helping the


---------24:02----------
guy so let's just tell you me anywhere


---------24:06----------
actionable it's like okay like these are


---------24:08----------
kinds of things like I feel like I've


---------24:10----------
had this conversation with myself that


---------24:11----------
maybe like not out loud with another


---------24:13----------
person okay yeah


---------24:17----------
what are what do you tell yourself what


---------24:19----------
are the conversations that what do you


---------24:21----------
tell yourself when you talk to yourself


---------24:22----------
hey well you know I tried I tried to


---------24:25----------
kind of succeed in school with the thing


---------24:26----------
that I really wanted to do and it didn't


---------24:27----------
really work out so maybe we can try to


---------24:29----------
do something else and I might end up


---------24:31----------
liking that more or that might be like a


---------24:33----------
different path that I could take in life


---------24:35----------
okay yeah and how do you feel about it's


---------24:39----------
not working out


---------24:43----------
it sucks mm-hmm like I mean like I was


---------24:49----------
saying like it's it's the thing that I


---------24:51----------
kind of imagined myself doing like


---------24:53----------
that's pretty much like the one thing


---------24:55----------
that I always kind of had going for me


---------24:57----------
or that I thought that I had going for


---------24:58----------
me and it's like well now I have to kind


---------25:00----------
of like just like look for something


---------25:03----------
else yeah so now now I think I mean it


---------25:06----------
sounds like you've gotten somewhere


---------25:07----------
which is great but no I feel like I'm


---------25:09----------
understanding you a little bit better so


---------25:11----------
thank you so much for you know answering


---------25:13----------
my questions so I think I want everyone


---------25:17----------
who's listening and for you to just


---------25:18----------
think about this Andrew so like you've


---------25:19----------
put all of your eggs in one basket


---------25:22----------
yes right and then like what happened to


---------25:25----------
your basket Hey someone took my basket


---------25:28----------
or the eggs went bad


---------25:30----------
yes see once again there's like there's


---------25:32----------
like a villain somewhere in your


---------25:34----------
subconscious mind


---------25:35----------
yeah it's not I lost the basket drop the


---------25:38----------
basket the eggs broke look they're all


---------25:39----------
kinds of weird [ __ ] you can say which is


---------25:41----------
what I was expecting


---------25:42----------
you said someone took the basket and


---------25:45----------
this is like consistent with the Mufasa


---------25:46----------
imagery and scar so like who took the


---------25:51----------
basket and I don't think it's yourself


---------25:57----------
like did someone take your [ __ ]


---------25:59----------
basket it's gonna be my parents isn't it


---------26:02----------
that's that's where this is going no I


---------26:05----------
don't know I think it might I don't know


---------26:07----------
anything about your parents like you're


---------26:10----------
the one your subconscious mind is


---------26:12----------
producing all of these like faint like


---------26:15----------
because you can say I mean I give you


---------26:16----------
such a broad analogy of eggs in a basket


---------26:19----------
yep and and like I thought like in my


---------26:23----------
mind the analogy is that the eggs are


---------26:25----------
fragile so they break easily so if you


---------26:27----------
drop it all the eggs break like that's


---------26:29----------
what's in my mind like I don't know I've


---------26:30----------
never even thought about it okay it's


---------26:32----------
consciously me maybe maybe like like


---------26:36----------
like who took it away from you Andrew so


---------26:39----------
I don't think that stolen I think just


---------26:42----------
the okay eggs my bed the eggs aren't bad


---------26:44----------
I like that better because it's like I


---------26:46----------
kind of I kind of like skated by like in


---------26:51----------
school but in life too I feel like just


---------26:53----------
just enough to get by and like I had the


---------26:55----------
eggs all along like I was able to keep


---------26:56----------
them safe but I guess they were able to


---------26:58----------
do anything with it


---------27:01----------
well I guess don't have the eggs they're


---------27:03----------
just really there there they went


---------27:04----------
they're spoiled okay yeah all right so


---------27:08----------
like let's just be transparent for a


---------27:10----------
second if you I don't want you to try to


---------27:13----------
change what you say but can we just


---------27:15----------
acknowledge that if there's some other


---------27:17----------
like open-ended weird Rorschach kind of


---------27:20----------
like statement that I make and if


---------27:22----------
someone does something bad to you then


---------27:24----------
we've got to talk about that like I can


---------27:28----------
let two out of three fine like the


---------27:29----------
imagery of Mufasa and like it's not like


---------27:31----------
you fell off the mountain the eggs went


---------27:33----------
bad like fine but if we hear it again


---------27:35----------
we're gonna think about that a little


---------27:38----------
bit more okay okay so okay I mean so I


---------27:42----------
think that let's just go back to the


---------27:44----------
eggs in in the basket and so so you have


---------27:48----------
you know you've put your entire life


---------27:50----------
into video game design like with how how


---------27:52----------
early on did you decide you wanted to


---------27:54----------
make video games I don't know if I


---------27:56----------
necessarily wanted to make video games I


---------27:58----------
just knew that I wanted to be involved


---------27:59----------
but I just making games is kind of like


---------28:01----------
the most like involved involved in what


---------28:03----------
I could think just like you know I like


---------28:06----------
go to work and do video game stuff and I


---------28:08----------
come home and I play video games so okay


---------28:11----------
it's like I went to school for video


---------28:14----------
game design and then somewhere along the


---------28:16----------
way you you what why did you think that


---------28:18----------
you weren't so like as you were in


---------28:21----------
school for video game design did you


---------28:23----------
like what you were learning kind of well


---------28:27----------
that's the problem I think part of it I


---------28:28----------
can't necessarily put the whole blame on


---------28:31----------
myself I think there are parts of school


---------28:33----------
where I was never able to like kind of


---------28:37----------
do what I really wanted to do in terms


---------28:40----------
of like game stuff if that makes sense


---------28:43----------
hold on when you say you didn't put the


---------28:46----------
whole blame on yourself does that mean


---------28:48----------
we're putting the blame on someone else


---------28:52----------
no I feel like there's so there are


---------28:55----------
parts there definitely things that I


---------28:56----------
could have done to kind of make to make


---------28:58----------
more use of my time but I feel like the


---------29:02----------
environment that I was in was not


---------29:03----------
necessarily like helpful either okay


---------29:08----------
what does that mean um tell me about the


---------29:12----------
environment well it's kind of like goes


---------29:18----------
back to like putting like just like


---------29:20----------
hoping for the future like when I was in


---------29:21----------
high school like I had an idea of what


---------29:22----------
like college is gonna be like and


---------29:24----------
actually got there and it was it really


---------29:25----------
anything like I imagined it being okay


---------29:29----------
did you feel like you got taken


---------29:31----------
advantage of maybe a little but I feel


---------29:37----------
like I feel like I probably could have


---------29:42----------
done more to kind of prevent that like


---------29:45----------
the tools were kind of available to me


---------29:47----------
but I never really made the most of it


---------29:49----------
okay I hear what you're saying


---------29:55----------
okay did you feel like college could


---------30:02----------
have done a better job of preparing you


---------30:04----------
for your career like for most people


---------30:07----------
college prepares them for their career


---------30:08----------
right yeah I kind of feel that way but


---------30:15----------
at the same time the people that I've


---------30:18----------
seen that we're successful coming out of


---------30:20----------
school which is very little like it was


---------30:21----------
a really small school but most of the


---------30:22----------
people who did well we're people who put


---------30:24----------
in a lot of work outside of class like


---------30:26----------
most of their creative endeavors were


---------30:28----------
done outside of class and for me like I


---------30:31----------
spent most of my time outside of class


---------30:32----------
just playing games yeah yeah yeah so I


---------30:36----------
think that's the divergence right and so


---------30:38----------
when did you decide that like your your


---------30:40----------
eggs were like that


---------30:47----------
when did you feel like the boat sailed


---------30:53----------
I think towards the end of it like


---------30:55----------
towards the end us will not listen


---------30:56----------
really like at the end but it was like


---------30:59----------
oh like okay like we're finishing up now


---------31:01----------
there are some people who kind of like


---------31:03----------
well like I'm looking at my peers and


---------31:05----------
it's like oh these people are so much


---------31:06----------
more like equipped they're more practice


---------31:08----------
they've done more than I have and I just


---------31:11----------
play games all day so like in my I guess


---------31:14----------
a part of my mind wanted to conflate


---------31:16----------
like playing games as like doing work


---------31:18----------
because


---------31:20----------
I don't know but no this is not really


---------31:26----------
the case that's not how it works yeah so


---------31:28----------
so and you finished college and then you


---------31:30----------
thought like it's over well I had like I


---------31:34----------
had sort of like an internship and I


---------31:37----------
didn't really do a lot like there's a


---------31:39----------
part of my mind that's like I'm not


---------31:40----------
really like doing a lot of work here and


---------31:42----------
I'm not like this isn't what I imagined


---------31:46----------
my life to be like okay but actually


---------31:53----------
well the other thing that happened to


---------31:54----------
says I live in Hawaii I went to school


---------31:55----------
in the mainland so I ended up moving


---------31:57----------
back home with my parents and I feel


---------32:00----------
like that kind of like you know like


---------32:03----------
maybe if I stayed in the mainland like I


---------32:04----------
still would have been able to be around


---------32:06----------
like my peers and I could have like


---------32:07----------
worked with them and stuff like that but


---------32:08----------
like moving to like we think that come


---------32:10----------
kind of like killed it like I did part


---------32:12----------
of the internship online but it was just


---------32:15----------
never really I kind of fell off like I


---------32:17----------
feel like I'm onto that cuz just wasn't


---------32:18----------
it didn't feel like it was going


---------32:19----------
anywhere right wasn't like I wasn't I


---------32:21----------
wasn't being like challenged or


---------32:24----------
interested by the work like I didn't


---------32:25----------
really like didn't really gel with me


---------32:27----------
and and


---------32:36----------
okay.i Andrew I'm gonna just need a


---------32:39----------
second to like recalibrate because I


---------32:41----------
still can't escape from this thought


---------32:42----------
that like this is just weird to me okay


---------32:48----------
because this is a real real weird dream


---------32:50----------
um so so so I think that I'm not blame


---------32:53----------
I'm please don't feel blamed I'm I'm


---------32:55----------
just trying to help you think about so I


---------32:57----------
have lots of things that I can say that


---------32:58----------
I feel like are somewhat generic right


---------33:00----------
so we can explore for example what it's


---------33:03----------
like to move back what it's like to you


---------33:05----------
know how do you start moving forward why


---------33:07----------
did you feel like it didn't gel with you


---------33:09----------
there are all these kinds of questions


---------33:10----------
that I could ask yeah right I feel like


---------33:12----------
I could answer Holden - yeah yeah and


---------33:14----------
that's I think the problem because I I


---------33:17----------
think I think there's there's something


---------33:19----------
here that I feel like we're moving


---------33:21----------
around that you're not willing to say


---------33:24----------
okay I feel like there's something here


---------33:27----------
it's like you have all of those answers


---------33:30----------
and that's not where the money is then


---------33:32----------
and the money isn't in the answers you


---------33:33----------
have it's in the answers that you don't


---------33:35----------
have okay and and there's just some


---------33:41----------
there's just some weird theme about and


---------33:43----------
like the other thing is like you're


---------33:44----------
creating this weird kind of like you're


---------33:47----------
baiting me like that's what it feels


---------33:48----------
like I'm not blaming you for this but


---------33:50----------
like you're giving me all this like


---------33:51----------
psychologically juicy [ __ ] like I am the


---------33:53----------
Mufasa and I'm the scar right but I I


---------33:56----------
don't like that's true but and you kind


---------33:59----------
of you keep on accepting responsibility


---------34:01----------
for your situation which sounds super


---------34:05----------
healthy right you're saying like oh yeah


---------34:06----------
I could have done more I could have done


---------34:08----------
more I could have done done more great


---------34:11----------
and you're saying that I think that


---------34:13----------
makes sense so like maybe this is just


---------34:15----------
like maybe I'm just I just got off on


---------34:16----------
the wrong track is that happens I'm not


---------34:19----------
perfect I'm not psychic I know people


---------34:20----------
think I am sometimes I'm just [ __ ]


---------34:22----------
wrong but to me it feels like there's


---------34:24----------
something here like do you


---------34:30----------
has someone has someone taken something


---------34:33----------
away from you like even before all this


---------34:35----------
College stuff like I know it's a


---------34:40----------
generator of course people have taken


---------34:41----------
things away from you but it's something


---------34:43----------
does something in your mind like pop out


---------34:46----------
when I ask you that question


---------34:47----------
I think my mom loves it okay yeah


---------34:51----------
what did she take away from you um I


---------34:56----------
don't know if she took anything away for


---------34:59----------
me necessarily but maybe like so growing


---------35:08----------
up I did play a lot of video games and


---------35:10----------
even as like in like middle school in


---------35:12----------
high school like I definitely like like


---------35:15----------
I did okay in school but I ended up


---------35:17----------
playing a lot of games and I think that


---------35:18----------
kind of like detracted from like other


---------35:20----------
parts of my life and I remembered like


---------35:23----------
there are times in my life were like I


---------35:24----------
was playing lots of games no my mom


---------35:25----------
would tell me like oh like you're only


---------35:26----------
gonna be good at games and stuff like


---------35:28----------
that like all you can be was like you


---------35:31----------
just sit around play on the computer


---------35:32----------
holy [ __ ] yeah what did she take away


---------35:35----------
from you I don't know what she took away


---------35:37----------
like my ability to like to do other


---------35:40----------
things


---------35:40----------
abso-fucking-lutely just think about


---------35:45----------
that for a second yeah so I feel like


---------35:51----------
I've known this yeah yeah go ahead good


---------35:55----------
no keep going I feel like I've known


---------35:57----------
this and I feel like like maybe like


---------36:00----------
like the 25 year-old Landry kind of


---------36:03----------
knows this but maybe like the younger


---------36:05----------
Andrew he's kind of like you still hurt


---------36:06----------
so some start right what's been doing


---------36:09----------
their homework yeah so tell me about the


---------36:12----------
younger Andrew uh I feel like he is kind


---------36:16----------
of hurt he's really hurt by that and you


---------36:18----------
know it's kind of weird it's like well


---------36:20----------
like I like to play video games and


---------36:22----------
maybe I do play too much but it's like


---------36:23----------
well now I'm hurt so now that I'm her


---------36:25----------
I'm gonna play more videos


---------36:28----------
so what were your choices to major in


---------36:30----------
college um well actually it was a it was


---------36:33----------
specifically for game design like I


---------36:35----------
understand that yeah


---------36:37----------
no choices like okay yeah like like so


---------36:40----------
so like this is the thing right so you


---------36:42----------
have this idea that you've got like one


---------36:44----------
option in life yeah right where did you


---------36:47----------
get that idea


---------36:49----------
it's probably like when I was younger


---------36:51----------
like for my mom right but it's kind of


---------36:53----------
weird cuz it's like I always like video


---------36:55----------
games but then I guess something got in


---------36:57----------
my head like I can only do video games


---------36:59----------
yeah right so I'm just gonna jump in for


---------37:04----------
a second so thanks for the raid a theme


---------37:06----------
live well we really appreciate it


---------37:10----------
and so we're gonna pick up in a second


---------37:14----------
Andrew cuz I just got to think about


---------37:15----------
this and I'm just gonna introduce people


---------37:16----------
to what this is so this is the healthy


---------37:19----------
gamer dot GG stream I am a psychiatrist


---------37:22----------
practicing in Boston Massachusetts this


---------37:25----------
is a stream all about sort of helping


---------37:26----------
people understand themselves why they


---------37:28----------
feel stuck helping them kind of think


---------37:31----------
about how to move forward so we're


---------37:36----------
talking with Andrew and Andrew feels


---------37:39----------
like he's sort of I would describe your


---------37:43----------
situation Andrew is something that I'd


---------37:44----------
call failure to launch I really like


---------37:48----------
that yeah yeah right so like look


---------37:51----------
failure to launch is like everything set


---------37:53----------
up like everyone's on board the plane is


---------37:55----------
is fueled and just something happens and


---------37:58----------
the plane just can't get off the ground


---------38:00----------
yes and so I think we're actually


---------38:03----------
dealing with two separate things here


---------38:05----------
should one is the failure to launch


---------38:07----------
which is like why hasn't your video game


---------38:09----------
courier picked up why don't you really


---------38:12----------
want to make video games because I don't


---------38:15----------
think you want to make video games like


---------38:16----------
you haven't we've asked you what you


---------38:18----------
want and it's always been like oh like I


---------38:20----------
like video games so let me make this my


---------38:22----------
career but I did the real devastating


---------38:25----------
thing is that actually maybe what you


---------38:26----------
want and this kind of goes back to


---------38:28----------
confusing what you want with what you


---------38:31----------
think you're capable of maybe what you


---------38:32----------
want is something else but somewhere


---------38:36----------
along the lines somewhere along the way


---------38:38----------
and you got convinced


---------38:40----------
that the only thing you can possibly be


---------38:42----------
good at is videogames sounds right and


---------38:47----------
so if we want to help you move forward I


---------38:50----------
don't think we want to and this is we're


---------38:52----------
not you know I'm sorry if I was like


---------38:53----------
like I'm just not excited about the


---------38:56----------
college and the inability to find a job


---------38:58----------
in the video game industry that just


---------39:00----------
feels in me like it's like a red herring


---------39:01----------
even though it's soon or not it it sucks


---------39:04----------
because it's like three years of my life


---------39:05----------
but yeah right so then we also have an


---------39:08----------
element of like grief because you in a


---------39:11----------
sense corner quote wasted your time


---------39:13----------
which I don't think you did but we'll


---------39:14----------
get to that okay but I think now the


---------39:17----------
question becomes like you know what is


---------39:19----------
it that when you did you have any idea


---------39:22----------
of like what you wanted like when your


---------39:24----------
mom told you that how old were you by


---------39:25----------
the way oh well those happen a lot it


---------39:30----------
happened a lot yeah well I feel like it


---------39:33----------
happened on it and how did she make you


---------39:35----------
feel I mean it kind of hurt but I feel


---------39:42----------
like I was just kind of able to ignore


---------39:44----------
it because it's you know it's happening


---------39:47----------
it's happening when I'm playing my game


---------39:48----------
so it's like okay like just show like


---------39:50----------
I'm trying to focus like yeah yeah and


---------39:53----------
what happens to feelings that you ignore


---------39:55----------
Andrew oh they don't they stay right


---------39:58----------
there I mean what are they they'll come


---------40:00----------
up later yes and in what way so what


---------40:03----------
what is the feeling that she's creating


---------40:04----------
you are in you every time she says that


---------40:07----------
to you I mean it's like her I don't


---------40:13----------
really know like what the feeling is


---------40:16----------
yeah so it hurts to have your mom say


---------40:18----------
that and what does it make you start to


---------40:20----------
believe about yourself like maybe she's


---------40:23----------
right and if she's right what does that


---------40:26----------
mean she's right about what and I'm


---------40:28----------
screwed only do video games yeah that


---------40:31----------
I'm screwed because it's like the only


---------40:32----------
thing that I can do is a thing that I


---------40:33----------
like to do yes right and also they do


---------40:37----------
screwed yeah so I think part of the


---------40:39----------
reason like why are you stuck right now


---------40:41----------
injury


---------40:43----------
because I'd never know what to do I feel


---------40:45----------
like that's half of it yeah okay like I


---------40:50----------
feel like anything that I would do won't


---------40:52----------
turn out well exactly yep so this is


---------40:57----------
important to understand it's not that


---------40:59----------
you don't know what to do


---------41:00----------
it's that doing anything is futile yeah


---------41:04----------
like I feel like I've tried to like kind


---------41:06----------
of pick up other things but it never


---------41:08----------
really like never really panned out or


---------41:11----------
caught my interest or is anyone ever


---------41:12----------
able to like say like Oh like I could


---------41:14----------
see this as a replacement for like doing


---------41:15----------
video games


---------41:16----------
absolutely and so you say this is all


---------41:20----------
surface level language right like it


---------41:22----------
never panned out no I think the problem


---------41:26----------
was that you never gave it a fair shot


---------41:27----------
because in your heart of hearts you


---------41:29----------
never knew it would succeed yeah I feel


---------41:33----------
like there are times that like maybe I


---------41:34----------
did kind of give them I'll but those are


---------41:35----------
like wait I'm just trying to like it


---------41:38----------
never lasts you know like yes because


---------41:41----------
that so this is important to understand


---------41:43----------
you can use willpower to temporarily


---------41:47----------
overcome like your internal


---------41:50----------
psychological stuff but as long as that


---------41:54----------
core belief that you're just not gonna


---------41:57----------
succeed is there you're only gonna get


---------41:59----------
like spurts of activity you're not gonna


---------42:01----------
be able to create anything sustained so


---------42:04----------
if you want to do something in life you


---------42:05----------
have to believe in yourself right like


---------42:08----------
you have to believe that this could go


---------42:10----------
somewhere like you can force yourself to


---------42:13----------
do anything for a short amount of time


---------42:15----------
right but like if you really want this


---------42:18----------
sustained so what I'm hearing from you


---------42:20----------
is that you have no sustained momentum


---------42:23----------
yeah you're not you're not a fire you're


---------42:26----------
a firework sure like a small if I ever


---------42:31----------
get that - there we go right wait a


---------42:35----------
little sparkler what is that what does


---------42:37----------
that statement tell you about yourself


---------42:38----------
put yourself in my shoes what do I think


---------42:41----------
about you when you insist on telling me


---------42:43----------
that you're a small firework or sparkler


---------42:48----------
like like this guy's not gonna go dear


---------42:53----------
in life that's what you think about you


---------42:56----------
all right Wendy what do you think about


---------42:58----------
me I think that that's a guy who


---------43:00----------
believes he's not gonna go anywhere in


---------43:02----------
life that is correct


---------43:03----------
yeah sorry what's the what's the


---------43:07----------
question yeah yeah that's fine okay okay


---------43:10----------
confusing question sorry


---------43:12----------
but yeah I think you're absolutely right


---------43:14----------
so like so you're like some somewhere in


---------43:16----------
your mind like do you see that like you


---------43:17----------
can't even sit with a random ass analogy


---------43:19----------
like you have to correct me you have to


---------43:20----------
let yourself and me and the rest of the


---------43:23----------
world know that you're not gonna amount


---------43:24----------
to anything okay that's harsh but yeah


---------43:29----------
but that's what you're saying like


---------43:31----------
you're tell--you're correcting me okay I


---------43:39----------
wish had to see my face right now I wish


---------43:42----------
I could - how do you feel I mean hearing


---------43:55----------
it I mean there's like there's like a


---------43:59----------
sense of sadness but it doesn't like


---------44:00----------
it's not like anything new it's not like


---------44:02----------
new information to me there's a sense of


---------44:07----------
sadness what else is there like


---------44:16----------
hopelessness yeah right so I think this


---------44:22----------
is the problem I mean I don't think it's


---------44:24----------
about not knowing what you can do I


---------44:25----------
think it's just like you don't think so


---------44:28----------
this is something you got to understand


---------44:30----------
about yourself Andrew your brain is like


---------44:32----------
very good and your brain is not gonna


---------44:35----------
waste time doing things that it doesn't


---------44:38----------
think are worth it okay right like


---------44:44----------
you're not gonna like your brain is not


---------44:46----------
gonna let you wake up tomorrow and start


---------44:50----------
painting for six hours a day for the


---------44:52----------
next five years if it doesn't believe


---------44:54----------
that you can be a good painter right


---------45:00----------
and so I think this comes back to like


---------45:02----------
you're just you have some fundamental


---------45:04----------
sense that you're not able to accomplish


---------45:06----------
your not able to succeed yeah and this


---------45:11----------
is pervasive it's like you know the


---------45:13----------
firework I think is a really good


---------45:14----------
example because you're kind of saying


---------45:15----------
like it's not even a big firework it's a


---------45:17----------
small firework it's a sparkler your


---------45:19----------
faith in yourself is just is completely


---------45:21----------
like it's like you believe you're


---------45:23----------
capable of little little things okay


---------45:30----------
how long have you felt that way about


---------45:33----------
yourself it probably started her own


---------45:42----------
college like I feel like in like before


---------45:45----------
college like in high school and when I


---------45:48----------
was younger like I feel like I could do


---------45:49----------
those things but the only thing that I


---------45:51----------
wanted to do was to play video games


---------45:52----------
okay and I feel like I did it okay job


---------45:55----------
at that yeah right so it sort of makes


---------45:58----------
sense why you gravitate towards video


---------46:00----------
games because you have this belief about


---------46:02----------
yourself and there's one thing that's


---------46:05----------
your beacon of hope right right you have


---------46:09----------
like one thing that like you can believe


---------46:11----------
for yourself


---------46:13----------
that you can that can be different yeah


---------46:18----------
and so you gravitate towards it you put


---------46:20----------
all your eggs in one basket so now


---------46:23----------
Andrew we've got to start thinking about


---------46:25----------
I want to sort of shift gears for a


---------46:27----------
second and start thinking about like


---------46:28----------
okay what do we do about this yes right


---------46:33----------
so what thoughts you have about that


---------46:39----------
like what to do mm-hmm give any any idea


---------46:45----------
you don't have to I'm just wondering


---------46:49----------
nothing like concrete like the part that


---------46:52----------
comes to mind so now we're gonna do a


---------46:54----------
little bit education and and I'm gonna


---------46:56----------
tell you what I think you should do okay


---------46:57----------
okay so the first thing is that like


---------47:01----------
beliefs about yourself let's just think


---------47:05----------
about this so it's it's clear that


---------47:07----------
you've done your homework so you know to


---------47:08----------
some scara's so can you explain to our


---------47:12----------
audience what are some scara's so I


---------47:17----------
guess kind of like a traumatic


---------47:20----------
experience that you've had before in the


---------47:21----------
past and usually when you're younger and


---------47:24----------
you don't really have the capacity to


---------47:27----------
kind of like process emotionally


---------47:30----------
absolutely you get older right and it


---------47:32----------
just it just sticks with you like yeah


---------47:34----------
so I think your sense of inadequacy is


---------47:38----------
not of a 25 year old like the reason


---------47:40----------
that you feel the way that you do is


---------47:41----------
because you're like a 15 year old inside


---------47:44----------
a 25 year olds body yes


---------47:46----------
and like that disconnect is hard to deal


---------47:49----------
with because you don't feel 25 you feel


---------47:52----------
15 yes are retains the age at which it


---------47:56----------
was formed yep okay so what forms the


---------48:02----------
some scar like a traumatic experience


---------48:08----------
okay so this is an important point not


---------48:12----------
all some scars are negative okay so so


---------48:17----------
if I have a some scar that is positive


---------48:20----------
where is that gonna come from a good


---------48:24----------
experience


---------48:25----------
absolutely so what's the common element


---------48:27----------
between so it's the root of a some scar


---------48:30----------
it's is what like you're saying on the


---------48:32----------
one hand it's a traumatic experience on


---------48:33----------
the other hand it's a good experience so


---------48:36----------
it's like a powerful emotional


---------48:37----------
experience exactly okay so just think so


---------48:42----------
some scars shape your behavior right you


---------48:44----------
don't get to control them they're not


---------48:45----------
logical


---------48:46----------
they just exert this subtle influence in


---------48:49----------
your subconscious mind that shapes what


---------48:51----------
you do every day when you wake up like


---------48:54----------
do you get that you don't like every


---------48:57----------
time you wake up and you think about


---------48:59----------
what you want to do in life there is a


---------49:02----------
part of your there's a part of you that


---------49:06----------
says it doesn't matter what you do


---------49:07----------
because you're gonna fail you with me


---------49:12----------
okay yeah so there's no point in


---------49:14----------
applying for a job there's no point in


---------49:15----------
doing this there's no point in trying


---------49:16----------
this there's no point in trying this


---------49:18----------
because at the core of the problem is


---------49:21----------
that like you think you're gonna fail


---------49:22----------
like you agree with that or not I'm a


---------49:25----------
little bit like I feel like I can kind


---------49:27----------
of I can kind of do those things for a


---------49:28----------
little bit and then I get to a certain


---------49:29----------
point and I just stop good okay so so


---------49:32----------
that's also accurate right because you


---------49:34----------
can use willpower to overcome the


---------49:36----------
influence of the some scar does that


---------49:38----------
make sense


---------49:39----------
yes yep for a brief period of time but


---------49:41----------
the some scar is there and it's active


---------49:42----------
it's like the some scar is like uh I


---------49:45----------
don't know like Auto spawns bad feelings


---------49:49----------
and like you can use some amount of like


---------49:51----------
manna to like lightning bolt whatever


---------49:53----------
[ __ ] it is popping out but at some point


---------49:55----------
you're gonna run out of man and it'll


---------49:57----------
continue like spawning like [ __ ] in your


---------50:00----------
life yeah so like you're just gonna run


---------50:03----------
out of mana if you use willpower so we


---------50:05----------
got to do is we got to like destroy that


---------50:07----------
like enemy generator from like gauntlet


---------50:09----------
which is probably not a game any you


---------50:10----------
guys I played hopefully I would okay


---------50:12----------
right so you can't you you just have to


---------50:15----------
take take care of the route if so you


---------50:18----------
want it but this is kind of a little bit


---------50:20----------
of a tangent but I play League of


---------50:22----------
Legends but you can use dota as you see


---------50:23----------
like okay great yeah okay I don't know


---------50:28----------
how to translate this new dude okay so


---------50:32----------
so yeah blue Izzard is about to die


---------50:36----------
right okay so let's just think about


---------50:38----------
this so if a some scar is kind of like


---------50:41----------
automatic and exerts its influence on


---------50:43----------
you like automatically and there are


---------50:47----------
good to some scars and negative some


---------50:49----------
scars and good some scars form and the


---------50:52----------
fundamental root of some scar is


---------50:55----------
experience what do you need to do have


---------51:00----------
good experiences exactly and it is that


---------51:04----------
simple


---------51:04----------
it is not to have a particular


---------51:06----------
experience it is just to have good


---------51:09----------
experiences


---------51:10----------
yeah and I are what you guys to know I'm


---------51:14----------
saying okay some scar is sa msk


---------51:18----------
ARA ya is the a silent is it like a


---------51:22----------
pronunciation thing it's a commission


---------51:24----------
okay so so this is the important thing


---------51:27----------
like I want you guys to just think about


---------51:28----------
this for a second if we think about what


---------51:30----------
influences your behavior it is


---------51:32----------
experience right that the natural


---------51:35----------
impulses that cause you to do things are


---------51:38----------
formed by experience not by logic but by


---------51:41----------
experience if you want to change the


---------51:43----------
person that you are automatically so


---------51:45----------
that you don't have to use willpower if


---------51:46----------
you're a lazy [ __ ]


---------51:48----------
like I am and you don't want to like be


---------51:51----------
disciplined and you don't want to be use


---------51:54----------
willpower and you don't want to be a


---------51:55----------
try-hard you just need to have different


---------51:57----------
experiences so I'll give you just a


---------52:00----------
simple example so let's say like I go to


---------52:04----------
uh what's that dump like let's say like


---------52:07----------
I go to like some like seafood place


---------52:08----------
okay okay and if I go to a seafood place


---------52:12----------
and I get sick what happens the next


---------52:16----------
time someone tells me like hey let's go


---------52:19----------
eat at that seafood place I'm gonna


---------52:20----------
probably turn them down right and is


---------52:22----------
that does that require willpower no it's


---------52:25----------
very easy it's automatic right so


---------52:27----------
because a negative experience


---------52:29----------
automatically shapes our behavior it I


---------52:31----------
think you will power to go back


---------52:32----------
absolutely


---------52:34----------
now let's say that I go to a restaurant


---------52:37----------
and I have an amazing meal and if


---------52:40----------
someone says oh like hey let's let's go


---------52:42----------
back to that restaurant how easy is that


---------52:46----------
in a heartbeat I'm there absolutely and


---------52:49----------
why is that because I remember the


---------52:53----------
positive experiences exactly so


---------52:56----------
experience is the great teacher right


---------52:59----------
right like that's the that's the big


---------53:01----------
thing that I want you guys to understand


---------53:02----------
it's not about logic it's even not about


---------53:04----------
emotion although emotion has a lot to do


---------53:06----------
with it in its essence Yogi's say it is


---------53:09----------
experience that creates change okay so I


---------53:15----------
think what you need to do is experience


---------53:17----------
because right now what I'm hearing is


---------53:19----------
absent in your life is experience not


---------53:25----------
like a particular experience but just


---------53:26----------
experience in general


---------53:28----------
like I'm curious but I would bet money


---------53:30----------
Andrew that if I looked at the last


---------53:33----------
month of your life compared to six


---------53:35----------
months ago compared to one year ago that


---------53:38----------
the raw nature of your experience is


---------53:41----------
basically the same Li sorry can you try


---------53:46----------
that again


---------53:46----------
so like that basically if we think about


---------53:49----------
one year ago versus six months ago


---------53:51----------
versus one week ago like the kinds of


---------53:54----------
things that you're experiencing are


---------53:55----------
basically the same I would say that's


---------53:58----------
pretty accurate yeah and as long as that


---------54:00----------
as as long as that is the case your life


---------54:02----------
is not gonna change okay because


---------54:05----------
experience is what creates change right


---------54:08----------
just think about this for a second I


---------54:10----------
mean uh because I think this is a good


---------54:12----------
example and I use it a lot but it leads


---------54:14----------
to lots of live stream fails right so


---------54:16----------
like I was about to ask you if you've


---------54:17----------
had sex but I'm not gonna ask so okay


---------54:20----------
you know like once you have sex you have


---------54:22----------
this experience of sex and then it like


---------54:24----------
really makes you want to have more sex


---------54:26----------
well if it's a positive and then if


---------54:29----------
you're like a traumatic experience of


---------54:30----------
sex that really makes you not want to


---------54:31----------
have sex yeah but like you have to have


---------54:35----------
sex once to really get fuel to do it


---------54:37----------
again yeah that's true and so I think


---------54:41----------
the basic problem you're saying that I


---------54:42----------
feel stuck I don't know what I want and


---------54:44----------
that's because you've got no fuel in


---------54:46----------
your tank and so what you're trying to


---------54:49----------
do your mind is trying to substitute


---------54:51----------
like logic and plans for fuel you're


---------54:57----------
trying to figure out in your mind like


---------54:59----------
okay if I try to do this or if I set


---------55:00----------
this up or what if I live life this way


---------55:02----------
what if I live life that way but that's


---------55:04----------
not gonna actually motivate like you can


---------55:06----------
come up with and I mean I don't know why


---------55:08----------
I think this but I think that you've


---------55:09----------
thought a lot about like all these


---------55:11----------
different things that you could do and


---------55:13----------
you've even taken a couple of steps


---------55:14----------
forward in those ways even though


---------55:16----------
they're all good ideas that never leads


---------55:18----------
to anything because you're operating in


---------55:20----------
this like abstract area of ideas you're


---------55:23----------
just like I could do this or I could do


---------55:25----------
this or I could do this let me try this


---------55:26----------
like let me wake up in the morning like


---------55:28----------
I'm gonna like give it my best because


---------55:29----------
this sounds like a good idea but like


---------55:32----------
you're not getting any fuel like you're


---------55:33----------
just it's a firework right like you need


---------55:35----------
to stick logs in that fire and you need


---------55:38----------
to let it burn for a while in those logs


---------55:40----------
were just experienced


---------55:42----------
so what I want to know from you andrew


---------55:44----------
is like what can you do tomorrow or


---------55:46----------
you're in Hawaii yeah


---------55:49----------
so what time is it it's 11:20 a.m. right


---------55:52----------
now okay


---------55:53----------
so what can you do today that is gonna


---------55:56----------
expand the scope of your experience


---------55:58----------
like something different so what is that


---------56:06----------
that's a great question I don't know I


---------56:15----------
don't know okay if I have an answer yeah


---------56:18----------
so think about what is it available in


---------56:21----------
your general area that you have never


---------56:23----------
done before


---------56:23----------
oh man that's a great question I don't


---------56:27----------
know I feel like when you live in Hawaii


---------56:29----------
there's only so many things you can do


---------56:30----------
I completely agree yeah and that's why


---------56:35----------
you turned out games cos we're


---------56:36----------
interesting yeah so like what is in your


---------56:40----------
general vicinity so I want you to Clark


---------56:44----------
yeah pull up Google Maps sure and like


---------56:49----------
look at your general location okay I am


---------56:58----------
looking kind of okay and just like I


---------57:03----------
don't know how to I mean I don't want


---------57:07----------
you can use and I like my address and


---------57:09----------
chat not in chat is send it to me over


---------57:12----------
discord I'm just I'm just you're just


---------57:14----------
your city I can just you know my address


---------57:19----------
you like the FBI no just give me give me


---------57:22----------
your so yeah they're in discord yeah


---------57:25----------
yeah okay there you go because we don't


---------57:28----------
want these people doxxing you yeah well


---------57:30----------
if they Doc's me I get to go on a trip


---------57:32----------
if they don't to snipe me


---------57:33----------
hey guys hang out


---------57:42----------
okay so I see lots of beaches yep oh so


---------57:49----------
I see that there's a rifle range oh


---------57:52----------
where are you seeing that it's like you


---------57:56----------
live here have you ever shot a gun a


---------57:58----------
real gun no okay right so like I don't


---------58:04----------
want you to go and shoot people yeah I


---------58:07----------
don't have any plans own good but I


---------58:10----------
would explore the rifle range because as


---------58:12----------
someone who has shot guns before it is a


---------58:14----------
very unique experience


---------58:16----------
okay I'm not advocating that you should


---------58:18----------
go out and buy a gun nor am i advocating


---------58:20----------
that you shoot people you should not do


---------58:21----------
that


---------58:21----------
but in terms of like they're just the


---------58:23----------
broad range of human experience I think


---------58:25----------
like shooting a gun is something that's


---------58:26----------
very like it's very different yes


---------58:32----------
because I I also see that there's a


---------58:36----------
there's a gym so the other thing that


---------58:39----------
you could do is you could go take a


---------58:44----------
class at a gym that you haven't taken


---------58:46----------
before if you've ever done yoga


---------58:48----------
I have not okay great so that's probably


---------58:52----------
healthier than shooting a gun but I


---------58:53----------
think you should actually like go to


---------58:55----------
your agency what am I to do both


---------58:57----------
yeah well which gym are you seeing it's


---------59:03----------
just search for gym in your [ __ ] city


---------59:05----------
like there's good okay doesn't matter


---------59:06----------
what yeah yeah I got pain money there


---------59:11----------
actually you see what it is room and


---------59:13----------
then I stopped okay so so go do


---------59:16----------
something at a gym or go find yeah yeah


---------59:21----------
oh I'll probably do the rifle range good


---------59:24----------
that sounds like a nice like one-off


---------59:25----------
thing but the gym sounds like a good


---------59:27----------
internet cousin yes so you may want to


---------59:28----------
call them and figure out like you know


---------59:30----------
what you need to do to go there yeah


---------59:35----------
is there like a military base near where


---------59:37----------
you live um maybe there's a couple of


---------59:42----------
those yeah near is kind of objectives


---------59:44----------
for employee like if it takes more than


---------59:46----------
like 50 minutes it's for okay so so yeah


---------59:51----------
so like call them up and then like go


---------59:53----------
and do something real and then like go


---------59:56----------
take a yoga class which is that's that's


---------59:59----------
you know like let go and have an


---------60:02----------
experience okay okay yeah I've tried


---------60:07----------
looking up things on meetup but I never


---------60:09----------
really considered looking at Google Maps


---------60:10----------
really stuff to do that makes sense yeah


---------60:12----------
okay and seriously like just be clear


---------60:17----------
I'm not like advocating violence it's


---------60:19----------
just never like I think he doesn't even


---------60:22----------
need to be a real gun have you ever


---------60:24----------
played paintball I done paintball I've


---------60:27----------
done air riflery in high school yeah


---------60:30----------
yeah so so I mean I think like a broad


---------60:33----------
range of things like I think going


---------60:35----------
underwater is like a wild thing you can


---------60:37----------
do like going skydiving is a wild thing


---------60:39----------
you can do like it doesn't even have to


---------60:40----------
be wild like going to a yoga class is


---------60:42----------
like a very different experience you


---------60:45----------
know like having an orgasm is like a


---------60:46----------
very different experience like watching


---------60:49----------
an animal stumbling upon an animal in


---------60:51----------
the wild is like a very different


---------60:53----------
experience and and like these are just


---------60:56----------
different experiences right like going


---------60:58----------
to a crawfish boil is a different


---------61:00----------
experience if you've never eaten sushi


---------61:01----------
before having sushi is a different


---------61:03----------
experience if you've never played a


---------61:06----------
video game before like enjoying a video


---------61:08----------
game is like a wildly different


---------61:10----------
experience like I've tried to get my mom


---------61:12----------
to play video games for the last 20


---------61:14----------
years and like she finally had fun


---------61:17----------
playing a game can anyone guess what it


---------61:19----------
is oh can it be dude oh yeah someone got


---------61:30----------
it


---------61:33----------
nope it's it's overcooked okay


---------61:37----------
everything's great


---------61:38----------
she played overcooked it she liked it


---------61:40----------
was a riot


---------61:42----------
nice and and so that's what I want you


---------61:47----------
to do like I know it's like a [ __ ]


---------61:49----------
I'm gonna get banned now because I told


---------61:50----------
you go to a rifle range but I'm not


---------61:52----------
saying [ __ ] like really like everyone


---------61:54----------
understands that right I'm not and by


---------61:56----------
the way I mean like yeah I mean we can


---------61:59----------
talk a little bit about feelings of


---------62:00----------
wanting to be violent towards other


---------62:01----------
human beings because that's a big


---------62:03----------
problem yeah um so yeah so if I really


---------62:07----------
wanted to get banned and I wanted to


---------62:09----------
punish people I'd tell them to play Dark


---------62:11----------
Souls if you have to play Dark Souls


---------62:14----------
before that's another not novel


---------62:16----------
experience that you can get and so I


---------62:19----------
think like you're so so Andrew just to


---------62:24----------
sum up so I think that like it can be


---------62:26----------
very hard to figure out how to move


---------62:28----------
forward in life when you feel so stuck


---------62:30----------
and you don't know what to do right like


---------62:32----------
that's where you are like you don't even


---------62:33----------
know where to start


---------62:34----------
so like the instinct is to tell you like


---------62:37----------
oh if you like studied like video gaming


---------62:38----------
like why don't you try to break into the


---------62:40----------
industry and why don't you polish up


---------62:42----------
your resume and why don't you find an


---------62:43----------
internship those are all suggestions


---------62:45----------
that may be good suggestions but I think


---------62:48----------
the basic problem is that you have a


---------62:50----------
lack of experience in life like just


---------62:52----------
experiencing different things and what


---------62:54----------
you need to do is just go out and do


---------62:56----------
something like go do different things


---------62:58----------
they don't have to be good they don't


---------62:59----------
have to be bad but as you start to do


---------63:02----------
different things you are going to


---------63:03----------
develop a different sense of self from


---------63:06----------
the one that you have now and as you


---------63:09----------
change your sense of self your ability


---------63:11----------
to move in the world is going to change


---------63:15----------
okay questions a couple actually kind of


---------63:23----------
I don't know if this is taking some


---------63:25----------
steps backwards but I have an


---------63:27----------
opportunity with my work to to do online


---------63:31----------
college and I'm also I was also trying


---------63:36----------
to look for a new job I'm wondering what


---------63:38----------
you think would be good like if I should


---------63:40----------
stay with that and like it's like super


---------63:42----------
cheap schooling


---------63:44----------
and that's kind of a new experience but


---------63:48----------
what are you thinking it it's hard it's


---------63:51----------
like well one hand if I go to my job if


---------63:54----------
I stick with the job that I have now


---------63:56----------
it's like well we're kind of suck


---------63:57----------
sometimes but then I'd like to be going


---------63:58----------
to school but at the same time I could


---------64:00----------
get a new job and then like I don't know


---------64:02----------
like I feel like that might not be any


---------64:05----------
reading yeah so Andrew I don't really


---------64:08----------
know how to advise you about whether you


---------64:09----------
should change your job or not because


---------64:10----------
that's I mean I don't know anything


---------64:11----------
about your life I don't know what your


---------64:12----------
financial situation is I know you work


---------64:14----------
in retail you have the opportunity to go


---------64:16----------
to college so this is all like in your


---------64:18----------
head level thinking does that make sense


---------64:20----------
like you're doing analysis you're


---------64:21----------
weighing projects like I don't think you


---------64:23----------
have a problem with that


---------64:24----------
that's not where your problem is yeah so


---------64:28----------
I I don't know anything about your life


---------64:30----------
I don't know like where you live I don't


---------64:32----------
know how much your rent is I don't know


---------64:34----------
if you're somebody doesn't know where


---------64:35----------
you live now yeah yeah I mean I don't


---------64:38----------
know like what your living situation is


---------64:39----------
whether you live it alone whether you


---------64:42----------
live with roommates whether you live at


---------64:43----------
home I don't know I mean all of those


---------64:45----------
like those are the kinds of things that


---------64:46----------
weigh into a decision like this I think


---------64:49----------
the way that you need to start is by


---------64:51----------
like so you can figure out whatever that


---------64:52----------
decision is but frankly Andrew I think


---------64:54----------
you spent too much time thinking about


---------64:56----------
that stuff because that's not you've


---------64:57----------
been thinking about that kind of [ __ ]


---------64:59----------
all four years and it's like hasn't


---------65:00----------
gotten you anywhere you know like you


---------65:03----------
need to just go out and like do


---------65:05----------
something like if there's there's an


---------65:06----------
animal shelter like go and volunteer do


---------65:09----------
you have a pet no okay so like fine like


---------65:12----------
is are there animal shelters nearby now


---------65:15----------
you think there might be so like go out


---------65:17----------
and like volunteer at an animal shelter


---------65:19----------
okay spend time with like animals it's


---------65:22----------
like crazy it's fun and will make you


---------65:24----------
feel different about yourself yeah we


---------65:26----------
used to have a dog in the dog died and


---------65:28----------
it's like that's it we're done with that


---------65:29----------
Sarah okay sorry to do that that's okay


---------65:33----------
I just I don't know I think like there


---------65:36----------
are a lot more details that are involved


---------65:38----------
in terms of answering that question so


---------65:39----------
I'm sorry okay really like giving like I


---------65:41----------
I don't that's this way okay questions


---------65:46----------
yeah how does one go about getting


---------65:51----------
therapy great


---------65:54----------
okay so let's talk about therapy yeah so


---------65:57----------
I think it is a good idea if you feel


---------66:00----------
depressed or sad or especially like


---------66:02----------
suicidal because that's been cropping up


---------66:04----------
from time to time one or discord you


---------66:07----------
should definitely get therapy like so


---------66:08----------
you should go and get a mentor in fact I


---------66:10----------
think everyone should get like a mental


---------66:11----------
health evaluation I think it's a good


---------66:12----------
idea to just be in a physical evaluation


---------66:15----------
to if you haven't seen a primary care


---------66:16----------
physician go and see a primary care


---------66:17----------
physician so start there and in terms of


---------66:21----------
finding a therapist here's what I would


---------66:22----------
recommend so if you have health


---------66:23----------
insurance you can start depending on


---------66:26----------
what your financial situation is so


---------66:27----------
about a third of therapists within the


---------66:29----------
United States don't accept health


---------66:32----------
insurance if you have health insurance


---------66:34----------
you may have an out-of-network benefit


---------66:37----------
and if you have an out-of-network


---------66:38----------
benefit they will reimburse a percentage


---------66:40----------
of what you pay to to your therapist or


---------66:44----------
psychiatrist so for example I see people


---------66:47----------
my rate is 450 an hour out of that


---------66:49----------
patients who have good health insurance


---------66:51----------
get reimbursed about 350 per session so


---------66:55----------
their out-of-pocket cost is about $100


---------66:57----------
per week okay so depending on what kind


---------67:00----------
of insurance you have you'll have an


---------67:02----------
out-of-network benefit or you won't if


---------67:04----------
you don't have an out-of-network benefit


---------67:06----------
I would call your insurance company and


---------67:08----------
ask for a list of providers who accept


---------67:10----------
your insurance then you start googling


---------67:12----------
people and you start calling people and


---------67:14----------
you read about the therapist because


---------67:15----------
nowadays a lot of therapists sub


---------67:16----------
websites and you try to find a couple of


---------67:18----------
people that you like and then what you


---------67:21----------
do is you reach out to them and you try


---------67:25----------
to schedule appointments and then you go


---------67:27----------
and I would recommend that you meet with


---------67:28----------
three pairs Arabists and if you meet


---------67:31----------
with three you just pick the one that


---------67:33----------
you think like you enjoy meeting the


---------67:35----------
most like who do you like the best and I


---------67:37----------
think that sometimes people forget that


---------67:38----------
like you know you don't just buy the


---------67:40----------
first car you see you go and you


---------67:42----------
test-drive things and you see which one


---------67:45----------
works for you and that's especially


---------67:46----------
important for a therapist so the


---------67:48----------
insurance stuff aside the other thing


---------67:50----------
that you can do is just Google like


---------67:52----------
things in like therapists in your area


---------67:54----------
or you can go to a website like


---------67:55----------
Psychology Today or you can go to


---------67:58----------
someone like rise above the disorder


---------68:00----------
like rad I think is a good resource they


---------68:03----------
connect people with therapists they'll


---------68:05----------
interview you and try to find a good fit


---------68:07----------
for you


---------68:07----------
stuff like that so they can really help


---------68:08----------
you with that um and so that's I think


---------68:13----------
that's how you find a therapist what


---------68:14----------
modality and stuff they use is I think


---------68:16----------
like that can be important but at the


---------68:18----------
end of the day like you're probably not


---------68:19----------
gonna know much i mean i guess you can


---------68:21----------
read about psychodynamic versus CBT or


---------68:23----------
whatever you can find something that you


---------68:26----------
think you're gonna like but ultimately I


---------68:27----------
think fit is way more important and it's


---------68:29----------
been my experience that oh a lot of


---------68:32----------
therapists do way more than a particular


---------68:36----------
thing like even so the person who taught


---------68:38----------
me CBT I was really confused because I


---------68:42----------
thought she was gonna be teaching BC BT


---------68:43----------
but she kept on like talking to me about


---------68:45----------
psychodynamic stop it and it's just like


---------68:47----------
good therapists use like everything


---------68:49----------
under the Sun right make sense what do


---------68:53----------
you think about online therapy I mean I


---------68:58----------
do telepsychiatry with some people I


---------69:00----------
think I like meeting with people in real


---------69:02----------
life better but it can work okay


---------69:05----------
I am very confused as chat you guys are


---------69:11----------
right I don't know what anyway


---------69:13----------
other questions does that does that make


---------69:14----------
sense yeah like sense uh okay another


---------69:17----------
one this is like a cushion I submit it


---------69:19----------
to the question but but since I'm here


---------69:20----------
sure figure might as well ask it so I


---------69:23----------
have something relating to like I review


---------69:26----------
talking about it like having like Dharma


---------69:28----------
to like different people or different


---------69:29----------
things in your life like it's normal


---------69:31----------
like a singular thing or it's like I


---------69:33----------
have like a Dharma to my family or have


---------69:34----------
a Dharma to like my community or haven't


---------69:36----------
Dharma to myself like how does that work


---------69:37----------
great question


---------69:39----------
I'm gonna start actually by asking a


---------69:42----------
question to chat because I think I think


---------69:44----------
your question is good so chat I need


---------69:46----------
y'all's help or we need y'all's help and


---------69:48----------
you feel free to weigh in to Andrew


---------69:50----------
we're trying to think about like how we


---------69:52----------
can help you all the best


---------69:54----------
yes and you spent one of the things that


---------69:56----------
I'm thinking about is like we're


---------69:58----------
thinking about taking a step back from


---------69:59----------
just doing interviews and like doing


---------70:01----------
more start-to-finish content because we


---------70:04----------
get a lot of questions I talked a lot


---------70:05----------
about Dharma but it's like patchwork I


---------70:07----------
get questions about it I interview


---------70:09----------
someone about it and then sometimes


---------70:11----------
people like will ask and chat like


---------70:13----------
what's the deal with herma so one of the


---------70:16----------
things that we're thinking about doing


---------70:17----------
is like doing like a stream devoted to


---------70:19----------
particular topics so


---------70:21----------
I'll do one day just talking about


---------70:23----------
Dharma from start to finish another day


---------70:26----------
I'll talk about psychedelics which is


---------70:27----------
like start to finish


---------70:28----------
I may not probably won't do an interview


---------70:30----------
but we'll just like do one day about


---------70:32----------
psychedelics one day about Dharma like


---------70:35----------
another day about Ayurveda which people


---------70:36----------
seem to like a lot and so do you guys


---------70:38----------
want us to expand beyond Q&A and


---------70:41----------
interviews okay so then we're gonna do


---------70:48----------
that okay so the next question that I


---------70:54----------
have for you guys is that the other


---------70:56----------
thing that I was thinking is we start


---------70:57----------
with people right so we had this this


---------70:59----------
session with Andrew and I'm still not


---------71:01----------
sure if this is helping or not helping


---------71:03----------
or whether this is useful to people a


---------71:06----------
little bit yeah


---------71:08----------
so so we'll see though because I think


---------71:10----------
you're not gonna have a psychological


---------71:11----------
breakthrough that's gonna change your


---------71:13----------
life Andrew you like you need to go out


---------71:14----------
and start doing [ __ ] like that's really


---------71:16----------
Jeannie okay and cuz I think it's all


---------71:19----------
about combating that some scar and we


---------71:20----------
can talk more about that but here's the


---------71:21----------
other thing that I've been wondering so


---------71:23----------
we have a waiting list of people who


---------71:25----------
want to come on stream and at the same


---------71:26----------
time I'm wondering so I sometimes get


---------71:29----------
follow-ups from people and like I'm


---------71:32----------
wondering if actually it would be


---------71:33----------
helpful for people to see for example


---------71:35----------
Andrews journey right so he goes out and


---------71:37----------
he does this but then the next time we


---------71:39----------
meet we dig a little bit further so


---------71:42----------
would you guys do you guys like to see


---------71:44----------
like different people every week or


---------71:46----------
would you guys think it is better or


---------71:49----------
more useful just to watch someone's


---------71:52----------
journey from start to finish


---------71:57----------
journey okay so we're gonna do both okay


---------72:01----------
cuz I think the main reason we haven't


---------72:03----------
been doing journey is because I feel


---------72:05----------
like it is unfair to all of the people


---------72:07----------
who want to come on first a few people


---------72:10----------
to monopolize like our time and and the


---------72:12----------
help that we offer so I think we're


---------72:14----------
gonna try to do both so we're gonna pick


---------72:16----------
a couple of people and I think reckful


---------72:18----------
is gonna be one of them because he wants


---------72:20----------
to come on again and then we'll try to


---------72:23----------
pick like a couple of other people and


---------72:25----------
we're gonna try to see because there are


---------72:27----------
a lot of challenges that come up so if


---------72:29----------
you guys have seen the interviews with


---------72:30----------
the sky so sky like DM me the other day


---------72:33----------
and like brought up in a maze


---------72:35----------
point which i think is like really


---------72:36----------
important but like is something that


---------72:38----------
happens two or three steps forward that


---------72:41----------
like as you start with your first


---------72:43----------
revelation you start with your first


---------72:44----------
game plan but in the progress of growth


---------72:47----------
you have challenges that arise and like


---------72:53----------
those challenges are also very common so


---------72:57----------
Skye asked me a question and he's like I


---------72:59----------
was wondering if I should start changing


---------73:01----------
my life today or I should like pick a


---------73:04----------
date in the future to like start this


---------73:06----------
journey and like that's such a beautiful


---------73:09----------
question to ask because it's like so


---------73:11----------
important and there's this big problem


---------73:14----------
so people everyone says like oh you


---------73:15----------
should just do today you should do today


---------73:17----------
you should usually that's defeating the


---------73:19----------
point right so the purpose of the stream


---------73:21----------
is not to give him the answer the


---------73:23----------
purpose of the stream is to help him


---------73:24----------
understand what in his mind makes him


---------73:27----------
want to put it off and what in his mind


---------73:29----------
makes him want to do it today that's


---------73:33----------
what you guys have to understand there's


---------73:35----------
a part of your mind that wants to push


---------73:36----------
things off and where is that coming from


---------73:38----------
and how do we understand that because


---------73:40----------
the solution to doing things today is


---------73:41----------
not just to say today is the better day


---------73:43----------
to do it it's understanding why you want


---------73:45----------
to push it off until tomorrow right it's


---------73:50----------
not about the right answer like I'm not


---------73:51----------
here to give you guys answers I'm here


---------73:53----------
to help you understand like what's going


---------73:55----------
on inside you okay so we're gonna do


---------74:00----------
longitude like we're gonna do like more


---------74:02----------
longitudinal streams so we'll follow up


---------74:04----------
with particular people and we're


---------74:06----------
probably gonna do like between four and


---------74:08----------
eight weeks so apologies to the people


---------74:11----------
that we're not going to be getting to as


---------74:13----------
a result of that we're gonna do the best


---------74:14----------
that we can we're gonna continue to do


---------74:15----------
new people because I think that's


---------74:17----------
important too yeah and okay and then


---------74:24----------
yeah so the other thing is if you guys


---------74:27----------
know someone that you think should come


---------74:29----------
on stream by all means let us know and


---------74:31----------
if you guys are members of other


---------74:33----------
communities let them know too


---------74:35----------
like so if you guys want like so you let


---------74:39----------
that like cuz I don't know I mean I yes


---------74:45----------
oh so like whoever it is like you guys


---------74:47----------
have to help us get those people right


---------74:50----------
so someone messaged me the other day and


---------74:52----------
they were like PewDiePie is taking a


---------74:53----------
break from YouTube he's super stressed


---------74:55----------
out and like PewDiePie is huge and all


---------74:58----------
that like I'm happy to talk to the guy


---------75:00----------
but like I have no way of getting


---------75:01----------
PewDiePie to come on like I don't know


---------75:03----------
who all these people are ls messaged me


---------75:05----------
and they said okay fine I don't know who


---------75:07----------
ls is like a theme rated us thank you


---------75:09----------
for the rate of theme you're welcome to


---------75:11----------
come on I don't know who that is I don't


---------75:14----------
know who any these people are people


---------75:15----------
have been talking about Mitt jones since


---------75:17----------
day one and that's fine like I'm I think


---------75:21----------
we're gonna I think Mitch Jones


---------75:23----------
I don't know I'm I can't say anything


---------75:25----------
about that but like so you guys tell us


---------75:28----------
who you want us to see and you also tell


---------75:31----------
them because reckful actually we didn't


---------75:32----------
get reckful on the stream you guys got


---------75:34----------
reckful to come on the stream so someone


---------75:36----------
in our community said hey reckful you


---------75:38----------
should do this and reckful was like okay


---------75:40----------
and it was a kind of a last minute thing


---------75:42----------
so whoever you guys want to come on you


---------75:46----------
just let me know and you let them know


---------75:48----------
and we'll make it happen and we're


---------75:51----------
definitely gonna reserve time for pardon


---------75:53----------
me for saying this but like the people


---------75:55----------
who aren't big streamers right like


---------75:56----------
that's fine it's not this isn't like a


---------75:59----------
like celebrity psychoanalysis stream


---------76:03----------
this is just a helping regular people


---------76:04----------
stream and like everyone is a regular


---------76:06----------
person in my book okay so you guys let


---------76:10----------
us know who you want so lemme just hear


---------76:12----------
a like so a couple of takeaways so the


---------76:14----------
first is that you guys want to see more


---------76:16----------
content streams so I'm not gonna


---------76:17----------
interview someone I'm just gonna get up


---------76:19----------
here and I'm gonna [ __ ] talk at you


---------76:21----------
for like 45 minutes which I feel we're


---------76:24----------
doing but I'll do the second thing is


---------76:26----------
we're gonna do more like fall ops with


---------76:28----------
people and follow someone's journey from


---------76:30----------
like start to finish I don't know about


---------76:32----------
finish because I don't know but we're


---------76:35----------
gonna follow people over time and we'll


---------76:36----------
see how that goes and the third thing is


---------76:40----------
that if you guys want someone else to


---------76:42----------
come on


---------76:43----------
I'm happy to and then y'all let me know


---------76:48----------
how to make that happen cuz I'm a boomer


---------76:50----------
right I claim boomer I claim boomer who


---------76:53----------
is LSI don't know okay


---------76:56----------
now getting back to so so this is the


---------77:06----------
thing you guys are telling me to ask


---------77:07----------
this person to ask this I don't know who


---------77:09----------
any of these people are you guys need to


---------77:10----------
ask these people like [ __ ] like


---------77:12----------
someone here is telling me that I need


---------77:14----------
to be streaming more you guys have to


---------77:15----------
understand this I have a limited amount


---------77:16----------
of time in my day and if I'm asking


---------77:19----------
people to come on stream that is like


---------77:21----------
time that I'm not spending actually


---------77:22----------
streaming it sounds like I need be


---------77:23----------
streaming more not streaming less so if


---------77:26----------
a theme great lazy dog absolutely hey


---------77:30----------
let's be clear I never claimed to not be


---------77:32----------
lazy okay okay so let's get back to poor


---------77:39----------
Andrew who has been waiting patiently


---------77:42----------
for an answer to his question and let's


---------77:43----------
talk for a second about Dharma okay so


---------77:46----------
the karma is the Sanskrit word for duty


---------77:48----------
or responsibility and it is my belief


---------77:51----------
that like living in accordance with your


---------77:53----------
Dharma gives you an immense amount of


---------77:55----------
strength to tolerate the difficult parts


---------77:58----------
of life and so if you don't feel like


---------78:01----------
doing something like doing your daughter


---------78:03----------
like Dharma is what lets you like give


---------78:05----------
you the strength to tolerate the bad


---------78:07----------
stuff so class I mean not classic but


---------78:09----------
like one example that I use is like if


---------78:11----------
I'm working in the emergency room and


---------78:12----------
some guy comes in with like a heart


---------78:13----------
attack like or actually let me give you


---------78:16----------
guys a real example that happened to me


---------78:17----------
so that's happened too but so when I was


---------78:20----------
interviewing for residency before I was


---------78:23----------
even a doctor I was a fourth-year


---------78:24----------
medical student and I was flying all


---------78:26----------
over the country to do interviews I was


---------78:29----------
on a flight where the dreaded thing that


---------78:31----------
all doctors dread happens which is that


---------78:34----------
someone said is there a doctor on board


---------78:37----------
there's someone one of the passengers is


---------78:39----------
having a problem so I'm a fourth-year


---------78:42----------
medical student I'm not even a doctor


---------78:43----------
and so I kind of wait and I'm like let's


---------78:47----------
see if there's a doctor on board and


---------78:49----------
then like about 60 seconds later the


---------78:52----------
announcement happens again and no one


---------78:54----------
says anything


---------78:55----------
and then I'm like well [ __ ] like I'm not


---------78:59----------
technically a doctor I'm terrified right


---------79:02----------
because I don't actually know how to


---------79:03----------
save anyone's life but I may be the most


---------79:06----------
knowledgeable person on the plane like


---------79:08----------
I'm a medical student and so like what


---------79:11----------
should I do


---------79:12----------
like I'm afraid that I'm gonna kill


---------79:13----------
someone I'm afraid that I'm like I'm


---------79:15----------
feeling anxious I'm feeling scared and


---------79:20----------
what do you think I want to do Andrew


---------79:22----------
since we still have you on let's use


---------79:24----------
what do you want to do yeah what do you


---------79:26----------
want act was you want to help the person


---------79:29----------
yeah but what do you I want to do


---------79:31----------
something more which is not do anything


---------79:34----------
okay right yeah all right there's a part


---------79:38----------
of you that wants to help live in a part


---------79:39----------
of you that wants to do nothing right


---------79:40----------
absolutely which part do you think is


---------79:42----------
stronger the part that doesn't wanna do


---------79:44----------
anything absolutely I just want to stay


---------79:47----------
quiet and I want to pretend this never


---------79:48----------
happened


---------79:49----------
let the guy die so what is my Dharma


---------79:52----------
what is my duty or responsibility in


---------79:54----------
that moment Andrew Tigers help the


---------79:57----------
person absolutely right and so the more


---------80:00----------
that I orient towards that the more its


---------80:02----------
I'm able to deal with my negative


---------80:04----------
feelings because when you sit with


---------80:07----------
negative feelings this is important when


---------80:09----------
you sit with negative feelings the


---------80:10----------
negative feelings control you right like


---------80:12----------
this is gonna sound really weird but


---------80:13----------
when you're in your negative feelings


---------80:15----------
and you're fighting against yourself


---------80:17----------
your negative feelings control what you


---------80:19----------
do does that make sense


---------80:20----------
yeah but when you incorporate someone


---------80:24----------
else when you start acting for other


---------80:27----------
people like you become less important


---------80:31----------
does that make sense yeah it's like you


---------80:34----------
like I've been able to kind of dump does


---------80:35----------
that work - it helps and and then like


---------80:38----------
the less important you become in the


---------80:40----------
equation then it doesn't matter what


---------80:43----------
kind of [ __ ] you're dealing with what


---------80:44----------
your some scars are whether you have


---------80:45----------
anxiety or whatever like it becomes


---------80:47----------
about the other person and then you have


---------80:49----------
the strength to act it's almost like a


---------80:51----------
hack


---------80:51----------
it's like Dharma's like a hack to let


---------80:54----------
you overcome the [ __ ] that goes on


---------80:56----------
within you because in that moment like


---------80:58----------
it doesn't [ __ ] matter what I what


---------80:59----------
fear I feel like this guy could be done


---------81:01----------
and I may be a medical student I may be


---------81:04----------
it like I may be incompetent I don't


---------81:07----------
know how to save lives I don't know what


---------81:08----------
to do


---------81:09----------
but like I'm it


---------81:12----------
so what do you think happened Andrew any


---------81:17----------
idea uh I I'm hoping that you save the


---------81:21----------
guy yeah so I muster up my courage I


---------81:25----------
think about my Dharma I hit the call


---------81:27----------
bell flight attendant comes over he


---------81:29----------
grabs me and I say you know I just want


---------81:35----------
to say like I I may be able to help I'm


---------81:37----------
a fourth-year medical student so I'm


---------81:38----------
gonna graduate in a couple of months but


---------81:40----------
I'm not actually a doctor but I'm happy


---------81:42----------
to try to help with what I can


---------81:44----------
so she says please come with me sir we


---------81:45----------
go back to the airplane I see a guy on


---------81:48----------
the floor and next to him I see an older


---------81:52----------
dude who's kneeling over and I


---------81:55----------
introduced myself and the guy says oh


---------81:58----------
like thanks for showing up I'm glad


---------82:00----------
you're a medical student you can go back


---------82:02----------
to your seat I'm a cardiologist and this


---------82:04----------
guy's going to be fine he's having a


---------82:06----------
panic attack


---------82:07----------
great


---------82:09----------
turns out there was a [ __ ] doctor on


---------82:11----------
the plane and like their wires were


---------82:13----------
crossed and I was like oh my god almost


---------82:16----------
died but you didn't but you went up you


---------82:19----------
went up and you stepped up which is just


---------82:21----------
right yeah right and like that's that's


---------82:25----------
what karma is about Dharma is about like


---------82:27----------
that thing within you that helps you


---------82:29----------
combat that fever that helps you


---------82:32----------
overcome it in the fear is there it


---------82:33----------
doesn't go away we don't numb it that's


---------82:36----------
what video games do that's what drugs do


---------82:37----------
they make it go away so what I want you


---------82:41----------
guys to do is I don't want to take away


---------82:43----------
your fear I don't want to take away your


---------82:44----------
anxiety I don't want to take away your


---------82:46----------
sadness I don't want to take away your


---------82:47----------
depression I don't want to take away


---------82:48----------
your shame what I want to do is help you


---------82:53----------
live the life that you want to in spite


---------82:55----------
of those [ __ ] things right like


---------83:00----------
that's what life is about it's not about


---------83:01----------
taking away that [ __ ] it's about like


---------83:04----------
living a life where you can do the


---------83:06----------
things that you need to do and want to


---------83:07----------
do in spite of that [ __ ] and that's what


---------83:12----------
the autumn uh lets you do


---------83:17----------
so Andrews question do you have to harm


---------83:21----------
us to multiple people absolutely right


---------83:25----------
so you so this is what what I think is


---------83:27----------
fun about the Mahabharat so this is a


---------83:29----------
story about like karmic conflict so that


---------83:31----------
you have Dharma's to different people


---------83:33----------
and sometimes those Dharma's like


---------83:34----------
conflict and how do you resolve the


---------83:37----------
different thermals that you have to


---------83:39----------
different people and so for example you


---------83:42----------
know if you're if you're you know I


---------83:46----------
don't know how what to say but like you


---------83:48----------
know you mate you have a certain


---------83:49----------
tournament to your parents and sometimes


---------83:51----------
that conflicts with your Dharma to


---------83:52----------
yourself yes you have a Dharma to you


---------83:56----------
know maybe your boyfriend or girlfriend


---------83:57----------
and that can sometimes conflict with


---------83:58----------
your Dharma to yourself you have a


---------84:00----------
Dharma to yourself that can conflict


---------84:02----------
with Dharma to your family I mean to


---------84:04----------
your job or your boss and I think like


---------84:07----------
this is where a lot of people get bent


---------84:08----------
out of shape because they don't live in


---------84:10----------
accordance with their Dharma they try to


---------84:12----------
make their family happy and you can't


---------84:15----------
make your family happy but you can do


---------84:17----------
your duty to them right and this is


---------84:19----------
where a lot of people get bent out of


---------84:21----------
shape because they try to make their


---------84:22----------
parents proud you can't make your


---------84:23----------
parents proud you can just do the most


---------84:26----------
that you can to make them proud and


---------84:27----------
whether they feel proud or not is up to


---------84:29----------
them so there's a lot of strength in


---------84:31----------
Dharma too because there's a lot of


---------84:32----------
surrender in Dharma so like now Andrew


---------84:37----------
you have a Dharma to go out and


---------84:39----------
experience something that's your Dharma


---------84:41----------
to yourself and whether your life gets


---------84:44----------
transformed or not like that's not


---------84:45----------
something you can control and I know


---------84:47----------
people come on the stream thinking that


---------84:49----------
I'm gonna transform their lives guys I


---------84:51----------
can't [ __ ] do that it's impossible


---------84:52----------
like literally think about this you


---------84:54----------
can't talk to a guy on twitch for an


---------84:55----------
hour and your life be transformed it's


---------84:57----------
just not going to happen but you do have


---------85:00----------
a tournament to yourself and that


---------85:03----------
thermos


---------85:04----------
to go out and experience something go to


---------85:05----------
yoga class or a shooting range no


---------85:07----------
trouble okay but I don't advocate gun


---------85:10----------
violence in any way just against targets


---------85:13----------
right yeah so you have a dharma to


---------85:17----------
yourself and this is like really


---------85:18----------
important because I think most people


---------85:20----------
that I talk to on stream and like gamers


---------85:23----------
or human beings in general the Dharma


---------85:27----------
that they fail the most is actually the


---------85:29----------
Dharma to themselves just think about


---------85:35----------
that like like you'll do amazing things


---------85:37----------
for other people like if your friend is


---------85:40----------
sick you'll make them chicken noodle


---------85:41----------
soup and you'll like take them something


---------85:44----------
that's healthy and nutritious and tasty


---------85:46----------
but you won't make healthy and


---------85:48----------
nutritious and tasty food for yourself


---------85:50----------
you'll do it for them but you won't do


---------85:52----------
it for yourself and that's a [ __ ]


---------85:56----------
problem like the biggest person that


---------85:59----------
you're failing in life is not your


---------86:00----------
parents not your boss not well maybe


---------86:03----------
your spouse maybe your kids actually


---------86:06----------
yeah but is to yourself right yeah other


---------86:15----------
questions


---------86:15----------
Andrew or we-well I get any kind of


---------86:18----------
expanding on that like should I be


---------86:19----------
holding like the Dharma to myself above


---------86:22----------
other things or how does that like


---------86:23----------
what's the what's the hierarchy like I


---------86:25----------
mean there isn't a set hierarchy and


---------86:27----------
that's why you need to do things like


---------86:29----------
study certain texts to understand the


---------86:31----------
nuances of Dharma so I think you just


---------86:34----------
have to understand like how can you do


---------86:35----------
and I think a lot of times people


---------86:37----------
confuse like I said they confuse


---------86:38----------
outcomes with doing your Dharma so I


---------86:41----------
find it rare that true Dharma comes into


---------86:44----------
conflict and that usually there's like


---------86:45----------
some kind of karmic road which involves


---------86:48----------
fulfilling all of your responsibilities


---------86:50----------
okay so just like try to do everything


---------86:53----------
the best you can yeah and just


---------86:55----------
understand like what target you're


---------86:57----------
setting because your target shouldn't be


---------86:58----------
a particular thing happening it should


---------87:00----------
be a particular Dharma like I'm doing


---------87:03----------
this I'm doing X thing for X reason and


---------87:05----------
not worry yeah okay right so like I


---------87:08----------
don't know like what kind of conflict do


---------87:10----------
you mean but you know rarely does it


---------87:13----------
actually come into conflict


---------87:16----------
okay in my experience just you just need


---------87:19----------
to think through it and and talk through


---------87:21----------
it oftentimes it seems like it comes


---------87:24----------
into conflict but the more that you


---------87:25----------
reflect on it the more you can find that


---------87:28----------
middle road can it can it be a kind of


---------87:30----------
specific done sure feels kind of weird


---------87:34----------
but it's like a part of me like wants to


---------87:37----------
stay at my job because I feel like I


---------87:38----------
have a responsibility to my co-workers


---------87:40----------
but at the same time I have a


---------87:41----------
responsibility to myself to kind of like


---------87:43----------
seek better appointment so what is your


---------87:45----------
responsibility to your coworkers I know


---------87:47----------
they just kind of feel like like I feel


---------87:50----------
like that they've helped me a lot and I


---------87:52----------
add value to like what they do what does


---------87:57----------
that mean you add value to what they do


---------87:58----------
uh or like like I feel like part of a


---------88:01----------
team like I feel like part of a family


---------88:03----------
like I really like like the people that


---------88:05----------
I work with okay


---------88:07----------
so what is your paramount to your


---------88:08----------
co-workers wait to help them in one way


---------88:12----------
to show up to work and do my job okay so


---------88:17----------
if you don't show up and do your job


---------88:19----------
what happens to your coworkers uh well


---------88:23----------
it kind of sucks more for them because


---------88:24----------
then they have more stuff to do okay


---------88:26----------
like that's not your Dharma yeah so that


---------88:31----------
sounds like a failure of Dharma on your


---------88:33----------
boss's part does that mean can you try


---------88:39----------
that over time yes so like it's not your


---------88:42----------
responsibility to ensure that your


---------88:44----------
co-workers are not overworked okay


---------88:50----------
does that make sense yeah so that can


---------88:58----------
feel different from feeling like you owe


---------89:00----------
them so you have a Dharma to them if


---------89:03----------
they've done something good for you you


---------89:05----------
have a Dharma to do something good for


---------89:07----------
them so that's just a conversation it's


---------89:10----------
like hey guys I'm quitting but I really


---------89:12----------
appreciate when you did X Y & Z and if


---------89:15----------
you all need help down the right and


---------89:16----------
road if you like need help moving or


---------89:18----------
whatever like let me know I'm happy to


---------89:20----------
help you out you can do Dharma to those


---------89:21----------
individuals yeah but like making their


---------89:25----------
job easy is not your Dharma this is


---------89:27----------
exactly what I mean like Dharma's pretty


---------89:28----------
sim


---------89:29----------
it's your boss's thumb but to make sure


---------89:32----------
that their employees have manageable


---------89:33----------
experiences


---------89:34----------
that's the therm of a boss it's not the


---------89:36----------
thermal of a co-worker okay yeah the


---------89:41----------
kind of puts it into perspective right


---------89:43----------
like it's not your a job to make sure


---------89:45----------
your co-workers have a good experience


---------89:46----------
that's the boss's job yeah like that's


---------89:51----------
the role of a boss like that's the


---------89:52----------
Dharma of a boss if I employ people it's


---------89:57----------
my job to make sure that they don't get


---------89:59----------
overworked it's my job to make sure that


---------90:01----------
they don't that they feel fulfilled it's


---------90:03----------
my job that they feel that that that


---------90:05----------
they feel like they're growing as human


---------90:07----------
beings and like they have a certain


---------90:13----------
basic trauma to treat you treat each


---------90:15----------
other with respect but you don't control


---------90:17----------
like the work environment and the


---------90:19----------
workloads of your coworkers that's not


---------90:20----------
your Dharma okay that can be hard to


---------90:27----------
accept but to me it's pretty simple like


---------90:29----------
you're taking responsibility for things


---------90:31----------
that are not yours that's not your


---------90:34----------
responsibility that makes sense


---------90:40----------
okay okay uh I guess okay yeah I mean I


---------90:49----------
don't know how much more time that you


---------90:51----------
have but well I'd like to get to other


---------90:53----------
questions but if you have like like if


---------90:54----------
you have like a clarifying question or


---------90:56----------
you don't understand by all means ask no


---------90:58----------
I think I think that's good I think I


---------91:00----------
got it okay awesome and thanks for


---------91:02----------
coming on Andrew strong work today all


---------91:05----------
right and you know try to make peace


---------91:08----------
with your inner scar because remember


---------91:10----------
guys there there are some battles that


---------91:12----------
you can't win because those are the


---------91:14----------
battles that you play against you fight


---------91:15----------
against yourself


---------91:17----------
that's a game you can't win when you're


---------91:19----------
playing against yourself so don't do it
