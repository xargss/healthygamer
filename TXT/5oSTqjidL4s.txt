---------00:00----------
it's kind of strange because of the


---------00:02----------
situation that you're describing is is


---------00:04----------
not a great one and yet your mind always


---------00:06----------
turns to things that are positive and


---------00:09----------
inspiring like everything you're saying


---------00:11----------
leads me to believe that you know making


---------00:16----------
a decision like when I think about


---------00:18----------
people who are struggling with decisions


---------00:20----------
I think I don't think about someone who


---------00:21----------
is learning lessons and has great role


---------00:24----------
models and is filled with like love and


---------00:26----------
appreciation for their family


---------00:31----------

---------01:31----------
my mom's Persian my dad's Arabic so okay


---------01:35----------
they taught me the language languages


---------01:38----------
and I taught myself English for the most


---------01:40----------
part from a young age actually it's kind


---------01:44----------
of not I think of it it's kind of a


---------01:46----------
weird trait my family and I share we're


---------01:49----------
like foot like polyglots like my my mom


---------01:52----------
speaks Hindi Persian Arabic English so


---------01:54----------

---------02:19----------
yeah actually when my when my mom speaks


---------02:24----------
over my dad but my parents on they speak


---------02:26----------
to like Indians and Hindi they yeah it's


---------02:31----------
kind of interesting because it's it it


---------02:33----------
you change it depending on what language


---------02:35----------
you speak you don't had bobble when I


---------02:37----------
speak English


---------02:38----------
hmm but when I speak one of the Indian


---------02:41----------
languages that I speak then I had bobble


---------02:43----------
yeah


---------02:44----------
that's a pretty cool thing yeah so yeah


---------02:47----------
yeah my brother also speaks languages I


---------02:49----------
speak and none nobody my family speaks


---------02:54----------
English as well as I do just because I


---------02:55----------
took it upon myself to you know imitate


---------02:58----------
the American accent and all that and


---------03:00----------
watch Hollywood movies etc Arabic


---------03:04----------
actions I can do it Arabic accent in


---------03:06----------
English hello my friends how are you how


---------03:09----------
are you doing I'm afraid the people in


---------03:17----------
the chat would be very confused so no


---------03:20----------
they will they will just think they are


---------03:22----------
what not watching an American dream tell


---------03:30----------
me Java yes yeah yeah yeah yeah so what


---------03:36----------
how can we help


---------03:38----------
so to be honest I actually doing the


---------03:41----------
whole interview in accents no I think I


---------03:44----------
sooo be too hard for me yeah yeah oh yes


---------03:46----------
up to you I think it's gonna be it's


---------03:48----------
gonna be throw me out hard for you


---------03:49----------
that's what she said yeah yeah that's


---------03:52----------
what should I like you already dr. kay


---------03:54----------
but so I I think there's a plethora of


---------03:59----------
things that I want to talk about but


---------04:01----------
since we're limited in time obviously


---------04:02----------
sure I think I think the angle now do


---------04:08----------
you want to talk about eventually is


---------04:10----------
like life just like decision making


---------04:12----------
right now being a 22 year old is gonna


---------04:14----------
graduate next month and figure out what


---------04:17----------
I want to do in life and career-wise but


---------04:19----------
I think it might be better for you to


---------04:21----------
get to know me and get to know kind of


---------04:25----------
my history to know exactly what type of


---------04:28----------
person I am and we'll applies to me I


---------04:30----------
don't know it's up to you I'm not the


---------04:31----------
guy who would be best suited to but if


---------04:34----------
that's what you that's what you think we


---------04:36----------
should do I can do that and then we can


---------04:40----------
get to I think the crux of the matter or


---------04:43----------
in solo mob war okay so tell me a little


---------04:46----------
bit about who you are okay so so yeah um


---------04:52----------
I'm a Muslim I was born obviously like I


---------04:55----------
said in behind and mushiya most someone


---------04:58----------
the minority of Muslims was like 10% I


---------05:00----------
think so yeah sorry I've tried to be


---------05:07----------
organic this is not not planned or


---------05:09----------
anything I don't have anything in mind I


---------05:11----------
just want to like go with the flow we


---------05:12----------
know what I mean so it's harder to be


---------05:15----------
more organized mentally and I don't want


---------05:18----------
to use a lot of filler words there's one


---------05:20----------
thing that I'm practicing right now is


---------05:21----------
not to use AHS and likes and it's hard


---------05:23----------
but I pick up I I blame my American


---------05:26----------
peers for that thing but well I was just


---------05:30----------
gonna say yeah go ahead and go for it no


---------05:32----------
go for it I was gonna say like there's a


---------05:34----------
lot of things that affected me in the


---------05:37----------
past and and my growth personally okay


---------05:40----------
like I guess when you so we'll get right


---------05:43----------
into it I guess


---------05:43----------
okay so I've been mentally and


---------05:46----------
physically abused by my father okay for


---------05:49----------
I would say 15 to 16 years of my life


---------05:55----------
and so 15 to 16 years because it stopped


---------06:01----------
when you left for college or no he said


---------06:04----------
when you were like six I guess I mean


---------06:08----------
started as far as I can remember maybe


---------06:10----------
like when I was three and so I would say


---------06:14----------
if he subtract that I'll be like 13 to


---------06:16----------
12 years


---------06:17----------
so stop them out when I was 15 or 16 and


---------06:21----------
it's not because I went to college it's


---------06:23----------
because he stopped abusing me and my


---------06:25----------
brother so I have three siblings I have


---------06:28----------
an older brother who's two years older


---------06:30----------
than me he's 24 I'm 22 and sister who's


---------06:34----------
17 and a younger brother who's five or


---------06:38----------
six I forget but yeah so yeah my dad was


---------06:43----------
very abusive and I I think it affected


---------06:46----------
my growth it has a way of doing that


---------06:50----------
unfortunately yeah and so this one I


---------06:53----------
think it's one of the reasons I want to


---------06:54----------
leave the country sure but like when I


---------07:00----------
say abuse so usually you know in at


---------07:02----------
least I don't know how similar Indian


---------07:04----------
culture is to Middle Eastern like it's


---------07:06----------
at least Arabic it's because it's a very


---------07:09----------
honor shame culture kind of


---------07:11----------
so so in that sense I think you can


---------07:14----------
compare but you know fathers they want


---------07:18----------
to raise men you know men can be


---------07:20----------
emotional they can you know cry said all


---------07:23----------
that stuff and so yeah I've never seen


---------07:26----------
my dad cry ever in my life and if I did


---------07:29----------
see him cry I would cover his eyes even


---------07:31----------
a funeral or something mm-hmm so I've


---------07:33----------
never seen that side of my dad never


---------07:34----------
seemed like the vulnerable side of my


---------07:36----------
dad and yeah so what a lot of kids like


---------07:44----------
my friends they got hit by their fathers


---------07:46----------
you know just a discipline thing it's


---------07:48----------
like common in the Middle East but the


---------07:51----------
thing is I didn't know that I was being


---------07:53----------
abused so I thought it was normal


---------07:56----------
because I'm a child I've never


---------07:58----------
experienced a life other than the life


---------08:00----------
I'm experiencing right now so as a child


---------08:02----------
there's nothing else I experience to


---------08:03----------
compare it to so when I asked my friend


---------08:05----------
zio does your dad beats you like yeah he


---------08:07----------
does be like okay so I'm not the only


---------08:08----------
one but the thing is he's not beating


---------08:11----------
them with a shovel in the face that's


---------08:13----------
the difference yeah and so or throw a


---------08:16----------
rock in my eye yeah or throw a rock at


---------08:19----------
full speed in my on my freakin skull


---------08:21----------
right I'm surprised I'm not at least to


---------08:23----------
my knowledge I'm not damaged my brain so


---------08:26----------
doesn't seem like it hopefully not but


---------08:32----------
yeah so the abuse got really bad


---------08:37----------
he never hit my mom so I think he knows


---------08:39----------
his limits right like he doesn't hit a


---------08:42----------
woman because like that's like it's a


---------08:44----------
prop


---------08:44----------
he's a very proud man or whatever I I


---------08:46----------
don't hit women etc etc but he's very


---------08:49----------
abusive to her in other ways like


---------08:50----------
vocally so the only source of affection


---------08:55----------
I've ever gone was from my grandma


---------08:58----------
because even or somewhat my mom but both


---------09:01----------
of them were working for the most part


---------09:03----------
and so me my brother were left home with


---------09:07----------
the housemaids that would take care of


---------09:09----------
us


---------09:10----------
and then you know when my dad comes back


---------09:12----------
home it's a gamble whether he's gonna


---------09:14----------
beat us or not if you had a bad day or


---------09:15----------
not so and I would try my best to go to


---------09:19----------
my friends house or whatever to not take


---------09:22----------
the chance you know what I mean if he


---------09:23----------
has a better day


---------09:25----------
and sometimes like the most common way


---------09:27----------
that would cause him to beat us as if


---------09:29----------
just if he's taking a nap and me and my


---------09:31----------
brother like having fun playing a game


---------09:33----------
or something and then we wake him up and


---------09:34----------
eat and that's it we wrapped a Wiccan


---------09:37----------
curse right we're [ __ ]


---------09:38----------
yeah yeah curse away my body um so yeah


---------09:44----------
like it got really bad like like when I


---------09:46----------
say abuse it's not like slapping it in


---------09:47----------
the wrist or whatever it's like like


---------09:49----------
punched in the face full force by a


---------09:51----------
going grown man so and my brother got it


---------09:55----------
worse whatever I got my brother got


---------09:56----------
twice twice as so why is that because he


---------10:02----------
could take it I guess he's so so he's at


---------10:07----------
least when we were younger so since the


---------10:10----------
two years mattered when it comes to our


---------10:11----------
growth when I was like four he was six


---------10:14----------
he was like way taller right now I'm the


---------10:16----------
tallest in the family I'm the I'm the


---------10:18----------
largest I'm even taller than my dad but


---------10:21----------
I think growing up I think that's why


---------10:23----------
because my brother was taller he was


---------10:24----------
more my brother was a more of a brat I


---------10:27----------
was a very nice child I was very quiet


---------10:29----------
very chill I didn't speak a lot and


---------10:32----------
disobey a lot if my dad tell me to do


---------10:34----------
something I'd be like yes sir and I'd do


---------10:35----------
it my brother would be he would make his


---------10:38----------
sighs sounding like like what you say


---------10:39----------
you know what I mean mm-hmm so sorry I'm


---------10:41----------
getting shaky talking about this I don't


---------10:42----------
usually talk about this but what are you


---------10:45----------
feeling sorry shaky like nervous um I


---------10:50----------
don't know like fear is I'm thinking of


---------10:53----------
the past and like the emotions that I


---------10:55----------
used to feel that I dropped away for a


---------10:57----------
long time is that what you're feeling


---------10:59----------
yeah yeah I think motions that I that I


---------11:04----------
trapped that I tried to escape


---------11:07----------
I guess I'm leaving I'm revisiting and


---------11:12----------
so JJ you know it's kind of weird it


---------11:15----------
seems like you were able to tell most of


---------11:17----------
the story about yourself without me it


---------11:21----------
seems like the most emotion that you


---------11:22----------
felt is when you started talking about


---------11:24----------
your brother really yeah I do love my


---------11:27----------
brother I mean do you think things have


---------11:31----------
are you feeling more over the last like


---------11:33----------
let's say 60 seconds or 90 seconds as a


---------11:35----------
as opposed to the first part


---------11:38----------
yeah I'm not sure if it's because of my


---------11:42----------
brother because I'm getting more more


---------11:45----------
more deeper into the into the


---------11:46----------
conversation mm-hmm yeah I'm not


---------11:49----------
shutting it could be


---------11:52----------
I do love my brother I think actually


---------11:56----------
now that you bring it up I always had a


---------11:58----------
soft spot like even if I do something


---------12:00----------
wrong or if my brother does something


---------12:03----------
wrong let's say like he beats me or


---------12:04----------
something I would feel bad cuz I would


---------12:09----------
know if my dad finds out he's gonna kick


---------12:11----------
his ass and so I would try to say like


---------12:13----------
no I just fell or something that's how I


---------12:15----------
got the bruising oh because I didn't


---------12:17----------
want my I don't want my brother to take


---------12:19----------
the fall and getting a beat up for it


---------12:21----------
for it and so a lot of times like even


---------12:23----------
like two of my stitches I got I've been


---------12:26----------
stitched six times not even not on this


---------12:30----------
front from my dad but two of them went


---------12:34----------
for my brother and not because he beat


---------12:36----------
me but because he did an accident like


---------12:39----------
mistake so we're playing hide and seek


---------12:41----------
and I was going up the closet and I want


---------12:45----------
to hide with him in the closet and as


---------12:47----------
out as I was climbing up he was tickling


---------12:48----------
my armpit and then oh yeah I was telling


---------12:55----------
you stop like he I was laughing so hard


---------12:57----------
he wouldn't know I was serious like I'm


---------12:59----------
losing my grip and I'm like stop stop


---------13:01----------
but he wouldn't


---------13:02----------
I was laughing and he thought was funny


---------13:03----------
I end up slipping I felt like full force


---------13:06----------
on my back and then inertia or the


---------13:08----------
momentum like judge over my head back


---------13:10----------
and hit the corner of a wall and then I


---------13:13----------
got stitches in the top of my head


---------13:15----------
that's one that's one way he got me


---------13:18----------
still she's another way he threw like a


---------13:19----------
sharp object but landed in my head that


---------13:22----------
didn't priests my brain thank goodness


---------13:24----------
got stitches because of that but both


---------13:26----------
times my debt to this day does not know


---------13:28----------
the heat caused yes I didn't tell


---------13:30----------
so-and-so yes yeah God sorry I if you


---------13:35----------
let me I will talk forever that's the


---------13:37----------
thing yeah you can stop me yeah I mean


---------13:39----------
do you talk about this stuff often I've


---------13:41----------
only speaking I've only spoken about it


---------13:43----------
once with my therapist okay how long


---------13:47----------
they're pissed


---------13:49----------
of for a year how's that going well this


---------13:53----------
is going pretty well but she she


---------13:56----------
diagnosed me with PTSD which I don't


---------13:59----------
really think I have just because so just


---------14:05----------
fast forwarding like after so going back


---------14:08----------
like my dad


---------14:09----------
he stopped abusing us when he made a


---------14:13----------
friend made a friend but I started


---------14:15----------
talking more to one of his closer


---------14:17----------
friends who's a very religious Muslim


---------14:19----------
and he's known him ever since he was a


---------14:20----------
kid and he was like teaching him to be a


---------14:24----------
better Muslim and like he have two teeth


---------14:27----------
do you have to like treat your family


---------14:29----------
well etc etc and so after that my dad


---------14:31----------
stopped being us um and you know there's


---------14:36----------
two there's two ways one could I guess


---------14:40----------
respond to this one way would be like I


---------14:43----------
don't forgive you dad for what you've


---------14:45----------
done and the other ways like the other


---------14:48----------
ones like I forgive you and I just want


---------14:50----------
to move on and you know have a better


---------14:54----------
relationship with you going on cuz now


---------14:55----------
he's a good father


---------14:56----------
like I don't complain about him he's a


---------14:58----------
good dad


---------15:01----------
so a good dad even when we use abusing


---------15:04----------
you yeah I would say he like good dad


---------15:08----------
not in a sense that he was emotionally


---------15:10----------
available or but he did take care of his


---------15:14----------
family at the end of the day so like he


---------15:16----------
he he the only reason so so like the two


---------15:20----------
responses I said like forgiving him and


---------15:22----------
moving on and not forgiving him that's


---------15:25----------
kind of scrubbing me and my brother I


---------15:26----------
forgave my dad even though my dad never


---------15:29----------
asked for forgiveness


---------15:30----------
I know deep down inside he regrets the


---------15:33----------
things he's done but my brother to this


---------15:36----------
day is not forgiven my dad


---------15:39----------
and so I forgive him because I know my


---------15:46----------
dad has went through the same [ __ ] as we


---------15:48----------
did he has you know what I think we're


---------15:53----------
talking about today what are we talking


---------15:56----------
about I think we're talking about your


---------15:57----------
brother really yeah


---------16:01----------
how do you feel about that um I actually


---------16:10----------
don't know how I feel about that let me


---------16:14----------
ask you something do you do you feel


---------16:16----------
like your brother protected you from


---------16:17----------
your dad yes I can see that yeah yeah my


---------16:24----------
brother's always been there for me like


---------16:26----------
he's he's been a person that I can


---------16:28----------
depend on at all times


---------16:30----------
so he's the type of guy that would drop


---------16:32----------
everything to to help help his family


---------16:36----------
out especially me my mother he's like


---------16:38----------
he's like the second in charge basically


---------16:41----------
so it sounds like you in a lot of ways


---------16:44----------
your your brother is what a dad is


---------16:46----------
supposed to be yeah true yeah


---------16:55----------
yeah he was like I'm so I'm very close


---------16:58----------
to my brother actually before I came to


---------17:00----------
his call was talking to him asking like


---------17:02----------
what's up back home you know how how are


---------17:03----------
you doing cuz he just he just finished


---------17:05----------
his master's degree he got his degree


---------17:06----------
yesterday so it's congratulating him and


---------17:08----------
all that so how's he doing he's doing


---------17:11----------
well so far there's a lot of things


---------17:15----------
going on back home they are not good and


---------17:19----------
so he has to take care of that mm-hmm


---------17:22----------
I've been stressed well this is gonna


---------17:28----------
switch gears real fast but my mom's


---------17:32----------
recently found out that my dad's been


---------17:35----------
cheating on her for the past 10 years so


---------17:40----------
she wants to get a divorce and and she's


---------17:45----------
been emotionally like broken


---------17:47----------
and my brother has to be there for her


---------17:50----------
etcetera


---------17:51----------
she's like doing very she thought very


---------17:54----------
negative she like she had negative


---------17:56----------
thoughts like maple most suicidal etc


---------17:58----------
and my brother I'm like yo like you


---------17:59----------
gotta like be there for her etcetera


---------18:01----------
etcetera so it he has more things to


---------18:03----------
worry about because he wants to get a


---------18:04----------
job because my family's financially


---------18:08----------
struggling because of all this and I'm


---------18:12----------
not getting any college I'm not getting


---------18:15----------

---------18:18----------
like my mom's taking out loans to to


---------18:20----------
support me coming here yeah so my


---------18:26----------
brother is very stressed but you know I


---------18:29----------
know he can handle it and yeah that's


---------18:33----------
how he did that's he's he's fine


---------18:35----------
I'm just he's just worried more about my


---------18:37----------
we were both worried more about my


---------18:39----------
mother than ourselves really haha


---------18:41----------
because like our mom is like very very


---------18:43----------
very important for us to us yeah I'm


---------18:49----------
gonna just think for a second is that


---------18:50----------
okay JJ yeah of course so I mean I I'm


---------18:57----------
gonna just start tossing stuff out so I


---------18:59----------
I think you know you you mentioned that


---------19:01----------
you're looking for guidance about what


---------19:03----------
to do after you finish college mm-hmm


---------19:06----------
I think we're talking about your brother


---------19:08----------
I think we're talking about his


---------19:11----------
capability that you know he's capable I


---------19:13----------
think we're talking a little bit about


---------19:14----------
you shirking your responsibilities by


---------19:17----------
letting him handle things I think we're


---------19:20----------
talking about whether you should go back


---------19:22----------
or whether you should stay whether you


---------19:24----------
should prioritize your own career we're


---------19:26----------
talking about whether you should put


---------19:27----------
your life ahead of your families and


---------19:30----------
we're talking about your guilt in terms


---------19:33----------
of letting your brother handle what


---------19:35----------
maybe you're a big man enough to handle


---------19:37----------
now are we talking about mm-hmm exactly


---------19:43----------
about that yeah so right now my dad is


---------19:49----------
pressuring me to find a job in the US


---------19:53----------
and initially so


---------19:56----------
I'm taking an extra semester so this is


---------19:58----------
I was supposed to graduate in May mm-hmm


---------20:00----------
but I took an extra semester to minor in


---------20:03----------
business because I didn't know what I


---------20:06----------
want to do and it seemed like everything


---------20:07----------
was moving too too quickly and I didn't


---------20:09----------
have a chance to make it choice whether


---------20:11----------
if I want to go back home or stay here


---------20:15----------
and so since I had a student visa and


---------20:17----------
it's hard to obtain um I was like I'll


---------20:20----------
take advantage of it and and take an


---------20:24----------
extra semester mm-hmm so I don't know


---------20:27----------
what I want to do because everybody's


---------20:29----------
advising me even my mom my brother boy


---------20:31----------
something like stay there get a career


---------20:33----------
jobs are harder to get or good jobs are


---------20:37----------
hard to get in the Middle East


---------20:38----------
it's full of nepotism and all that stuff


---------20:40----------
and so I'm like stuck I'm like in a rut


---------20:48----------
yep so I can I like


---------20:51----------
there's a lot of there's also selfish


---------20:53----------
reasons for me to go back home like I'll


---------20:54----------
admit like it's gonna be more


---------20:56----------
comfortable for me because I'm my


---------20:59----------
country a small country I know


---------21:01----------
everything about it I'm getting more


---------21:02----------
comfortable in it my friends are there


---------21:04----------
our girlfriends there you know and so


---------21:10----------
it's easier for me just to go back home


---------21:12----------
and get a degree in like hey you know


---------21:14----------
tell tell people or employers I studied


---------21:17----------
in the u.s. I'm an asset to your company


---------21:19----------
asset etc another option B is for me to


---------21:24----------
stay here like everybody telling me to


---------21:25----------
because there's a better opportunities


---------21:28----------
for me and even if I'd like my dad says


---------21:34----------
even or my brother both of them are


---------21:35----------
saying even if I don't end up living in


---------21:38----------
the u.s. at least working for a year or


---------21:40----------
two is gonna help my resume immensely


---------21:42----------
going back they'll have the


---------21:46----------
international experience basically you


---------21:48----------
know so


---------21:50----------
that's that's where I'm stuck I'm


---------21:52----------
looking for jobs I've been applying I


---------21:55----------
should got response today from one of


---------21:58----------
the careers and so like my major is


---------22:01----------
computer information systems so it's


---------22:03----------
like a lot of coding and stuff with some


---------22:05----------
business on the side but the thing is


---------22:08----------
I'm not passionate about programming I'm


---------22:10----------
good at it but I just don't like doing


---------22:11----------
okay and you know so that's something


---------22:14----------
I'm struggling with as well so JJ I mean


---------22:18----------
I I think like I mean we can talk about


---------22:21----------
computer information systems in your


---------22:22----------
career and all that stuff as much as you


---------22:24----------
want to I don't think that's why you're


---------22:25----------
coming here today mm-hmm I think I think


---------22:28----------
what we're talking about today is


---------22:30----------
selfishness versus sacrifice mmm-hmm and


---------22:33----------
I think we're talking about your


---------22:34----------
struggle about whether you should go or


---------22:36----------
whether you should stay and and who gets


---------22:39----------
helped and who gets left behind


---------22:42----------
yeah so fill that in like I'm just


---------22:45----------
tossing out words right I'm tossing out


---------22:48----------
like themes but I don't know I think


---------22:52----------
you're way forward and I don't know if


---------22:53----------
twitch chat is gonna understand like


---------22:55----------
what what I mean by that


---------22:57----------
it's clear to me that you understand


---------22:58----------
what we mean by that I just don't know


---------23:00----------
if we've laid things out and Twitch's


---------23:02----------
following along or if it's just like too


---------23:04----------
vague mm-hmm okay so so yeah tell us


---------23:10----------
about that fill in the gaps for us so if


---------23:12----------
I go back home I'll be able to this


---------23:21----------
summer I worked part time I went back


---------23:24----------
home the past summer I worked back home


---------23:27----------
as a videographer that's my passion I


---------23:29----------
like doing video stuff video editing and


---------23:31----------
all that and so I worked part time and


---------23:33----------
my boss offered me a full time so if I


---------23:35----------
go back home now I will get a job that's


---------23:38----------
not an issue and I can like my mom will


---------23:41----------
feel like some weight off her shoulders


---------23:43----------
because she knows she doesn't have to


---------23:45----------
financially support me being away and my


---------23:48----------
sister who was studying in the Emirates


---------23:51----------
she wants to be a dentist she's also


---------23:54----------
like my mom is telling her her jewelry


---------23:56----------
and all that just so she can support my


---------23:58----------
sister right now and so if I leave if I


---------24:01----------
graduate and go back home that's one


---------24:03----------
less person she


---------24:04----------
financial support and that's gonna help


---------24:06----------
pearl a ton and I can get money and I


---------24:09----------
can work and I can pay off her help her


---------24:12----------
pay off her loans and debts right that's


---------24:15----------
that's one thing I can do for my family


---------24:17----------
if I stay here that means I will still


---------24:21----------
need more financial support even if I


---------24:23----------
graduate it doesn't I'm not gonna get it


---------24:26----------
immediately once I start working I might


---------24:29----------
even just get an internship and unpaid


---------24:31----------
internship by still thinking you know


---------24:36----------
SUNY [ __ ] all that I'm sorry we just


---------24:39----------
cut out there for a second keep going


---------24:41----------
yeah so what was it was last thing you


---------24:43----------
heard economic so so you you were saying


---------24:47----------
something about even if you stay here


---------24:48----------
you're gonna need some degree of


---------24:49----------
financial support and then I didn't


---------24:51----------
catch the details around that yeah so


---------24:53----------
I'm still gonna need financial support


---------24:54----------
because I might get an unpaid internship


---------24:57----------
position so I will still need support


---------25:02----------
from from my family to get an apartment


---------25:03----------
and all that for the duration of the


---------25:06----------
internship okay and then like you can't


---------25:10----------
get a paying job because getting a visa


---------25:13----------
that's what yeah gotcha


---------25:16----------
never mind okay yes but go ahead yeah


---------25:19----------
and so if I getting an unpaid internship


---------25:23----------
and the longer means I'll get a visa


---------25:25----------
from the company and followed up by a


---------25:27----------
full-time position that's a less risky


---------25:33----------
route for me even if I have to get some


---------25:36----------
financial support early for the for the


---------25:38----------
duration of the internship which is


---------25:39----------
probably three months but it's also a


---------25:44----------
risk in a sense because I don't know how


---------25:46----------
guaranteed a full-time position will


---------25:48----------
follow up after yet but it's still gonna


---------25:51----------
be good for my resume I think it's a


---------25:52----------
win-win situation if I get the


---------25:54----------
internship I get the work visa I still


---------25:57----------
have I can make connections I can have


---------25:58----------
it in my resume and I can go back home


---------26:01----------
with with with a powerful resume so


---------26:05----------
that's that's sacrifice if I stay here


---------26:08----------
it means I'm sacrificing the the like


---------26:11----------
helping my family out by being there for


---------26:14----------
them


---------26:15----------
I can I can drive


---------26:18----------
back home that means I can help my mom


---------26:20----------
and get her stuff she doesn't have to go


---------26:21----------
drive around everywhere I can do a lot


---------26:24----------
of things by being there physically and


---------26:26----------
getting a job there but it's not gonna


---------26:29----------
be the best career choice for me


---------26:32----------
personally okay that's better trade off


---------26:36----------
so you mentioned your mom is financially


---------26:39----------
supporting you does your dad work


---------26:41----------
my dad had retired might have had a


---------26:44----------
successful career and he retired very


---------26:46----------
early he retired when he was 40 he's 50


---------26:50----------
something he thought I was 43 even


---------26:52----------
though he had more opportunities to make


---------26:54----------
a lot of money but continued to work and


---------26:57----------
he chose not to because he values he


---------27:01----------
says he values his life and he wants to


---------27:02----------
do the things he wants to do which is


---------27:04----------
which it seems to be fishing every


---------27:06----------
weekend and going fishing and every


---------27:08----------
weekend but what he's been doing


---------27:10----------
recently he built a an apartment


---------27:14----------
building so he's at Landlord now but he


---------27:18----------
took a lot of loans for that from his


---------27:20----------
friends and from the bank and now and


---------27:22----------
now he has some tenants and he's


---------27:26----------
currently working on paying loans back


---------27:30----------
I'm just a little bit confused about you


---------27:33----------
you talk about your mom and dad as if


---------27:35----------
they're separate financial units they


---------27:37----------
are yeah that's the issue


---------27:40----------
my mom always support my mom works at a


---------27:42----------
bank she works in HSBC and she always


---------27:46----------
she was like the the backbone of our


---------27:49----------
house she would support the house by


---------27:51----------
bringing food every week I'm in


---------27:54----------
groceries and all that she supported us


---------27:57----------
in school because my dad didn't want us


---------28:00----------
to go to private school he want us to go


---------28:01----------
to public school my mom was like no I


---------28:02----------
think private will be better and he's


---------28:04----------
like okay if you wanna do that he could


---------28:05----------
have to pay for for the private school


---------28:08----------
she's like fine and she did it and so it


---------28:11----------
seems yeah so my mom is a hell of a


---------28:14----------
woman she's amazing so she she has been


---------28:20----------
supporting abandoning was her must be


---------28:22----------
hard yes that's very hard and she's she


---------28:26----------
I feel bad because I'm helpless


---------28:29----------
in case of helping her financially I


---------28:33----------
want to be successful nor to help to get


---------28:35----------
her like the car she wants or whatever


---------28:37----------
she wants you know because she's been in


---------28:40----------
her entire life if I mean we don't have


---------28:41----------
time for talking about her life but her


---------28:45----------
entire life has been a sacrifice like


---------28:47----------
she's been sacrificing the sake of her


---------28:48----------
own family her parents financially and


---------28:51----------
then now for her kids she never had time


---------28:53----------
for her own how do you feel about that I


---------28:56----------
feel sad yeah every time like I I pray


---------29:01----------
like my Muslim prayers I like pray for


---------29:03----------
her all the time


---------29:05----------
so she's she deserves a lot and you know


---------29:08----------
what bothers me what it really annoys me


---------29:10----------
like when we talk about religion she's


---------29:12----------
like I don't know if I'm if I'm gonna go


---------29:14----------
to heaven like I might go to hell who


---------29:15----------
knows I'm like mom if you're gonna go to


---------29:17----------
hell there's no way I'm gonna go to


---------29:19----------
heaven so give me a chance you know tell


---------29:21----------
me you're gonna go to heaven just so I


---------29:23----------
can think I can get a chance to go there


---------29:25----------
because there's no I get to go to heaven


---------29:27----------
and you get to go to hell God has done


---------29:30----------
something wrong I mean we have to switch


---------29:31----------
places you know what I mean like so yeah


---------29:34----------
she's an angel


---------29:36----------
so she's supporting i yeah she's


---------29:40----------
supporting me financially she works at a


---------29:41----------
bank she's still the only working person


---------29:43----------
in the family and she's very stressed


---------29:47----------
like she's a good boss and she's she's a


---------29:49----------
good and she works well she doesn't


---------29:51----------
she's good at her job but it's taxing on


---------29:53----------
her cuz I see her working every night


---------29:55----------
from home


---------29:56----------
she's like a workaholic and like she has


---------30:01----------
the things are on her eyes to black and


---------30:03----------
I don't know blackness on her eyes


---------30:05----------
showing it she never gets sleep she


---------30:07----------
sleeps like three four hours a day she's


---------30:09----------
always tired so she yeah so she


---------30:16----------
financially supports me and she and my


---------30:18----------
dad's also has been taking money from


---------30:20----------
her as well okay I gave me this money


---------30:22----------
for I need it for the building and I'll


---------30:24----------
pay you back and sometimes he doesn't


---------30:25----------
pay back and it gets annoying with my


---------30:27----------
mom my dad lucky I'm doing it for the


---------30:30----------
family cetera cetera so


---------30:36----------
with the whole I feel really angry


---------30:38----------
because I feel like my dad can be very


---------30:43----------
hypocritical so like I don't understand


---------30:46----------
how when you changed to be a better


---------30:48----------
father you couldn't change to be a


---------30:50----------
better husband and you still maintain to


---------30:52----------
cheat on my mom after you changed right


---------30:56----------
I don't understand that


---------30:57----------
um so dad sounds like quite the [ __ ]


---------31:00----------
yeah but he's very wise like he's a good


---------31:04----------
like my dad is a wise he's very wise he


---------31:08----------
like he some of the life lessons I like


---------31:11----------
I remember him teaching me things that I


---------31:13----------
still remember to this day like what for


---------31:16----------
instance


---------31:17----------
we were in the car one day and my dad


---------31:22----------
asked me it's like I was like eight or


---------31:24----------
nine and he asked me like do you want to


---------31:25----------
be what do you wanna be in life and I


---------31:29----------
said I want to be a millionaire you know


---------31:30----------
I want to have a lot of money and he's


---------31:33----------
like how do you want to do that and I


---------31:36----------
said I don't know I'm gonna make the


---------31:38----------
best video game ever


---------31:39----------
or something like that I forgot the


---------31:40----------
answer and he says look at the building


---------31:42----------
like we're driving he's very he loves


---------31:44----------
teaching by examples and metaphors and


---------31:46----------
he likes he likes asking questions


---------31:50----------
rather than teaching me something like


---------31:51----------
this is how you do something he'd like


---------31:54----------
to ask me a question making and he makes


---------31:56----------
me ponder like wow I see what you mean


---------31:58----------
so he's like you see this building like


---------32:00----------
yeah it's like how do you get to the


---------32:01----------
roof do you just fly up to the roof and


---------32:03----------
he's like and I was like no what do you


---------32:06----------
do is like you take the stairs or you


---------32:07----------
take the elevator you go step by step


---------32:08----------
it's like exactly so don't think about


---------32:11----------
life the way your thing like oh I'm just


---------32:13----------
gonna make a video game and I'm gonna be


---------32:14----------
rich that's not how life works you got


---------32:16----------
to take the stairs it's gonna be tiring


---------32:18----------
especially if it's a like a tall


---------32:20----------
building like the one you were asking


---------32:22----------
what millionaire is not an easy task and


---------32:24----------
so that's one of the things I remember


---------32:26----------
another thing do you think he'd mind the


---------32:28----------
stairs yes he my dad has a had a


---------32:33----------
terrible life I would say and this is


---------32:35----------
one of the things what one of the


---------32:37----------
choices


---------32:38----------
remember I said I chose to forgive


---------32:41----------
forgive my dad even though he didn't ask


---------32:42----------
for forgiveness the only reason I was


---------32:44----------
able to forgive my dad it's because my


---------32:47----------
mom told me about his upbringing


---------32:49----------
and his upbringing was very bad so like


---------32:53----------
his dad married three women not at the


---------32:55----------
same time


---------32:56----------
first one passed away very early and so


---------32:59----------
he married another woman shortly after


---------33:02----------
she had a lot of kids and she died as


---------33:05----------
well giving birth to her last child and


---------33:08----------
then he made my my direct grandma and


---------33:11----------
they had a lot of kids so my his father


---------33:15----------
was about his 60s when my when my dad


---------33:18----------
was born hmm and he was very sick and so


---------33:21----------
my dad didn't have a father figure all


---------33:24----------
right


---------33:24----------
he never had a father figure and he had


---------33:26----------
older brothers so when he was born he


---------33:28----------
had brothers that were like in their 20s


---------33:29----------
and so those are the ones who are taking


---------33:32----------
care of him and they would beat the crap


---------33:33----------
out of him so this like as bad as he


---------33:38----------
would beat us so they would hang him on


---------33:40----------
a ceiling fan like a pinata and smack


---------33:42----------
him that's how that's how bad he got


---------33:44----------
some fact as a kid and so he he's a he's


---------33:47----------
a my dad is a very handy man like that


---------33:50----------
his his family was dirt poor he would go


---------33:56----------
to the bike repair shop and look at the


---------33:59----------
garbage in the bike repair shop and get


---------34:01----------
like pieces like spare parts for the


---------34:04----------
bike and make his own bike on his own he


---------34:06----------
would learn on his own hmm see so he can


---------34:09----------
anything he can throw at him he can fix


---------34:11----------
car engine boat engine air conditioning


---------34:14----------
whatever so he was his survival he was a


---------34:17----------
survivalist and that's why he became


---------34:18----------
successful because he was the only one


---------34:20----------
who finished school from his you have a


---------34:24----------
lot of positive things to say about


---------34:25----------
everyone in your family yeah how do you


---------34:29----------
feel about yourself uh


---------34:35----------
can't catch a break Oh like the abuse


---------34:41----------
when I was a kid and then I was also


---------34:46----------
very obese as a child I was very fat I


---------34:50----------
lost most of my weight back in I was 250


---------34:53----------
50 pounds yeah


---------34:56----------
haiji I got to 20 2015 I used to walk


---------35:01----------
every day for half an hour or two an


---------35:04----------
hour and just eat better so mixing sound


---------35:09----------
office this is my sound okay hello I can


---------35:12----------
hear you fine okay yeah I'm not sure so


---------35:17----------
we'll see but so so you feel you say you


---------35:20----------
can't catch a break like in what way


---------35:22----------
like I don't feel like like all my life


---------35:26----------
I've been stressed I don't feel like an


---------35:27----------
i I've ever felt like relaxed or content


---------35:31----------
with where I with where I was like I'm


---------35:37----------
going through a hair loss right now my


---------35:40----------
dad is bald so I'm guessing his genetic


---------35:42----------
but he lost his hair he started losing


---------35:44----------
his hair in his 30s I started losing my


---------35:46----------
hair when I was 18 when I'm when I came


---------35:48----------
here for college okay and so and I'm


---------35:53----------
sure you know the concept of halal food


---------35:55----------
right like kosher halal I don't have any


---------35:57----------
halal food here to enter the chat if


---------35:59----------
they're confused halal food is basically


---------36:01----------
permissible food for Muslims and so


---------36:05----------
there's not any halal meat here in


---------36:06----------
college so I became like a vegetarian


---------36:10----------
almost I just eat salads every day I was


---------36:12----------
very malnourished when it comes to


---------36:14----------
proteins and stuff and so my hair loss


---------36:16----------
is accelerating and that that really


---------36:19----------
like hurt my self-image because I


---------36:24----------
stopped the care and I still like be


---------36:25----------
proud to take care of my hair and all


---------36:27----------
that and I'm losing it


---------36:29----------
but at this point I really don't care


---------36:31----------
like about my hair like you know I sew


---------36:35----------
so I'm okay hold on let me just I'm


---------36:38----------
sorry if I'm all over the place I don't


---------36:39----------
know it's not sure it's not your fault


---------36:42----------
so I think um so first let me tell you


---------36:45----------
what I'm seeing


---------36:46----------
okay so like you painted me a picture


---------36:48----------
that is over


---------36:48----------
only positive and loving right so like


---------36:52----------
you're talking about the sort of


---------36:53----------
desperate situation but when I hear you


---------36:55----------
talk you're smiling a lot you're talking


---------36:57----------
about how inspiring and sacrificing your


---------37:00----------
mom is how inspiring and and wise your


---------37:03----------
dad is you're talking about how awesome


---------37:04----------
your brother is you know it's kind of


---------37:09----------
strange because of the situation that


---------37:11----------
you're describing is is not a great one


---------37:13----------
and yet your mind always turns to things


---------37:15----------
that are positive and inspiring like


---------37:18----------
everything you're saying leads me to


---------37:21----------
believe that you know making a decision


---------37:24----------
like when I think about people who are


---------37:27----------
struggling with decisions I think I


---------37:28----------
don't think about someone who is


---------37:30----------
learning lessons and has great role


---------37:33----------
models and is filled with like love and


---------37:34----------
appreciation for their family that


---------37:37----------
usually leads to sort of some sense of


---------37:40----------
security or direction in life and yet


---------37:44----------
you're talking about positivity like


---------37:45----------
even I mean you're kind of saying you


---------37:48----------
kind of say like oh I'm angry with my


---------37:49----------
dad and then when I kind of reflect that


---------37:51----------
back to you I kind of say like he kind


---------37:53----------
of sounds like an [ __ ] like your mom


---------37:54----------
is working double shifts and supporting


---------37:56----------
you and he's out fishing and taking


---------37:58----------
loans from everyone including your mom


---------38:00----------
and then when I call him an [ __ ]


---------38:02----------
what's your response


---------38:04----------
do you remember honey I try to empathize


---------38:07----------
you say he's a really wise man and and


---------38:12----------
on the surface I think it sounds like


---------38:14----------
really saintly for you to forgive your


---------38:16----------
dad right it sounds like the kind of


---------38:18----------
thing that your mom would do and and I'm


---------38:23----------
just not getting like any negativity


---------38:25----------
from you but your life should be full of


---------38:27----------
negativity I feel like the negative


---------38:33----------
thing right now or there's two things if


---------38:36----------
I there's another gonna take a turn but


---------38:40----------
there's two things right if I didn't


---------38:42----------
think the abuse I was getting was normal


---------38:46----------
because I thought it was normal because


---------38:47----------
sometimes half my face will be purple


---------38:50----------
because of the smacking you'll get right


---------38:52----------
if I did the thing I was normal now as I


---------38:54----------
was getting abused I would probably not


---------38:56----------
be alive today


---------38:57----------
like that's just being serious I thought


---------38:59----------
was normal I didn't know it was


---------39:02----------
I was being abused I don't know I


---------39:03----------
thought I was going through this so I'll


---------39:05----------
just be a [ __ ] if I you know thought


---------39:08----------
about suicide whatever right and so that


---------39:12----------
lets just me being real and that's how


---------39:14----------
it was as a kid not mean looking back


---------39:19----------
when I went to therapy yeah


---------39:21----------
so I'm gonna jump in right there mm-hmm


---------39:24----------
so like I'm mentioning to you that you


---------39:28----------
seem to be like very inspiring and


---------39:30----------
positive despite this very difficult


---------39:32----------
situation and you say that it's


---------39:35----------
difficult but I'm not hearing you use


---------39:38----------
the language of difficulty everything is


---------39:40----------
like about growth and learning and


---------39:43----------
wisdom and sacrifice and then when I ask


---------39:48----------
you that the for some reason your mind


---------39:50----------
goes to if I didn't know I was in such a


---------39:53----------
bad situation


---------39:54----------
or if I knew I was in such a bad


---------39:56----------
situation then I may have become


---------39:58----------
suicidal but I thought it was normal so


---------40:00----------
like that's kind of a weird thing to say


---------40:01----------
in response to what I'm pointing out to


---------40:04----------
you so why do you think you said that I


---------40:05----------
I think that was a precursor to what -


---------40:09----------
to what - yeah so like the second part I


---------40:14----------
was gonna say like right now I feel very


---------40:16----------
like me thinking about the past and the


---------40:19----------
things that I went through it's kind of


---------40:23----------
affecting me right now because I feel


---------40:24----------
like I blocked that part up like of my


---------40:27----------
life off and then now it's coming it's


---------40:29----------
rushing to me like a flood yeah


---------40:32----------
sometimes I would cry like when I would


---------40:34----------
sleep or I dream about my dad beating me


---------40:36----------
things like that which I some things I


---------40:39----------
didn't experience ever I have insomnia


---------40:43----------
so I can't sleep without the TV being on


---------40:46----------
yes something like I struggle with


---------40:48----------
I'm very lethargic now especially my


---------40:50----------
last my last semester I feel like very


---------40:54----------
lazy and I just want to get a job and


---------40:56----------
just I don't want to study anymore it's


---------40:58----------
like yeah yeah so like this is kind of


---------41:01----------
weird so like I don't know how to


---------41:05----------
explain this to you but you know


---------41:12----------
jay-j like you should have rage in your


---------41:14----------
heart you should have like frustration


---------41:19----------
and anger in disappointment I think you


---------41:24----------
have guilt


---------41:24----------
I think guilt is the only thing you've


---------41:26----------
got that's the only thing I'm really


---------41:27----------
picking up from you but there should be


---------41:31----------
a lot of other stuff mm-hmm like your


---------41:35----------
understand that your dad so I think it's


---------41:37----------
a very mature outlook to have to


---------41:42----------
recognize with him and also like do you


---------41:45----------
forgive him for what he did for it to


---------41:47----------
your mom you know how do you feel about


---------41:51----------
that I'm very mad about that and he


---------41:55----------
doesn't know that I know see my dad my


---------42:00----------
dad really loves his kids and he cares


---------42:03----------
about what we think about him yeah he's


---------42:08----------
a very proud man yep he I cannot be


---------42:10----------
never like even when I argue with him or


---------42:13----------
debate with him about the religious


---------42:15----------
topic or whatever political topic Lusaka


---------42:17----------
chol he doesn't like losing and he


---------42:20----------
doesn't admit when he loses and he tries


---------42:21----------
to I don't say he loses often I keep I


---------42:25----------
think I think he loves you guys but I it


---------42:27----------
sounds to me like he's quite


---------42:28----------
narcissistic yes yes very much so and so


---------42:32----------
my my he doesn't want he doesn't want


---------42:34----------
and he has a special place in his heart


---------42:37----------
for me out of all of his kids my mom


---------42:39----------
told me this because he feels like out


---------42:43----------
ever since I was a child I was obedient


---------42:45----------
one like I mentioned earlier I was a


---------42:46----------
beating I would say yes sir


---------42:48----------
and so he doesn't want me to know that


---------42:50----------
side of him he doesn't want to know the


---------42:51----------
cheating side of him like he would he


---------42:53----------
would Gary I'm gonna jump in okay let me


---------42:56----------
ask you something what what do you what


---------42:59----------
do you think is the right thing to do


---------43:02----------
for my mom know divorce him what is what


---------43:05----------
is the right thing for you to do in your


---------43:07----------
life take care of my mom okay


---------43:12----------
in what way I want her to does that mean


---------43:17----------
staying or going she


---------43:21----------
wants me to stay that's not what I asked


---------43:23----------
I don't know how I can help let me ask


---------43:28----------
you this so everyone is telling you that


---------43:30----------
staying is the right thing to do right


---------43:32----------
what would your dad do in your situation


---------43:36----------
who would stay that's why it's hard for


---------43:39----------
you that's why it's hard for you because


---------43:43----------
your mom is telling you don't come back


---------43:47----------
establish yourself and then you can help


---------43:49----------
me


---------43:49----------
your brother is saying I can handle [ __ ]


---------43:52----------
and you feel filled with guilt because


---------43:54----------
you're leaving him to pick up the pieces


---------43:55----------
because he's the one who takes the blows


---------43:58----------
right he's the one who takes the blows


---------44:00----------
for you so he's saying I can help out


---------44:02----------
mom you see he's stressed you she sees


---------44:04----------
she's stressed and he's doing the thing


---------44:06----------
that he's always done for you which is


---------44:08----------
like tank


---------44:10----------
he's the tank your mom is saying you


---------44:13----------
should stay and you want to go and the


---------44:18----------
thing that I think it makes it really


---------44:20----------
hard you're telling me that objectively


---------44:22----------
the right move is to stay for your


---------44:23----------
career I think the reason that you can't


---------44:26----------
bring yourself to stay is because that's


---------44:28----------
what your [ __ ] dad would do that's


---------44:32----------
the problem and so like if you stay you


---------44:36----------
become him and you can say as much as


---------44:38----------
you want to about him being wise but


---------44:40----------
like I don't think you want to be him he


---------44:42----------
is the last person on this world that


---------44:43----------
you want to be like you know you once


---------44:47----------
told me that like you know you earlier


---------44:49----------
said that like your mom is worried about


---------44:51----------
going to hell and you were kind of


---------44:52----------
saying if you go to hell then I don't


---------44:56----------
know I have no chance of getting into


---------44:57----------
heaven and I think that there's like a


---------44:59----------
there's like a flipside of that which is


---------45:01----------
like you don't think your dad should go


---------45:02----------
to heaven no I think my dad should go to


---------45:07----------
heaven okay


---------45:08----------
I I don't wish hell on anybody and this


---------45:11----------
is gonna sound like this is gonna sound


---------45:13----------
like very controversial but I don't even


---------45:17----------
wish hell on Hitler even though like cuz


---------45:20----------
no I I think that makes sense yeah hell


---------45:23----------
is eternal punishment yeah III think on


---------45:26----------
balance you can it's completely


---------45:29----------
reasonable and I think you can be a


---------45:30----------
person that really doesn't want to wish


---------45:32----------
ill on anyone


---------45:34----------
and at the same time I think there's a


---------45:36----------
part of you that wishes that there's a


---------45:40----------
lot of negativity towards your dad


---------45:42----------
mm-hmm and I I think that this this


---------45:46----------
really comes down to like you don't want


---------45:48----------
to be if he ends up in heaven you want


---------45:50----------
to be in hell like it's like the flip of


---------45:53----------
your mom and I I sense that current and


---------45:56----------
you and I think the problem here is that


---------45:58----------
it's it's like buried beneath so much


---------46:00----------
like positivity and it's it's buried but


---------46:03----------
beneath a lot of compassion and it's


---------46:05----------
buried beneath a lot of maturity but I


---------46:08----------
think it's there like I find it hard to


---------46:10----------
believe that that it's not there I think


---------46:16----------
give me a second let me let me like it


---------46:18----------
dig into my because I I'm bad at at like


---------46:23----------
realizing my emotions I think that I


---------46:29----------
really do love my dad I think you do too


---------46:32----------
and part of my brain is saying you


---------46:36----------
shouldn't because of the things he's


---------46:38----------
done to you and it is doing to your mom


---------46:40----------
right but I don't feel it yeah so here's


---------46:46----------
the problem


---------46:47----------
it's not that you shouldn't it's that


---------46:50----------
you should feel other things as well so


---------46:54----------
I think the problem is that your


---------46:55----------
feelings are one dimensional like the


---------46:58----------
question that I have for you JJ is do


---------47:00----------
you hate your dad no can you love and


---------47:04----------
hate someone yes so then the question


---------47:09----------
becomes why don't you hate your dad I


---------47:12----------
think it's because I've only seen one


---------47:16----------
side of him like like two sides of him


---------47:19----------
right one side is him being very abusive


---------47:21----------
and that's the side that I blocked for


---------47:24----------
most of my life after that in a sec and


---------47:26----------
the second side of is him being a very


---------47:29----------
very good father to me this is the side


---------47:32----------
that I want you to think about for a


---------47:33----------
second the side that act that side that


---------47:36----------
tells your mom if you want our kids to


---------47:38----------
go to private school you [ __ ] pay for


---------47:40----------
it and then the side that tells your mom


---------47:42----------
hey I need some money for the business


---------47:43----------
this is for the family and then he


---------47:45----------
doesn't give it back


---------47:46----------
how do


---------47:47----------
feel about that guy I feel very angry


---------47:49----------
about that guy do you hate that guy


---------47:52----------
yeah it doesn't like it doesn't it


---------47:54----------
doesn't go with the guy I see and that's


---------47:57----------
the problem right I hear stories about


---------47:59----------
him I hate their stories about him I


---------48:01----------
don't I don't see him doing the axe


---------48:04----------
because I can only have one type of


---------48:06----------
relationship with my father and that's


---------48:07----------
fathered a son I don't have a wife to


---------48:09----------
husband relationship with my father


---------48:11----------
obviously because I'm nice wife but you


---------48:13----------
know I can't yeah just his son so the


---------48:15----------
way he talks to me is different than we


---------48:16----------
talks to my mom and so I only hear from


---------48:19----------
my mom and I feel angry and I empathize


---------48:21----------
with her but then when I went on goes on


---------48:24----------
I go I'm back to squirm which is I love


---------48:27----------
my dad yeah so I think that you have to


---------48:30----------
understand the negativity like the thing


---------48:32----------
that's buried here and the thing that's


---------48:34----------
hard for you I think is the absence of


---------48:35----------
negativity you feel some degree of guilt


---------48:38----------
but like I think at the end of the day


---------48:40----------
you know you've got to first of all


---------48:42----------
understand that like the reason that you


---------48:43----------
don't want to stay is because that's


---------48:45----------
what your dad would do because that


---------48:47----------
feels like the wrong thing but like


---------48:49----------
you've got to come to terms with that


---------48:51----------
and that it may not be just because it's


---------48:53----------
what your dad do doesn't mean that it's


---------48:55----------
the wrong thing but I think the reason


---------48:57----------
it feels like the wrong thing is because


---------48:58----------
it's what your dad would do like you


---------49:01----------
have to understand that staying doesn't


---------49:03----------
mean becoming your dad mm-hmm yeah I I


---------49:09----------
do I do not want to be like my dad so


---------49:14----------
and I told my mom this like when she had


---------49:16----------
my baby brother I was this was yeah I


---------49:21----------
was like 16 17 just right when the abuse


---------49:24----------
stopped and like I told I told my mom I


---------49:28----------
never if I ever had kids I never want to


---------49:32----------
hit them ever because I know how how


---------49:37----------
that feels right now said I don't think


---------49:39----------
I said emotion I'll ever forget and so


---------49:43----------
my brother was born I made a vow to


---------49:45----------
myself to never hit him I'm the only one


---------49:47----------
in the household who's never hit him


---------49:49----------
even my mom like I said I don't mean


---------49:52----------
like he's been like if you used like


---------49:53----------
he's like smack in the hand or the


---------49:55----------
maximum that I've done is yell at him


---------49:57----------
and so there was a very hard


---------50:00----------
worming moment for me which made me cry


---------50:02----------
and I asked my brother and this is like


---------50:07----------
I got like I mean this is like a PTSD


---------50:09----------
thing there's no way I and I understand


---------50:12----------
why my Sheriff this brings up PTSD but


---------50:14----------
when I asked my brother like why do you


---------50:18----------
love me right I said I said you love me


---------50:19----------
said yeah I love you so why do you love


---------50:21----------
me said cuz either you never beaten me


---------50:22----------
and like Wow


---------50:25----------
like imagine loving someone because they


---------50:28----------
have not beaten you they don't love you


---------50:30----------
because I mean me I'm sure he loves


---------50:33----------
because I'm nice to him and all that


---------50:34----------
like I by him like but the first thought


---------50:36----------
he things like initially as a kid right


---------50:38----------
kids are very harness you saved a lot of


---------50:42----------
wise stuff but I think your your mind is


---------50:44----------
circling around the problem everything


---------50:47----------
you're saying like what do you just tell


---------50:49----------
me like what is that story me not


---------50:52----------
wanting to be like my father


---------50:53----------
yeah and it's also inspiring and


---------50:56----------
positive mm-hmm so I mean I think you're


---------51:02----------
you're just you're swimming in


---------51:04----------
positivity which i think is like very


---------51:07----------
like it's bizarre it's like sort of a


---------51:09----------
it's a very mature thing to do but I


---------51:11----------
think it's actually holding you back and


---------51:13----------
that's causing you a problem because


---------51:14----------
you're saying like I don't want to be


---------51:15----------
like my father I don't want to be like


---------51:17----------
my father but what you've got to start


---------51:19----------
doing is like stop living in comparison


---------51:21----------
to him right you have to make a decision


---------51:24----------
about whether whether you go or you stay


---------51:26----------
based on your life in your family and


---------51:29----------
what you want to do and and you have to


---------51:32----------
really sit down with your mom and your


---------51:34----------
brother and like understand that like


---------51:35----------
you're leaving like that the problem


---------51:37----------
with like you staying here is that


---------51:39----------
you're leaving them so can you make that


---------51:43----------
can you make that sacrifice is it okay


---------51:45----------
to like leave them to manage their own


---------51:48----------
[ __ ] because you're filled with guilt


---------51:50----------
and it's guilt that's causing you to go


---------51:52----------
back and generally speaking you know I I


---------51:56----------
think it's it's good to put your your


---------51:58----------
family first like I think that's an


---------52:00----------
important thing and it's an important


---------52:01----------
part of your entire Amma I just wonder


---------52:03----------
for free if you go back today how much


---------52:06----------
can you support your mom if you go back


---------52:08----------
two years from now how much you can you


---------52:10----------
support your mom how much can you


---------52:12----------
support your brother


---------52:13----------
and that's why I that's the conflict


---------52:17----------
right because if I go back now I can


---------52:19----------
short-term help them but long term I can


---------52:22----------
do way more by staying here and helping


---------52:24----------
helping yeah so I mean I think that's


---------52:27----------
the conflict but I think if you want to


---------52:29----------
resolve this conflict you've got to


---------52:31----------
understand the negativity because you


---------52:32----------
understand the positive part of it very


---------52:34----------
well there is another issue to it though


---------52:38----------
so like when it comes to my degree and


---------52:42----------
my passion that's another struggle I


---------52:45----------
have a conflict I have because like I


---------52:48----------
said you know I'm graduating with a


---------52:49----------
computer information systems degree but


---------52:51----------
I'm not passionate I'm good at coding


---------52:53----------
but I don't think I like it as a I would


---------52:56----------
like it as a career I'm more of a


---------52:58----------
problem solver critical thinker etc I


---------53:01----------
really love philosophy so like I like


---------53:04----------
you know reading my Immanuel Kant or


---------53:06----------
Nietzsche or whatever but so so and I do


---------53:12----------
like video doing video um you know


---------53:15----------
that's one of the things I am passionate


---------53:17----------
but I've been doing it since I was 12


---------53:21----------
I used to edit called DD montages my


---------53:24----------
crappy laptop and put him on YouTube and


---------53:25----------
I used to teach as a 12 year old


---------53:27----------
actually this is funny this is one of


---------53:28----------
videos I made on YouTube is still up


---------53:30----------
there it has like eighty thousand views


---------53:32----------
and I was like twelve teaching somebody


---------53:33----------
had to convert an mp4 file so I can so


---------53:37----------
you can use it in Windows Movie Maker so


---------53:41----------
I have a passion for video but it


---------53:43----------
doesn't pay well and it's hard to get a


---------53:45----------
job for a video but I have a degree in


---------53:48----------
something that pays well but I want


---------53:53----------
something in between


---------53:54----------
I wanted something in business that's


---------53:56----------
why I'm minor in your business like


---------53:58----------
management or something because I feel


---------54:00----------
like I can lead people okay so Jay Jay


---------54:04----------
listen yes I don't think you're gonna


---------54:06----------
get the kind of satisfaction that maybe


---------54:09----------
you were hoping for because I I think


---------54:11----------
you're skirting around the issue like I


---------54:13----------
keep on saying the same thing to you and


---------54:15----------
you keep on changing the subject what am


---------54:18----------
I saying to you


---------54:19----------
that I should stay here no I'm saying


---------54:24----------
that you've got a grapple with your


---------54:25----------
negativity but I can't it's hard I don't


---------54:29----------
know that's why that's that's exactly


---------54:31----------
why you keep on talking about other [ __ ]


---------54:34----------
so like I want everyone to understand


---------54:37----------
this when there is a hard decision you


---------54:39----------
face your mind will run to anything it


---------54:41----------
can to complicate the situation you'll


---------54:46----------
add as many variables as you can to the


---------54:48----------
equation you're gonna make any time


---------54:50----------
you're faced with a difficult decision


---------54:51----------
that you don't want to make your mind is


---------54:53----------
gonna try to add as much complicating


---------54:55----------
[ __ ] as you can because then you can


---------54:57----------
like you start talking about oh but I


---------54:59----------
want to like do videography and it's my


---------55:00----------
passion and like but this pays better


---------55:03----------
like what should I do because like I'm


---------55:04----------
telling you like like JJ your problem is


---------55:07----------
that you have to decide whether you want


---------55:08----------
to be an [ __ ] to your family that's


---------55:10----------
your decision mm-hmm because that's what


---------55:15----------
it's gonna feel like and you have to


---------55:18----------
decide like do I want guilt in the


---------55:20----------
feeling of not being an [ __ ] to like


---------55:23----------
control what I do or can I come to a


---------55:27----------
place where I can say like okay I'm


---------55:29----------
gonna stay and acknowledge that I'm


---------55:31----------
gonna leave my my brother and my mom


---------55:33----------
behind but I'm really doing it for them


---------55:36----------
and like it's gonna feel bad for a while


---------55:38----------
and I'm not like my dad that I'm really


---------55:41----------
doing this for them and not just for


---------55:43----------
myself I think I've come to accept that


---------55:47----------
the rest of it I think is details I mean


---------55:50----------
I think you can you can come up to


---------55:52----------
whatever kinds of other things you want


---------55:54----------
to talk about like oh like should you


---------55:55----------
follow your passion or should you do


---------55:56----------
what pays I mean I think in your


---------55:58----------
position I would do what pays and then


---------56:00----------
like do my passion on the side like


---------56:01----------
that's what I do I don't think like you


---------56:03----------
can I mean I like I have a job and then


---------56:06----------
I do this because this is my passion I


---------56:09----------
don't think the two are mutually


---------56:11----------
exclusive and I think if you get if you


---------56:13----------
get good at your job like if you're


---------56:14----------
gonna work it like see is like I imagine


---------56:17----------
that involves some amount of coding and


---------56:18----------
you're gonna probably be paid like


---------56:20----------
hourly or based on stuff and I think if


---------56:22----------
you're as good as you say you are you


---------56:23----------
could probably get paid for 40 hours a


---------56:25----------
week and work 20 and on 20 you do


---------56:27----------
videography on the side like that's the


---------56:30----------
whole point behind getting a salary job


---------56:32----------
is you get


---------56:33----------
really really good at it and then you do


---------56:35----------
your own [ __ ] on their dime that's how


---------56:37----------
you game the system so I don't think


---------56:39----------
this is like an either/or I think you're


---------56:41----------
22 yeah


---------56:43----------
you're 22 you've got 40 years of work


---------56:46----------
ahead of you and you can develop your


---------56:47----------
passion start making like I don't know


---------56:49----------
if you know this but like people get


---------56:51----------
paid a lot for video editing nowadays


---------56:53----------
you know you can make a lot of money


---------56:55----------
like through videography you can be like


---------56:58----------
a contract videographer on the side and


---------56:59----------
have a day job that pays your bills


---------57:01----------
because that's your Dharma that's what a


---------57:03----------
man does right your mom needs your help


---------57:06----------
so [ __ ] helper mm-hmm and I don't


---------57:09----------
know what's go yeah so I mean I think


---------57:12----------
you're you're gonna figure that out like


---------57:14----------
so I think I get what you're saying in


---------57:16----------
terms of uncertainty so the other thing


---------57:18----------
is you're religious so like is Allah in


---------57:20----------
your corner is he helping you out yeah


---------57:23----------
okay so have some faith in that right


---------57:28----------
like you can decide whatever you want to


---------57:29----------
but what makes you think you have it


---------57:31----------
like why do you think you have control


---------57:35----------
the thing is I don't feel like I have


---------57:37----------
control yeah so you just choose you make


---------57:40----------
a choice and you deal with the emotional


---------57:43----------
fallout I feel like time is running out


---------57:46----------
though like yes no of course in November


---------57:48----------
20th and yeah I gradually December see


---------57:51----------
you make a decision what's the problem


---------57:54----------
with making a decision JJ commitment


---------57:57----------
yeah I mean commitment I think the


---------58:00----------
bigger problem is you're afraid of


---------58:01----------
making the wrong decision yes that's the


---------58:04----------
big one that's the big problem so like


---------58:07----------
you can't make the wrong decision though


---------58:10----------
why can't you make the wrong decision um


---------58:16----------
because they're only two good things


---------58:19----------
maybe because you don't [ __ ] know


---------58:21----------
like how can you blame yourself for


---------58:24----------
making the wrong decision if you don't


---------58:25----------
[ __ ] know yeah I'm also I was going


---------58:29----------
to say I'm also a very pragmatic person


---------58:33----------
and so I try to a part of me says there


---------58:39----------
are every human being has a limited


---------58:43----------
number of routes they can take in their


---------58:45----------
lives right you


---------58:47----------
you could have been a barber and not a


---------58:50----------
psychiatrist right


---------58:51----------
sure you could that's a route that's a


---------58:54----------
possibility once your mind doing right


---------58:55----------
now JJ that's taking me away from the


---------58:59----------
issue absolutely but it is a struggle


---------59:04----------
bill right of course it's a struggle


---------59:06----------
because I I think I have so many


---------59:08----------
possibilities I want to say here's


---------59:10----------
here's the problem JJ you're trying to


---------59:13----------
figure this out so that there's a right


---------59:15----------
answer


---------59:15----------
the reason you're paralyzed is because


---------59:18----------
you will do whatever kind of pragmatic


---------59:21----------
calculating statistical philosophical


---------59:24----------
psychological you will just chew this


---------59:28----------
stuff up until you come out with the


---------59:30----------
right answer the basic problem is that


---------59:32----------
you're uncomfortable with uncertainty


---------59:34----------
yes


---------59:35----------
I don't like not having the answer so


---------59:37----------
that's what you've got it grapple with


---------59:39----------
like you've got to just understand that


---------59:41----------
like this is not gonna get fixed you can


---------59:45----------
try to like read a manual Conte all you


---------59:47----------
want to you could talk to some [ __ ]


---------59:48----------
psychiatrist on the internet and like


---------59:51----------
you were like you're coming here and


---------59:52----------
you're hoping that someone is gonna give


---------59:54----------
you an answer so that you can make the


---------59:55----------
wrong right decision if you're if you're


---------59:58----------
this is for you and everyone at home the


---------60:00----------
way to move forward in life is not to


---------60:02----------
find the right decision that's like the


---------60:04----------
like risk-averse strategies are not how


---------60:06----------
you become successful you become


---------60:08----------
successful by doing and then like


---------60:10----------
learning damage control it's not


---------60:12----------
prevention it's damage control if you


---------60:15----------
want to be successful in life just get


---------60:16----------
really good at damage control can you


---------60:19----------
expand on that what do you mean by


---------60:21----------
damage control that when you [ __ ] up you


---------60:23----------
know how to fix it mm-hmm like I I don't


---------60:28----------
think that there's an objectively right


---------60:30----------
answer here even there's there's not


---------60:31----------
even a psychologically correct answer


---------60:33----------
like because if you stay sure your


---------60:36----------
earning potential is greater but like


---------60:37----------
the whole h-1b visa situation is like


---------60:40----------
that's up in the air man like that's not


---------60:42----------
a reliable bet like you could stay for a


---------60:44----------
year everything could get [ __ ] up it's


---------60:46----------
there's really no way of knowing and so


---------60:50----------
the thing that you've really got to do


---------60:51----------
JJ is understand that uncertainty is a


---------60:53----------
part of the equation that sometimes in


---------60:56----------
life you just have to like make a choice


---------60:58----------
and just see what happens and thankful


---------61:01----------
we you're religious so somewhere along


---------61:04----------
the way you've lost faith like I don't


---------61:08----------
know when that happened but it's clear


---------61:09----------
to me that you don't you've lost faith


---------61:11----------
like Allah is looking out for you so


---------61:15----------
just do what you're gonna do and


---------61:17----------
understand that you could make the wrong


---------61:18----------
decision and understand that whether you


---------61:20----------
go so sometimes like for example you're


---------61:24----------
gonna find your way as long as you try


---------61:26----------
and as long as you keep at it and as


---------61:28----------
long as I think you face your negativity


---------61:30----------
but you're just you're looking for like


---------61:32----------
a safe safe solution like this is like


---------61:34----------
you remember when you were a quiet and


---------61:36----------
good kid that's what you're being right


---------61:39----------
now you're just being like quiet and


---------61:43----------
good like how can I figure out like


---------61:44----------
what's gonna make everyone happy like


---------61:45----------
how can I figure out how to not rock the


---------61:48----------
boat like that's what you're trying to


---------61:49----------
do in your life but your boat is in it's


---------61:50----------
in like stormy seas it's gonna rock your


---------61:55----------
fear of that is actually like the


---------61:57----------
biggest problem like you've just got to


---------61:58----------
face uncertainty fine so I'm gonna say


---------62:01----------
something that's that's probably the


---------62:02----------
most ridiculous thing and then


---------62:03----------
unfortunately we're gonna have to stop


---------62:06----------
soon but but that's I don't think it


---------62:08----------
matters what choice you make because I


---------62:11----------
don't think you get to control what


---------62:12----------
happens like I just don't think you do


---------62:14----------
like I don't from the situation that


---------62:16----------
you've laid out I think it's a really


---------62:18----------
challenging conundrum you're in I just I


---------62:20----------
genuinely do not think there is a right


---------62:22----------
answer because on the one hand you have


---------62:23----------
a high degree of uncertainty if you stay


---------62:25----------
the h-1b visa stuff is really up in the


---------62:28----------
air so like there's no one's gonna tell


---------62:30----------
you that that's a corner quote the right


---------62:32----------
answer and then there's gonna be like a


---------62:34----------
high degree of uncertainty if you go


---------62:36----------
like your career options are gonna get


---------62:38----------
narrowed quite a bit you could become a


---------62:40----------
millionaire through like cutting YouTube


---------62:42----------
videos by like you could do that but you


---------62:44----------
could do that either way right I think


---------62:46----------
the thing that you've got to start doing


---------62:48----------
is having faith in yourself that there


---------62:49----------
is first of all acknowledging that there


---------62:51----------
isn't a right answer and there isn't a


---------62:52----------
wrong answer and this is a big problem


---------62:54----------
that I see with all kinds of gamers it's


---------62:56----------
like they're not willing to apply to


---------62:58----------
college until they know they're gonna


---------62:59----------
get into the one that they want they're


---------63:03----------
like oh yeah like I'm not gonna apply to


---------63:05----------
college cuz like it's gonna be I'm gonna


---------63:08----------
be ashamed if I don't get into like a


---------63:09----------
good university mm-hm so they want they


---------63:12----------
want everything to line up to be per


---------63:14----------
before they take action it's not gonna


---------63:16----------
work there's some amount of


---------63:19----------
psychological stuff we can talk about


---------63:21----------
right like you don't want to stay


---------63:23----------
because you're abandoning your family


---------63:24----------
and that's what your dad does and you're


---------63:26----------
not gonna be like him fine you could


---------63:29----------
talk about that through that with your


---------63:30----------
therapist it's a wonderful revelation


---------63:32----------
eye opening and your situation doesn't


---------63:34----------
change that's when I realize you


---------63:36----------
actually don't have a psychological


---------63:37----------
problem you have a problem of


---------63:38----------
uncertainty and fear you also have this


---------63:42----------
arrogance that like you think that you


---------63:43----------
can figure things out because you've


---------63:45----------
been good at that so far right you


---------63:47----------
figured out like how to act so that your


---------63:49----------
dad minimized the amount of time that he


---------63:51----------
hit you you didn't just take chances


---------63:54----------
like you don't take chances so that's


---------63:55----------
what you've got to learn like you're


---------63:57----------
your barrier is one of like dealing with


---------63:59----------
uncertainty and understanding that


---------64:00----------
sometimes in life you have to roll the


---------64:01----------
dice mm-hmm I know it's wholly


---------64:08----------
unsatisfying for you but that's the


---------64:09----------
[ __ ] point because if you're looking


---------64:12----------
for satisfaction like that's not gonna


---------64:14----------
happen the whole point is that you need


---------64:15----------
to learn how to make decisions without


---------64:16----------
satisfaction you're coming on here and


---------64:20----------
you're saying like Oh like but I don't


---------64:21----------
know what to do now yeah and you're not


---------64:23----------
going to ever but you can't let that


---------64:27----------
stop you from acting do you have like


---------64:32----------
any advice on how to stay in the moment


---------64:35----------
because I'm always a future-oriented


---------64:37----------
person I can never watch the meditation


---------64:42----------
streams right yeah so meditation is the


---------64:45----------
practice that brings your mind to the


---------64:47----------
present moment and and we'll do some


---------64:50----------
meditation today but I think like the


---------64:52----------
challenge here is that you've got a you


---------64:54----------
know you've got a I mean it's tough but


---------64:57----------
you have to practice it it's a skill and


---------64:58----------
I know that your mind is very


---------65:00----------
future-oriented because you just love


---------65:02----------
your mind can think about possibilities


---------65:05----------
and equations and how if you do this and


---------65:08----------
then this can happen and then this can


---------65:09----------
happen and then this can happen what if


---------65:11----------
I do it this way this can happen and


---------65:12----------
this can happen can this can happen if I


---------65:14----------
do it this way this can happen this can


---------65:15----------
happen this can happen your mind is


---------65:17----------
spending all of this energy going


---------65:19----------
through hypotheticals and building


---------65:21----------
fantasies in your mind and it prevents


---------65:22----------
you from actually acting at the end of


---------65:24----------
the day you're spent and you're actually


---------65:25----------
not this is important to understand


---------65:27----------
you're not


---------65:28----------
any closer to the actual solution even


---------65:31----------
though it feels like all of those


---------65:32----------
thoughts are bringing you to solution


---------65:34----------
it's just like today we're like I'm


---------65:36----------
pushing you to the solution and then


---------65:38----------
your mind is like oh but I forgot to


---------65:40----------
mention this and like even at the


---------65:42----------
beginning you were like okay I have to


---------65:43----------
start off with a bunch of [ __ ]


---------65:44----------
context and you should watch my facial


---------65:46----------
expression go back and watch it I was


---------65:47----------
like what the [ __ ] I saw I saw that is


---------65:51----------
there it's like that's no the context


---------65:54----------
doesn't [ __ ] matter but your mind can


---------65:56----------
chew on that context it's like it's like


---------65:58----------
the meal that never ends


---------66:00----------
for your mind and you just think and you


---------66:03----------
think and you think and you think and


---------66:04----------
you think and you think and you think


---------66:05----------
interesting it's exhausting and it


---------66:08----------
doesn't get you anywhere so just do make


---------66:11----------
a decision understand that it could be


---------66:13----------
the wrong decision and there's no way of


---------66:15----------
knowing and have some faith okay that's


---------66:20----------
what I got well thank you very much I


---------66:26----------
mean I came here for guidance and I got


---------66:31----------
some guidance on what on being content


---------66:36----------
that I can't choose or or solidify any


---------66:40----------
option that I have to just go with go


---------66:42----------
with the flow you know yeah just I'm


---------66:44----------
accepting that and if it's wrong you


---------66:46----------
adjust if it's wrong you adjust that's


---------66:49----------
the skill that you need that's the


---------66:51----------
confidence you need to have in yourself


---------66:55----------
if it's wrong you adjust an and let you


---------67:00----------
know in a few months whoa let me know


---------67:03----------
you can you can come back on stream and


---------67:06----------
we'll see depending on the quality of


---------67:07----------
yours what what continent hey who knows


---------67:13----------
I'm a good India my grandpa loves India


---------67:15----------
okay well if you go there than the your


---------67:17----------
internet connection will be just as


---------67:19----------
it'll be unclear it could be as good as


---------67:21----------
the US could be as bad as Bahrain I have


---------67:23----------
no idea what far aids Internet is like


---------67:25----------
but but listen this I will tell you JJ


---------67:29----------
so first of all I think you're an


---------67:30----------
awesome guy and I can't you know it's


---------67:32----------
it's hard to go through what you've gone


---------67:34----------
through and I think it's really


---------67:36----------
remarkable it's kind of telling cuz next


---------67:38----------
on we're gonna have feral and we're


---------67:39----------
gonna talk to fair all about and


---------67:41----------
trolls in the internet and holding on to


---------67:43----------
hatred and I think you've done an


---------67:45----------
amazing job of not being able when you


---------67:49----------
have every right to be and that's really


---------67:50----------
commendable think and I don't think like


---------67:53----------
you're like your dad so I want you to


---------67:54----------
take some comfort in the fact that I


---------67:56----------
really don't think you can abandon your


---------67:57----------
family even if you try it's just not you


---------68:00----------
just are not that person


---------68:01----------
yeah and and that basically what you and


---------68:05----------
your family are doing is they're they're


---------68:06----------
rolling the dice right they're making a


---------68:08----------
gamble and all of you guys need to get


---------68:11----------
on the same page about like which way do


---------68:13----------
you want like where do you want to place


---------68:14----------
your bet on going your home or on


---------68:17----------
staying and either one you can be


---------68:19----------
successful either way and I think it


---------68:22----------
just takes a couple of years to figure


---------68:24----------
that out I don't think you're locking


---------68:25----------
yourself into a career for the rest of


---------68:27----------
your life you can do video and I'm


---------68:29----------
serious like any kind of programming job


---------68:30----------
you can do your programming and then do


---------68:33----------
[ __ ] on the side mm-hmm so I don't I


---------68:36----------
think their problem is that you're


---------68:37----------
thinking about an either/or it's not an


---------68:39----------
either/or it's just about how to do both


---------68:41----------
so I don't accept your premise that you


---------68:43----------
have to choose between the two like you


---------68:45----------
have to choose between the two like


---------68:46----------
right now sure but six months from now


---------68:48----------
you can be doing both you can find


---------68:50----------
contracting jobs for CIS you can do


---------68:54----------
Contracting jobs for videography and you


---------68:56----------
can make that transition um last thing


---------69:01----------
the only reason I feel like I have to


---------69:03----------
make a choice and I agree with you like


---------69:05----------
I can do either it's just easier to make


---------69:07----------
a choice now because of I let's say I


---------69:09----------
end up going back home it's harder for


---------69:12----------
me to come back to the u.s. and it's


---------69:14----------
just logistics base it's not like


---------69:19----------
finding it hard psychologically or hard


---------69:22----------
to make a decision is just logistically


---------69:24----------
if I go back home getting a visa and


---------69:27----------
convincing an employer hey get me back


---------69:29----------
to the US h-1b visa over somebody else


---------69:31----------
it'll be harder so being here in the


---------69:33----------
u.s. having connections and in Korea


---------69:34----------
phrase and all you could tell me all the


---------69:36----------
strategic reasons to make one better the


---------69:38----------
other I think that's fine I don't think


---------69:39----------
you're gonna find an answer yeah no I


---------69:41----------
agree yeah yeah


---------69:43----------
so don't feed that part of your mind


---------69:45----------
okay okay just keep us keep us posted


---------69:48----------
just know that the Jay Jay I have faith


---------69:50----------
in you I think you're gonna be okay and


---------69:53----------
I think that you're a good human being


---------69:54----------
and it sounds


---------69:55----------
pretty smart it sounds like you just had


---------69:57----------
a minor amount of brain damage so you


---------69:59----------
only speak and you know so but that too


---------70:04----------
is like that's you know I talk about


---------70:06----------
karma a lot you could talk about the


---------70:08----------
will of Allah you could talk about Karma


---------70:10----------
I think it's all the same Tamiya that's


---------70:13----------
just how it is and I'm sorry that you


---------70:15----------
know there isn't an easy answer for you


---------70:16----------
but that's what that's what Allah wants


---------70:17----------
