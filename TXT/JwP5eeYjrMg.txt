---------00:03----------
but one of the biggest problems that


---------00:05----------
parents want into is they say like okay


---------00:07----------
no baby parameter and then read this


---------00:09----------
book and what I don't think anyone in


---------00:12----------
that relationship understands that even


---------00:14----------
I don't really understand it because I


---------00:15----------
was just theoretical is that they don't


---------00:17----------
have the capacity to actually enjoy that


---------00:20----------
not in the way that we do right so as a


---------00:24----------
parent you have to understand that when


---------00:25----------
you give them like some kind of


---------00:27----------
alternative like they're not going to


---------00:28----------
have the capacity to enjoyment to enjoy


---------00:30----------
it and what you really have to do is


---------00:32----------
sort of like pull them away from games


---------00:33----------
in a pretty significant manner to get


---------00:36----------
them to sort of have like a normal


---------00:37----------
healthy kind of dopamine kind of brain


---------00:40----------
now the good news is that it's not like


---------00:42----------
you have to get them to stop all gaming


---------00:44----------
I think it's enough to engage them in a


---------00:46----------
way that they find enjoyable like


---------00:48----------
there's you can do something right so


---------00:50----------
you can you know some people I'll tell


---------00:52----------
them to do things like go whitewater


---------00:53----------
rafting or like a vacation so whitewater


---------00:55----------
rafting is a really like tired rather


---------00:57----------
than kind of thing it's a little bit


---------00:58----------
dangerous to that be careful but it's


---------01:00----------
like I've never met a game or a strong


---------01:02----------
whitewater rafting and didn't absolutely


---------01:04----------
like it's really engaging it's also


---------01:07----------
helped me it's something that you can do


---------01:09----------
as a family so there are things that you


---------01:10----------
can do to sort of help yourself along


---------01:12----------
and then when it comes to reading books


---------01:14----------
like you know I think books can be


---------01:16----------
bought and you just have to give them


---------01:18----------
time and space and let their brain sort


---------01:19----------
of like get used to that again and then


---------01:24----------
you can kind of think about alternative


---------01:25----------
activities but I think the dopamine


---------01:26----------
circuit is like just one of them and


---------01:28----------
then there are all these other circuits


---------01:30----------
like there's this sort of sense of


---------01:31----------
identity there's the sense of there's


---------01:33----------
something a lot that I call the triumph


---------01:34----------
circuit which is not real circuits but


---------01:37----------
it's like just this basic capacity that


---------01:38----------
human beings like triumph and taya is


---------01:41----------
requires adversity so when you're


---------01:44----------
thinking about like you know how that


---------01:45----------
help your kid do something you have to


---------01:47----------
give them a task that is hard but


---------01:49----------
engaging
