---------00:38----------
to are are we doing a video interview


---------00:40----------
today june


---------00:42----------
no no no i don't usually do face gun


---------00:45----------
okay sure so then let me just make a


---------00:47----------
quick adjustment


---------00:50----------
okay um so tell me a little bit about


---------00:52----------
what you'd like to talk about today and


---------00:54----------
how i can be helpful


---------00:57----------
oh


---------01:00----------
i think i want to talk about like maybe


---------01:02----------
three topics maybe


---------01:04----------
maybe one of the three topics if we have


---------01:06----------
enough time sure


---------01:09----------
um i think one of them is like um


---------01:12----------
like opening up in in friendships


---------01:15----------
and like relationships because i feel


---------01:18----------
like um


---------01:19----------
i can make friends really easily but at


---------01:22----------
the surface level


---------01:23----------
because i feel like um if i if i think


---------01:26----------
of like really close friends right like


---------01:28----------
best friends


---------01:29----------
like people usually open up about like


---------01:31----------
super personal stuff


---------01:33----------
but then like i tend to never do that to


---------01:36----------
other people


---------01:36----------
where i talk about myself because i feel


---------01:40----------
like i don't


---------01:41----------
really have a moment where i feel like i


---------01:44----------
need to do that


---------01:45----------
because i feel like i deal with it alone


---------01:47----------
anyways


---------01:48----------
but then because i don't do that i feel


---------01:50----------
like


---------01:52----------
most friendships end up just at the


---------01:54----------
surface level


---------01:56----------
and i want to change that somehow why do


---------01:58----------
you want to change that


---------02:02----------
because i want closer friends


---------02:05----------
and what makes you want closer friends


---------02:08----------
i know it's kind of a weird question


---------02:15----------
i think having a lot of friends is


---------02:19----------
actually not as good as having a few


---------02:22----------
really close friends


---------02:25----------
so you value close friendships


---------02:30----------
have you ever had a close friend


---------02:33----------
uh yeah i like close friends from high


---------02:35----------
school


---------02:36----------
okay yeah go ahead sorry


---------02:40----------
yeah we were able to get like you know


---------02:42----------
really close but


---------02:44----------
um as time goes on you know like you


---------02:46----------
kind of drift apart right because


---------02:48----------
absolutely everyone goes different paths


---------02:50----------
so there's not that many times that you


---------02:52----------
can like


---------02:53----------
catch up with them so you meet new


---------02:56----------
friends


---------02:57----------
that are for example like if your


---------02:59----------
streamer you meet other streamer friends


---------03:03----------
and what do you think it is that makes


---------03:04----------
it hard for you to open up


---------03:08----------
hmm i just don't feel the need to


---------03:14----------
like it's just like kind of random to


---------03:16----------
just talk about personal stuff


---------03:18----------
with someone that you just met not too


---------03:20----------
long ago


---------03:22----------
yeah so that's the first thing i you


---------03:25----------
know i asked you kind of a weird


---------03:26----------
question which is like


---------03:27----------
why do you want close friends because i


---------03:30----------
think the first


---------03:31----------
the first question is is really like to


---------03:32----------
think a little bit about


---------03:35----------
you know is there is there a part of you


---------03:36----------
that wants to open up


---------03:38----------
but can't or


---------03:41----------
i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------03:43----------
like another possibility is that


---------03:45----------
you sort of know theoretically that like


---------03:47----------
people have close friends and you've had


---------03:49----------
close friends before but it's actually


---------03:50----------
not something that you actually need


---------03:52----------
right now


---------03:55----------
what do you think about that


---------04:00----------
i think that also ties into my


---------04:01----------
relationships too where


---------04:04----------
um like if you don't open up to anybody


---------04:07----------
then how are you supposed to get


---------04:09----------
emotionally attached to them right


---------04:11----------
do you want to be emotionally attached


---------04:13----------
to people


---------04:16----------
yeah i think i i'm not i'm not one to


---------04:18----------
get like super


---------04:19----------
lonely and stuff like that but i think


---------04:22----------
especially with you know the coveted


---------04:24----------
stuff


---------04:26----------
like i feel like um if i do this i might


---------04:28----------
end up single


---------04:29----------
until i'm like 40 or something okay


---------04:33----------
and are you so so i know this sounds


---------04:36----------
weird june but like


---------04:37----------
is the reason that you want to open up


---------04:39----------
to people because you want to avoid


---------04:41----------
being single


---------04:42----------
at the age of 40. no no no


---------04:46----------
why do you not the reason why okay


---------04:48----------
that's very helpful no i just feel like


---------04:50----------
it's it's just better to have


---------04:51----------
you know like let's say i do have a


---------04:53----------
moment where i do need people right


---------04:56----------
then i don't really have that moment


---------04:59----------
right now


---------05:00----------
but i know later on there's eventually


---------05:03----------
gonna be


---------05:03----------
you know moments like that where i need


---------05:05----------
someone


---------05:07----------
but then like if i never did that with


---------05:08----------
anyone then it would be kind of weird to


---------05:10----------
just like do it out of the blue right


---------05:12----------
yes but i do love listening to other


---------05:14----------
people though


---------05:16----------
okay so so i know this is going to sound


---------05:18----------
kind of weird june and maybe i'm just


---------05:20----------
missing something because i


---------05:21----------
sometimes i when i can't see people's


---------05:23----------
faces i'll like


---------05:24----------
miss play a little bit so apologies but


---------05:27----------
but


---------05:27----------
i'm hearing you sort of say a lot of


---------05:29----------
logical reasons why it's good to open up


---------05:31----------
to people


---------05:33----------
like oh like what if i need someone one


---------05:36----------
day


---------05:40----------
right so so but that's kind of


---------05:41----------
interesting because what i'm hearing


---------05:42----------
there is that i should


---------05:44----------
open up to people so if we thought to


---------05:46----------
think about like there's like what i'm


---------05:47----------
hearing from you is that you know in


---------05:49----------
your mind you're kind of saying oh it's


---------05:50----------
like


---------05:50----------
it's a good idea to open up and form


---------05:53----------
connections with people


---------05:54----------
but there's a difference between like it


---------05:56----------
being a good idea and it being something


---------05:58----------
that you want


---------06:02----------
i think i want to i think you do too but


---------06:05----------
i do see it in a logical way as well


---------06:07----------
yep so i think this is where like we've


---------06:09----------
got to get underneath the logic to try


---------06:11----------
to get


---------06:12----------
at what the wanting is because when i


---------06:14----------
ask you about your motivations


---------06:16----------
i get a logical answer does that make


---------06:17----------
sense


---------06:19----------
yeah that makes sense you see i watched


---------06:21----------
your interviews before and then you'd


---------06:22----------
always ask


---------06:23----------
why why do you what do you say that


---------06:26----------
i thought that was very interesting and


---------06:27----------
that was happening to me so cool


---------06:29----------
what i'm confused you just lost me


---------06:35----------
you're getting to the bottom of it and i


---------06:37----------
usually don't do that with myself


---------06:39----------
yeah i just thought that was really cool


---------06:40----------
so so i think that what we're seeing


---------06:42----------
here i know this sounds kind of weird


---------06:44----------
but like


---------06:45----------
so like june this is going to be weird


---------06:48----------
because like


---------06:49----------
i'm going to try to get you to open up


---------06:51----------
right but that's not


---------06:52----------
what you want to do you want to want to


---------06:55----------
open up


---------06:59----------
does that mean yeah so you want to be


---------07:02----------
someone who wants to open up


---------07:05----------
yes but you don't actually want to open


---------07:08----------
up


---------07:14----------
hmm


---------07:17----------
i think i just don't know how to like


---------07:19----------
how do how do people


---------07:21----------
get to the point where people open up


---------07:23----------
yeah totally


---------07:24----------
totally fine so we'll we'll we'll try to


---------07:26----------
get you there


---------07:27----------
okay june okay


---------07:30----------
so a big piece of this is going to be


---------07:32----------
like so what i'm when i say that you


---------07:34----------
are someone who wants to be someone


---------07:37----------
who wants to open up so like you're


---------07:40----------
striving to be someone who opens up


---------07:43----------
right because that's good and that's


---------07:45----------
healthy and you just don't know how to


---------07:47----------
so if we think about is that fair are we


---------07:49----------
on the same page now


---------07:52----------
so if we think about what keeps people


---------07:54----------
from opening up


---------07:55----------
like so it's almost like something's


---------07:58----------
holding you back


---------08:00----------
and so the the blockage is between


---------08:03----------
opening up like i don't know how to say


---------08:05----------
this but like you want to be someone who


---------08:07----------
opens up so there's something


---------08:09----------
holding you back from being what you


---------08:10----------
want to be does that make sense


---------08:14----------
so we're going to dig into that so can


---------08:15----------
you tell me about your relationships


---------08:20----------
uh like friendship was you use the word


---------08:23----------
relationships i don't know what you're


---------08:24----------
referring to there whatever you mean by


---------08:26----------
that oh


---------08:26----------
i meant like friendships and then you


---------08:28----------
know also relationships


---------08:30----------
because i feel like well


---------08:33----------
okay just to you know talk about myself


---------08:35----------
a little bit please


---------08:37----------
um like right out of high school i went


---------08:39----------
to college


---------08:40----------
and then um around the same time i


---------08:43----------
started playing this game called rust


---------08:45----------
okay so it's like a survival you know


---------08:47----------
fps kind of game


---------08:48----------
and then all i did really was you know


---------08:51----------
play that game


---------08:52----------
until like 18 to like 23.


---------08:56----------
okay so basically my entire adulthood


---------08:59----------
was playing that game and then


---------09:00----------
eventually


---------09:01----------
i made youtube videos and then i became


---------09:03----------
a youtuber and then i started streaming


---------09:06----------
and then i became streamer and only


---------09:07----------
recently where


---------09:09----------
you know i'm kind of getting burnt out


---------09:10----------
of rust so i'm like venturing out


---------09:12----------
into other games okay and then i met a


---------09:15----------
lot of like new friends


---------09:17----------
so because i made a lot of new friends i


---------09:19----------
wanna


---------09:21----------
like i like them a lot and i want to get


---------09:23----------
close with them


---------09:24----------
right but because


---------09:28----------
i don't i haven't usually done that


---------09:32----------
like i don't even i i don't like small


---------09:34----------
talk


---------09:35----------
so like even at the first step like


---------09:38----------
it's already doomed you know what i mean


---------09:43----------
what why is it tuned doomed


---------09:47----------
because i feel like if you don't even


---------09:49----------
small talk then how are you supposed to


---------09:50----------
get to the


---------09:51----------
the deep talk


---------09:57----------
okay that makes sense it makes a lot of


---------09:59----------
sense so what i'm hearing you say is


---------10:01----------
that like


---------10:02----------
generally speaking the way that


---------10:03----------
relationships progress is that you have


---------10:05----------
some amount of small


---------10:06----------
talk and then you progress to deep talk


---------10:12----------
and do you say that you don't like small


---------10:15----------
talk or are you


---------10:16----------
not good at it i'm probably not good at


---------10:19----------
it


---------10:21----------
okay where do you get that idea


---------10:25----------
hmm i just don't know what to say when


---------10:28----------
we're talking about like


---------10:30----------
surface level stuff do you know what to


---------10:33----------
say when you're talking about deep level


---------10:35----------
stuff


---------10:37----------
i think so i'm really good at like


---------10:39----------
listening to other people


---------10:40----------
talk about deep stuff but then when


---------10:42----------
someone asks me


---------10:43----------
it's like i don't really know what to


---------10:47----------
say because let's say like someone's


---------10:48----------
talking about like super emotional stuff


---------10:49----------
right and then they ask me


---------10:51----------
like was there a very like emotional


---------10:53----------
moment for you


---------10:54----------
or like that i don't really know what to


---------10:56----------
say because it's not really about like


---------10:59----------
i think this also ties to my other topic


---------11:00----------
that i will talk about with you


---------11:02----------
um i feel like i'm too emotionally


---------11:05----------
moderate


---------11:07----------
and what i mean by that is like i never


---------11:10----------
get like super depressed


---------11:11----------
but also i don't get super happy either


---------11:15----------
okay so like there's not that many like


---------11:18----------
moments of


---------11:19----------
vulnerability that i can really talk


---------11:21----------
about with people


---------11:25----------
yeah do you think that that's a problem


---------11:29----------
um i think if i don't


---------11:33----------
talk about stuff like that with people


---------11:36----------
then


---------11:37----------
it's not really like a two-way thing


---------11:40----------
right


---------11:42----------
and you want it to be a two-way thing


---------11:46----------
yeah okay


---------11:50----------
can i think for a second june yes


---------12:10----------
can you tell me about your friends from


---------12:11----------
high school


---------12:14----------
um well we're all gamers we actually met


---------12:18----------
uh playing league of legends together


---------12:21----------
and uh they're all very smart


---------12:24----------
so basically i'll like sit with them and


---------12:25----------
then the teacher will think that i'm


---------12:27----------
super smart too


---------12:29----------
so are you not super one of them uh


---------12:32----------
i would say i'm above average but i'm


---------12:35----------
not smart as them


---------12:36----------
definitely not supported them okay


---------12:41----------
all right so t you would sit with them


---------12:42----------
and then the teachers would think you


---------12:44----------
were super smart


---------12:46----------
[Laughter]


---------12:50----------
what was that like oh that was great


---------12:53----------
so like in english clash class um


---------12:57----------
i sat next to the smartest


---------13:00----------
kid in my school which is my best friend


---------13:03----------
and then the second smartest


---------13:05----------
so the english teacher was like yo this


---------13:07----------
guy must be smart he must be like third


---------13:08----------
smartest or something


---------13:10----------
so even though i write like


---------13:13----------
yeah maybe like uh 86 level


---------13:17----------
she still gave me like a 95 level great


---------13:22----------
hmm i'm confused by that


---------13:31----------
so like no because she has like a


---------13:33----------
pre-conception of what i will be like


---------13:36----------
so like whatever she reads that i write


---------13:38----------
it was it was


---------13:39----------
better than what it was


---------13:42----------
okay so you're saying that she had a


---------13:44----------
cognitive bias that caused her to


---------13:48----------
inflate the value of your work


---------13:52----------
yes okay so let me ask you a question


---------13:54----------
okay because you're a super


---------13:56----------
logical dude in above average


---------13:58----------
intelligence


---------13:59----------
so how would we know if you are a person


---------14:02----------
who


---------14:03----------
gets the benefit of a cognitive bias


---------14:05----------
from a teacher


---------14:06----------
or you're misjudging your own skill


---------14:09----------
because of a cognitive bias on your part


---------14:13----------
[Music]


---------14:15----------
how do we know if the paper is really in


---------14:17----------
95 and that you believe you're


---------14:19----------
you deserve an 86 which is incorrect


---------14:22----------
or whether your paper is an 86 and you


---------14:25----------
actually deserve it


---------14:26----------
and it gets inflated to a 95.


---------14:30----------
hmm i wouldn't know that


---------14:37----------
i think i do that a lot though i think


---------14:39----------
you do too


---------14:41----------
tell me tell me other other ways that


---------14:43----------
you do that


---------14:47----------
so for example if i want to get like


---------14:48----------
really good at something


---------14:50----------
i would look at people that


---------14:53----------
are really good at that specific thing


---------14:55----------
so for example


---------14:57----------
let's say it's like gaming right then


---------15:01----------
if i want to be really good at the game


---------15:03----------
i would look at the very best


---------15:06----------
the very best in the game and then i


---------15:08----------
would constantly like


---------15:09----------
try to strive to get there


---------15:16----------
and then i would just always assume that


---------15:19----------
i'm always like under


---------15:22----------
yeah i think that's a good and bad thing


---------15:26----------
say more gene i'd agree 100 explain that


---------15:29----------
to us please


---------15:31----------
because i think that always like keeps


---------15:32----------
like a fire underneath you


---------15:34----------
to keep going but then um


---------15:38----------
you wouldn't really have like


---------15:40----------
satisfaction


---------15:41----------
of getting somewhere because you're


---------15:43----------
always under that


---------15:45----------
level that you want to get to see that's


---------15:47----------
another thing


---------15:49----------
um i think i really hate the feeling of


---------15:53----------
like being mediocre


---------15:57----------
yep you and me both


---------16:00----------
because


---------16:04----------
because like ever since high school i


---------16:05----------
tried a lot of things right so in high


---------16:06----------
school i tried like


---------16:08----------
well i still sing like for fun


---------16:11----------
but i really like singing i really like


---------16:14----------
dancing


---------16:15----------
like basketball like i like gaming


---------16:18----------
obviously


---------16:20----------
um but i felt like i was like never the


---------16:23----------
best at something i was maybe like


---------16:24----------
number two or like number three


---------16:26----------
like above average is number two or


---------16:30----------
number three above average


---------16:32----------
i mean i guess technically the answer is


---------16:34----------
yes but i don't think about number two


---------16:36----------
or number three like i wouldn't


---------16:39----------
you know like if i think about the


---------16:40----------
silver medalist at the olympics


---------16:42----------
i hope like when i think about that


---------16:45----------
person i'd


---------16:46----------
the the words above average is not what


---------16:48----------
comes to mind


---------16:50----------
um but then i think how i was


---------16:53----------
looking at it was like maybe i'm number


---------16:55----------
two in this school


---------16:57----------
but then like i'll be like oh okay the


---------16:59----------
number one in my school


---------17:00----------
is this guy but then that guy is like


---------17:02----------
number


---------17:03----------
500 million in the world


---------17:06----------
sure so


---------17:10----------
june how can you tell me about like


---------17:12----------
where like what growing up was like for


---------17:14----------
you


---------17:16----------
um in what way


---------17:19----------
like where did you grow up what who


---------17:21----------
lived with you at home


---------17:23----------
oh i lived in vancouver i grew up here


---------17:27----------
i'm korean um so basically


---------17:30----------
i learned korean first and then learned


---------17:33----------
english


---------17:35----------
i have both my parents living with me


---------17:36----------
even until now


---------17:38----------
i have one older brother one older


---------17:40----------
sister


---------17:41----------
and they're much older than me so i


---------17:43----------
always play like diablo 2


---------17:45----------
and play the same games that they've


---------17:46----------
played


---------17:49----------
and and i think yeah go ahead


---------17:53----------
i think it was a it was a good childhood


---------17:55----------
i can't really think of any like traumas


---------17:58----------
sure i don't i don't have anything like


---------18:01----------
super bad i can think of like a time


---------18:04----------
where i was like super sad


---------18:06----------
yeah that's what i mean by


---------18:10----------
being too emotionally moderate


---------18:13----------
like i don't really like take things too


---------18:16----------
seriously so i feel like there's no


---------18:20----------
real significant highlight of my life


---------18:23----------
yet


---------18:25----------
which kind of feels empty sometimes


---------18:31----------
can i think for a second june for sure


---------18:38----------
let me just think okay


---------18:56----------
did your did you


---------19:00----------
compare yourself a lot to other people


---------19:01----------
when you were young or did your parents


---------19:03----------
like sort of compare you to other people


---------19:05----------
when you were young


---------19:08----------
um i think i just did that


---------19:11----------
myself a lot my parents don't really do


---------19:14----------
that


---------19:15----------
do you have a sense of of how you


---------19:18----------
started doing that


---------19:23----------
when i see like a good quality in people


---------19:26----------
like


---------19:26----------
i want to


---------19:29----------
[Music]


---------19:30----------
try to do the same so i would see that


---------19:33----------
quality in my


---------19:34----------
my brother or my sister or maybe my


---------19:36----------
classmates


---------19:37----------
or maybe like someone older than me or


---------19:39----------
something i see on tv or whatever


---------19:44----------
so and and i know this sounds kind of


---------19:47----------
weird but like


---------19:51----------
uh so i'm getting a sense that you


---------19:53----------
strive to be more than you are


---------19:58----------
it's always about moving forward


---------20:02----------
no no


---------20:09----------
hmm always striving to move forward


---------20:18----------
and the things that i'm passionate about


---------20:19----------
not in like life


---------20:21----------
or my career wise but if i


---------20:24----------
really like gaming for example i'm gonna


---------20:26----------
always strive to be better


---------20:28----------
yeah okay so so what i'm hearing you say


---------20:31----------
is that it's true for the things that


---------20:33----------
you're passionate about but not like


---------20:34----------
every random thing yeah okay


---------20:38----------
and so i have a weird question june what


---------20:42----------
do you


---------20:42----------
like are you good enough


---------20:46----------
i think i'm good enough


---------20:50----------
if you're good enough


---------20:54----------
what makes you want to be better


---------20:57----------
because it doesn't give me satisfaction


---------21:01----------
then why do you think you're good enough


---------21:05----------
well i think being good enough doesn't


---------21:08----------
necessarily mean that it's going to give


---------21:09----------
you satisfaction


---------21:11----------
what does give you satisfaction


---------21:14----------
hmm


---------21:24----------
i think more than like career like


---------21:26----------
milestones just like having fun


---------21:29----------
with friends probably because i remember


---------21:31----------
like


---------21:32----------
distinctly like i so within the russ


---------21:35----------
community


---------21:37----------
i made like three tournaments last year


---------21:39----------
called uh trust and rust


---------21:41----------
it's like where we uh brought all the


---------21:43----------
people from the russ community together


---------21:45----------
all the creators all the streamers all


---------21:46----------
the youtubers and then we


---------21:48----------
did like a huge event and then we raised


---------21:51----------
over like i think


---------21:53----------
200 000 in that year


---------21:56----------
but then like when i was done i was like


---------21:59----------
oh


---------22:00----------
wow that was great but then that that


---------22:04----------
feeling was more like relief oh it's


---------22:06----------
it's over


---------22:08----------
but i wasn't really like super satisfied


---------22:12----------
but then when i play video games


---------22:17----------
with friends and it was like a really


---------22:18----------
fun night i feel like i get more


---------22:20----------
satisfaction from that


---------22:22----------
than something like doing something


---------22:25----------
really cool


---------22:26----------
like if you think logically raising all


---------22:29----------
that money for charity and like helping


---------22:30----------
all those people is awesome right


---------22:32----------
but didn't really give me that much


---------22:35----------
satisfaction


---------22:39----------
okay so june um i'm noticing a couple of


---------22:43----------
disconnects which which i probably need


---------22:45----------
to like try to understand you a little


---------22:47----------
bit better here


---------22:48----------
um so on the one hand you're kind of


---------22:52----------
telling me that like you always are


---------22:54----------
looking at number one right and


---------22:57----------
and you kind of recognize that that's


---------22:58----------
like adaptive because it sort of like


---------23:01----------
keeps the fire going and keeps you


---------23:02----------
improving


---------23:05----------
and so i i'm sort of i think we're


---------23:07----------
running into a couple of different like


---------23:10----------
conflicts because i think if i ask you


---------23:12----------
are you good enough


---------23:14----------
i wonder if i'm getting a logical answer


---------23:17----------
but like


---------23:18----------
you know there's a part of me that sort


---------23:19----------
of gets the sense that you're striving


---------23:21----------
to be number one


---------23:23----------
and until you're number one you're not


---------23:25----------
going to be like good enough or


---------23:26----------
satisfied


---------23:27----------
what do you think about that


---------23:31----------
yeah i think you're right i think um


---------23:33----------
good enough is like more like


---------23:36----------
a logical answer yes yeah so so like if


---------23:39----------
i like because


---------23:40----------
because like you said like you know


---------23:41----------
you're not like you don't have like


---------23:42----------
super low self-esteem or anything so


---------23:44----------
like you think you're like a decent dude


---------23:46----------
right you're above average just a cut


---------23:50----------
above mediocre


---------23:56----------
why is that funny


---------24:00----------
sorry no i think it's


---------24:04----------
i think we hit a nerve there


---------24:08----------
[Music]


---------24:13----------
now i think a lot of people would be


---------24:15----------
satisfied if


---------24:16----------
they were above average but even if we


---------24:20----------
even if i do like something really cool


---------24:22----------
i just


---------24:24----------
i don't know there's like


---------24:28----------
i think it just stems back to like


---------24:29----------
emotionally moderate


---------24:32----------
i so i i agree so we'll get to so first


---------24:35----------
of all june i want to commend you bro


---------24:37----------
like you've done a really good job of


---------24:40----------
tying together i think a lot of things


---------24:42----------
that


---------24:42----------
feel like that can seem really far apart


---------24:44----------
but i really do think


---------24:46----------
have a shared root so i think the


---------24:48----------
emotional moderation


---------24:50----------
the inability to open up all of this


---------24:52----------
talk about like


---------24:53----------
you know being like never the smartest


---------24:56----------
kid in the class


---------24:58----------
and essentially like a bias that causes


---------25:01----------
you to devalue where you are


---------25:03----------
and and like what i mean by that is like


---------25:05----------
you know you're getting 95s and


---------25:07----------
you're friends with the two smartest


---------25:08----------
kids in the class but you sort of don't


---------25:10----------
think you're


---------25:11----------
of yourself okay maybe i'm the third


---------25:12----------
smartest kid and i think if we


---------25:15----------
if we look at like how that works it's


---------25:17----------
because your mind


---------25:19----------
will find some the second that you start


---------25:22----------
to get towards the top


---------25:24----------
what does your mind do


---------25:27----------
i know it's kind of like a really weird


---------25:29----------
abstract like open-ended question


---------25:32----------
so i'm just going to toss it out and


---------25:33----------
then i'll give you like an answer


---------25:35----------
but i'm curious if you're kind of can


---------25:37----------
read my mind there for a second


---------25:41----------
right so like like we kind of we kind of


---------25:43----------
heard you say like


---------25:44----------
okay even if i think about the number


---------25:46----------
one in my high school like


---------25:48----------
what is that number one compared to the


---------25:50----------
rest of the world


---------25:52----------
so like your mind plays this your mind


---------25:54----------
plays this game of constantly moving


---------25:56----------
goal posts


---------25:58----------
yeah i think so right so even if you


---------26:00----------
rise to the top like what does your mind


---------26:02----------
do


---------26:03----------
does it let you say good job june you're


---------26:06----------
number one


---------26:09----------
no it doesn't do that what does it do


---------26:13----------
move the goal post absolutely


---------26:16----------
right so you're on this like treadmill


---------26:19----------
and no matter how far


---------26:20----------
you move forward like you're never going


---------26:24----------
to be satisfied


---------26:28----------
what do you think about it i'm trying to


---------26:29----------
find ways to get that satisfaction


---------26:32----------
yeah well so that's because like so


---------26:34----------
you're so you're someone who's like


---------26:36----------
walking on a treadmill instead of


---------26:38----------
walking on a path and then you're asking


---------26:40----------
me


---------26:41----------
how do i get to the end of the road


---------26:46----------
right where i think the problem is that


---------26:48----------
like as long as you're on a treadmill


---------26:49----------
it'll never end


---------26:52----------
that's true so like even if you figure


---------26:55----------
out what the treadmill is


---------26:56----------
and what the path is yeah so i think the


---------26:59----------
treadmill is that your mind continuously


---------27:01----------
compare


---------27:02----------
like so as soon as you get like even if


---------27:04----------
you became the biggest rust


---------27:05----------
youtuber then your mind is like okay but


---------27:08----------
what about the biggest


---------27:09----------
rust streamer and then if you become the


---------27:11----------
biggest streamer then it's like


---------27:13----------
oh but they're people who play other


---------27:14----------
games who are bigger than i am


---------27:18----------
and then you start comparing yourself to


---------27:20----------
them


---------27:24----------
um so what i'm hearing from you is you


---------27:27----------
don't think that way in like career-wise


---------27:29----------
though


---------27:31----------
do you feel satisfied in your career


---------27:35----------
um i feel like right now


---------27:38----------
because i don't have a game that i enjoy


---------27:44----------
like if i'm not passionate about


---------27:45----------
something i don't really have that drive


---------27:47----------
like right now i don't have that drive


---------27:49----------
yeah so let let me


---------27:50----------
toss something back at you okay so you


---------27:52----------
said that like if i have a fun


---------27:54----------
night with my friends then i feel


---------27:56----------
satisfied


---------27:58----------
yeah like i go to bed like satisfied oh


---------28:00----------
that was a good day yep yep and so


---------28:02----------
what goal post did you hit by having a


---------28:06----------
good night with your friends


---------28:09----------
[Music]


---------28:12----------
like are you thinking about being number


---------28:14----------
one


---------28:17----------
no right so this is like an important


---------28:20----------
thing to understand that satisfaction


---------28:21----------
doesn't come from hitting the end of the


---------28:23----------
road


---------28:23----------
it comes from not walking on the road


---------28:28----------
but the second you have a goal post and


---------28:30----------
especially if you move the goal post


---------28:32----------
you're never going to be satisfied


---------28:36----------
because we've seen moments where you


---------28:38----------
have been satisfied but i think i know


---------28:40----------
this sounds kind of like now we get to


---------28:41----------
some of those generic


---------28:42----------
you know yoga calendar stuff but i think


---------28:45----------
like in those moments you're like


---------28:47----------
living in the present you're like today


---------28:50----------
i'm gonna play with my friends and we're


---------28:51----------
gonna do some cool stuff


---------28:53----------
and like then you can feel satisfied but


---------28:56----------
when you start living in the future when


---------28:57----------
you start living towards


---------28:59----------
goals when you start like thinking about


---------29:02----------
becoming something your mind won't let


---------29:05----------
you be satisfied because like no matter


---------29:07----------
how good you do


---------29:08----------
it's gonna advance the goal posts


---------29:15----------
[Music]


---------29:16----------
what do you think about that


---------29:20----------
yeah i think just like


---------29:24----------
probably finding other ways


---------29:27----------
to get satisfaction like whether that's


---------29:31----------
like you know building friendships or i


---------29:33----------
think one thing


---------29:34----------
that did help me recently is


---------29:39----------
like having another avenue where i feel


---------29:40----------
like i'm always making progress


---------29:42----------
so like that could be like going to the


---------29:44----------
gym or something


---------29:47----------
yeah so i think so even if my goal post


---------29:51----------
is still there on somewhere else i feel


---------29:53----------
like i'm still moving on a different


---------29:55----------
path


---------29:56----------
yeah so june now we get to something


---------29:58----------
really hard okay like this is probably


---------30:00----------
gonna be like


---------30:01----------
really challenging because i think


---------30:04----------
you're so


---------30:06----------
um you've come


---------30:09----------
to rely on this part of yourself so much


---------30:11----------
as a cornerstone of your success


---------30:13----------
i think it's going to be really hard to


---------30:15----------
let it go but like


---------30:18----------
you know if you are progressing


---------30:22----------
progress can't come without


---------30:24----------
dissatisfaction does that make sense


---------30:27----------
like you're always striving to be more


---------30:32----------
but like if you're striving to be more


---------30:35----------
if you want to be better that means that


---------30:38----------
you're not


---------30:39----------
happy with where you are


---------30:46----------
does that make sense that makes sense


---------30:49----------
so like i think there's this weird thing


---------30:51----------
going on where like


---------30:52----------
what you use to motivate you


---------30:56----------
dooms you to be unsatisfied


---------31:01----------
because it's never enough right like you


---------31:03----------
need to see the progress to feel good


---------31:05----------
about yourself


---------31:06----------
but that progress implies that like


---------31:09----------
you're


---------31:09----------
not good enough because you need to be


---------31:12----------
better


---------31:14----------
and if you need to be better then like


---------31:15----------
you're not good enough like those two


---------31:17----------
come hand in hand


---------31:19----------
does that make sense that makes sense


---------31:22----------
okay so then like and this is where i


---------31:25----------
think we see this like fundamental idea


---------31:27----------
that you have that you're not


---------31:29----------
good enough play out in the school


---------31:31----------
english teacher example


---------31:33----------
because if you believe you're not good


---------31:36----------
enough


---------31:37----------
and you get a 95 what does your mind


---------31:40----------
conclude


---------31:41----------
about why you got the 95


---------31:44----------
was it because you did a good job


---------31:48----------
because i sat next to two two kids there


---------31:50----------
you go right so like it's weird because


---------31:52----------
your mind


---------31:53----------
starts from the foundation of like


---------31:56----------
i'm not good enough so even when life


---------31:58----------
tells you like hey man you did a great


---------32:00----------
job


---------32:01----------
you're like uh no it's actually a


---------32:04----------
cognitive bias


---------32:05----------
because of where i sit in a classroom


---------32:08----------
my score is nine points higher than


---------32:10----------
where it deserves to be


---------32:12----------
like just think about that for a second


---------32:13----------
bro


---------32:23----------
[Music]


---------32:28----------
like i'm sure that teachers have


---------32:30----------
cognitive biases but usually those


---------32:32----------
cognitive biases


---------32:33----------
have to do with people who kiss their


---------32:34----------
ass not like where they sit in the


---------32:36----------
classroom


---------32:39----------
that's true and they usually don't have


---------32:42----------
like a


---------32:42----------
nine point swing unless you really are


---------32:45----------
like you know stuff in your nose way up


---------32:47----------
there


---------32:48----------
[Laughter]


---------32:50----------
right okay i definitely didn't do that


---------32:53----------
yeah so


---------32:54----------
it's it's interesting right


---------32:57----------
and so now we get to opening up because


---------32:59----------
like i i know this sounds kind of weird


---------33:01----------
but like


---------33:01----------
if you open up to people like what do


---------33:04----------
you think they'll see


---------33:11----------
um the vulnerable side


---------33:14----------
yeah but what is in the vulnerable side


---------33:20----------
what is in the vulnerable side yeah so


---------33:23----------
this is where i'm going to try to help


---------33:24----------
you out okay


---------33:25----------
so like i'm going to give you a


---------33:26----------
hypothesis whereas like i think that


---------33:28----------
sometimes the reason that we have


---------33:29----------
difficulty


---------33:30----------
opening up is because we believe that


---------33:33----------
what is on the


---------33:33----------
inside is ugly


---------33:37----------
like that's the biggest reason to not be


---------33:39----------
vulnerable because


---------33:41----------
you don't want to show people like


---------33:42----------
what's ugly


---------33:44----------
right like you can think about people


---------33:45----------
who like are self-conscious about going


---------33:48----------
to the beach because of


---------33:49----------
the body that is underneath their


---------33:51----------
clothes like who's self-conscious about


---------33:53----------
going to the beach it's like people who


---------33:55----------
are like


---------33:55----------
embarrassed to have you know


---------33:59----------
like a flabby stomach or whatever


---------34:02----------
and so like like the people who hesitate


---------34:05----------
to be vulnerable


---------34:06----------
are the ones that have something to hide


---------34:10----------
does that make sense that makes a lot of


---------34:13----------
sense


---------34:15----------
but if i try to think like what


---------34:18----------
things i can talk about


---------34:22----------
i don't i don't really know i'm trying


---------34:24----------
to think like am i am i hiding something


---------34:26----------
because i'm trying to like you know


---------34:27----------
listen to what you're saying right but


---------34:30----------
i don't know if i have have that


---------34:34----------
yep i make sense i i think that it's it


---------34:37----------
seems


---------34:38----------
it seems very inaccessible to me talking


---------34:41----------
to you


---------34:42----------
so we'll get to that in a second but


---------34:44----------
something that i


---------34:45----------
i want you to kind of play around with


---------34:46----------
is like


---------34:48----------
you know i suspect june that you know i


---------34:51----------
mean


---------34:51----------
i don't know this could be wrong but


---------34:53----------
like i think there's this weird like


---------34:54----------
complex of like


---------34:56----------
not being good enough which strives you


---------34:58----------
to be better so you love it


---------35:00----------
but that also means that like you never


---------35:03----------
view yourself as good enough


---------35:05----------
and if you never view yourself as good


---------35:06----------
enough like it can be hard to open up to


---------35:08----------
people because like what are you


---------35:10----------
displaying to them


---------35:13----------
like what do you want to show the world


---------35:14----------
like what do you want people to see you


---------35:16----------
as jun


---------35:19----------
just a fun guy to be around yeah and so


---------35:22----------
if you start telling people like


---------35:24----------
and what are you


---------35:28----------
i think i think i'm a fun guy to be


---------35:30----------
around okay


---------35:33----------
right so i think this is where if you


---------35:34----------
want to be a fun guy to be around like


---------35:36----------
and you start


---------35:37----------
sharing your vulnerabilities with them


---------35:39----------
like what are you then


---------35:43----------
[Music]


---------35:54----------
fun friend i don't think so man


---------35:58----------
right because i don't think you're fun


---------35:59----------
anymore


---------36:03----------
so now we get to like a couple of


---------36:05----------
interesting questions these are shots in


---------36:06----------
the dark okay


---------36:08----------
so on the one hand like maybe we're just


---------36:10----------
digging like i don't really know


---------36:12----------
the first question is have you ever


---------36:14----------
opened up to someone


---------36:15----------
and like been hurt by it


---------36:19----------
have i opened up to someone and been


---------36:20----------
hurt by it yeah


---------36:24----------
um


---------36:28----------
and specifically like we can even like i


---------36:30----------
can ask you very specifically like has


---------36:32----------
there been a case where


---------36:34----------
you felt like someone pulled away from


---------36:36----------
you because you showed them


---------36:38----------
a side of june that is not fun and fun


---------36:40----------
to be around


---------36:45----------
that's the thing i don't think i've done


---------36:47----------
that yet okay that's totally fine


---------36:49----------
so other option is have you been on the


---------36:52----------
receiving end of that


---------36:54----------
where have there been sort of situations


---------36:56----------
where like people have opened up to you


---------36:58----------
or and then like you've sort of seen or


---------37:01----------
you


---------37:02----------
yourself have withdrawn from someone


---------37:04----------
because they show you a part of them i


---------37:06----------
know you're a really good listener so


---------37:08----------
this is probably unlikely but have there


---------37:09----------
been situations where like


---------37:11----------
you kind of pulled back or you saw other


---------37:13----------
people pull back from someone who's


---------37:15----------
vulnerable


---------37:17----------
i think i've seen other people that like


---------37:19----------
told me vulnerable things and then


---------37:20----------
pulled back themselves because they


---------37:23----------
you know kind of exposed that and maybe


---------37:26----------
they thought


---------37:27----------
that i would think differently of them


---------37:29----------
or whatever


---------37:32----------
yeah but how and what ended up happening


---------37:35----------
there so they pulled back and did you


---------37:36----------
let them or


---------37:39----------
um i think it's slowly kind of like


---------37:43----------
drifted apart probably


---------37:53----------
june i feel like we're missing something


---------37:55----------
what do you think


---------37:58----------
i think


---------38:02----------
um i think it's um


---------38:10----------
i think we're focusing too much on like


---------38:13----------
not being good enough part


---------38:15----------
because i don't that's not my main issue


---------38:18----------
okay so what should we be focusing on


---------38:22----------
instead and what's your main issue


---------38:31----------
that's very helpful feedback by the way


---------38:33----------
thank you


---------38:49----------
trying to think as well


---------39:03----------
i think in terms of like friendships and


---------39:05----------
relationships


---------39:07----------
i think like for example let's say


---------39:13----------
in high school i was probably


---------39:20----------
afraid to start a relationship because


---------39:23----------
if i did i was scared of the


---------39:26----------
aftermath because i hate conflict


---------39:31----------
so i hate the awkwardness


---------39:35----------
and i feel like um in the friendships


---------39:37----------
things too if i open up


---------39:39----------
and if someone else opens up and then


---------39:42----------
they felt uncomfortable with that


---------39:44----------
then there's the awkwardness as well


---------39:48----------
okay what do you what help help me


---------39:50----------
understand what you hate about the


---------39:54----------
awkwardness


---------39:58----------
[Music]


---------40:08----------
um


---------40:20----------
you know like the awkwardness when you


---------40:22----------
let's say date someone


---------40:24----------
and then like you're in the front same


---------40:27----------
friend group


---------40:27----------
or or whatever


---------40:31----------
and then there's like that tension there


---------40:33----------
as well like if you didn't date


---------40:36----------
it wouldn't be awkward for anyone


---------40:39----------
involved


---------40:41----------
so you're trying to protect people or


---------40:43----------
yourself from the awkwardness


---------40:47----------
yeah i think for myself yeah so june do


---------40:50----------
you mind if i


---------40:51----------
you don't have to answer this so i'm


---------40:52----------
gonna ask a pretty specific personal


---------40:54----------
question are you


---------40:54----------
in a relationship right now no


---------40:58----------
have you been in a relationship that's


---------40:59----------
serious before


---------41:01----------
um not a serious one can you tell me


---------41:05----------
about


---------41:06----------
a relationship that you have been in


---------41:09----------
uh yeah it's quite a long time ago


---------41:12----------
though


---------41:14----------
yeah tell me about it


---------41:21----------
um it was more of like


---------41:24----------
the girl liked me so i was like oh a


---------41:27----------
cute girl likes me so you know i got


---------41:29----------
into the relationship


---------41:31----------
um but then i think i learned from that


---------41:34----------
relationship that


---------41:35----------
you shouldn't really like get into a


---------41:37----------
relationship just because you're lonely


---------41:39----------
and the other person is lonely and then


---------41:41----------
you know you have less like infatuation


---------41:43----------
because like the aftermath is like oh i


---------41:46----------
don't want to see that person anymore


---------41:49----------
oh i don't want to see their like


---------41:51----------
friends anymore either


---------41:52----------
so i feel like just makes everything


---------41:53----------
like kind of uncomfortable


---------41:57----------
okay so what happens in a relationship


---------42:04----------
um it's mostly like just too different


---------42:11----------
yeah so so that's maybe why the


---------42:12----------
relationship kind of


---------42:14----------
ended but can you help me understand


---------42:16----------
like what it looked like from the


---------42:18----------
outside or what the sequence of sort of


---------42:20----------
events were


---------42:23----------
well i was like super young i was like


---------42:25----------
14 so


---------42:27----------
relationship since then no


---------42:31----------
how do you feel about that


---------42:35----------
[Music]


---------42:40----------
i don't really have strong like super


---------42:41----------
strong feelings about it but i do feel


---------42:43----------
like i'm missing out


---------42:48----------
because because i focus so much on like


---------42:49----------
rust like from my 18 to like 23


---------42:53----------
like i didn't really travel that much i


---------42:55----------
didn't really live life


---------42:58----------
i didn't really date didn't really go


---------43:00----------
outside so


---------43:02----------
i do feel like i'm missing out and maybe


---------43:03----------
that's like


---------43:05----------
part of the reason why i'm not satisfied


---------43:07----------
with all the other things


---------43:08----------
because i'm only focused on one thing


---------43:11----------
okay


---------43:12----------
so when you say missing out how does


---------43:15----------
that feel


---------43:21----------
missing out how does that feel


---------43:26----------
if that question is hard for you i can


---------43:28----------
ask it a different way


---------43:30----------
sure do you ever think about what the


---------43:32----------
consequences of missing out are


---------43:37----------
you don't know what it's like what does


---------43:40----------
that mean for you going forward


---------43:44----------
makes me curious really


---------43:50----------
that's why i want to travel more once um


---------43:54----------
it gets better with covert and stuff


---------43:58----------
june do you ever feel like what i was


---------44:00----------
expecting to hear was something along


---------44:02----------
the lines of actually like being a


---------44:03----------
little bit afraid that like once you've


---------44:05----------
missed out like it's really hard


---------44:08----------
because like now like everyone's kind of


---------44:10----------
past you


---------44:12----------
right and so if you try to like date


---------44:13----------
someone


---------44:15----------
sometimes people will feel like oh like


---------44:18----------
she's gonna be more experienced than i


---------44:20----------
am and like i'm not


---------44:23----------
really gonna be sure like it'll be


---------44:25----------
awkward


---------44:29----------
do you ever have thoughts like that


---------44:32----------
not really interesting okay


---------44:38----------
see i think i know what kind of


---------44:39----------
questions you're asking and i know


---------44:41----------
i know the answers that could be said


---------44:43----------
but like


---------44:45----------
it's i don't know it's just not like


---------44:49----------
that for me


---------44:50----------
yep and i know i know i know people can


---------44:52----------
be like oh he's just hiding it but like


---------44:54----------
i don't my my feeling of the


---------44:57----------
satisfaction is that


---------44:59----------
it's it's that i don't really feel those


---------45:01----------
things and that's what makes it feel


---------45:03----------
empty


---------45:07----------
yeah so it looks like what we're coming


---------45:10----------
back to


---------45:11----------
so i'm i'm really happy you said that


---------45:13----------
june because i i don't think that just


---------45:15----------
because


---------45:16----------
you know so like we can it's just as


---------45:19----------
important to close off the wrong paths


---------45:21----------
as it is to find the right one


---------45:25----------
so in medicine you know we have this


---------45:27----------
concept called differential diagnosis


---------45:30----------
and like you know if someone has a fever


---------45:32----------
like maybe it's the flu maybe it's


---------45:33----------
coveted maybe it's


---------45:35----------
you know strep throat maybe it's


---------45:38----------
lymphoma


---------45:39----------
or lupus and sometimes in medicine we


---------45:42----------
have to order tests


---------45:43----------
not to necessarily find the right


---------45:45----------
diagnosis


---------45:46----------
but we'll order a test to make sure it


---------45:49----------
isn't lymphoma


---------45:50----------
in order test to make sure it isn't


---------45:54----------
lupus and so we can almost use like a


---------45:57----------
process of elimination approach


---------46:01----------
and so i think i think part of what


---------46:03----------
we're doing here today is sort of a


---------46:04----------
process of elimination approach


---------46:06----------
what do you think yeah i had a tough


---------46:08----------
time answering those questions actually


---------46:10----------
yep and if you think about it it's like


---------46:12----------
really simple questions


---------46:14----------
why do you think you have a tough time


---------46:15----------
answering them


---------46:20----------
because i think if you ask like like how


---------46:22----------
do you feel about that right


---------46:25----------
it's like


---------46:29----------
that's the thing i didn't really feel


---------46:30----------
anything about that yep


---------46:33----------
and so i feel like i feel like that


---------46:34----------
would be like a


---------46:37----------
super mundane answer


---------46:41----------
but then like if i said anything else it


---------46:43----------
would be it'll be a lie


---------46:44----------
yep and so how do you feel about giving


---------46:47----------
me on dana


---------46:48----------
mundane answers hey you know what i


---------46:52----------
think i think i tied this together


---------46:55----------
huh because because i don't have


---------46:57----------
experiences like that


---------47:00----------
i feel like that's why i can't open up


---------47:02----------
because i don't want to i don't want to


---------47:03----------
give boring answers


---------47:08----------
okay okay yeah so


---------47:12----------
you feel like the answers that you give


---------47:14----------
when you open up aren't going to be good


---------47:15----------
enough


---------47:16----------
they'll be boring no i'm i'm being


---------47:19----------
completely honest right now like i'm not


---------47:20----------
trying to like


---------47:21----------
i'm making sure honestly i'm talking i'm


---------47:23----------
talking about other people though


---------47:29----------
right because you say that like if i


---------47:30----------
offer what's on the inside


---------47:32----------
it's gonna feel bland to people


---------47:35----------
yes right so like i'm just noticing


---------47:39----------
an interesting theme like sure i get


---------47:40----------
that it's bland


---------47:42----------
and i'm not i i know i i get the sense


---------47:44----------
you're being authentic with me i don't


---------47:46----------
think you're trying to like you know


---------47:48----------
hide i don't i genuinely don't think


---------47:50----------
you're hiding but at the same time i do


---------47:53----------
notice that there's sort of like a theme


---------47:56----------
that like what you have to give isn't


---------47:58----------
good enough


---------48:05----------
yeah that could be a thing so then let


---------48:08----------
me ask you this like


---------48:09----------
so let's go let's go to the emotional


---------48:11----------
moderation then


---------48:12----------
so you you don't feel things quite as


---------48:15----------
intensely as other people feel them


---------48:18----------
and i'm very jealous of that so like if


---------48:20----------
people are like


---------48:22----------
super sad about something or like if


---------48:24----------
someone's super ecstatic about something


---------48:28----------
like i see that i'm like i wish i had


---------48:30----------
that


---------48:32----------
um have you ever felt


---------48:36----------
super sad or excited about something


---------48:41----------
super sad or excited about something


---------48:48----------
i think i probably have but like in


---------48:49----------
hindsight if i look back to it


---------48:52----------
i think i always like downplay it


---------48:55----------
so like during the moment i was probably


---------48:57----------
super excited but then like if i look


---------48:59----------
back like two years later


---------49:00----------
i'd be like oh it wasn't that good


---------49:04----------
so i don't remember that feeling as


---------49:07----------
intensely as i probably had it when it


---------49:09----------
happened


---------49:11----------
so like if i try to look back right now


---------49:13----------
like i can't really recall


---------49:16----------
any specific moment to tell you


---------49:20----------
um do you ever let me just think about


---------49:23----------
this


---------49:24----------
okay so june here's so i know this may


---------49:26----------
be like a little bit


---------49:27----------
unsatisfying but i'm gonna like toss out


---------49:31----------
like a possibility okay so have you ever


---------49:33----------
heard of this term alexithymia


---------49:36----------
no so alexithymia is a condition


---------49:39----------
in which you are not aware of what your


---------49:42----------
internal emotions are


---------49:44----------
so it's almost like you're colorblind to


---------49:46----------
emotion


---------49:49----------
so lexithymi is very common um


---------49:53----------
in like three populations so like


---------49:57----------
you know a lot of like asians are alexa


---------50:00----------
thymic


---------50:01----------
um indians too uh


---------50:04----------
men and gamers so if you think about


---------50:08----------
like the culture that you grew up in


---------50:10----------
what was like was there a lot of emotion


---------50:13----------
expressed in your household growing up


---------50:16----------
no did your parents tell you that they


---------50:19----------
loved you


---------50:21----------
i think no okay i could see that i mean


---------50:25----------
they


---------50:26----------
are great parents yep and i could feel


---------50:29----------
the love


---------50:30----------
but we never verbally said it and i


---------50:32----------
think


---------50:33----------
at when i was like around 17


---------50:37----------
i think i had a feeling where i was like


---------50:38----------
why is my family not


---------50:40----------
like the ones i see in movies like


---------50:44----------
the ones you see in movies are like


---------50:45----------
saying oh i love you and like


---------50:47----------
doing like all this affectionate stuff


---------50:49----------
but then i realized


---------50:51----------
that like part of the problem is not


---------50:54----------
just my parents


---------50:55----------
it's also me i was also afraid to say i


---------50:58----------
love you


---------50:58----------
like i would say like i love you too


---------51:00----------
like girls like that i didn't even


---------51:02----------
[ __ ] care about


---------51:03----------
when i was younger but then i was so


---------51:05----------
scared to say that to my mom


---------51:07----------
right so i think starting from then


---------51:11----------
i did start saying it to my mom and dad


---------51:14----------
and then we are pretty regularly saying


---------51:17----------
that now


---------51:19----------
what made you scared to say that to your


---------51:21----------
mom and dad


---------51:23----------
it's embarrassing it was embarrassing at


---------51:26----------
first


---------51:27----------
what's embarrassing about it


---------51:31----------
well i think growing up and not doing


---------51:35----------
that kind of stuff and then all of a


---------51:36----------
sudden doing it


---------51:41----------
when you're an angsty teenager i think


---------51:43----------
that's pretty


---------51:46----------
um you're like going to put in a


---------51:52----------
pretty vulnerable place i think


---------51:55----------
and what if i say that what if i say


---------51:57----------
that and then you know


---------51:59----------
the response is like oh why are you


---------52:02----------
saying that


---------52:03----------
or whatever


---------52:06----------
and and i'm curious is is that


---------52:10----------
so we're talking about vulnerability and


---------52:12----------
how people may respond to it


---------52:16----------
um you know but it sounds like you've


---------52:18----------
never been in a situation where you have


---------52:20----------
opened up to someone so it sounds like


---------52:21----------
you were actually vulnerable with your


---------52:23----------
parents like you went on a limb


---------52:24----------
and you said i love you and they said i


---------52:27----------
love you too you're great june


---------52:30----------
yes yeah so


---------52:35----------
i feel like that's significant and


---------52:37----------
relates to our conversation but i'm not


---------52:39----------
quite sure how


---------52:40----------
what do you think


---------52:43----------
i think i think something's clicking


---------52:48----------
i think um just like


---------52:51----------
can't really expect other people to be


---------52:54----------
vulnerable with me if i don't take the


---------52:55----------
initiative


---------52:57----------
to be vulnerable with them as well sure


---------53:00----------
because that's like saying i love you to


---------53:02----------
your mom or that's like i don't know


---------53:04----------
sharing like something


---------53:05----------
emotional with your friends


---------53:08----------
what would you share


---------53:12----------
i don't know that's what i'm


---------53:16----------
trying to figure out yeah so i i feel


---------53:19----------
like that's


---------53:20----------
i feel like something clicked for me


---------53:21----------
there too i don't know exactly what it


---------53:23----------
is but it certainly has the themes of


---------53:25----------
vulnerability


---------53:26----------
going out on a limb being accepted


---------53:30----------
you know and i think this is where when


---------53:31----------
i when we talk about culture so i think


---------53:33----------
that like


---------53:34----------
like so you know june it sounds like


---------53:36----------
you're good at singing sounds like


---------53:38----------
you're good at dancing sounds like


---------53:39----------
you're good at basketball it sounds like


---------53:40----------
you're really good at rust


---------53:43----------
and so when it comes to understanding


---------53:45----------
our emotions that's a skill too


---------53:48----------
right so like we we can be just like you


---------53:50----------
can train your palate


---------53:52----------
or train your eyesight or train your you


---------53:55----------
know your reflexes


---------53:57----------
your hand-eye coordination your ability


---------54:00----------
to like get the


---------54:01----------
ball in the basket you can also train


---------54:04----------
yourself to understand


---------54:05----------
what you feel on the inside and there


---------54:08----------
are a couple of different things that i


---------54:10----------
think could be going on so i'm going to


---------54:11----------
go like academic for a second


---------54:13----------
and let's like forget yeah because


---------54:16----------
because i'll ask you lots of questions


---------54:17----------
about how you feel about stuff and


---------54:19----------
you'll


---------54:19----------
you generally give me umbrella terms so


---------54:22----------
you'll say like


---------54:23----------
uncomfortable or awkward but like


---------54:26----------
what is awkward right so like usually


---------54:28----------
awkwardness is an umbrella term


---------54:30----------
that like means something like fear of


---------54:33----------
judgment


---------54:34----------
for feeling guilty for making like


---------54:36----------
destroying your friend group


---------54:38----------
right so when i think about like the


---------54:40----------
actual emotions


---------54:42----------
that people are feeling if you date


---------54:44----------
someone in your friend group and then


---------54:46----------
y'all


---------54:46----------
break up there's actually a whole


---------54:50----------
constellation of feelings there


---------54:52----------
that we call awkward because we don't


---------54:53----------
know how to


---------54:55----------
define what they are okay i i gotta know


---------54:57----------
right so like


---------54:58----------
let's just think through what people


---------55:00----------
could be feeling the first is you guys


---------55:01----------
go to a party


---------55:03----------
and then like all of your friend group


---------55:04----------
is there or maybe


---------55:06----------
even before the party starts it's like


---------55:08----------
people are texting each other


---------55:09----------
and then you feel guilty because like


---------55:12----------
people don't know like who to text


---------55:14----------
it's supposed to be fun but now that you


---------55:16----------
and your girlfriend broke up


---------55:18----------
the entire group like can't have fun


---------55:20----------
anymore


---------55:21----------
so maybe you feel guilty yes


---------55:24----------
right but like guilty yeah but it's


---------55:26----------
weird because like you don't


---------55:28----------
like we don't put words to that or maybe


---------55:30----------
you feel ashamed


---------55:31----------
like maybe you feel like you know she


---------55:34----------
has some friends in the friend group


---------55:36----------
that are closer to her than


---------55:38----------
closer to you and as she's crying every


---------55:41----------
day


---------55:41----------
like she's gonna make you look bad


---------55:44----------
because the friends are gonna think oh


---------55:46----------
you're an [ __ ]


---------55:47----------
and so then like maybe you feel a little


---------55:50----------
like you that can create all kinds of


---------55:52----------
feelings maybe you feel a little bit


---------55:53----------
shamed ashamed for hurting her


---------55:56----------
maybe you feel a little bit like angry


---------56:00----------
because


---------56:01----------
she's talking [ __ ] about you and like


---------56:03----------
since those are her friends better like


---------56:05----------
they're gonna start thinking less of you


---------56:07----------
and you don't deserve that


---------56:10----------
[Music]


---------56:12----------
does that make sense that people could


---------56:13----------
kind of feel that way


---------56:15----------
yeah that makes a lot of sense because i


---------56:17----------
for me i was like oh awkward okay that


---------56:20----------
encapsulates what i feel really well but


---------56:22----------
now that you like


---------56:23----------
break it down i can see what you mean


---------56:25----------
that right so so and


---------56:27----------
and then there's like they're even all


---------56:29----------
like all kinds of kinds of other layers


---------56:31----------
like


---------56:31----------
what if you're crushing a little bit on


---------56:33----------
someone else in the friend group


---------56:35----------
and so like what's gonna happen there


---------56:37----------
now that you broke up with this person


---------56:40----------
or like what if one of your friends is


---------56:42----------
crushing on her


---------56:44----------
and now you broke up with her and now


---------56:46----------
you've like that's complex


---------56:48----------
it's very complex yeah i


---------56:51----------
i don't like that at all okay


---------56:55----------
so now i hate conflict of any kind okay


---------56:59----------
so now we're getting somewhere so the


---------57:01----------
first thing is like


---------57:03----------
what do you hate about conflict


---------57:06----------
i just don't want to have any bad blood


---------57:08----------
with anyone why


---------57:09----------
why i want all my interactions to be


---------57:12----------
positive


---------57:13----------
yeah so that's why you're not going to


---------57:14----------
open up to anyone


---------57:18----------
hmm maybe that's it right because you


---------57:21----------
gotta like


---------57:22----------
here's the thing like so here's the


---------57:24----------
thing june so when it comes to alexa


---------57:25----------
thymia


---------57:27----------
what happens so this is what happens is


---------57:29----------
like so culturally we're like taught to


---------57:31----------
sort of suppress emotions so we don't


---------57:32----------
like


---------57:33----------
understand what they are so we use these


---------57:35----------
terms like awkward right


---------57:36----------
fine secondly when you play a lot of


---------57:38----------
video games like literally


---------57:40----------
video games will shut off like i was


---------57:42----------
just talking about this i can't believe


---------57:43----------
this


---------57:43----------
but video games will shut off your


---------57:46----------
amygdala


---------57:47----------
which is like the part of your brain


---------57:48----------
that experiences emotions


---------57:50----------
yeah right absolutely right so like rust


---------57:54----------
is like


---------57:55----------
so so then what's happening is you've


---------57:56----------
got like you know eight hours a day or


---------57:58----------
whatever where you're like playing rust


---------58:00----------
and so what you're doing is you're like


---------58:02----------
switching off this emotional circuitry


---------58:04----------
so it starts to get rusty


---------58:07----------
and then on top of it it sounds like


---------58:09----------
you're a dude


---------58:11----------
and so like generally speaking


---------58:12----------
especially like like culturally


---------58:14----------
in most cultures that like you know


---------58:18----------
women


---------58:19----------
will emotionally express things to each


---------58:21----------
other


---------58:22----------
in a platonic way but as men


---------58:26----------
like you know like like it's weird we


---------58:28----------
use like the language of body


---------58:30----------
right so like if i get like dumped by my


---------58:34----------
girlfriend


---------58:34----------
or if i break up with my girlfriend i'm


---------58:36----------
not gonna come to you and say


---------58:38----------
hey june i feel really bad about myself


---------58:42----------
and then you're gonna say like yeah man


---------58:43----------
sucks bro and then i'm not gonna say


---------58:45----------
like


---------58:46----------
yeah i'm now afraid i'm now afraid that


---------58:49----------
i will never be able to find love again


---------58:51----------
and that there's something fundamentally


---------58:53----------
broken in me because i couldn't make


---------58:54----------
this relationship work


---------58:56----------
that's so true right what i'm gonna say


---------59:00----------
you're gonna be like sucks bro and i'm


---------59:02----------
like yeah man i'm gonna be like yeah it


---------59:04----------
feels like she tore my nut sack off


---------59:06----------
and you're like yeah man i know exactly


---------59:07----------
what you're talking about


---------59:11----------
yeah i see i see girls do that a lot


---------59:13----------
like like being like super


---------59:14----------
like open with each other and you know


---------59:18----------
being like very descriptive with their


---------59:21----------
words and like


---------59:22----------
you know actually explaining their


---------59:24----------
emotions well i i i'm really jealous of


---------59:26----------
that


---------59:26----------
because like if i try to uh like when


---------59:29----------
you ask me


---------59:30----------
about my emotions like i had no idea


---------59:32----------
what to say yeah


---------59:34----------
yep so so so i think that like the first


---------59:36----------
problem here is alexa thymia


---------59:38----------
because when i point it out to you right


---------59:41----------
so like so


---------59:42----------
even if we pay attention i don't know if


---------59:44----------
this makes sense june but how are you


---------59:46----------
feeling emotionally right now


---------59:50----------
right now yeah um


---------59:54----------
so i i'm not actually i'm not gonna feel


---------59:56----------
like it's getting getting more clear


---------59:57----------
yes okay so that's but that's not an


---------59:59----------
emotion


---------60:01----------
oh man right it's an emotion yeah yeah


---------60:04----------
it's it's okay it's okay


---------60:05----------
don't get frustrated so like what is


---------60:07----------
what is the energy of the conversation


---------60:09----------
now


---------60:12----------
what's the energy it's a little bit more


---------60:15----------
comfortable yep right so like there's a


---------60:17----------
change in the tone of your voice


---------60:20----------
you're laughing


---------60:24----------
right whereas like before it clicked


---------60:27----------
yeah before it's like


---------60:28----------
hmm because i couldn't really think of


---------60:32----------
like what to say


---------60:33----------
right so so what's happening how to


---------60:34----------
describe what i was thinking


---------60:36----------
totally fine so like as we get closer to


---------60:39----------
the truth


---------60:41----------
some kind of emotion is going to come up


---------60:43----------
and like it doesn't matter what it is


---------60:45----------
it's like in what we're hearing you do


---------60:47----------
is laughing like i can


---------60:49----------
hear the animation in your voice


---------60:53----------
and there's the hmm


---------60:58----------
i can't help it yeah that's fine you


---------61:00----------
don't need to help it like we're we're


---------61:01----------
here to help it right it's it's totally


---------61:03----------
fine


---------61:03----------
you do you baby so


---------61:06----------
so like it and that's where like okay so


---------61:09----------
because now as i as i explain these


---------61:11----------
emotions to you like


---------61:12----------
you know i know this sounds kind of


---------61:13----------
weird jun sometimes i say things that


---------61:15----------
sound so basic they sound idiotic but


---------61:17----------
when i point these possibilities out to


---------61:19----------
you you


---------61:20----------
understand exactly right so like but


---------61:24----------
you can't understand when i point it out


---------61:26----------
unless on some level you know


---------61:29----------
if you truly did not feel those things


---------61:32----------
and i said oh like maybe this person is


---------61:34----------
feeling this you'd be like scratching


---------61:35----------
your head you'll be like


---------61:37----------
yeah i can sort of see that does that


---------61:38----------
make sense


---------61:40----------
yeah but you're like yes yes i can


---------61:43----------
i can understand all those things i'm


---------61:45----------
conflict-avoided like you call it


---------61:47----------
conflict avoid it because that's what it


---------61:49----------
looks like from the outside or that's


---------61:51----------
the surface level


---------61:52----------
way that you describe it but really what


---------61:55----------
it is is like i can't tolerate people


---------61:58----------
disliking me


---------62:01----------
[Music]


---------62:03----------
right and so if we think about you know


---------62:06----------
why can't you tolerate people disliking


---------62:07----------
you like


---------62:08----------
there's an emotion there that could be


---------62:10----------
fear


---------62:12----------
i'm afraid i can't i can't tolerate


---------62:16----------
people that i like disliking me


---------62:19----------
yeah that's what scares me if someone


---------62:21----------
random


---------62:22----------
internet stranger didn't like me i


---------62:24----------
wouldn't care at all


---------62:25----------
absolutely so now my family or my


---------62:28----------
friends or


---------62:29----------
let's say like my community then i'll be


---------62:31----------
like oh


---------62:32----------
there must be something i did wrong and


---------62:35----------
that would bother me a lot


---------62:36----------
so so now we get to so there's origins


---------62:38----------
to that but before we go there like now


---------62:40----------
we get to the vulnerability


---------62:42----------
so anytime you have a surface level


---------62:45----------
relationship with someone


---------62:48----------
and you be vulnerable with them what are


---------62:50----------
the possible


---------62:51----------
outcomes of that vulnerability


---------62:56----------
[Music]


---------62:59----------
you wouldn't talk to them anymore


---------63:00----------
possibly right it either strengthens the


---------63:03----------
relationship


---------63:04----------
or shatters the relationship yeah


---------63:08----------
and so like i can sort of see like why


---------63:10----------
you may feel


---------63:11----------
like i imagine that you almost feel


---------63:13----------
paralyzed in these relationships like


---------63:16----------
you're kind of stuck


---------63:17----------
at the surface level


---------63:22----------
and and i think if you really look into


---------63:24----------
that one of the possibilities is that


---------63:26----------
like


---------63:27----------
you don't know how to make sure that


---------63:29----------
when you vulnerably express something


---------63:32----------
that it's going to advance the


---------63:33----------
relationship forward


---------63:35----------
yeah i have no clue you don't know how


---------63:38----------
to say something that


---------63:39----------
won't make things awkward


---------63:47----------
not awkward like i can i can


---------63:53----------
so it's not i can't i can't talk about


---------63:55----------
like personal stuff without making it


---------63:56----------
awkward that's what i mean yeah so so


---------63:58----------
you don't know like you can talk about


---------63:59----------
surface level stuff but like it's your


---------64:01----------
avoidant like you don't want to make


---------64:03----------
things awkward right june


---------64:04----------
like scale of one to ten with friends of


---------64:07----------
yours


---------64:09----------
ten being is absolutely terrible one


---------64:12----------
being is no big deal


---------64:13----------
how much do you want to avoid


---------64:15----------
awkwardness


---------64:19----------
so they're not on any awkwardness right


---------64:22----------
so like


---------64:23----------
and now this is like the crux of it


---------64:24----------
because if you're


---------64:26----------
like you don't know how to be vulnerable


---------64:27----------
with someone without making it awkward


---------64:31----------
and so you're avoiding awkwardness at


---------64:32----------
all costs the


---------64:34----------
er ergo like you can't be vulnerable


---------64:36----------
with anyone


---------64:39----------
and so the challenge here is it comes


---------64:41----------
down to control june


---------64:43----------
like the whole point about advancing a


---------64:45----------
relationship i know this sounds weird


---------64:47----------
and it's gonna sound terrifying


---------64:48----------
and if you're trying to figure out how


---------64:50----------
you feel when i'm about to say what i'm


---------64:52----------
gonna say


---------64:52----------
the answer is terror when you are


---------64:56----------
vulnerable with someone


---------64:57----------
you are opening the door to awkwardness


---------65:01----------
you are seeding control of the


---------65:03----------
relationship and it could rupture


---------65:08----------
how does that make you feel


---------65:12----------
very afraid there it is and so now we


---------65:15----------
see why you can't open up because that's


---------65:17----------
the whole point about vulnerability


---------65:18----------
right it's like


---------65:20----------
i'm gonna let like vulnerability is like


---------65:22----------
like literally the word means


---------65:24----------
i'm going to let give you the


---------65:26----------
opportunity to hurt me


---------65:28----------
and right now you control your [ __ ]


---------65:30----------
charismatic guy aren't you june


---------65:34----------
you're so good at making friends you are


---------65:36----------
so good at getting people to like you


---------65:39----------
you can show this shell to people and


---------65:42----------
you can like man


---------65:43----------
everyone when they meet june within 15


---------65:45----------
minutes look at this chad


---------65:47----------
okay dancer


---------65:51----------
you're gassing me up a little bit too


---------65:52----------
much right no but like come on bro like


---------65:58----------
tell me i'm wrong tell me if i if i met


---------66:01----------
you in real life in 20 minutes


---------66:03----------
would i like you


---------66:07----------
uh maybe i think the answer is yes


---------66:13----------
right look at [ __ ] look at how humble


---------66:14----------
you are i hope so


---------66:17----------
how how down to earth is this guy right


---------66:19----------
like he's not an arrogant prick he's


---------66:21----------
just like so


---------66:22----------
like how is that not the perfect


---------66:24----------
response


---------66:27----------
like just think about it right it's


---------66:28----------
perfect i hope you like me man


---------66:31----------
like i'm confident in myself and i hope


---------66:32----------
you can appreciate that


---------66:34----------
but you don't say no because you don't


---------66:36----------
have [ __ ] low self-esteem and you


---------66:37----------
don't say yes because you're not an


---------66:39----------
arrogant prick


---------66:40----------
it's so perfect it's so [ __ ] silky


---------66:42----------
smooth man like teflon right here


---------66:44----------
wd-40


---------66:48----------
oh man because people do like you right


---------66:50----------
june


---------66:52----------
uh i like to think so yeah yeah well


---------66:56----------
it's still so humble


---------66:57----------
right like it you can state it without


---------66:59----------
being arrogant like i think you're


---------67:00----------
you're probably charismatic


---------67:02----------
and like now the problem though is that


---------67:04----------
like that


---------67:06----------
shell which you have which makes people


---------67:09----------
like you


---------67:10----------
is something that you have to discard


---------67:12----------
and you have to make


---------67:14----------
like risk making things awkward if you


---------67:16----------
want to advance the relationship


---------67:18----------
[Music]


---------67:19----------
and like you know when it comes to girls


---------67:21----------
i don't know if like the reason that you


---------67:23----------
i mean i'm assuming that you're


---------67:24----------
heterosexual because it sounded like you


---------67:25----------
were talking about a girlfriend but


---------67:27----------
yeah um you know like


---------67:30----------
i mean i don't know if it's like because


---------67:33----------
you've become a big youtuber and


---------67:34----------
streamer that you don't really have


---------67:35----------
opportunities to engage in relationships


---------67:37----------
or


---------67:38----------
there like have been girls that you've


---------67:41----------
been interested in


---------67:42----------
and like something has kept you


---------67:45----------
from like asking them out


---------67:50----------
yeah i've actually never asked someone


---------67:52----------
out before


---------67:53----------
okay so like here we go baby so like


---------67:58----------
when you think about asking someone out


---------68:04----------
what are you afraid of right i'm like


---------68:06----------
it's like golden word


---------68:07----------
is awkward there it is right there it is


---------68:10----------
again


---------68:12----------
and so like what like but awkward it's


---------68:14----------
not a thing


---------68:16----------
right it's just like it's like it's not


---------68:19----------
a thing


---------68:19----------
it's yeah it's an umbrella term like i


---------68:23----------
get that it makes things awkward but


---------68:24----------
like what is the awkwardness that you're


---------68:26----------
trying to avoid is it like


---------68:28----------
oh we're kind of friends right now and i


---------68:29----------
don't want to screw that like what is


---------68:31----------
like


---------68:31----------
it's it's there jude like don't like you


---------68:33----------
may not be able to find it but like


---------68:35----------
i don't even know if we're gonna find it


---------68:36----------
today but it's there right what like


---------68:39----------
when you


---------68:39----------
i guess i'm gonna have to guess because


---------68:41----------
i don't know if you can find it but like


---------68:43----------
so there's this girl like so tell me


---------68:44----------
about it like can you do you feel okay


---------68:46----------
talking about a girl or is that too


---------68:47----------
awkward


---------68:48----------
no i can talk i can talk so like talk to


---------68:50----------
me about a girl that you liked


---------68:53----------
okay i think there's only like two girls


---------68:55----------
that i actually seriously liked


---------68:57----------
and it's mostly people that were


---------69:00----------
what i was super interested at the time


---------69:03----------
and they were what i considered like


---------69:07----------
like the most passionate about it


---------69:10----------
i think i think passion is a big thing


---------69:12----------
so like passion's a big turn on for you


---------69:15----------
yes so one of them was like a martial


---------69:17----------
art right and they would always like


---------69:19----------
work super


---------69:20----------
hard so like i would first get that


---------69:21----------
attention and then it's like admiration


---------69:23----------
oh


---------69:24----------
wow this person's working so hard like


---------69:26----------
i'll work as hard as them and then it


---------69:29----------
turns into infatuation


---------69:32----------
so it sounds like what do you mean by


---------69:34----------
infatuation


---------69:37----------
well you admire them as people first and


---------69:40----------
then


---------69:42----------
and then you start liking them okay


---------69:46----------
and so and so like what did you want to


---------69:48----------
like and that you thought about asking


---------69:50----------
her out


---------69:52----------
um


---------69:56----------
the first girl actually did like me back


---------70:00----------
but then i don't know i just like


---------70:04----------
it was kind of gone the second girl was


---------70:06----------
like in dance


---------70:10----------
and it was like the same thing like she


---------70:12----------
was like super good at dance and i was


---------70:14----------
like


---------70:14----------
wow like she was super passionate about


---------70:17----------
it


---------70:17----------
and then i liked her like as a person


---------70:20----------
and as like a dancer


---------70:22----------
and then i wanted to be i wanted to be


---------70:23----------
like them and then


---------70:25----------
i started liking them afterwards and


---------70:28----------
then what happened


---------70:32----------
the two are kind of different because


---------70:34----------
the first one


---------70:36----------
i kind of did say wait i didn't really


---------70:38----------
ask her out but


---------70:40----------
we kind of figured out that we liked


---------70:42----------
each other but then


---------70:43----------
it kind of fizzled out so i don't really


---------70:45----------
have much to say about that


---------70:47----------
what do you mean by it kind of fizzled


---------70:49----------
out


---------70:50----------
i think i just lost interest


---------70:55----------
okay so june i want to just like point


---------70:58----------
out to you what i'm seeing okay like


---------71:00----------
let me know if you feel judged but like


---------71:02----------
i'm seeing like blind spots


---------71:03----------
in this conversation


---------71:06----------
right so it's it's like you can trust me


---------71:08----------
i do too yeah yeah yeah yeah


---------71:10----------
so it seems really weird but that's just


---------71:12----------
how it was yeah yeah no i i understand


---------71:14----------
so i think what we've got to do is like


---------71:16----------
increase your like ability to detect


---------71:18----------
right so like


---------71:19----------
like here's this girl you're infatuated


---------71:22----------
with her


---------71:22----------
you respect her as a human being like


---------71:24----------
how are you not just like the perfect


---------71:26----------
boyfriend jun


---------71:27----------
like you respect her as a human first


---------71:31----------
and then like you like you you like her


---------71:34----------
you guys like each other


---------71:35----------
and then it fizzles out it's like that


---------71:39----------
sounds like lost interest


---------71:41----------
maybe maybe it was because like if i if


---------71:44----------
i really try to think about it


---------71:46----------
i think um


---------71:51----------
because i saw her in like such a


---------71:53----------
positive light at first


---------71:55----------
like once i got to know her maybe she


---------71:58----------
wasn't what i expected


---------72:00----------
and then it fizzled out is that the case


---------72:04----------
i think that was the case for the first


---------72:05----------
one okay what about the second one


---------72:08----------
the second one i never really made a


---------72:10----------
move


---------72:12----------
what kept you from making a move


---------72:18----------
probably just insecurity what does that


---------72:22----------
mean


---------72:24----------
because i like regarded her so highly i


---------72:27----------
just didn't think


---------72:29----------
that i'll be good enough


---------72:33----------
i'm sorry have we talked about that


---------72:34----------
before you not being good enough


---------72:40----------
right so so now it's interesting because


---------72:43----------
like you know were you afraid that


---------72:45----------
things would get awkward if you asked


---------72:46----------
her out


---------72:49----------
um yeah because i enjoyed our company


---------72:52----------
like


---------72:53----------
even without dating but then if i


---------72:58----------
cross that line that would be gone too


---------73:01----------
yep


---------73:01----------
so so that's the thing right so like


---------73:04----------
remember like so this is why i think


---------73:05----------
your relationship state okay so june


---------73:07----------
this is tying together for me now okay


---------73:10----------
may not tie together for you but it's


---------73:12----------
seeming like we're kind of hitting these


---------73:14----------
same notes like over and over and over


---------73:15----------
again


---------73:16----------
i don't know if it's because i'm making


---------73:18----------
like i'm drawing a constellation out of


---------73:20----------
stars


---------73:21----------
and there really isn't like a horse in


---------73:23----------
the sky it's just stars


---------73:24----------
it's all over the place there's no


---------73:26----------
there's no image with my constellation


---------73:28----------
so maybe it's just me over interpreting


---------73:30----------
because that's a bias of people in my


---------73:31----------
profession


---------73:32----------
is we like to come we like to listen to


---------73:34----------
human beings and reduce them to simple


---------73:36----------
patterns that we can divine


---------73:38----------
out of our psychiatric brilliance so i


---------73:40----------
could be falling into that trap


---------73:42----------
but i really don't think so so here's


---------73:45----------
what i'm hearing from you okay so the


---------73:46----------
first thing is that like


---------73:48----------
you like this person and then like the


---------73:51----------
problem is that like


---------73:52----------
at some point to advance the


---------73:53----------
relationship you've got to take a risk


---------73:57----------
right like and this is where like stuff


---------73:58----------
comes together so there's this girl


---------74:00----------
she's in dance like you respect her


---------74:02----------
because she puts in the work like you


---------74:04----------
put in the work it's something that you


---------74:05----------
pride very heavily about yourself


---------74:07----------
you may not be the smartest kid in the


---------74:09----------
bunch you may not be the gold medalist


---------74:10----------
but god damn it you're gonna at least


---------74:12----------
get a bronze because like


---------74:14----------
you can progress like you can put in the


---------74:15----------
work and you can put in the time


---------74:17----------
and here she is she's into dance she's


---------74:19----------
probably in shape


---------74:20----------
she's relatively hot and then like you


---------74:23----------
know so


---------74:23----------
you're like you're into her and you guys


---------74:26----------
are friends because you're


---------74:28----------
charismatic and you're a likable guy


---------74:31----------
and then probably what happened is like


---------74:33----------
a couple of things maybe you felt her


---------74:35----------
out a little bit right like


---------74:37----------
you kind of put out some signals like


---------74:38----------
hey but like you never were


---------74:40----------
too transparent about it because like


---------74:43----------
you said with the first girl like you're


---------74:44----------
pretty good at like sussing things out


---------74:46----------
but you're never gonna ask directly


---------74:48----------
you're never gonna make anything awkward


---------74:49----------
right


---------74:49----------
you're never gonna put her in the place


---------74:51----------
of like hey i'm really into you like are


---------74:52----------
you interested in going out


---------74:54----------
because oh my god that would be so


---------74:56----------
awkward what if she says no


---------74:58----------
and so now the problem is that like


---------75:00----------
there's this is where things really


---------75:02----------
start to like come together


---------75:03----------
in this terrible storm because if you're


---------75:06----------
insecure about yourself


---------75:08----------
that makes it even harder for you to


---------75:09----------
risk if you were secure if you were good


---------75:11----------
enough


---------75:13----------
then you'd be okay rolling the dice


---------75:15----------
because then it's i know it sounds weird


---------75:16----------
june but it's not even rolling the dice


---------75:18----------
at that point right


---------75:20----------
like the risk is low the more confident


---------75:22----------
you are in yourself


---------75:24----------
yeah and so you strive for progress


---------75:28----------
and you strive to be the gold medalist


---------75:30----------
because if you're the gold medalist


---------75:32----------
then you can roll the dice and it won't


---------75:34----------
matter


---------75:35----------
because you're so good like you you know


---------75:38----------
that people will accept you


---------75:40----------
even though that's not true like i know


---------75:41----------
it's not true you know it's not true but


---------75:44----------
it's like this kind of like clicks


---------75:45----------
together


---------75:46----------
in this weird way because you're always


---------75:48----------
striving to be better always striving to


---------75:50----------
be better always striving to be better


---------75:51----------
and then


---------75:52----------
one day if you're good enough then you


---------75:55----------
can ask someone out and then there's no


---------75:56----------
risk


---------75:58----------
does that make sense yeah


---------76:02----------
but now the problem is that like even


---------76:04----------
with your relationships the very nature


---------76:07----------
of asking someone out


---------76:10----------
is that it is a risk the very nature of


---------76:13----------
deepening


---------76:14----------
deeping deepening a relationship is that


---------76:16----------
it involves vulnerability


---------76:19----------
yeah and you try so hard to control your


---------76:23----------
relationships


---------76:24----------
to keep them perfect you want no


---------76:27----------
you don't want anyone that you care


---------76:29----------
about to dislike you


---------76:30----------
at all and that's sort of like it's kind


---------76:33----------
of like


---------76:34----------
bro if i'm like never willing to get


---------76:36----------
into the ring


---------76:38----------
and take a couple of punches like i'm


---------76:39----------
never going to be able to play the game


---------76:43----------
you know like i mean it sounded like you


---------76:45----------
played league of legends i'm not too


---------76:47----------
familiar with russ i mean i know it's


---------76:48----------
like a cooperative survival mmo kind of


---------76:50----------
thing


---------76:50----------
right let's look at the common ground as


---------76:51----------
league of legends i played that game a


---------76:52----------
lot so it's like it's like if i'm afraid


---------76:54----------
of losing


---------76:55----------
and i never queue up from league like


---------76:57----------
that's what i hear you


---------76:59----------
saying to me that like i don't know how


---------77:02----------
to queue up for a game of league because


---------77:04----------
you're so terrified about like losing


---------77:06----------
and it's like


---------77:06----------
it's just part of the game


---------77:10----------
yeah that actually gave me a lot of


---------77:11----------
insight what you just said


---------77:13----------
because i actually never thought about


---------77:14----------
it but i do


---------77:16----------
i do wait until everything's perfect if


---------77:18----------
i want to do something big


---------77:20----------
yeah then wait until it's perfect


---------77:21----------
because i hate risk yeah


---------77:24----------
right and this is the thing so like risk


---------77:27----------
tolerance


---------77:28----------
ties to confidence because if we think


---------77:31----------
about what confidence


---------77:32----------
is confidence is the ability to face


---------77:35----------
uncertainty


---------77:38----------
and the more that you stack the deck in


---------77:40----------
your favor before you act


---------77:42----------
june what happens to your confidence


---------77:45----------
if i stack the deck in my favor and then


---------77:47----------
i act am i more confident afterward


---------77:52----------
no probably not the exact opposite it


---------77:55----------
reinforces my insecurity


---------77:57----------
because it's not me that did it it's all


---------78:00----------
of these


---------78:00----------
other things that made sure that it


---------78:03----------
worked out ridiculous planning


---------78:05----------
yes and so like now i'm going to give


---------78:08----------
you just an analogy for medicine


---------78:10----------
okay okay so can i share a story about


---------78:12----------
myself


---------78:14----------
oh yes okay i love that so like i


---------78:17----------
finished medical school and then


---------78:18----------
everyone called me a doctor


---------78:21----------
but i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------78:22----------
when you finish medical school like


---------78:24----------
you're not really a doctor


---------78:26----------
you know does that make sense like you


---------78:27----------
just get your md it's like with the day


---------78:29----------
before medical school you don't have


---------78:30----------
your md degree and then


---------78:31----------
you walk down the stage and someone


---------78:33----------
hands you a piece of paper and then like


---------78:34----------
magically you're a doctor you're not a


---------78:36----------
doctor you're just


---------78:37----------
just like one day you're a fourth year


---------78:38----------
medical student you're not a


---------78:39----------
full-fledged doctor sure technically


---------78:41----------
you're a doctor


---------78:42----------
but does that make sense that makes


---------78:45----------
sense


---------78:46----------
and so like i


---------78:49----------
i still remember the day that i became a


---------78:51----------
doctor i was at a wedding


---------78:53----------
and then someone was like is there a


---------78:55----------
doctor here and i was like oh [ __ ]


---------78:58----------
because normally like when you yeah so


---------79:00----------
like normally like


---------79:02----------
so then you start residency okay which


---------79:04----------
is like where you really learn how to be


---------79:05----------
a doctor


---------79:06----------
so you go to the hospital and then


---------79:07----------
you're taking care of patients but you


---------79:09----------
have like


---------79:10----------
supervisors who are above you so i'm


---------79:12----------
there at the hospital i'm taking care of


---------79:13----------
patients but i have a senior resident i


---------79:15----------
have an attending physician


---------79:16----------
so there's a dude with 20 years of


---------79:18----------
experience there's a dude with three


---------79:19----------
years of experience there's a dude


---------79:20----------
he's one year ahead of me and this is my


---------79:22----------
team i'm the bottom on the totem pole


---------79:24----------
but there are three people looking over


---------79:25----------
my shoulder all the time


---------79:28----------
what we're like butt buddies like the


---------79:30----------
body system oh


---------79:32----------
right so they're okay i know where


---------79:33----------
you're going with this and so then you


---------79:36----------
want me to finish or you want to


---------79:37----------
yeah let me finish no no go ahead go


---------79:38----------
ahead so like here i am at the wedding


---------79:40----------
and it's like oh crap and i'm like


---------79:42----------
waiting for someone else to say


---------79:45----------
you know i'm i'm but there's like it's


---------79:48----------
bizarre my mom is a doctor


---------79:50----------
so my mom [ __ ] my mom volunteers me


---------79:55----------
she's a doctor she's been practicing for


---------79:56----------
30 years


---------79:58----------
and then she's like oh yeah like my son


---------80:00----------
is a doctor i was like


---------80:02----------
you're like i've been doing this for six


---------80:04----------
months you've been doing this for 30


---------80:06----------
years


---------80:08----------
and then she like points at me like i


---------80:09----------
still remember she points at me we're in


---------80:11----------
this big hall with like 400 tables


---------80:13----------
there's over 400 people like 50 tables


---------80:16----------
and she points at me


---------80:18----------
and then i see like people walking over


---------80:20----------
and i'm like what


---------80:21----------
and then they're like oh like your mom


---------80:23----------
said you're a doctor and i was like yes


---------80:25----------
that is true and then we walk outside of


---------80:27----------
the hall and there's like this 70 year


---------80:29----------
old lady who's like


---------80:30----------
laying down on a couch and i'm like oh


---------80:32----------
[ __ ] and my mom is there i don't think


---------80:34----------
she realizes what she had done


---------80:37----------
and then and then so they're like you


---------80:39----------
know oh like she's feeling light-headed


---------80:42----------
this is like like like the bride of the


---------80:43----------
i mean the grandmother or the bride


---------80:46----------
and she's like my grandma's like


---------80:47----------
lightheaded and i'm like oh [ __ ]


---------80:49----------
is she having a heart attack is she


---------80:50----------
having a stroke is she


---------80:52----------
you know so then i'm like okay well


---------80:56----------
and then like your training kicks in


---------80:58----------
there's no senior residents no


---------80:59----------
attendings


---------81:01----------
and my mom has abandoned me which is you


---------81:03----------
know


---------81:04----------
if i ever talk to a psychiatrist on


---------81:06----------
stream we can talk about that


---------81:07----------
but and so there i am and it's like okay


---------81:11----------
so i talked to her you know i'm like


---------81:12----------
okay what do i do like okay i check her


---------81:14----------
blood pressure you know ask her a couple


---------81:15----------
of questions like


---------81:17----------
i do a neurological exam i'm like okay


---------81:19----------
blink and then do this and look to the


---------81:21----------
right and look to the left


---------81:22----------
swallow smell my fingers i know it


---------81:24----------
sounds weird but something that you do


---------81:27----------
um you know try to smell this thing and


---------81:28----------
like okay like can you can you wiggle


---------81:30----------
your fingers wiggle your toes


---------81:32----------
okay you know are you having any chest


---------81:34----------
pain and then i look at her and she


---------81:36----------
doesn't seem that


---------81:37----------
sick right like i know this sounds weird


---------81:40----------
but like even you june


---------81:42----------
like you know you see some people


---------81:43----------
sometimes and you're like that person is


---------81:44----------
sick


---------81:47----------
and then other people are like oh like


---------81:48----------
that person isn't that sick she doesn't


---------81:50----------
look sick and i'm like yeah it sounds


---------81:51----------
like maybe you're dehydrated have you


---------81:52----------
like had any water today


---------81:54----------
and she's like yeah i had a little bit


---------81:55----------
and i was like why don't you have some


---------81:56----------
water i'm gonna sit here with you i


---------81:58----------
don't think we need to call 9-1-1 yet


---------82:00----------
but i'm going to sit here with you with


---------82:01----------
for 15 minutes like i get you some food


---------82:03----------
get you some water she's feeling better


---------82:06----------
okay let's like


---------82:07----------
it's fine no one needs to go to the


---------82:09----------
hospital


---------82:11----------
okay and it's like holy [ __ ] i'm a


---------82:14----------
doctor


---------82:15----------
you're a doctor and so like where does


---------82:19----------
that confidence come from


---------82:22----------
there's no attendings it's just me


---------82:26----------
and grandmother of the bride and the


---------82:28----------
problem


---------82:30----------
is that like you're good at rust right


---------82:32----------
june


---------82:33----------
and when you start on a rust server


---------82:36----------
who's got your back


---------82:39----------
who's got my back yeah


---------82:44----------
my teammates okay right


---------82:48----------
but there are other teams


---------82:51----------
and so like yeah like like sure your


---------82:54----------
teammates have your back but like you


---------82:55----------
know when you go into a game of league


---------82:56----------
of legends like even it's a team game


---------82:58----------
it's you right like it's not like it's


---------83:00----------
not like


---------83:01----------
you know riot games is like sitting


---------83:03----------
there like recoding things to make your


---------83:04----------
hero overpowered


---------83:06----------
which is exactly what you do in real


---------83:07----------
life is you try to like


---------83:09----------
you know open up dev tools


---------83:12----------
and structure your life so that you


---------83:14----------
never have to take risks


---------83:16----------
and then the more that you do that like


---------83:18----------
the harder it becomes to open up because


---------83:19----------
you want to avoid that awkwardness


---------83:21----------
at all costs and like i don't know how


---------83:25----------
to say this bro but like


---------83:26----------
if you're never willing to you know make


---------83:29----------
things awkward


---------83:30----------
it's gonna be really hard to ask a girl


---------83:32----------
out


---------83:33----------
but you have your plan june and you know


---------83:36----------
what your plan is


---------83:38----------
your plan is to wait until you're 100


---------83:41----------
sure that she likes you and she's gonna


---------83:42----------
say yes


---------83:43----------
and then you will ask her out


---------83:46----------
you're going to ask your friends you're


---------83:48----------
going to ask her friends and you're


---------83:49----------
going to make sure that everything


---------83:51----------
i'll never do that okay that would make


---------83:53----------
things too awkward


---------83:55----------
but you got to be sure before you take


---------83:58----------
your shot


---------84:00----------
and as long as that's the case bro


---------84:02----------
you're gonna be like stuck at this level


---------84:11----------
that was a really good uh story because


---------84:13----------
i think it relates


---------84:15----------
because like even if you even if you


---------84:17----------
didn't think you were a doctor at the


---------84:19----------
time because you were like six months in


---------84:21----------
and there was like all these other


---------84:22----------
people that had way more experience than


---------84:23----------
you you were still a doctor


---------84:25----------
and then once you're like put into that


---------84:27----------
position you're able to do it anyways


---------84:30----------
even though you didn't think you were a


---------84:31----------
doctor at first yep


---------84:33----------
so here's the thing june did i think i


---------84:37----------
was good enough


---------84:40----------
no but you did it anyways was i good


---------84:42----------
enough


---------84:44----------
yes did you get an 86 or did you get a


---------84:48----------
95


---------84:50----------
i got a 95. and what did you think you


---------84:53----------
deserved


---------84:57----------
a hundred months ago


---------85:00----------
see i'm getting close to something you


---------85:02----------
can deflect with humor if you want to


---------85:05----------
because here's the thing june you are


---------85:06----------
good enough you've been good enough


---------85:09----------
you deserve the 95 then your parents


---------85:12----------
have loved you since the day you were


---------85:13----------
born


---------85:15----------
and those chicks were totally into you


---------85:17----------
you don't need to be any better than


---------85:18----------
what you are right now you're


---------85:20----------
you're golden bro like should you


---------85:22----------
continue to grow as a human being


---------85:23----------
absolutely but you're good enough


---------85:28----------
thank you i think um right now


---------85:32----------
i am trying to be like opening up more


---------85:35----------
like i'm like


---------85:36----------
talking to people more like initiating


---------85:38----------
more friendships


---------85:39----------
because i never used to do that honestly


---------85:41----------
like even last year i didn't really do


---------85:42----------
that


---------85:43----------
but then like this year i'm really


---------85:45----------
trying to do that um


---------85:48----------
i think in terms of like dating i'm not


---------85:50----------
i'm not too worried


---------85:52----------
back then i didn't have a lot of


---------85:53----------
confidence i think i grew like over the


---------85:55----------
last five years i did grow


---------85:57----------
a little bit more confidence i think


---------85:59----------
right now the only issue is


---------86:01----------
i'm just not able to even


---------86:04----------
have the first step where i have a girl


---------86:06----------
that i like


---------86:10----------
because i like because i code


---------86:13----------
basically yeah so if that's the case


---------86:15----------
like that's why


---------86:16----------
you know this is this is why we're gonna


---------86:17----------
have this conversation now and like


---------86:19----------
hopefully people will get vaccinated


---------86:21----------
turns out people may need a third


---------86:23----------
booster


---------86:25----------
but i think you'll get there but i think


---------86:27----------
the main thing june is you've got to


---------86:28----------
stop running away from awkwardness


---------86:33----------
right and that's where like like like


---------86:35----------
overcoming awkwardness is not going to


---------86:37----------
happen as long as you don't know what it


---------86:39----------
is


---------86:40----------
and so the next step is going to be like


---------86:42----------
unpacking what is awkwardness in a given


---------86:44----------
situation


---------86:46----------
right so like if you think about someone


---------86:47----------
who you want to deepen a relationship


---------86:49----------
with


---------86:50----------
what are you saying that would make


---------86:52----------
things awkward and like what is the


---------86:54----------
awkward is it fear


---------86:55----------
is it guilt is it shame you know like i


---------86:58----------
will send you something called the


---------87:00----------
feelings wheel


---------87:00----------
and if you have like a friend or


---------87:02----------
therapist or something like that that


---------87:04----------
you can work with dude that'd be awesome


---------87:07----------
uh like we're i'm gonna send you the


---------87:09----------
feelings we'll like you're gonna just


---------87:11----------
circle the feelings okay oh it looks


---------87:14----------
like


---------87:14----------
someone is fog


---------87:18----------
okay so let me forward this to you


---------87:24----------
oh you actually have the feeling wheel


---------87:27----------
yeah one


---------87:27----------
one of our how do i


---------87:31----------
copy image so i will just


---------87:36----------
okay so yeah can you take a look at that


---------87:40----------
oh my god


---------87:44----------
okay this is so big


---------87:47----------
yes hold on chat let me let me open this


---------87:50----------
wait there's like there's like a hundred


---------87:51----------
words here


---------87:53----------
yes wow this is like beyond my


---------87:55----------
vocabulary


---------87:57----------
well yeah so like we're gonna we're


---------87:59----------
gonna progress


---------88:01----------
june because that's something you're


---------88:02----------
good at


---------88:04----------
right so like this is the feelings wheel


---------88:06----------
so when we talk about awkward


---------88:09----------
you know it's gonna be feeling rejected


---------88:13----------
excluded in that group after you break


---------88:16----------
up with a girlfriend


---------88:18----------
feeling inadequate feeling anxious


---------88:22----------
feeling bitter


---------88:26----------
feeling humiliated feeling resentful


---------88:29----------
for your friends for siding with her


---------88:31----------
instead of fight siding with you


---------88:34----------
feeling overwhelmed out of control


---------88:38----------
pressured to ask her out quickly or


---------88:42----------
be nice or fix your problems


---------88:45----------
you know you know i i really think


---------88:49----------
just like just being a streamer


---------88:52----------
like really made me worse in being


---------88:54----------
descriptive


---------88:55----------
because what ends up happening dr k


---------88:58----------
i don't know if you've already reached


---------89:00----------
this point


---------89:01----------
in streaming where you just like say


---------89:05----------
everything as kw


---------89:09----------
yeah yeah you know it's it's it's


---------89:11----------
interesting right because i i think that


---------89:12----------
like


---------89:13----------
like you know when i was talking about


---------89:14----------
how men describe


---------89:17----------
you know feelings and physical ways


---------89:20----------
i i think actually one of the things


---------89:21----------
that's really cool um


---------89:23----------
is that we do have our own vocabulary


---------89:27----------
right and it's just not mine right now


---------89:29----------
is sag


---------89:30----------
yeah but but so that's the thing right


---------89:31----------
is if you really look at it like the


---------89:33----------
reason that there are so many different


---------89:34----------
icons


---------89:36----------
is because bad man and sag and pepe han


---------89:39----------
pepe hands is different from pepe crying


---------89:42----------
true right pepe with tears in his eyes


---------89:46----------
is different from pepe crying


---------89:50----------
and and like there's like feels bad man


---------89:53----------
and then there's sag and then there's


---------89:55----------
feels sag


---------89:55----------
man so it's almost like you could


---------89:57----------
construct a feeling wheel


---------90:00----------
with like all of the emotes


---------90:03----------
and that would work right like


---------90:05----------
underneath sag


---------90:06----------
there's feels bad man and then there's


---------90:08----------
feels sag man


---------90:10----------
and then there's pepe with tears in his


---------90:11----------
eyes and then there's pepe crying


---------90:13----------
like you could do this so i i think it's


---------90:16----------
it's interesting that you say everything


---------90:18----------
is cac w i don't think everything is


---------90:19----------
keck i don't even know what keck w means


---------90:22----------
but but like you know i i definitely


---------90:25----------
think we are developing our own


---------90:27----------
vocabulary


---------90:30----------
yeah honestly yeah and even like you


---------90:34----------
know the fish


---------90:34----------
like i love the fish you know the fish


---------90:36----------
emote the fish emote you mean um


---------90:40----------
what was it called which one it's the


---------90:42----------
one


---------90:44----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah right so there's


---------90:46----------
there's ooh


---------90:47----------
and there's pog and there's pog champ so


---------90:50----------
like in the pog


---------90:51----------
wedge of the feeling wheel there's


---------90:52----------
poggers pog champ


---------90:55----------
you know i don't know what the other


---------90:58----------
ones are


---------91:00----------
yeah it's becoming a real problem


---------91:02----------
actually like twitch talk


---------91:04----------
like even even sheesh do you know sheesh


---------91:07----------

---------91:10----------
thing okay i'll do it once for you okay


---------91:14----------

---------91:26----------
like a mating call because actually i


---------91:28----------

---------91:54----------
like i was like in the shower room and i


---------91:57----------

---------92:00----------
the sheet with that guy


---------92:01----------
it's actually becoming a problem wait so


---------92:03----------

---------92:54----------
that's my concrete advice to you at the


---------92:56----------
end of the conversation


---------92:58----------

---------93:00----------
on getting from this but what we're


---------93:02----------

---------93:03----------

---------93:05----------
i'm going to choose from the shower room


---------93:06----------
next time thank you very much


---------93:08----------
um any questions june i mean because i i


---------93:11----------
do feel like we're at sort of like a


---------93:12----------
good stopping point but i i don't know


---------93:14----------
if


---------93:14----------
i don't know how you feel about that or


---------93:17----------
no i think this is really good


---------93:18----------
uh honestly i really love talking with


---------93:21----------
like super intelligent people like you


---------93:22----------
because i think it gives me


---------93:24----------
a lot of insight i


---------93:28----------
like at the beginning of our


---------93:30----------
conversation


---------93:31----------
honestly i didn't even know what to say


---------93:34----------
because i wasn't really sure how to


---------93:36----------
describe anything


---------93:37----------
but then i feel like i got a lot of


---------93:39----------
insight um


---------93:42----------
yeah gave me a lot of hope so i i


---------93:45----------
appreciate your positive sentiment and


---------93:47----------
your


---------93:47----------
your gratitude for the conversation and


---------93:50----------
i still feel like i gotta bounce that


---------93:52----------
back a little bit and


---------93:53----------
remind you that it takes two to tango


---------93:56----------
so i know that you appreciate i i just


---------93:59----------
drive this point home


---------94:00----------
which is like what is your contribution


---------94:03----------
to the conversation


---------94:05----------
because what i'm hearing is you call me


---------94:07----------
super intelligent and you being ignorant


---------94:11----------
no no no no no i just no that was not


---------94:14----------
like uh


---------94:15----------
okay right because you said but i i just


---------94:18----------
want to reflect back to you that i enjoy


---------94:20----------
these conversations too


---------94:22----------
june and it's because i recognize that


---------94:24----------
there may be some things that you don't


---------94:25----------
understand but i think you actually did


---------94:27----------
an amazing job


---------94:28----------
because the problem is that like i swim


---------94:30----------
in these waters all the time


---------94:32----------
it's my day job whereas like we're


---------94:35----------
queuing up


---------94:36----------
right and like this is like i grind


---------94:38----------
every single day


---------94:39----------
and like we're queuing up together


---------94:42----------
and and you're you know you're holding


---------94:45----------
your own in lane


---------94:46----------
like that's the way we win


---------94:51----------
right so i think it's really awesome


---------94:52----------
like i think this conversation is a good


---------94:55----------
example


---------94:56----------
of like you know you putting yourself


---------94:58----------
out there feeling awkward i'm sure


---------95:01----------
um and then really like i i'm really


---------95:05----------
like i'm i think you did a fantastic job


---------95:09----------
thank you cool


---------95:12----------
um do you sometimes i teach people how


---------95:15----------
to meditate


---------95:15----------
do you oh


---------95:20----------
i i actually love meditating but i


---------95:22----------
haven't done it in a while


---------95:23----------
okay coincidentally ever since i started


---------95:26----------
rest


---------95:28----------
like can i tell you a story about like


---------95:29----------
the first time i tried meditating yes


---------95:31----------
please


---------95:33----------
so i think i was like 13


---------95:37----------
and i was just like laying down in my


---------95:38----------
bed and then


---------95:40----------
on my youtube recommendations i got a


---------95:43----------
this guided meditation thing and this


---------95:45----------
guy had like a super deep voice and i


---------95:46----------
was like oh my god


---------95:48----------
so i like put my earphones on and then i


---------95:50----------
did this guided meditation thing


---------95:52----------
and then i was like listening to this


---------95:54----------
guy's like beautiful voice


---------95:56----------
and he puts me into like a stance and


---------95:59----------
then


---------96:00----------
i literally felt like i was in the


---------96:03----------
middle of space


---------96:06----------
it was like super cool but i haven't


---------96:08----------
been able to replicate it since no


---------96:10----------
matter how hard i tried


---------96:11----------
okay so you


---------96:15----------
you felt this a a sensation of vastness


---------96:19----------
yeah i was just like floating in like


---------96:22----------
middle of nothing


---------96:24----------
yeah it felt like that so cool are you


---------96:27----------
sitting up or


---------96:29----------
what right now uh i can i can


---------96:33----------
i can lay down on my chair let me just


---------96:36----------
think about how to teach this to you


---------96:38----------
so this is going to be a little bit more


---------96:40----------
of a of an


---------96:41----------
advanced technique but it's actually


---------96:43----------
relatively simple


---------96:47----------
your back should be straight and if


---------96:49----------
you've done this lying down


---------96:51----------
i think you can try doing it lying down


---------96:52----------
again


---------96:54----------
i think this is gonna take practice i


---------96:55----------
don't know if it's gonna work right now


---------96:57----------
because i think that you need a certain


---------96:58----------
degree of like calmness


---------97:00----------
and i think actually like we're


---------97:02----------
energized right now is what i'm feeling


---------97:04----------
june


---------97:05----------
but i'm happy to share the technique


---------97:06----------
with you that you can try to practice


---------97:09----------
okay so um the technique is very simple


---------97:13----------
and we can kind of try to do it together


---------97:15----------
so you can lay down if you want to but


---------97:16----------
i'm going to go ahead and sit up


---------97:17----------
straight


---------97:19----------
the main thing for meditation is that


---------97:20----------
your back needs to be straight


---------97:22----------
so you can do that laying down standing


---------97:23----------
up sitting up straight


---------97:25----------
is there a reason for that yes


---------97:29----------
um so what it's not there isn't a


---------97:32----------
scientific reason


---------97:34----------
um i'm sure there's a scientific reason


---------97:37----------
i don't know what the scientific reason


---------97:38----------
is i should say that


---------97:39----------
but in the sort of eastern systems


---------97:42----------
of like you know energy and qi and and


---------97:45----------
all that stuff


---------97:46----------
the energy of like spiritual growth is


---------97:49----------
situated along your spine


---------97:52----------
lives at the base of your spine and as


---------97:54----------
that energy


---------97:55----------
rises along the back of your spine you


---------97:57----------
start to have more spiritual experiences


---------98:00----------
and spiritual growth


---------98:02----------
so there's no scientific correlate to


---------98:04----------
this energy like no one's been able to


---------98:06----------
find it or detect it


---------98:07----------
or anything like that but essentially


---------98:10----------
like


---------98:10----------
apparently the spine according to these


---------98:13----------
theories like the people who developed


---------98:14----------
the practice of meditation


---------98:16----------
this is what they said is that you want


---------98:19----------
to facilitate


---------98:20----------
like it's like a pipe that you know


---------98:21----------
water flows through and it starts at the


---------98:23----------
bottom and then it works its way up


---------98:28----------
does that answer your question and offer


---------98:30----------
yeah that's okay very interesting


---------98:32----------
so it's gonna be kind of weird but what


---------98:35----------
i'm gonna ask you to do it's hard to


---------98:36----------
demonstrate i'm gonna ask you to close


---------98:38----------
your eyes


---------98:39----------
and then there's a point that's sort of


---------98:42----------
like maybe right above


---------98:44----------
your the middle of your eyebrows i don't


---------98:46----------
know if you can kind of tell it's like


---------98:48----------
not you know it's it's maybe like a


---------98:50----------
quarter inch or a few centimeters above


---------98:52----------
the middle or you can kind of find it


---------98:55----------
for some people it feels a little bit


---------98:57----------
higher but what i want you to do is


---------98:59----------
close your eyes


---------99:00----------
and then i want you to look at that


---------99:02----------
point


---------99:03----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------99:05----------
and then you're gonna never done


---------99:07----------
i think that's the first time i've ever


---------99:08----------
done that in my life


---------99:10----------
so i want you to you can lay down or sit


---------99:13----------
up straight and then i want you to just


---------99:14----------
look at that and just keep focusing on


---------99:17----------
that point


---------99:19----------
as if you're trying to like look through


---------99:21----------
it with your eyes


---------99:23----------
like imagine that your eyes are behind


---------99:25----------
your forehead it's hard to describe


---------99:26----------
because these things are so experiential


---------99:28----------
but like imagine your eyes are behind


---------99:30----------
your forehead and you're trying to look


---------99:32----------
through like that point in your forehead


---------99:35----------
is like a telescope


---------99:37----------
and so you're like looking through that


---------99:39----------
point into something else


---------99:41----------
does that make sense yep


---------99:44----------
okay so this may cause some amount of


---------99:47----------
eye strain


---------99:48----------
which then you want to relax once it


---------99:50----------
starts to feel uncomfortable


---------99:52----------
and then you want to resume again once


---------99:54----------
your eyes have calmed down


---------99:55----------
you don't want to push yourself or hold


---------99:57----------
it for a long period of time


---------99:58----------
but gradually over time you want to


---------100:00----------
build up the strength and focusing on


---------100:02----------
that point


---------100:04----------
you may also learn that at some point


---------100:06----------
you can actually relax your


---------100:08----------
eyes and focus on the point anyway which


---------100:10----------
is totally fine


---------100:14----------
does that make sense that makes sense


---------100:17----------
okay so let's try to practice for like


---------100:19----------
three or four minutes okay


---------100:20----------
so you can try to hold it for maybe 10


---------100:22----------
seconds 15 seconds 30 seconds


---------100:24----------
relax for a little bit hold again relax


---------100:27----------
don't strain your eyes too much okay


---------100:31----------
so let's begin


---------101:45----------
you


---------102:26----------
foreign


---------102:39----------
okay go ahead and relax let your eyes


---------102:43----------
remain closed


---------102:47----------
go ahead and take a deep breath in and


---------102:49----------
exhale slowly


---------102:58----------
you can go ahead and rub your eyes a


---------102:59----------
little bit


---------103:04----------
okay and then go ahead and open them


---------103:12----------
what what was that like for you jun


---------103:18----------
i didn't get to the state i was talking


---------103:21----------
about


---------103:22----------
but it is really relaxing okay


---------103:26----------
yeah so you could try practicing this um


---------103:28----------
did you feel like


---------103:29----------
dizzy at all no but i did i did see the


---------103:34----------
i did feel the eye strain are you


---------103:35----------
talking about yeah sometimes like i'm


---------103:36----------
like trying so hard to like look


---------103:38----------
up and then like naturally gradually


---------103:40----------
goes down


---------103:41----------
so i have to like do it again yeah so


---------103:44----------
so it may take a little bit of practice


---------103:47----------
you know this may not be the right


---------103:48----------
technique for you


---------103:49----------
um i i tend to find that


---------103:53----------
some people will sometimes feel dizzy


---------103:56----------
and then i know it's not like this is


---------103:57----------
gonna


---------103:58----------
probably not gonna make any sense but as


---------104:01----------
the dizziness kind of like expands


---------104:06----------
this is a technique that i consistently


---------104:08----------
hear from people when i teach it


---------104:10----------
that it gives them the feeling of what i


---------104:12----------
call vastness


---------104:13----------
which is that they like that i know it


---------104:16----------
sounds kind of weird


---------104:17----------
like you feel dizzy and then it like


---------104:19----------
kind of like


---------104:22----------
sounds so bizarre but it kind of like


---------104:23----------
grows and grows


---------104:25----------
and then like a lot of people that i


---------104:26----------
teach this technique will sort of


---------104:28----------
share that experience with me that's


---------104:31----------
kind of what i experienced


---------104:33----------
back then yeah so so one thing i would


---------104:36----------
say june is that


---------104:37----------
one of the things that gets in the way


---------104:39----------
of meditation or experiences in


---------104:41----------
meditation is seeking experiences in


---------104:43----------
meditation


---------104:44----------
so when our mind is calm and tranquil


---------104:46----------
and we don't have


---------104:47----------
expectation then it can truly shut off


---------104:50----------
and


---------104:50----------
open ourselves up to whatever experience


---------104:52----------
we can have


---------104:54----------
the challenge is that if you go into a


---------104:56----------
practice


---------104:57----------
seeking something that very expectation


---------105:01----------
will prevent your mind from relaxing


---------105:06----------
so i i would say you know just do


---------105:09----------
meditation without


---------105:10----------
sort of thinking about that or try to


---------105:12----------
let go of that expectation


---------105:14----------
like learn to let go of your goal which


---------105:16----------
i think is also very healthy for you in


---------105:18----------
general


---------105:19----------
[Laughter]


---------105:21----------
but always finds a way to tie it


---------105:23----------
together


---------105:24----------
yeah maybe that's just me looking you


---------105:28----------
meditate


---------105:31----------
do i meditate every day


---------105:35----------
i'm gonna go with no


---------105:38----------
so i i tend to have much more intensive


---------105:42----------
periods of meditation


---------105:43----------
and then i do lots of different kinds of


---------105:45----------
meditation but i also think that like


---------105:47----------
where i am in life right now


---------105:49----------
it is important for me to not meditate


---------105:51----------
every day and just like let that go


---------105:53----------
you know you have like a cheat day in


---------105:54----------
terms of diet or like you'll take a week


---------105:56----------
off from going to the gym


---------105:59----------
so i think meditation is sort of the


---------106:00----------
same way


---------106:02----------
where i tend to meditate a fair amount


---------106:03----------
but i let go of the everyday


---------106:06----------
thing a long time ago where


---------106:09----------
it's like you know that at this point


---------106:12----------
feels a little bit artificial to me so


---------106:14----------
what i will do is like


---------106:15----------
embark on sprints essentially of


---------106:17----------
meditation


---------106:19----------
and then i'll do a particular practice


---------106:21----------
in depth for a particular amount of time


---------106:24----------
and then i'll also let my practice wane


---------106:28----------
do you ever like think about stuff while


---------106:29----------
meditating or do you try to keep your


---------106:31----------
mind empty


---------106:33----------
you can't keep your mind empty your mind


---------106:35----------
has to


---------106:36----------
naturally empty and i'm usually


---------106:39----------
pretty good at not thinking about things


---------106:41----------
when i meditate but that just comes with


---------106:42----------
practice


---------106:44----------
so the way that meditation works june is


---------106:46----------
you don't


---------106:47----------
stop thinking about stuff so your body


---------106:50----------
and mind have a very simple principle


---------106:52----------
of like tolerance to a constant stimuli


---------106:55----------
so if i put on my shirt first thing in


---------106:57----------
the morning or after i shower


---------106:59----------
i'm gonna feel the shirt on my body


---------107:01----------
right


---------107:03----------
and then the sensation of the shirt


---------107:05----------
stops


---------107:06----------
does that make sense yeah


---------107:10----------
and then if i concentrate on feeling the


---------107:13----------
shirt


---------107:14----------
i will ign like my mind will stop


---------107:17----------
feeling


---------107:17----------
all other things does that make sense


---------107:23----------
that doesn't make too much sense we're


---------107:25----------
gonna illustrate it really simply


---------107:27----------
i want you to do this with your hands


---------107:30----------
okay now i want you to concentrate on


---------107:33----------
the sensation of your hands can you feel


---------107:34----------
your hands


---------107:37----------
are you wearing a shirt yes


---------107:41----------
now i want you to concentrate on the


---------107:43----------
feeling of the shirt


---------107:46----------
as you focus on the shirt what happens


---------107:49----------
to the sensation of your hands


---------107:53----------
uh you forget about him absolutely


---------107:57----------
right so in the same way our mind has


---------108:00----------
lots of thoughts


---------108:02----------
and so what we do in meditation is we


---------108:04----------
actually start with a focusing technique


---------108:06----------
like focusing on the breath and when i


---------108:08----------
put my attention on the breath


---------108:10----------
the breath knocks out all of the other


---------108:13----------
thoughts but we're still thinking about


---------108:14----------
the breath


---------108:16----------
does that make sense then what happens


---------108:20----------
is eventually our mind


---------108:21----------
stop acclimatizes to the sensation of


---------108:24----------
the breath


---------108:25----------
and if we're lucky we're left in a no


---------108:26----------
mind state


---------108:30----------
wow that sounds awesome okay


---------108:35----------
i don't know i don't know if i can get


---------108:37----------
to that point


---------108:38----------
my mind races all the time sure sounds


---------108:41----------
like you may not be good enough


---------108:47----------
i'll try it actually i'll try for a week


---------108:49----------
there we go


---------108:51----------
right so it just takes practice june


---------108:53----------
you'll get there


---------108:54----------
all minds are capable of it and


---------108:57----------
sometimes if you like work out


---------108:58----------
or dance that may actually be like your


---------109:01----------
avenue because like


---------109:02----------
you know sometimes when you dance or you


---------109:03----------
sing or you work out


---------109:05----------
you're like one with the practice


---------109:09----------
does that make sense like you lose


---------109:11----------
yourself in the dancing and all


---------109:13----------
all you are is like a dancing elemental


---------109:17----------
like you become an elemental if that


---------109:19----------
makes sense


---------109:21----------
yeah like you're no longer june you're


---------109:23----------
just like someone who is dancing


---------109:27----------
so that can be a form of meditation yeah


---------109:29----------
so you


---------109:30----------
you've done it so you may just be


---------109:32----------
someone it sounds like you're quite


---------109:34----------
kinesthetic


---------109:35----------
by nature kinesthetic meaning being like


---------109:38----------
you have a good like


---------109:39----------
sense of your body so what you may


---------109:43----------
actually want to do is not


---------109:44----------
sitting down meditation something like


---------109:46----------
yoga or tai chi may work way


---------109:48----------
better for you like a very solid like


---------109:50----------
hata yoga have you ever done like hot


---------109:52----------
yoga


---------109:53----------
no i never tried hot yoga so


---------109:57----------
i would say like hot yoga is like a good


---------109:59----------
thing for you to try i mean cove it


---------110:01----------
aside because i don't know


---------110:02----------
that's probably awful with a mask on but


---------110:04----------
you know i'd say


---------110:05----------
in your case just i don't know that you


---------110:07----------
need to sit and do like a quiet sitting


---------110:09----------
meditation


---------110:10----------
practice you may be someone who just


---------110:12----------
really gets to that clear state of mind


---------110:15----------
and that feels so good through physical


---------110:17----------
through a physical focus


---------110:19----------
as opposed to a breath focus or a mantra


---------110:21----------
or something like that


---------110:24----------
[Music]


---------110:26----------
i might try it there's a lot of things


---------110:28----------
that i used to


---------110:30----------
have like used to do that gave me that


---------110:33----------
satisfaction


---------110:34----------
that i was talking about but i stopped


---------110:35----------
doing them


---------110:37----------
for whatever reason sure so and i think


---------110:40----------
if i do that more


---------110:42----------
pick it up again should pick it up again


---------110:44----------
