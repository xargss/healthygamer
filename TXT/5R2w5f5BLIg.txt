---------00:00----------
how so how are you doing I'm all right


---------00:04----------
yeah I haven't slept in quite well but


---------00:06----------
otherwise doing all right what's up with


---------00:08----------
that especially no so I started I


---------00:14----------
started paying a little bit more close


---------00:16----------
attention to my health good for you


---------00:20----------
I've been logging it because I have a


---------00:21----------
planet nothing happens unless I write it


---------00:23----------
down because I've got bad memory


---------00:24----------
problems so I I write what I've been


---------00:29----------
eating how much caffeine I'm having how


---------00:33----------
much have slept that sort of thing and


---------00:34----------
there's only one day this week were


---------00:36----------
actually slept I tried to take a nap on


---------00:39----------
another day I think I lasted an hour and


---------00:41----------
a half maybe but yeah I don't know why


---------00:43----------
I'm just I'm just not sleeping hmm what


---------00:47----------
is it that keeps you from sleeping busy


---------00:50----------
like you're so busy that you literally


---------00:53----------
do not sleep yeah


---------00:59----------
where do you do uh your dad he's good


---------01:03----------
I'm sorry he's not he's not good


---------01:06----------
I been I've been just getting on with my


---------01:10----------
life I mean since that since that since


---------01:12----------
that cuts that since the in since that


---------01:16----------
since since Kovac broke out and it's not


---------01:19----------
been we haven't been able to get carers


---------01:21----------
out to my mom's a bit a bit more busy


---------01:23----------
taking care of her as well as you know


---------01:24----------
running a stream running a YouTube


---------01:26----------
taking care of rescue animals a lot of


---------01:29----------
the charities to take on animals right


---------01:30----------
now are understaffed because of covert


---------01:32----------
so I I'm getting a lot more people come


---------01:36----------
to me when they have injured animals so


---------01:38----------
yeah I've just been busy very very very


---------01:40----------
very busy and weirdly I feel more okay


---------01:43----------
than I should be at this point


---------01:45----------
I feel like now I should be like really


---------01:47----------
really sleepy but I'm okay


---------01:50----------
yeah I'm concerned about you any that I


---------01:55----------
am I used to be worried about this


---------01:59----------
little thing but I've actually grown


---------02:00----------
quite used to it I'm kind of a burnout


---------02:02----------
Queen even before I streamed life used


---------02:05----------
to get like this every now and again and


---------02:06----------
weirdly I'd always pull through so I


---------02:09----------
wouldn't worry too much because I'm


---------02:11----------
pretty sure I'm gonna be fine yeah so is


---------02:15----------
it okay for me to be worried about you


---------02:16----------
if you're even if you're gonna be fine


---------02:19----------
oh then what's the point seems like a


---------02:22----------
waste to worry


---------02:25----------
well because I I'm concerned that so


---------02:29----------
you're saying you're gonna be fine let's


---------02:30----------
accept that for a second but what


---------02:33----------
worries me is that like what you're


---------02:34----------
shooting for is fine survival right eye


---------02:40----------
and what I would want for you is more


---------02:42----------
than survival I guess I guess I'm very a


---------02:48----------
very very very very very much more


---------02:51----------
comfortable being busy yeah and tired


---------02:55----------
then still since for me this is this is


---------03:00----------
okay okay difficult but it's okay is it


---------03:04----------
okay if I is there something in


---------03:06----------
particularly you want to talk about


---------03:07----------
today by the way I didn't make any plans


---------03:09----------
I'm quite notorious for that perfect so


---------03:12----------
yeah I would read to talk about whatever


---------03:14----------
you and me both


---------03:16----------
right so then can we talk a little bit


---------03:20----------
about I'm curious if it would be useful


---------03:22----------
to talk about like why stillness feels


---------03:24----------
uncomfortable for you sure yeah


---------03:28----------
what feels uncomfortable about being


---------03:29----------
still why you got to be moving all the


---------03:31----------
time


---------03:33----------
[Music]


---------03:35----------
I guess for a lot of reasons I mean I


---------03:39----------
feel a lot of guilt if I stay still I


---------03:42----------
feel like I'm wasting time and letting


---------03:46----------
people down but also it's been my coping


---------03:49----------
mechanism for difficult so if I am in a


---------03:53----------
situation where I'm not very comfortable


---------03:57----------
like emotionally if there's something


---------03:59----------
that's been going on I just keep busy


---------04:02----------
because then I can only give enough time


---------04:05----------
to face it in increments which allows me


---------04:07----------
to face it without it hitting me too


---------04:09----------
hard and so I think in part it becomes


---------04:12----------
the coping mechanism for adversity I


---------04:16----------
guess sure and that sounds pretty


---------04:19----------
important because it sounds like maybe


---------04:21----------
if you let it hit you all at once it


---------04:23----------
would be overwhelming yeah so


---------04:27----------
like it's a pretty important coping


---------04:29----------
mechanism yeah I think it's working out


---------04:32----------
I mean uh uh uh he's I was I was I don't


---------04:35----------
I don't know if you know this but I used


---------04:36----------
to be depressed for thirteen years I


---------04:38----------
didn't so yeah I had I had I had a


---------04:42----------
difficult background god I remember yeah


---------04:47----------
so obviously I think it's kind of


---------04:49----------
natural to not be happy about that but I


---------04:52----------
did have really very severe depression


---------04:54----------
for thirteen years I had a severe social


---------04:57----------
phobia and anxiety which is


---------05:00----------
understandable especially when I didn't


---------05:01----------
have a diagnosis and it was kind of


---------05:03----------
scary to interact with people because I


---------05:04----------
never knew how that was gonna go um so


---------05:08----------
yeah I don't think it was so much a


---------05:09----------
failing or anything I think it's just


---------05:11----------
kind of a normal reaction to the


---------05:13----------
situation I was in and what was the


---------05:15----------
normal reaction I'm sorry to be


---------05:17----------
depressed about it yeah but luckily I


---------05:21----------
got out of that and even though you know


---------05:23----------
um maybe not living the most


---------05:25----------
conventional life and pretty happy


---------05:27----------
I don't feel depressed I don't feel down


---------05:29----------
I don't wake up feeling kind of bad


---------05:31----------
about the day I feel quite excited about


---------05:34----------
what's gonna happen next but sounds


---------05:35----------
awesome


---------05:36----------
yeah so like even though it may on the


---------05:40----------
outside seem very uncomfortable


---------05:43----------
it's actually really working for me to


---------05:46----------
just stay busy and keep moving yeah so


---------05:48----------
that that makes a lot of sense that can


---------05:51----------
I just tell you what I heard mm-hmm so


---------05:54----------
it sounds like you were depressed for a


---------05:55----------
while


---------05:56----------
you had somewhat of a tough upbringing


---------05:59----------
you had some social phobias and you kind


---------06:01----------
of managed to get out of that somehow


---------06:03----------
and now maybe when you're dealing with


---------06:07----------
as you put an adversity or there are


---------06:10----------
some kinds of emotions that you're


---------06:11----------
experiencing staying busy is like a


---------06:14----------
really good way of coping with it and


---------06:16----------
and I'm not hearing that you're really


---------06:19----------
like suppressing or anything it sounds


---------06:21----------
like you genuinely find enjoyment in


---------06:24----------
what you do you're not like necessarily


---------06:26----------
blocking things out or things like that


---------06:28----------
it's just like you wake up every day


---------06:29----------
you're pretty happy about what you do


---------06:31----------
you care for people and animals that you


---------06:34----------
love and you make the world a better


---------06:36----------
place and


---------06:38----------
it kind of helps you feel fulfilled and


---------06:40----------
happy yeah yeah so I I mean that makes


---------06:45----------
sense to me I think the only thing


---------06:47----------
that's a little bit confusing for me is


---------06:49----------
that like if you're still then guilts


---------06:52----------
happens right so it it sounds to me like


---------06:55----------
I just have trouble reconciling there's


---------06:58----------
two things in your mind in my mind that


---------07:01----------
that you know there can be sort of


---------07:03----------
happiness and fulfillment but it sounds


---------07:06----------
to me like if you're still and there's


---------07:07----------
guilt and there's a feeling of letting


---------07:09----------
people down then maybe there is a little


---------07:12----------
bit of well I don't know suppression is


---------07:15----------
the right word because it sounds like


---------07:16----------
what you do is you you kind of manage it


---------07:18----------
in your own way over time right that's


---------07:20----------
the way that you deal with it is you


---------07:22----------
kind of take chunks and then you kind of


---------07:24----------
process a little bit and then chunks and


---------07:26----------
then process a little bit but I but I


---------07:29----------
can't help but hear so it sounds like


---------07:31----------
it's a formula that works for you yeah I


---------07:34----------
mean it can't land me in a lot of


---------07:36----------
trouble how's that well it means I'm


---------07:39----------
slow to anger one of the disadvantages


---------07:42----------
of having Tourette's syndrome is a lot


---------07:44----------
of people don't know you get sick


---------07:45----------
emotions so I will get out of context


---------07:47----------
joy or out of context anger the thing is


---------07:50----------
when you get a surge of emotion it's


---------07:52----------
quite natural for your brain to try and


---------07:54----------
rationalize that so if you get a rage if


---------07:56----------
you get a surge of rage you're like it's


---------07:58----------
because of this and it could be


---------07:59----------
something stupid like I don't know if


---------08:00----------
there's a scuff on the table your brain


---------08:02----------
tries to rationalize things it doesn't


---------08:04----------
really understand so if you have an


---------08:06----------
incomprehensible wave of motion you try


---------08:08----------
to contextualise it and the way I've


---------08:09----------
managed that so that I don't rage out at


---------08:11----------
people or just be really sad and burst


---------08:13----------
in tears over nothing is I sit beside my


---------08:16----------
emotions become detached from them and


---------08:18----------
watch them as if they're I'm an observer


---------08:21----------
like a scientist documenting a feeling


---------08:23----------
so I'm like wow my heart rate has sped


---------08:25----------
up


---------08:26----------
I can feel a tingle in my teeth my


---------08:28----------
fingers have gone cold I can feel my


---------08:29----------
brain like rushing towards this kind of


---------08:32----------
thought and that kind of thought and I


---------08:33----------
sit beside it and listen to it and make


---------08:36----------
sense of it go is this a tic or is this


---------08:38----------
a genuine feel and this means that I


---------08:40----------
have a delay in my anger which means


---------08:43----------
that when people are inappropriate


---------08:44----------
towards me


---------08:45----------
I don't immediately react the way that


---------08:47----------
they should and I don't necessarily get


---------08:49----------
to safety


---------08:50----------
or challenge


---------08:52----------
the situation in the way that I should


---------08:53----------
because I question whether or not I


---------08:54----------
should be mad and I need time to figure


---------08:57----------
that out and so someone might not figure


---------08:59----------
out that they've been disrespectful or


---------09:01----------
that they need to stop the certain


---------09:03----------
behavior I don't really communicate that


---------09:04----------
and and this isn't a very delayed sense


---------09:07----------
quite often which puts me in danger


---------09:09----------
and has done fairly recently even and so


---------09:13----------
yeah it does have disadvantages but I


---------09:17----------
feel like it's a side effect of of of


---------09:22----------
growing up with Tourette's because a lot


---------09:23----------
of children especially have difficulties


---------09:25----------
with like especially tick rage but I've


---------09:28----------
managed to be a very calm person by


---------09:30----------
managing my emotions in this way but


---------09:32----------
yeah it means that because I deal with


---------09:35----------
my emotions in increments and I make


---------09:37----------
sense of them especially adversity I end


---------09:39----------
up I end up I end up taking like weeks


---------09:43----------
sometimes to figure out how I feel about


---------09:44----------
things and that delay can definitely be


---------09:47----------
a disadvantage at times hmm hey your


---------09:51----------
thoughts seem very well-formed Thanks I


---------09:55----------
don't know how time has lost all meaning


---------09:58----------
at this point I'm pretty tired yeah it I


---------10:03----------
can hear that you've thought about it a


---------10:05----------
lot or analyzed it a lot or really spent


---------10:07----------
a lot of time trying to understand


---------10:09----------
yourself and trying to figure out how to


---------10:11----------
manage some of your internal environment


---------10:14----------
ah I think I'm just listening to my


---------10:18----------
monologue I think I'm just listening I


---------10:20----------
don't I don't know that I necessarily


---------10:21----------
put a lot of time into it I mean I


---------10:25----------
always get this thing where people tell


---------10:28----------
me it sounds like a rehearsed what I say


---------10:30----------
on stream or that I've written it down


---------10:31----------
or foot it through a lot I haven't


---------10:34----------
usually I'm just formulating that on the


---------10:35----------
spot I think it's it's not so much that


---------10:38----------
I'm paying lots and lots of energy into


---------10:40----------
figuring stuff out it's just I'm


---------10:42----------
genuinely listening to myself yeah that


---------10:45----------
that's interesting to hear because it


---------10:48----------
does sound well-thought-out it sounds


---------10:52----------
you know so so even even if you're not


---------10:57----------
consciously thinking about it I think


---------10:59----------
one of the consequences of observation


---------11:01----------
is understanding and what I'm hearing


---------11:04----------
from you is that you underst


---------11:05----------
yourself quite well and you've noticed


---------11:07----------
different patterns that you have you've


---------11:10----------
noticed different strategies you've used


---------11:12----------
to cope with Tourette's and situations


---------11:16----------
and the the interesting thing in eating


---------11:18----------
and I don't know if this is I kind of


---------11:21----------
don't know exactly what we're talking


---------11:22----------
about today but let me tell you what I'm


---------11:24----------
seeing if that's okay so yeah you know


---------11:28----------
it sounds like you've been Delta a very


---------11:30----------
unique hand of cards in life and you've


---------11:33----------
learned certain strategies to manage


---------11:35----------
those hands of that hand of cards how to


---------11:36----------
play that handle and you've done a


---------11:38----------
really good job of playing the hand of


---------11:41----------
cards that you've been dull and so one


---------11:44----------
of like as you mentioned like one


---------11:46----------
example of this is that you've learned


---------11:47----------
how to just look at your emotions and


---------11:49----------
not kind of give in to them and the


---------11:52----------
problem with your strategy though is


---------11:53----------
that it sounds like sometimes for the


---------11:56----------
most part it works really well and it's


---------11:58----------
allowed you to be successful and


---------12:00----------
functional in this world but that there


---------12:02----------
are some kind of cracks at the seams


---------12:04----------
and and I've heard you say some words


---------12:06----------
that still concern me and so you said


---------12:10----------
something about you know like burnout is


---------12:13----------
sort of what you do like so that doesn't


---------12:15----------
sound like a great strategy to me you


---------12:18----------
know there's there's the sense of guilt


---------12:20----------
and letting people down if you set still


---------12:22----------
if you sit still and then lastly use the


---------12:25----------
word danger that sometimes the way that


---------12:28----------
you you distance yourself from emotions


---------12:30----------
leads you to danger and that's scary


---------12:35----------
like III don't know I mean because


---------12:37----------
you're so articulate granted you may not


---------12:40----------
have thought things out you're maybe


---------12:41----------
thinking them through as you speak but


---------12:44----------
that's a powerful word and and I'm just


---------12:48----------
not quite sure how to understand or how


---------12:51----------
to think about you know a system that


---------12:54----------
seems to work so well and allow you to


---------12:56----------
help so many people but then also tosses


---------13:00----------
out words from your head like guilt


---------13:02----------
letting people down being unable to sit


---------13:04----------
still getting yourself into danger and


---------13:08----------
burnout


---------13:10----------
yeah pros and cons yeah


---------13:15----------
fancy it has a lot of really powerful


---------13:17----------
upside to me but also a lot of powerful


---------13:19----------
downsides I mean to give you some scope


---------13:21----------
of what my life looks like right now I


---------13:23----------
think if I genuinely described it I


---------13:25----------
think a lot of chat would assume that


---------13:27----------
I'm not very happy or that it'd be


---------13:29----------
difficult to be happy in my


---------13:30----------
circumstances mmm let's let's hear about


---------13:33----------
it I'd love to if you're okay with that


---------13:37----------
okay I I'm worried I'm a little bit


---------13:41----------
scared this is a tentative situation you


---------13:43----------
see if I start listing the things that I


---------13:45----------
find difficult in life there are gonna


---------13:47----------
be a bunch of people who hear this he


---------13:49----------
think I'm fishing for pity so I'm always


---------13:51----------
very nervous about describing my life in


---------13:54----------
detail because yeah can we talk about


---------13:58----------
that for a second sure why would you


---------14:02----------
think that people think you're fishing


---------14:04----------
for pity


---------14:06----------
because people I've noticed a reaction


---------14:11----------
and people in real life and on the


---------14:13----------
internet that if someone seems


---------14:15----------
vulnerable people are afraid of being


---------14:17----------
manipulated it's one of the hardest


---------14:19----------
things to come up against this one with


---------14:21----------
Tourette's or any kind of disability on


---------14:23----------
stream is that people are afraid of


---------14:26----------
being manipulated and so you know I get


---------14:28----------
lots of people saying that I'm the next


---------14:30----------
zillion ope and things like this and I


---------14:33----------
am what is that that was once a streamer


---------14:37----------
Q I don't know much about it I wasn't on


---------14:39----------
Twitch when it happened but as far as I


---------14:41----------
know there was a streamer who pretended


---------14:44----------
to have a disability in order to get


---------14:46----------
donations for years accidentally stood


---------14:49----------
up on camera even though he was claiming


---------14:51----------
to have a wheelchair I think that was


---------14:54----------
the what happened am i right


---------14:56----------
check there I'm sure there was some


---------14:58----------
veterans here who know


---------15:02----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so basically he


---------15:06----------
forgot his camera was still on and stood


---------15:07----------
up and yeah it came to like that yet


---------15:12----------
perhaps he might have been overplaying


---------15:14----------
his condition although I'm not sure I


---------15:16----------
mean people don't flat check on twitch


---------15:17----------
and I do know that some people who need


---------15:19----------
a wheelchair can stand up but can't


---------15:22----------
stand up for long periods of time for


---------15:24----------
example so I don't know whether it was


---------15:26----------
genuinely that he didn't have a


---------15:28----------
disability or that people just expected


---------15:30----------
a disability to present in a specific


---------15:31----------
way and got outraged when he stood up I


---------15:33----------
don't know but anyway people quote that


---------15:36----------
and they're like kind of accusing me of


---------15:38----------
being fake all the time because yeah


---------15:40----------
people are scared of being kind and


---------15:42----------
empathetic and people are scared of


---------15:43----------
being used and so when when people talk


---------15:46----------
about their hardships I certainly


---------15:49----------
noticed a trend of not being met with


---------15:51----------
kind of empathy but rather suspicion and


---------15:53----------
so it's very very scary to put your


---------15:56----------
difficulties let to lay them out on the


---------15:58----------
table sometimes because do you think a


---------16:02----------
pity no I think I'm doing all right I


---------16:07----------
think I'm I'm pretty happy with the fact


---------16:09----------
that I managed to live the life that I


---------16:11----------
do and do as much as I do


---------16:13----------
just by everything I think that's the


---------16:15----------
point I feel I feel really good about


---------16:17----------
that would you be okay if you were


---------16:20----------
deserving a pity


---------16:24----------
prefer empathy it's a pity I didn't


---------16:27----------
really I don't really feel like I need


---------16:29----------
pity but I think that you know if people


---------16:32----------
want to empathize with my situation I


---------16:34----------
think that's just natural I empathize


---------16:35----------
with people who have facing stuff you


---------16:38----------
know it's normal so how would you


---------16:40----------
describe the difference between pity and


---------16:43----------
empathy it's use when you're glad you're


---------16:47----------
not someone and empathy is when you feel


---------16:50----------
with someone it's a great way to put it


---------16:56----------
hmm so you're concerned that you will be


---------17:01----------
perceived as fishing for pity mm-hmm as


---------17:04----------
in as in people


---------17:09----------
but if I openly discuss everything that


---------17:12----------
people will disbelieve me or think that


---------17:17----------
I'm trying to manipulate them so can I


---------17:20----------
offer a reason why I think this is an


---------17:24----------
important discussion so I think that


---------17:28----------
people assume that their circumstances


---------17:32----------
are primarily responsible for their


---------17:34----------
happiness or unhappiness


---------17:40----------
make sense did you say that again yeah


---------17:43----------
so people assume that their


---------17:46----------
circumstances are responsible for their


---------17:49----------
happiness or their unhappiness one of


---------17:53----------
the most mind-boggling things that I've


---------17:56----------
discovered is that certainly


---------17:57----------
circumstances influence your happiness


---------17:59----------
or unhappiness but what are the most


---------18:03----------
shocking things is that sometimes people


---------18:06----------
can be in bad circumstances and it can


---------18:09----------
be happy and sometimes people can be in


---------18:11----------
good circumstances and be unhappy yes


---------18:14----------
and generally speaking the internet


---------18:17----------
loves to get their pitchforks out when


---------18:20----------
there is someone in good circumstances


---------18:22----------
who is unhappy and we sort of have this


---------18:25----------
idea that circumstances and I'm not


---------18:28----------
saying that they don't influence


---------18:29----------
happiness there's data that suggests


---------18:31----------
that certainly a certain amount of like


---------18:33----------
financial security correlates with


---------18:35----------
happiness or a sense of security so I'm


---------18:39----------
not saying that they're completely


---------18:41----------
independent but I think it could


---------18:43----------
actually be useful for people to hear


---------18:47----------
about your circumstances and then also


---------18:50----------
hear how you're able to be happy in


---------18:53----------
spite of them because that's an


---------18:55----------
important lesson to learn


---------18:57----------
what do you think about that


---------19:01----------
yeah we could do that okay cool so the


---------19:05----------
other thing to just think a little bit


---------19:06----------
about is you know we were talking


---------19:08----------
earlier about your strategy and how


---------19:09----------
there are pros and cons and I wonder


---------19:12----------
whether it's worthwhile like discussing


---------19:14----------
are there other ways or are there ways


---------19:18----------
to deal with the cons of your strategy


---------19:20----------
yeah because can I just speak plainly


---------19:25----------
for a second mm-hmm so based on our last


---------19:28----------
conversation like I don't know what you


---------19:31----------
remember about it but I remembered a


---------19:32----------
couple of things and I think you


---------19:34----------
generally speaking don't place yourself


---------19:36----------
high enough on the priority list of


---------19:38----------
what's important and that's just


---------19:43----------
something that I had to take away from


---------19:45----------
last time and I know that you're an


---------19:46----------
amazing person and you make the world a


---------19:48----------
better place it's just there's a part of


---------19:50----------
me that is that fields and this is a


---------19:54----------
judgment and I apologize if this offends


---------19:56----------
you that you should try to make the


---------19:59----------
world a better place for you from time


---------20:01----------
to time and that's one of the big cons


---------20:04----------
of your strategy that actually makes me


---------20:06----------
sad is because like it bothers me when


---------20:08----------
someone can't sit still because they


---------20:10----------
feel guilty and like they're letting


---------20:12----------
other people down that just bothers me


---------20:15----------
and I I'm trying I don't know if that's


---------20:19----------
sympathy or empathy I'm not quite sure


---------20:21----------
but you know it makes me sad to think


---------20:25----------
that and this is gonna be an


---------20:29----------
exaggeration this could be unfair but


---------20:31----------
I'm gonna say it anyway this is how I


---------20:33----------
feel it makes me sad to imagine you


---------20:36----------
being unable to be happy with yourself


---------20:39----------
unless you're doing something for


---------20:41----------
someone else


---------20:46----------
so I leave it up to you as in terms of


---------20:48----------
which direction we go okay and if you


---------20:52----------
need me to recap a couple of options I'm


---------20:54----------
happy to yes so the couple of options


---------20:59----------
one are the two big options are to hear


---------21:03----------
a little bit about you know how your


---------21:05----------
life is hard and then to explore a


---------21:07----------
little bit about how you can be happy in


---------21:09----------
spite of difficult circumstances right


---------21:13----------
so to paint a pitiable picture which is


---------21:16----------
what you're afraid of but then also like


---------21:18----------
realize that actually we don't have to


---------21:20----------
pay to you because you're happy and how


---------21:22----------
do you find that happiness despite being


---------21:24----------
in circumstances that other people may


---------21:26----------
pity because that's huge like if we can


---------21:29----------
understand that like that's gonna help


---------21:31----------
tons of people could be the most helpful


---------21:34----------
thing that we ever discover on stream


---------21:35----------
which is how to get okay so tell us


---------21:39----------
about your circumstances okay so I have


---------21:45----------
an autoimmune disorder okay about six or


---------21:49----------
seven times a day at least when I do


---------21:51----------
make the time just the I wake up several


---------21:53----------
times drowning because everyone else


---------21:57----------
when they have fluid running down the


---------21:58----------
back up they're very all day like this


---------22:00----------
lighter and stuff it goes somewhere but


---------22:03----------
for me it doesn't and I choke on it and


---------22:05----------
I kind of wake up with burning lungs and


---------22:08----------
I am a high risk of pneumonia


---------22:10----------
aspirational pneumonia and lung scarring


---------22:14----------
so I'm in pain whenever I try to sleep I


---------22:16----------
don't get a good night's sleep and I am


---------22:19----------
constantly vomiting I'm tired


---------22:22----------
some days I won't be able to eat for a


---------22:23----------
few days because my body just decides


---------22:26----------
that it's not gonna let any food in and


---------22:28----------
I'm just going to be sick every time I


---------22:31----------
try to get something into my stomach I


---------22:33----------
tried to get on basic things and I have


---------22:37----------
a lot of responsibilities but they're


---------22:39----------
difficult because sometimes my tics get


---------22:41----------
in the way and I'll throw things on the


---------22:44----------
floor smash things I'll burn myself


---------22:47----------
trying to cook I will try to feed the


---------22:49----------
rabbits and just threw the food


---------22:50----------
everywhere I'll you know I'll punch


---------22:52----------
myself in the face I'll and I'll be so


---------22:55----------
tired and busy and even when I try to


---------22:57----------
sleep I can't


---------22:59----------
so sometimes I'll be getting home with


---------23:00----------
something and I'll just fall asleep out


---------23:02----------
of nowhere and I wake up next to my


---------23:03----------
grasshoppers or whatever and this is the


---------23:05----------
thing like it's really hard and it's


---------23:08----------
really annoying


---------23:08----------
I've tried to have housemates because I


---------23:10----------
choked on my food a lot and if nobody's


---------23:12----------
here when that happens really badly I


---------23:14----------
might not be here anymore


---------23:16----------
but the thing is whenever I get


---------23:17----------
flatmates it goes bad like people hit on


---------23:21----------
me a lot I have to harm you as in like I


---------23:27----------
I'm scared of sounding very vain um I


---------23:30----------
don't necessarily consider myself


---------23:32----------
particularly attractive person but


---------23:34----------
everyone I ever live with ends up


---------23:36----------
getting weird and like stealing my


---------23:37----------
underwear or secretly filming me or


---------23:39----------
trying to coerce me into things and it


---------23:42----------
happens even if they're female and I've


---------23:44----------
been trying to figure out what the


---------23:45----------
problem is and not really getting that


---------23:47----------
one right so I live on my own now and


---------23:50----------
yeah it's risky can I jump in with a


---------23:53----------
what the [ __ ] I know I mean a quick I


---------23:58----------
know it's annoying but yeah you have no


---------24:02----------
idea the things the things the things


---------24:05----------
recently so I had four or five friends


---------24:09----------
I'd read a second time but what the [ __ ]


---------24:13----------
it eat it yeah I know but what key do


---------24:18----------
people just steal your like your


---------24:19----------
flatmates steal your underwear that's a


---------24:21----------
routine occurrence for your flatmates


---------24:25----------
it's happened with multiples that means


---------24:27----------
yes and friends and is there something


---------24:31----------
that we just don't understand about your


---------24:32----------
underwear


---------24:33----------
[Laughter]


---------24:36----------
if so then it's something I'd also don't


---------24:39----------
understand about my underwear this is


---------24:41----------
like like this is like the bathwater


---------24:43----------
thing like I just don't understand some


---------24:45----------
of these things but maybe there's


---------24:46----------
something that we don't get about what


---------24:48----------
is happening right now but yeah that's


---------24:51----------
really bizarre my best guess is


---------24:53----------
pheromones is all like that's my best


---------24:56----------
guess that's actually a damn good guess


---------24:59----------
interesting okay sorry to derail you I


---------25:03----------
just I could I literally could not


---------25:06----------
listen to the rest of what you were


---------25:07----------
saying because my mind had a great big


---------25:10----------
what the [ __ ] are balancing around in


---------25:11----------
there so I have friends who tried to


---------25:17----------
rush to help me you genuinely tried to


---------25:19----------
support me but it often goes awry one of


---------25:23----------
my flatmates kept cooking me food and


---------25:25----------
then it turned to you leaving chocolates


---------25:27----------
on my bed and then alcohol and then


---------25:29----------
doing loads of favours for me and then


---------25:32----------
secretly filming me one day I


---------25:35----------
transferred some he let me use his


---------25:37----------
laptop to transfer some files and


---------25:39----------
accidently deleted them


---------25:40----------
so immediately went into the recycling


---------25:42----------
folder and opened the first folder


---------25:44----------
thicky I'd be the one that was most


---------25:46----------
recently deleted right no it was a


---------25:48----------
motivational it was a fotomat motivation


---------25:50----------
with just the loads of pictures of me


---------25:52----------
that he taken of various social media


---------25:54----------
with my ex-boyfriend cropped out of them


---------25:56----------
and I was ah this might be time to run


---------25:59----------
but like it got creepy I know you feel


---------26:02----------
when you open that


---------26:05----------
you


---------26:07----------
like it's happened to me a few times


---------26:10----------
they're like I just feel this gut


---------26:12----------
sinking um not again and it becomes a


---------26:15----------
dangerous situation and uh I have this


---------26:19----------
to contend with whilst trying to run my


---------26:21----------
life and keep up with everything and


---------26:22----------
just try to stay well and yeah it just


---------26:27----------
puts a lot of strain on me when that


---------26:29----------
happened I stopped coming home for like


---------26:31----------
a month I just went out and did rescue


---------26:33----------
work and stayed in my office working and


---------26:35----------
just got really busy and just avoided


---------26:38----------
the house because that got really bad at


---------26:41----------
one point he said that if I ever got a


---------26:42----------
boyfriend he'd make me homeless so yeah


---------26:45----------
I kind of feel like I'd end up in these


---------26:47----------
situations a lot


---------26:48----------
I keep everyone goes why do you what


---------26:51----------
kind of people are you hanging out with


---------26:52----------
and they just blame me but my friends


---------26:55----------
hang out with these people too and don't


---------26:57----------
see it coming and always think that


---------26:59----------
they're nice people and that everything


---------27:00----------
will be fine


---------27:01----------
some people say I should hang out with


---------27:02----------
women but one of the worst cases of this


---------27:04----------
ever happening to me was a woman and it


---------27:07----------
was this year so like I I don't know I


---------27:09----------
don't know what to do about it but


---------27:11----------
friendships are difficult for me because


---------27:13----------
so many of them go weird like that and


---------27:17----------
so I end up on my own and struggling and


---------27:19----------
lots of people are like why don't you


---------27:21----------
ask me for help and it's like because


---------27:22----------
I'm afraid everyone I pulled closer


---------27:25----------
everyone I spent time with a lot tends


---------27:27----------
to get strange and so I am coping with


---------27:31----------
this alone and it can get a bit


---------27:34----------
overwhelming and very busy


---------27:35----------
I'll have 30 or 40 things on my list I


---------27:38----------
can see why you spent so much time with


---------27:40----------
animals right but yeah I think my mom my


---------27:49----------
mom is another part of it all like she


---------27:51----------
has a lot of illnesses going on we


---------27:54----------
fought for 20 years to get a diagnosis


---------27:57----------
because she was progressively getting


---------27:59----------
more ill she would put her hand up to


---------28:01----------
help me cross the road when I was little


---------28:03----------
and just walk us out in front of a car


---------28:05----------
not because she wanted us to come to


---------28:07----------
harm but because she'd have absences


---------28:09----------
she'd constantly burn food and nearly


---------28:11----------
burned the house down she'd flood the


---------28:12----------
house trying to run herself a bath and


---------28:13----------
in the end I just ended up taking care


---------28:15----------
of a lot of stuff when I was really


---------28:16----------
little because to not do so it was


---------28:18----------
pretty dangerous


---------28:20----------
to leave it up to my mom was pretty


---------28:21----------
dangerous my dad was a bit I don't know


---------28:24----------
out of it and not really there much and


---------28:27----------
to be honest I'm kind of glad he went to


---------28:30----------
hold my hand across the road and another


---------28:32----------
cross the road story and he still had a


---------28:34----------
cigarette in my hand and I have a little


---------28:36----------
bone in my hand because he just


---------28:37----------
accidentally bite me he was a bit


---------28:38----------
absent-minded not because there's


---------28:40----------
anything he wasn't ill or anything


---------28:42----------
he's just absent-minded so to be honest


---------28:44----------
I was happier looking after my mom and


---------28:47----------
yeah that's where I stayed without the


---------28:49----------
to well after they split and yeah I've


---------28:55----------
been looking after her it's been pretty


---------28:57----------
intense the doctors weren't sure what


---------29:00----------
was wrong with her they suspected


---------29:02----------
something neurological at one point they


---------29:04----------
said that she might not have long to


---------29:06----------
live and that all of the symptoms were


---------29:08----------
indicating something very serious and


---------29:09----------
perform and nose took some brain scans


---------29:12----------
and then just didn't tell her what was


---------29:13----------
going on for like months and during that


---------29:15----------
time it was really difficult because we


---------29:17----------
didn't know how long we were she was


---------29:19----------
gonna be around she they just she kept


---------29:22----------
going in they didn't leave her and she


---------29:24----------
ended up with a tumor so large and


---------29:26----------
attached to so many organs that removing


---------29:28----------
it would cause more symptoms than


---------29:29----------
leaving it now and she had a disease for


---------29:34----------
so long that it caused brain and organ


---------29:36----------
damage alongside that that could have


---------29:38----------
been cured with a bit of medication


---------29:39----------
within a week of her getting it and


---------29:41----------
she'd have been fine


---------29:42----------
he said jammer yeah I think


---------29:49----------
it's it's I guess humor is a kind of


---------29:52----------
very dramatic word but what's the thing


---------29:55----------
what was the thing


---------29:57----------
fibroids endometriosis there we go I


---------30:00----------
don't mean to say yeah so it's grown and


---------30:04----------
grown and grown off her womb and just


---------30:06----------
connected everything in inside her and


---------30:09----------
the only way to remove it now would be


---------30:11----------
to remove several other organs so not


---------30:15----------
worth that anymore


---------30:16----------
but the side effects of it being there


---------30:18----------
are quite bad she yeah she's in a lot of


---------30:20----------
pain she's barely out of bed it's pretty


---------30:24----------
serious now and there's nothing we can


---------30:25----------
do


---------30:26----------
so yeah those two things and trying to


---------30:28----------
push for diagnosis her constantly


---------30:29----------
reporting pain we constantly go into the


---------30:31----------
hospital with her going to the doctors


---------30:33----------
with her having some really awful events


---------30:34----------
I remember when I was little I stood in


---------30:36----------
the corner of the room while the


---------30:37----------
paramedics resuscitated her and there


---------30:41----------
was just nothing I could do and there


---------30:42----------
was one of the one of the medics was


---------30:44----------
just looking making me look at him


---------30:45----------
instead of my mom and just talking to me


---------30:47----------
and just keeping me talking because he


---------30:49----------
obviously didn't if it was gonna be her


---------30:51----------
last moments and want me to watch her


---------30:52----------
die so yeah it's been a struggle and


---------30:56----------
scary because the main foundation of my


---------30:59----------
life the most constant human I have in


---------31:01----------
my life every day I don't know whether


---------31:03----------
she's still gonna be here and that's


---------31:05----------
been the case for so long and it's a


---------31:07----------
really precarious place to be


---------31:09----------
because everyone else around me comes


---------31:11----------
and goes and sometimes because of really


---------31:13----------
bad things I mean one of my best friends


---------31:16----------
became a stalker he yeah he he assaulted


---------31:21----------
me he slept in my back garden he watched


---------31:24----------
the house he chased me whenever I left


---------31:26----------
the house some people heard from a shop


---------31:28----------
had to intervene and hold him down


---------31:30----------
because he just yeah so basically the


---------31:36----------
only person I have in my life is someone


---------31:37----------
I don't know how how long I'll I'll get


---------31:39----------
to have and it's it's scary and but I I


---------31:45----------
feel bad as well because I'm so busy


---------31:46----------
taking care of so many animals and


---------31:48----------
trying to keep up with everything that


---------31:50----------
sometimes I'm rushed with her and I'm


---------31:52----------
like hi okay I'll do all the things bye


---------31:54----------
and I feel so bad because I wanna you


---------31:57----------
know I wanna have these conversations I


---------31:59----------
want to sit with her I want to spend


---------32:00----------
more time with her I do whenever I can


---------32:02----------
but whenever it's rushed I feel terrible


---------32:04----------
because I don't know you know is mom


---------32:07----------
gonna be okay next week is this gonna be


---------32:09----------
my last week and what do I get a female


---------32:11----------
so I get a few more years what what's


---------32:12----------
gonna happen hmm


---------32:15----------
so what's that what's it what's that


---------32:17----------
like most the time I don't think about


---------32:21----------
it


---------32:22----------
um and I just take each day so I think


---------32:25----------
you're very good at yeah I just feel


---------32:27----------
like worrying about it won't change


---------32:29----------
whether or not it happens it just mean I


---------32:31----------
suffered twice so I just focus on being


---------32:36----------
grateful for the moments I do yet


---------32:37----------
instead of brought you about the moments


---------32:38----------
I might not get


---------32:40----------
yeah it also says I mean that also


---------32:42----------
sounds like something that you're good


---------32:43----------
at which is that you don't really let


---------32:47----------
yourself feel certain things because


---------32:50----------
there's no utility to them sure but you


---------32:54----------
might start to think that I I maybe bury


---------32:58----------
these emotions that maybe that they're


---------33:00----------
causing a lot of havoc but being


---------33:02----------
unaddressed because that's usually how


---------33:04----------
people don't do those emotions is that


---------33:07----------
they just don't acknowledge that they're


---------33:08----------
there a lot of people who don't think


---------33:10----------
they're particularly emotional are


---------33:11----------
usually emotional wrecks who just can't


---------33:13----------
see their emotions rather than them not


---------33:15----------
being there but with me genuinely I just


---------33:19----------
have this thing where I can just be like


---------33:21----------
now I'm just invest my energy and my


---------33:24----------
thoughts into you other ways of feeling


---------33:27----------
and processing like genuinely I I don't


---------33:30----------
have like some some like I don't know


---------33:34----------
how to describe it like unseen sadness


---------33:37----------
about the situation I really I just feel


---------33:40----------
lucky that mom is here today sure it


---------33:43----------
sounds like you're I mean I'm getting a


---------33:45----------
lot of genuine gratitude from you I'm


---------33:48----------
kind of curious Anita how would you know


---------33:52----------
whether they're doing what you're doing


---------33:54----------
or whether they're the emotional wreck


---------33:57----------
is just buried deeper how can you tell


---------34:04----------
the difference


---------34:04----------
I guess because I have repressed


---------34:09----------
emotions in the past and I it comes with


---------34:12----------
a very specific since sensation and feel


---------34:17----------
okay so if so that's how you know you're


---------34:22----------
not doing it so you you cuz you're


---------34:26----------
saying basically I know what suppressed


---------34:28----------
emotions feel like and I used to do that


---------34:31----------
I've learned now not to do it and it


---------34:35----------
sounds to me like you're practicing some


---------34:36----------
amount of detachment as opposed to


---------34:38----------
suppression like you acknowledge the


---------34:40----------
emotion you recognize it's there and


---------34:42----------
then you sit with it for a little bit


---------34:45----------
and then you kind of choose to focus on


---------34:47----------
other things which is not quite like


---------34:49----------
denial right it's sort of like


---------34:50----------
acknowledgment but separation as opposed


---------34:55----------
to like sticking it in the basement and


---------34:59----------
pretending like it doesn't exist yeah I


---------35:02----------
mean


---------35:06----------
yeah so and recent recent recent oh can


---------35:12----------
you see that behind me can you see my


---------35:14----------
rabbit just like I saw someone move


---------35:17----------
yeah I'll be right back he destroys


---------35:20----------
wives so I have to address that right


---------35:22----------
away


---------35:24----------
hello buddy are you


---------35:29----------
[Music]


---------35:36----------
thanks for waiting sure I think they


---------35:39----------
want to see the rabbit but oh I can grab


---------35:42----------
him if you like he's only in the kitchen


---------35:44----------
he's in the next room it doesn't mind


---------35:47----------
yeah again


---------35:52----------
you


---------35:58----------
you


---------36:13----------
oh wow that's a big rabbit no I'm just


---------36:17----------
small everyone says that he's actually


---------36:19----------
quite a small species of rabbit I'm only


---------36:22----------
5 foot 2 you so everything looks big


---------36:24----------
like sometimes I'll lift up a


---------36:25----------
normal-sized Cup and people like where


---------36:27----------
can I get that giant cup from the rabbit


---------36:32----------
is a boy rabbit or a girl rabbit he's a


---------36:34----------
he I actually so I spotted him in a


---------36:38----------
rescue centre up country and being a


---------36:40----------
friend traveled all day to go and get


---------36:42----------
him umm I thought he'd make a really


---------36:44----------
good husband for my lonely girl because


---------36:46----------
her partner died and I didn't think that


---------36:48----------
she should have to live alone so we're


---------36:50----------
not to get him thinking that you're on


---------36:52----------
like a house on fire but they don't


---------36:53----------
really like each other so I'm still I've


---------36:55----------
been working on it for a year trying to


---------36:56----------
get them to love one another and it's a


---------36:58----------
really hard matchmaking process I can


---------37:01----------
imagine I can imagine that some of your


---------37:03----------
former roommates feel the same way was


---------37:09----------
that out of line I'm sorry was that a


---------37:10----------
dick thing to say no it's I'm so my mind


---------37:15----------
is still bottled by the pheromones and


---------37:19----------
people sniff me a lot like in public and


---------37:22----------
everything [ __ ] yeah they sniff you and


---------37:25----------
pop mm-hmm


---------37:27----------
so like it would be like I have a friend


---------37:30----------
we're not attracted to each other


---------37:32----------
whatsoever one time we got really really


---------37:35----------
drunk and we all just fell asleep in a


---------37:37----------
line adjacent on the sofa watch miss me


---------37:39----------
emailing like um there'll be situations


---------37:42----------
where like I'll wake up to someone


---------37:44----------
asleep humping me like with their


---------37:45----------
clothes on and I'm just like god damn


---------37:47----------
pheromones and I'll just get up and move


---------37:49----------
away like I get all of these sorts of


---------37:51----------
situations all the time and it's so


---------37:54----------
annoying


---------37:56----------
but yeah like people sniff me people


---------37:59----------
stalk me people get weird and yeah


---------38:02----------
basically it's it's a whole thing like I


---------38:06----------
have thousands of stories I just don't


---------38:08----------
know what to do with it anymore how do


---------38:10----------
you understand why this happens to you I


---------38:12----------
don't understand why this happens to me


---------38:15----------
I don't understand why I just understand


---------38:17----------
that it does and that you know I've just


---------38:20----------
grown exasperated with it honestly


---------38:23----------
so it does sound quite exhausting I'm


---------38:26----------
curious do you have any other emotions


---------38:29----------
that come up when you find people have


---------38:31----------
been stealing your underwear or stocking


---------38:34----------
you or anything like that


---------38:35----------
besides exasperation no this point I


---------38:39----------
just feel tired because I don't want to


---------38:42----------
presume that it's gonna happen again


---------38:44----------
it feels vain to presume that every


---------38:46----------
single person that I ever make friends


---------38:48----------
with is just gonna fall in love with me


---------38:49----------
and turn into a menace and so I always


---------38:51----------
give people the chance and I always give


---------38:53----------
people the benefit of the doubt and you


---------38:55----------
know assume that it's gonna be different


---------38:56----------
this time and I always give this speech


---------38:58----------
from like I am not attracted to my


---------39:00----------
friends I am very obvious with my


---------39:02----------
emotions if I'm attracted to someone I


---------39:04----------
will let them know I hate people who


---------39:06----------
come on to me without me giving any


---------39:07----------
signs so I've had to dump a lot of


---------39:09----------
friends because of this and you know


---------39:11----------
it's kind of like this big warning


---------39:13----------
statement it's kind of like a subtle if


---------39:14----------
you hit on me I'm gonna run away kind of


---------39:17----------
situation because I I'm so used to it


---------39:18----------
now and it doesn't work the statement


---------39:22----------
doesn't work no hmm I mean it's it's


---------39:28----------
just like this background noise till the


---------39:31----------
other trouble I have is that I'd like to


---------39:33----------
have friendships that don't end in


---------39:34----------
disaster


---------39:35----------
I mean I'm one of my friends assaulted


---------39:38----------
me there was a witness


---------39:40----------
unfortunately somebody else watched it


---------39:42----------
happen and he was also a friend and he


---------39:45----------
did nothing I tried to go to the police


---------39:47----------
and police did nothing in fact I had to


---------39:50----------
report him for several other things that


---------39:52----------
were relatively minor by comparison for


---------39:56----------
example you know sleeping in my back


---------39:59----------
garden chasing me around following me


---------40:01----------
everywhere and constantly trying to DOX


---------40:04----------
me on stream this sort of thing but then


---------40:07----------
after they found out my view account and


---------40:08----------
how many people knew that the police


---------40:10----------
were failing me


---------40:11----------
then they took action but he's still


---------40:13----------
free he's been charged but he's still


---------40:15----------
free and yeah he still harasses me


---------40:18----------
online from time to time and I'm pretty


---------40:20----------
sure he probably will come back to the


---------40:22----------
house again at some point because he


---------40:25----------
always does so yeah but he's what do


---------40:29----------
they see in you I don't know genuinely


---------40:34----------
don't know it's not like I'm a pretty


---------40:36----------
average


---------40:37----------
person in most respects I'm not like


---------40:39----------
some supermodel that's just irresistible


---------40:41----------
so I genuinely don't know why this keeps


---------40:43----------
happening well there's something about


---------40:45----------
you that clearly is irresistible


---------40:50----------
like literally like ears like not just


---------40:54----------
like their I mean like it's it sounds


---------40:56----------
like people I can't stay away and sort


---------40:59----------
of it doesn't I mean it's strange right


---------41:01----------
because these are people that are able


---------41:03----------
to have normal relationships with some


---------41:05----------
of your other friends but there's


---------41:07----------
something different pheromones that that


---------41:13----------
you know and you're kind of saying that


---------41:15----------
like your friends are sort of like oh


---------41:16----------
you know they think that everything's


---------41:18----------
gonna be okay but they don't really


---------41:19----------
understand it like it's just a strange


---------41:21----------
pattern then yeah


---------41:29----------
do you have any idea I don't I've been


---------41:33----------
trying to figure it out because I just


---------41:35----------
want it to stop


---------41:38----------
I uh you have no idea like I've had


---------41:42----------
female friends uh I've had female


---------41:44----------
friends you've done this to meet you um


---------41:48----------
I've had like I've got like three female


---------41:52----------
friends who send me drunk messages well


---------41:54----------
they come on to me and then apologized


---------41:55----------
the next morning and I'm just like I'd


---------41:59----------
love to hang out with you but you know I


---------42:01----------
don't want to another thing that I have


---------42:03----------
to start reporting to the police or any


---------42:04----------
more drama and stuff and like I doesn't


---------42:09----------
matter I tried to watch for the pattern


---------42:12----------
in life am i spending too much time with


---------42:13----------
lonely people but they could be really


---------42:15----------
diverse they can be really outgoing and


---------42:16----------
have lots of friends and it still


---------42:18----------
happens they can be really popular and


---------42:19----------
it's happens they can have lots of


---------42:21----------
really attractive friends to hit on and


---------42:23----------
they still hit on me I can set up


---------42:26----------
boundaries and be really clear and


---------42:27----------
they'll still do it


---------42:29----------
I I get blamed as well people are like


---------42:33----------
what like what are you doing they act


---------42:35----------
like it's my fault like I go why do you


---------42:37----------
hang out with strange people and it's


---------42:38----------
like


---------42:40----------
Oh Anita I'm gonna say something that


---------42:44----------
may sound like blaming you but but


---------42:46----------
please listen carefully I know it sounds


---------42:47----------
weird but so here's here's what I'm


---------42:51----------
hearing from you okay and it's weird so


---------42:53----------
you've looked for patterns a smart thing


---------42:57----------
to do like is it something about the


---------42:59----------
play the way I find my roommates am I am


---------43:03----------
I on the wrong part of Craigslist where


---------43:05----------
I'm looking


---------43:06----------
instead of like looking for roommates


---------43:08----------
I'm like looking for love am i posting


---------43:11----------
in the wrong area you know and the


---------43:14----------
interesting thing is that like if we


---------43:15----------
think about it logically and you know it


---------43:18----------
seems to be independent of gender it


---------43:19----------
seems that these people are able to have


---------43:21----------
normal relationships with other people


---------43:22----------
it seems to be that it's not like a


---------43:25----------
particular ethnicity or like you know


---------43:28----------
and there isn't some kind of


---------43:29----------
overwhelming physical attractiveness or


---------43:32----------
something like that then then I mean if


---------43:35----------
it's not a factor with them which is


---------43:36----------
interestingly enough that's what you've


---------43:38----------
been saying right is there's no pattern


---------43:40----------
in terms of how I'm selecting people


---------43:42----------
then that sort of suggests that it's


---------43:44----------
something with you and I'm not trying to


---------43:48----------
blame you I'm just saying like the the


---------43:49----------
case that you're making is a really


---------43:51----------
strong one that it's something with you


---------43:54----------
right that there is something and it's


---------43:56----------
interesting because I asked you earlier


---------43:57----------
like why do people you know steal your


---------44:00----------
underwear and you were saying like


---------44:01----------
pheromone it's like that's not a them


---------44:03----------
factor that's a you factor it's um a


---------44:06----------
pheromone is sort of like I wonder if so


---------44:09----------
I wonder if it's actually bear moans


---------44:10----------
right which would be interesting because


---------44:13----------
if you can get multiple women unclear


---------44:16----------
what their sexual preferences or sexual


---------44:18----------
orientation is but be especially


---------44:20----------
interesting if they were actually


---------44:21----------
heterosexual and they drunkenly message


---------44:24----------
you two of them ah yeah so so so how do


---------44:30----------
we like that's weird


---------44:31----------
right like so then I'm not blaming you


---------44:33----------
but at the same time I'm saying that it


---------44:35----------
seems like you know the common element


---------44:38----------
doesn't have anything to do with them it


---------44:40----------
has something to do with you mm-hmm but


---------44:43----------
then like I tried changing my approach


---------44:45----------
there are some people who I've never met


---------44:47----------
in person - I barely speak to you sure I


---------44:51----------
think you've tried changing the things


---------44:53----------
that you're aware of


---------44:54----------
hmm right so like the question is what


---------44:58----------
are the things that you do that you're


---------45:00----------
not aware of and that's a hard question


---------45:03----------
to answer because how are you supposed


---------45:05----------
to know if you're not aware of them okay


---------45:07----------
fair so let me ask you something Anita


---------45:10----------
do you feel like like I guess a big


---------45:12----------
sense of stuckness from you I get a


---------45:15----------
sense that like you're kind of [ __ ]


---------45:16----------
either way like you know either you


---------45:21----------
start taking it like you can't stop


---------45:22----------
working because then you're gonna feel


---------45:24----------
guilty and letting like you know letting


---------45:27----------
people down and the emotions will


---------45:28----------
overwhelm you but you can't keep working


---------45:30----------
because then you're gonna be burnt out


---------45:32----------
and you're not gonna be able to sleep


---------45:33----------
and things like that it's like damned if


---------45:35----------
you do damned if you don't that's like a


---------45:37----------
theme that I'm hearing it like even when


---------45:38----------
it comes to your mom it's like you can


---------45:41----------
try to spend more time with her you can


---------45:42----------
try to not spend more time with her like


---------45:44----------
either one sort of doesn't work that


---------45:46----------
she's really ill and she needs her


---------45:48----------
support and she may be gone tomorrow and


---------45:50----------
I mean it's it's kind of like there's


---------45:51----------
like nothing you can do and we hear I


---------45:54----------
hear that as well from from kind of you


---------45:57----------
know rebates it's like you try to have


---------45:59----------
friends and then it's like panty


---------46:03----------
sniffing backyard parties and then or


---------46:06----------
you're by yourself and then if you're by


---------46:08----------
yourself it's like you're gonna choke on


---------46:10----------
food and you're actually like you could


---------46:11----------
die it's like damned if you do damned if


---------46:14----------
you don't


---------46:15----------
like if there's one thing there that I'm


---------46:17----------
hearing from you it's like I don't see


---------46:19----------
how you can make a choice because no


---------46:22----------
choice is good does that make sense yeah


---------46:30----------
um I've chosen which isn't to live alone


---------46:34----------
because I feel happier and safer sure I


---------46:39----------
can imagine I mean I actually I can't


---------46:42----------
imagine because I've never felt the kind


---------46:45----------
of danger that you were describing I


---------46:47----------
actually cannot imagine I could try to


---------46:50----------
imagine but I can't even put my head in


---------46:53----------
your in your head what are you feeling


---------46:56----------
right now


---------46:57----------
[ __ ] okay yeah yeah what are you feeling


---------47:07----------
just sat in that down I mean


---------47:14----------
just certain let down by my friends the


---------47:18----------
ones that have kind weird like the ones


---------47:21----------
who'll risk prison to like do stupid


---------47:26----------
stuff and ruin the friendship the


---------47:29----------
friends that would idly watch and


---------47:31----------
pretend it's not happening until it's


---------47:33----------
too late and you know just uh just how


---------47:37----------
often this happens and just how tired I


---------47:39----------
am and just how I just can't make sense


---------47:42----------
of it and I feel bad even mentioning it


---------47:43----------
because people don't believe me all they


---------47:45----------
blame me and I feel like I've tried


---------47:48----------
everything I feel like people are like


---------47:51----------
what are you wearing and it's like I


---------47:52----------
could be wearing a full-on trench coat


---------47:54----------
in the middle of summer just covering


---------47:55----------
every inch of skin I possibly can people


---------47:58----------
still hit on me in the street you'll


---------47:59----------
still get weird with me and sniff me and


---------48:01----------
constantly like don't let me cross the


---------48:03----------
road because they want to get my number


---------48:05----------
and stuff and they're like you know


---------48:06----------
don't ignore me [ __ ] and all this stuff


---------48:08----------
and I just feel like it's so hard to


---------48:11----------
talk about because nobody believes it


---------48:13----------
happens nobody believes that this is


---------48:14----------
going on and I just don't know what to


---------48:16----------
do about it because I want to have


---------48:18----------
friends and I want to feel okay and I


---------48:19----------
want to have people that I can trust and


---------48:21----------
sometimes I think I found people and I


---------48:23----------
will known them for years and it will


---------48:25----------
just happen out of the blue and I'm just


---------48:26----------
tired


---------48:29----------
that sounds really exhausting


---------48:33----------
can I think for a second


---------48:42----------
do you work with a therapist or mental


---------48:45----------
health professional by the way you don't


---------48:47----------
I used to back when I was depressed I


---------48:50----------
used to but when I stopped feeling


---------48:51----------
depressed and I felt okay


---------48:56----------
what do you think about seeing one again


---------48:58----------
I don't know how they could help me


---------49:00----------
because I know I make very punishing


---------49:02----------
lists and I know I keep myself busy


---------49:05----------
haha I am okay mentally I think that


---------49:10----------
some some of these things like what


---------49:12----------
happened with one of my roommates and


---------49:15----------
what happened wouldn't my friends


---------49:17----------
recently and things like that


---------49:21----------
I don't know how I can prevent that from


---------49:24----------
happening except to just keep trying and


---------49:26----------
keep trusting people until I find the


---------49:27----------
right ones unfortunately well so it's


---------49:30----------
hot that's actually exactly why I think


---------49:33----------
one may be helpful because I I think


---------49:35----------
that we're missing some piece of the


---------49:37----------
puzzle here hmm right because what


---------49:40----------
you're describing sort of just doesn't


---------49:42----------
it doesn't compute there's like some


---------49:43----------
variable to the equation and maybe it's


---------49:46----------
actually pheromones like maybe there's


---------49:48----------
something about you that just drives


---------49:50----------
people insane because that's certainly


---------49:51----------
what it sounds like now the interesting


---------49:54----------
thing is that I think the reason to


---------49:56----------
potentially see a therapist is for you


---------49:58----------
to get someone get a different pair of


---------50:01----------
eyes besides your own to look at your


---------50:04----------
situation and see if yeah I've asked


---------50:09----------
friends about this people who knew the


---------50:10----------
people that did this to me and they've


---------50:13----------
said that sometimes I'm friends with


---------50:16----------
very lonely people who can be very


---------50:18----------
desperate you don't often get as much


---------50:20----------
approval and attention as I'm willing to


---------50:23----------
give them and that that seems like


---------50:25----------
intimacy to people who don't have that


---------50:27----------
level of friendship normally and that


---------50:30----------
maybe they take it a lot more seriously


---------50:32----------
than I do but I setup my boundary as I


---------50:34----------
say if this isn't romantic and they


---------50:36----------
still pursue it but also I can be very


---------50:40----------
forgiving so limp I hope someone crosses


---------50:42----------
a boundary I don't necessarily act like


---------50:44----------
I'm outraged immediately when I shed and


---------50:47----------
this means that whilst I'm processing


---------50:49----------
whether or not I should be angry about


---------50:50----------
it or act out and you know kind of say


---------50:53----------
look stay away or anything like that


---------50:54----------
they've kind of said well she didn't get


---------50:57----------
upset that's consent sort of thing and


---------50:59----------
they keep pushing it and pushing it and


---------51:01----------
so I know that that's a problem but I


---------51:04----------
also know that a lot of the people that


---------51:07----------
have done this to me have also been


---------51:08----------
people with friends who are happy you


---------51:10----------
have emotional support have connections


---------51:12----------
and so sometimes it does feel like I


---------51:15----------
don't know that would be that would make


---------51:18----------
sense if it was consistently the case


---------51:21----------
sure so so I think that's another


---------51:24----------
interesting example of light


---------51:27----------
kind of like that stuckness right so


---------51:29----------
you're you have reasons on the pro side


---------51:31----------
like oh that would explain everything


---------51:32----------
except dot dot dot so there's there's a


---------51:36----------
very kind of conflicting theme through a


---------51:39----------
lot of what you say and it's kind of


---------51:42----------
like maybe it's this way but except it's


---------51:44----------
not and the other thing I would say just


---------51:47----------
very simply is that I don't know that


---------51:49----------
friends can provide for you the same


---------51:51----------
degree of support or examination that a


---------51:56----------
licensed professional can write because


---------51:59----------
they're gonna be friends and they're not


---------52:00----------
trained to like see patterns because I


---------52:03----------
am curious so Anita I'm gonna ask you a


---------52:05----------
question and and I understand that this


---------52:08----------
question may come across as offensive um


---------52:11----------
if it does come across as offensive


---------52:12----------
please let me know is there any part of


---------52:15----------
you that's flattered by what they do no


---------52:18----------
no because I know that a lot of these


---------52:22----------
guys are so lonely that if anybody else


---------52:24----------
you know was around that gave them the


---------52:27----------
same level of attention they probably do


---------52:29----------
the same thing like I've learnt that


---------52:32----------
it's not you don't have to be special


---------52:34----------
for people to be attracted to you that


---------52:36----------
quite often guys will especially will


---------52:38----------
just take what they can get and it's not


---------52:40----------
you don't have to be beautiful or smart


---------52:42----------
or funny for guys to just be like yeah


---------52:45----------
I'll sleep with you you'll sleep with me


---------52:47----------
right please sleep with me right so no


---------52:49----------
it doesn't feel flowering it feels like


---------52:51----------
ah it feels like I want to make friends


---------52:54----------
with people I want to have genuine


---------52:55----------
connections that last and there are


---------52:57----------
always lonely dicks just getting in the


---------53:00----------
way and just like I'd like do you okay


---------53:03----------
do you feel flattered by anything


---------53:13----------
that's a weird question yeah I guess


---------53:18----------
actually comments um compliment


---------53:20----------
something that I I can take credit for


---------53:23----------
like I'm not really I'm not really happy


---------53:26----------
with or don't really care about comments


---------53:28----------
and my parents I didn't really choose my


---------53:29----------
genetics I did choose your why Who I am


---------53:32----------
or my ethics or the way I go about life


---------53:35----------
or the way that I choose to impact


---------53:37----------
animals and things like that so I guess


---------53:39----------
again I I genuinely like ah thank you


---------53:42----------
and I weirdly I trust compliments from


---------53:45----------
women more these days because I'm


---------53:48----------
usually a little bit wary now after


---------53:50----------
everything I've been through that you


---------53:51----------
know I don't know off the bat if a guy


---------53:53----------
is hitting on me and just trying to


---------53:55----------
butter me up


---------53:56----------
initially some cautious so usually when


---------53:59----------
like a woman chooses to you like


---------54:00----------
compliment something I've chosen about


---------54:02----------
myself and like wow cool thank you but


---------54:05----------
if it dudes like I like your ass I'm


---------54:06----------
just like yeah so I'm really happy to


---------54:11----------
hear that India because I was a I was


---------54:13----------
growing a little bit concerned that


---------54:15----------
maybe you don't let other people


---------54:17----------
appreciate you


---------54:20----------
[Music]


---------54:23----------
I have a friend he's awesome he's never


---------54:25----------
done anything bad


---------54:26----------
um he's a physicist and will usually get


---------54:30----------
a thermos of like a hot drink


---------54:31----------
we'll go and sit by the beach we'll


---------54:33----------
watch the sunset we'll look at the stars


---------54:35----------
and he'll tell me loads of cool facts


---------54:36----------
about them because he does Astrid and he


---------54:40----------
is genuinely very complimentary but


---------54:43----------
he'll compliment actual things about me


---------54:45----------
and yeah I do the same for him and I


---------54:47----------
really appreciate him I think I can have


---------54:49----------
a healthy reciprocal friendships there


---------54:52----------
just ain't incredibly rare absolutely


---------54:55----------
and there's a little part of me that's


---------54:58----------
had friendships like that before for


---------54:59----------
years that I've turned to right so I'm


---------55:01----------
still slightly under guard like I'm


---------55:06----------
scared to you like with friends like


---------55:08----------
that I have like a few where they have


---------55:11----------
like partners and stuff I won't touch


---------55:13----------
them I won't


---------55:15----------
I won't hug them I won't you know what I


---------55:18----------
mean that because I'm scared of giving


---------55:21----------
any signals that will trigger that kind


---------55:23----------
of behavior from like I get like some


---------55:27----------
some people who've taken it too far or


---------55:29----------
gone weird because it happens out of the


---------55:32----------
blue sometimes spontaneously


---------55:35----------
and I don't know what causes it and I'm


---------55:38----------
just scared and there's little things


---------55:40----------
like that that just really make me


---------55:41----------
nervous now because I don't want to lose


---------55:43----------
the friendship and I don't know what it


---------55:45----------
is yet and I'm just terrified of losing


---------55:47----------
people to this issue


---------55:51----------
yeah I I can I can see that you know


---------55:54----------
there is almost like a traumatic


---------55:56----------
paranoia there like it's like it's


---------55:59----------
happened to you so many times that you


---------56:01----------
become so so careful that you won't even


---------56:05----------
engage in like normal behaviors like


---------56:07----------
hugging because you're afraid of what


---------56:09----------
will happen I mean that sounds really


---------56:11----------
awful


---------56:12----------
[Music]


---------56:15----------
any questions for me so far


---------56:22----------
I don't know I think what let me just


---------56:24----------
recenter of like where we're going on


---------56:26----------
why we're going so urology about some of


---------56:29----------
my illnesses and challenges I've told


---------56:33----------
you about some of the difficulties with


---------56:35----------
friendships and people hitting on me


---------56:37----------
with your mind female


---------56:38----------
yeah and how I feel quite isolated and


---------56:41----------
how I'd like to fit form bonds and have


---------56:44----------
people in my life


---------56:46----------
it doesn't always pan out the way I hope


---------56:48----------
mm-hmm so now you kind of know a lot of


---------56:55----------
the stuff that troubles me and I find


---------56:57----------
difficult about my existence yeah things


---------56:59----------
that I'm trying to make sense of and


---------57:00----------
trying to maintain some level of


---------57:02----------
happiness and quality of life through


---------57:04----------
yeah so can we talk about that part now


---------57:09----------
sure


---------57:10----------
how are you happy


---------57:16----------
I think I like I used to be very


---------57:20----------
isolated and static and nothing in my


---------57:22----------
life changed and now every morning I


---------57:25----------
wake up and there's just a million


---------57:26----------
possibilities


---------57:27----------
and I get to have a positive impact on


---------57:30----------
those around me it feels powerful to be


---------57:32----------
the one that rewrites a story like with


---------57:34----------
with with him with Peter he was


---------57:37----------
abandoned because he's a destroyer and


---------57:39----------
he's a destroyed a lot of my stuff um


---------57:41----------
he's quite angry he's a little ball of


---------57:44----------
hate he looks adorable he's a little


---------57:46----------
ball of hate and yeah I think I'm so


---------57:50----------
glad I got to make him happy and give


---------57:54----------
him treats and that he's gonna have a


---------57:56----------
great quality of life he's gonna have


---------57:58----------
all the best pet care he's gonna be okay


---------58:00----------
now even though the first people to love


---------58:02----------
him don't anymore


---------58:03----------
and I get to you know I get to talk to


---------58:06----------
loads of people online I get messages


---------58:08----------
from people who are struggling I get


---------58:10----------
messages from people who've taken stuff


---------58:12----------
from my stream and my coping mechanisms


---------58:13----------
we're living a better life now and they


---------58:15----------
talk through what they've taken from it


---------58:17----------
and you know I get to I get to change


---------58:19----------
things for people and I get to make sure


---------58:21----------
my mom's okay and I get to see a lot of


---------58:23----------
positivity in the world and I get to be


---------58:25----------
a part of a lot of positivity in the


---------58:26----------
world I guess laughs I get to have a few


---------58:28----------
drinks and like an pikas with my friends


---------58:30----------
sometimes when I get the time and even


---------58:33----------
though that's not as often as it used to


---------58:35----------
be I feel really privileged to have


---------58:37----------
people in my life and to smile at them


---------58:38----------
and to just like enjoy these moments and


---------58:40----------
I kind of feel like if I wait for


---------58:43----------
everything to be perfect before I can be


---------58:45----------
happy I'll never be happy and there


---------58:47----------
there's always gonna be stuff I'm not


---------58:49----------
happy with there's always gonna be


---------58:50----------
something to be dissatisfied with we're


---------58:51----------
not meant to be satisfied and I can keep


---------58:53----------
on improving my life but that doesn't


---------58:55----------
mean that I'm blind to all the beauty in


---------58:56----------
it um and yeah I think to be honest even


---------59:00----------
suffering suffering is a privilege


---------59:02----------
because ah I get a short moment of life


---------59:05----------
I get a short moment to exist and then


---------59:09----------
I'm gone and for most of the existence


---------59:11----------
of the universe I haven't been here and


---------59:13----------
won't be here so for the brief time that


---------59:15----------
gets seen hear and feel and think and be


---------59:18----------
I feel really honored to have that even


---------59:21----------
if not everything about it feels awesome


---------59:23----------
everything about it is awesome but kia's


---------59:26----------
experiencing stuff is a privilege and I


---------59:29----------
remember that every day and I feel


---------59:30----------
really really really lucky


---------59:32----------
to exist and I really really feel


---------59:35----------
passionate about leaving the world a


---------59:36----------
better place the one I found it and I


---------59:39----------
get to do that every day I don't know


---------59:40----------
how long I have but every day at the end


---------59:42----------
of the day I know I've chipped away at


---------59:44----------
that goal I guess and I know that I've


---------59:46----------
I've kind of not just justified being


---------59:49----------
but really loved the chance to be and


---------59:51----------
yeah if I die tomorrow I'm really glad


---------59:54----------
that I did everything I did because I I


---------59:57----------
devoted a lot of my time and energy and


---------59:59----------
my power to influence the world to do


---------60:01----------
things that I'm genuinely proud to have


---------60:03----------
been a part of and I have a lot of


---------60:05----------
really great memories um so yeah I feel


---------60:07----------
good I like life life is awesome even if


---------60:11----------
in order to enjoy it you have to have


---------60:13----------
some downside sometimes and maybe I'll


---------60:15----------
figure out how to make friends with


---------60:17----------
people who don't want to meet with me


---------60:19----------
but maybe that's the thing that will


---------60:20----------
happen I'm still figuring it out I've


---------60:22----------
tried a lot of approaches so far I'll


---------60:24----------
chip at it and for the friends that I do


---------60:26----------
you have the handful that have stayed


---------60:27----------
and not done anything like that so


---------60:29----------
grateful for them I'm scared but


---------60:31----------
grateful and um yeah and like I have


---------60:36----------
this overall philosophy overall with the


---------60:38----------
whole existence of the universe you know


---------60:40----------
being the lens through which the


---------60:41----------
universe observes itself stuff which I


---------60:42----------
talk about a lot on stream but there's


---------60:44----------
also like an underlying I know what I


---------60:48----------
exist I know the things that make me


---------60:51----------
glad to exist I know the things that


---------60:52----------
feel good about having lived that I can


---------60:56----------
do daily and monthly and yearly


---------60:58----------
depending on how long they take that


---------61:00----------
make me grateful and satisfied and I


---------61:04----------
build like I found stuff that is like ah


---------61:07----------
like a bucket like I like drops in a


---------61:09----------
bucket that fill and stay instead of


---------61:12----------
constantly dripping away so many


---------61:14----------
beautiful energy yeah well thank you um


---------61:18----------
I don't I I don't remember anything of


---------61:21----------
what I just said cuz I'm tired so I


---------61:22----------
don't know which part was an analogy but


---------61:24----------
cool um there was a the thing is I used


---------61:27----------
to I used to find happiness and things


---------61:29----------
that used to drip away and a lot of


---------61:31----------
people do that like when you buy stuff


---------61:32----------
like you buy a thing and you have the


---------61:34----------
thing and you're like cool and then you


---------61:36----------
just want to buy another thing it


---------61:37----------
doesn't really make you happy and it


---------61:38----------
won't matter like when you die no one's


---------61:40----------
gonna remember that you had those shoes


---------61:42----------
no one's gonna remember your opinion


---------61:44----------
aren't drop like that stuff's going


---------61:45----------
trip away and it probably drove away day


---------61:47----------
year you probably won't remember what


---------61:49----------
shoes you had a couple of years ago so


---------61:51----------
basically a lot of people reach for


---------61:54----------
happiness and treat themselves to things


---------61:56----------
that don't really build and satisfy


---------61:59----------
they're just kind of like a stopgap and


---------62:01----------
I found stuff that genuinely sits Joe


---------62:05----------
not only is there how they how do you


---------62:07----------
find stuff that genuinely says


---------62:13----------
how do you know which drop it drops stay


---------62:17----------
in your bucket and which ones drip away


---------62:23----------
first


---------62:27----------
so


---------62:31----------
I remember when I had at their best we


---------62:33----------
used to talk about this I used to have a


---------62:34----------
lot of stuff that I would do but it


---------62:35----------
wouldn't keep me happy and I'd have to


---------62:37----------
constantly be running and constantly


---------62:39----------
doing it over and over again to feel any


---------62:40----------
semblance of okayness and then I started


---------62:44----------
doing the things that I felt I couldn't


---------62:48----------
help but do things that if no one paid


---------62:51----------
me I'd still be doing if it hurt I'd


---------62:54----------
still be doing the stuff that I can't


---------62:56----------
help that do and I started allowing


---------62:59----------
myself to give time to doing that more


---------63:01----------
than everything else I used to just run


---------63:03----------
around looking after my mom and kind of


---------63:04----------
chasing after my ex and just making sure


---------63:07----------
he was okay and and attending to


---------63:09----------
everyone else's needs when I wanted to


---------63:11----------
go and do volunteering and I wanted to


---------63:13----------
look after animals and I wanted to go


---------63:15----------
and I wanted to read books I wanted to


---------63:17----------
educate myself and this sort of thing


---------63:18----------
and that's the kind of stuff that stayed


---------63:19----------
and that I loved but I wasn't allowing


---------63:22----------
myself to invest in so when I actually


---------63:24----------
just let my urges free and just did


---------63:28----------
exactly what I wanted


---------63:29----------
I gained experiences that I remember for


---------63:31----------
the rest of my life and connections I


---------63:33----------
remember for the rest of my life even if


---------63:35----------
they don't turn out awesomely in the end


---------63:36----------
like I still feel really lucky about the


---------63:38----------
friends that I hang out with I have fond


---------63:40----------
memories of the guy who assaulted me I'm


---------63:42----------
glad I met him I'm glad he gave me a


---------63:44----------
chance to laugh and a chance to you


---------63:46----------
learn and stuff and I'm sad it's over


---------63:49----------
but I'm not going to define our


---------63:51----------
friendship by the way that it ended I'm


---------63:53----------
gonna define it by all the things I was


---------63:55----------
lucky to experience you see so I guess


---------63:59----------
it was worth reaching out and risking it


---------64:00----------
even though I'm really scared of people


---------64:02----------
these days sorry I didn't mean to start


---------64:05----------
laughing but it just occurred to me but


---------64:07----------
maybe that's the pheromones would you


---------64:10----------
just hear are you talking about this


---------64:13----------
stalker and how you can appreciate


---------64:16----------
people and appreciate your friendship


---------64:19----------
despite the way that it ended that


---------64:21----------
sounds intoxicating to have someone in


---------64:24----------
your life who like treats you that way


---------64:28----------
like I could imagine that people are


---------64:30----------
drawn to that non-judgmental acceptance


---------64:33----------
and gratitude and appreciation for life


---------64:36----------
like a moth drawn to a flame because


---------64:40----------
that is that's rare


---------64:41----------
right and either like most people who


---------64:43----------
get stalked


---------64:44----------
have difficulty appreciating parts of


---------64:47----------
the relationship and expressing


---------64:48----------
gratitude towards the relationship


---------64:51----------
before people got crazy right


---------64:58----------
[Music]


---------65:06----------
I hate how I hate how right you are


---------65:09----------
because like one thing that is


---------65:12----------
consistent that my friends say that I


---------65:13----------
can't really deny is that I'm very


---------65:16----------
forgiving


---------65:18----------
like I have this thing where man


---------65:25----------
so like when people [ __ ] up I'm like


---------65:27----------
yeah I'll make mistakes to you someday


---------65:29----------
and if I want to deserve forgiveness


---------65:31----------
I'll I'm gonna be understanding


---------65:33----------
empathetic and you're going through this


---------65:34----------
right now and this was going through


---------65:36----------
your head and I understand that just


---------65:38----------
like you to stop and I'm really like


---------65:39----------
gentle and forgiving I mean he did a lot


---------65:44----------
of stuff that built up to the assault


---------65:46----------
that people kind of be like well why


---------65:48----------
didn't you just cut it off there and I


---------65:52----------
was like jeez I was okay and you know


---------65:55----------
people make mistakes and yeah I think


---------65:58----------
it's the fact that I'm very forgiving


---------66:00----------
that may be a pretty consistent


---------66:02----------
component in this because I'm thinking


---------66:04----------
back to all the people all the extreme


---------66:05----------
examples there was a girl who literally


---------66:08----------
seduced and slept with everyone around


---------66:10----------
me and sent nudes to them and all sorts


---------66:12----------
because she wanted to get closer to me


---------66:14----------
like the minute anyone appeared on


---------66:16----------
stream with me or whatever suddenly she


---------66:18----------
was their best friend and she'd be


---------66:20----------
trying to move in with them or whatever


---------66:22----------
right and yeah it got to the point when


---------66:24----------
she broke a lot of hearts and really


---------66:26----------
upset a lot of people and in the end I


---------66:29----------
was just like wow you've caused a trail


---------66:31----------
of devastation here lady um and she just


---------66:34----------
would not stop hitting on me over and


---------66:37----------
over and over and I said no but I was


---------66:40----------
forgiving and then she drunk text me and


---------66:42----------
she'd say this and she'd do that and I'd


---------66:44----------
be like no but I forgive you it's cool


---------66:47----------
then she'd be like I'm so sorry it's


---------66:49----------
okay it's okay I understand you sorry


---------66:51----------
I'm sure it won't happen again


---------66:53----------
and then she'd do it again and I'd be


---------66:55----------
forgiving and then like my friend would


---------66:57----------
have a broken why are you so forgiving


---------67:05----------
you don't know


---------67:07----------
okay yeah


---------67:16----------
so can we go can I share a couple


---------67:19----------
thoughts with you yeah some of them I


---------67:23----------
hope will be helpful to people some of


---------67:27----------
them may be a little bit concerning if


---------67:32----------
that's okay


---------67:33----------
yeah so I see a couple patterns here


---------67:37----------
that that I think it's worth your walk


---------67:39----------
your time to explore but let's start


---------67:42----------
with this so what we were talking about


---------67:45----------
how you were able to be happy despite


---------67:47----------
all of this stuff I think that that is


---------67:49----------
amazing


---------67:50----------
like that kind of free association


---------67:57----------
speech rant about how to view the world


---------68:00----------
is like absolutely beautiful Mita and I


---------68:03----------
think there's there a couple of


---------68:04----------
subtleties there and my favorite


---------68:07----------
subtlety is you always use the verb get


---------68:10----------
to when you talk about yourself which is


---------68:14----------
it it's like it's a little subtle it's


---------68:16----------
like a subtle thing but like you use


---------68:18----------
that you use the verb get like I get to


---------68:21----------
dot dot dot I get to dot dot dot I get


---------68:24----------
to dot dot write like I get to


---------68:26----------
appreciate this I get to do this I get


---------68:28----------
to do this I get to do this I get to do


---------68:30----------
this and so there's there's just a lot


---------68:32----------
of gratitude like baked in to the way


---------68:35----------
that you look in the world it the world


---------68:37----------
which i think is a key thing because


---------68:39----------
happiness would this says that happiness


---------68:42----------
is not about like circumstances it's


---------68:44----------
about mindset it's about detachment it's


---------68:48----------
about being able to appreciate as


---------68:50----------
opposed to expect


---------68:52----------
so expectation leads to suffering and


---------68:55----------
like a lack of expectation is what leads


---------69:00----------
to happiness and if we hear your words


---------69:03----------
it's kind of interesting because I've


---------69:05----------
never heard someone who expects a lot


---------69:06----------
say I get to because get to sounds like


---------69:09----------
a privilege right it sounds like


---------69:11----------
something extra that you get to do it's


---------69:14----------
not that like you're entitled to do it


---------69:18----------
like I don't I'm allowed to sit in this


---------69:22----------
chair it's my right to sit in this chair


---------69:25----------
and nowadays we tend to be I'm not


---------69:28----------
saying that this is negative I'm just


---------69:29----------
saying it's an


---------69:29----------
kind of consequence that I never


---------69:31----------
realized when we think about rights


---------69:33----------
right rights are about entitlement and


---------69:35----------
rights are about expectations and I


---------69:37----------
think rights are a good thing but


---------69:40----------
there's like a big difference between


---------69:41----------
being entitled to do something and


---------69:43----------
getting to do something and getting to


---------69:46----------
do something is about appreciation and


---------69:48----------
what I really hear from you is that


---------69:49----------
despite all of the terrible things in


---------69:51----------
your life you have genuinely found the


---------69:54----------
capacity to appreciate the good I think


---------69:58----------
there's also a lot of like other really


---------69:59----------
important stuff in there I loved your


---------70:01----------
analogy about like fine like drops of


---------70:03----------
happiness that drip away versus drops of


---------70:05----------
happiness that stay in your bucket and


---------70:07----------
somewhere along the way that you kind of


---------70:10----------
started gravitating towards things that


---------70:13----------
you find fulfilling is opposed to things


---------70:16----------
that bring you like temporary or


---------70:18----------
materialistic happiness you you have a


---------70:21----------
very interesting I mean your language is


---------70:23----------
just really interesting because you also


---------70:24----------
use words like allow you allowed


---------70:27----------
yourself to start to do things that like


---------70:29----------
you cared about as opposed to doing the


---------70:32----------
things that you were supposed to do and


---------70:34----------
and that also is kind of weird because


---------70:36----------
even the things that you allow yourself


---------70:37----------
to do or things that are like giving


---------70:41----------
things which we'll get to in a second


---------70:43----------
but and I really do think that it's been


---------70:47----------
fascinating for me to hear and I hope


---------70:49----------
people can kind of take away with


---------70:50----------
something I think there's an another


---------70:52----------
baby conversation that needs to be had


---------70:54----------
or exploration into like how were you


---------70:56----------
able to do that right because at some


---------70:59----------
point you were chasing materialistic


---------71:01----------
things or you were chasing temporary


---------71:03----------
happiness and then you said that I


---------71:05----------
allowed myself to start to invest in


---------71:07----------
things that like I should do you know


---------71:10----------
for the betterment of the world and


---------71:12----------
things like that and so how did you do


---------71:14----------
that how did you be to prep how are you


---------71:16----------
depressed for 13 years and like what


---------71:18----------
turned it around for you now I don't


---------71:20----------
know if that's a short conversation or a


---------71:21----------
long conversation if that's something


---------71:24----------
you can like touch on for a few minutes


---------71:26----------
I think that would be fantastic but then


---------71:28----------
I do have a couple of other things that


---------71:30----------
I'd like to share with you sure if you


---------71:33----------
want to know how I got out of my


---------71:35----------
depression I think it was a lot of


---------71:39----------
things a lot of steps but


---------71:41----------
if I'd open it as quickly as I could it


---------71:44----------
would be in the beginnings of my life I


---------71:46----------
didn't know I deserved respect I excused


---------71:49----------
the behavior of the people around me by


---------71:52----------
explaining it away and that was


---------71:53----------
important to me because I took it list


---------71:55----------
personally when I understood it it's not


---------71:57----------
because of me it's because of their


---------71:59----------
upbringing it's because of their issues


---------72:00----------
it's because of their this and


---------72:01----------
understanding psychology and researching


---------72:04----------
the way that people respond to trauma


---------72:05----------
helped me to feel less flawed and


---------72:08----------
deserving of the aggression and


---------72:11----------
mistreatment but I endured when I was


---------72:13----------
younger and that helped me until it


---------72:15----------
started become an excuse to allow abuse


---------72:17----------
what I didn't then process until much


---------72:20----------
later was that it's okay to expect


---------72:22----------
respect I didn't even know what that


---------72:24----------
looked like I didn't know what it felt


---------72:26----------
like to be cared about and prioritized


---------72:30----------
and loved and so I ended up in a


---------72:32----------
situation of really extreme domestic


---------72:35----------
violence and I was drinking to cope with


---------72:37----------
it every day


---------72:38----------
weirdly I thought I maybe what hap was


---------72:40----------
an alcoholic or something but then as


---------72:42----------
soon as I moved out I didn't drink like


---------72:45----------
I didn't I didn't even notice that I


---------72:47----------
didn't pick up anything and from there I


---------72:53----------
still had a lot of ways to go but I was


---------72:55----------
starting to build a better and more


---------72:56----------
beautiful an environment where I could


---------72:58----------
thrive and discover who I was and then I


---------73:00----------
had a lot of time throughout that whole


---------73:02----------
situation to sit and listen to myself so


---------73:05----------
as soon as I had like a tiny little inch


---------73:07----------
of movement to be free to do what I want


---------73:09----------
instead of what other people wanted me


---------73:11----------
to do for them because I'm basically


---------73:12----------
grown up being a servant in a lot of


---------73:15----------
ways I didn't know what it was to has


---------73:19----------
that changed


---------73:24----------
I don't know yet I am happier but yeah


---------73:29----------
like I started to notice all of these


---------73:31----------
things so I started building a better


---------73:32----------
environment I was offered


---------73:33----------
antidepressants especially after a


---------73:35----------
suicide attempt


---------73:36----------
I didn't survive because I failed I


---------73:39----------
survived because someone busted the door


---------73:42----------
down and intervened and so I didn't


---------73:46----------
exactly feel grateful to live it wasn't


---------73:48----------
a second thought thing it wasn't a


---------73:50----------
choice it was a I didn't I didn't


---------73:53----------
succeed kind of situation and I in that


---------73:56----------
in that situation I needed to get out I


---------73:58----------
needed to fix my environment and when


---------74:00----------
they offered me an expression I was like


---------74:01----------
I don't feel like this is a problem with


---------74:03----------
my neuro chemistry I feel like this is a


---------74:05----------
problem with my surroundings and I'd


---------74:07----------
like to change those first so I went


---------74:09----------
running to help with the neurochemical


---------74:11----------
side of things and I started fixing my


---------74:13----------
life and getting to safety and when I


---------74:15----------
did I started to expand into that little


---------74:18----------
bit of extra freedom and yeah from there


---------74:22----------
I guess the next part was just thinking


---------74:25----------
about the philosophical part of it and


---------74:26----------
why I should want to live I needed to


---------74:29----------
have a reason so I started thinking


---------74:31----------
about what mattered to me and what was


---------74:32----------
beautiful about life and that's where


---------74:34----------
the kind kind of like universe kind of


---------74:36----------
theory stuff came from and that helped


---------74:39----------
me to have like a little bit of a


---------74:40----------
foundation and a backbone and then the


---------74:43----------
next part was what will I be glad I did


---------74:45----------
here from now like if I look back a year


---------74:47----------
from now in the future future me what


---------74:50----------
will I be glad I did what will I regret


---------74:51----------
wasting time on and I started


---------74:53----------
prioritizing according to the stuff that


---------74:55----------
would consistently make me satisfied


---------74:57----------
long term and when I started imagining a


---------75:00----------
life in the future where I was happy it


---------75:03----------
had animals had stability safety and all


---------75:06----------
these sorts of things so just by being


---------75:09----------
like picturing myself happy


---------75:10----------
I knew the direction I had to go in and


---------75:12----------
I built all these things I'm safe now


---------75:14----------
and I'm happy and I have animals and I


---------75:17----------
have computer games breakfast and I have


---------75:20----------
I have all of the things that allow me


---------75:24----------
to thrive and have choices and another


---------75:27----------
thing I think the final thing is to stop


---------75:29----------
trying to manipulate the world to be


---------75:31----------
what I want it to be I don't have


---------75:32----------
awesome plans anymore I go with the flow


---------75:35----------
I take what the universe hands me


---------75:38----------
I take what Kaos throws up my feet and I


---------75:40----------
build the best of it there are people


---------75:42----------
who get handed [ __ ] in life and they cry


---------75:45----------
because they've got [ __ ] on their hands


---------75:46----------
and there are people who make it into


---------75:48----------
bricks and build [ __ ] houses and I


---------75:50----------
want to be the second kind I want to be


---------75:52----------
the kind of person who could be handed


---------75:53----------
anything and see it as an opportunity


---------75:55----------
since then I've been incredibly happy


---------75:57----------
and surprised by all the ve that's come


---------75:59----------
my way okay beautiful anything so can I


---------76:06----------
highlight a couple things that I heard


---------76:08----------
there No get out yeah go for it so the


---------76:13----------
first is that like I think it starts


---------76:14----------
with listening to yourself right so I


---------76:17----------
think that this is something that people


---------76:19----------
need to understand is that we're taught


---------76:21----------
and this kind of goes back to the idea


---------76:23----------
that people with privilege can't suffer


---------76:25----------
in that people who are in in black


---------76:28----------
privilege can't be happy and and I think


---------76:32----------
that the the interesting thing is that


---------76:33----------
like a lot of times when I work with


---------76:35----------
people they assume that a particular


---------76:38----------
thing is going to bring them happiness


---------76:39----------
and the interesting thing is that since


---------76:42----------
they don't have it like like a good


---------76:44----------
example is like let's say there's a guy


---------76:46----------
who's never had so I used to be this way


---------76:48----------
where like I had never really had a


---------76:49----------
serious and loving relationship and I


---------76:52----------
thought what I needed to be happy was a


---------76:54----------
serious and loving relationship and the


---------76:56----------
interesting thing though is that that's


---------76:58----------
not something that comes from me that's


---------77:00----------
something that comes from watching other


---------77:03----------
people so it's not actually listening to


---------77:05----------
myself it's making assumptions about


---------77:08----------
what the road to happiness looks like


---------77:10----------
based on what I see outside of myself


---------77:12----------
because if you think that a million


---------77:14----------
being a millionaire is gonna make you


---------77:15----------
happy and you aren't a millionaire then


---------77:18----------
like you're not basing that on yourself


---------77:19----------
you're basing it on the outside world


---------77:21----------
yeah and I and we'll go get two I mean I


---------77:25----------
do think a loving relationship goes a


---------77:26----------
long way and we'll get to that in a


---------77:27----------
second but the first thing is that you


---------77:29----------
know I was listening to your story and


---------77:31----------
it sort of started with listening to


---------77:33----------
yourself


---------77:34----------
it started with getting a little bit of


---------77:35----------
space and listening to that voice inside


---------77:37----------
you and following that direction even in


---------77:40----------
the smallest way and then you got a


---------77:41----------
little bit more space you listened to it


---------77:42----------
more and so on and so forth I think you


---------77:46----------
also mentioned something like so about


---------77:48----------
the power of environment and the people


---------77:51----------
around you


---------77:51----------
I think so many people do not understand


---------77:55----------
how much of the way they feel has so


---------77:58----------
much to do with things that are given


---------78:01----------
around them like if you live in a toxic


---------78:04----------
home with abusive parents and you think


---------78:07----------
that there's no way that you're gonna be


---------78:09----------
better and the we get this a lot that


---------78:11----------
dr. K is the only one that can save you


---------78:13----------
you would be surprised how little dr. K


---------78:15----------
matters compared to like getting the


---------78:17----------
[ __ ] out of like your current living


---------78:19----------
situation with abusive people it can be


---------78:21----------
like night and day there are so many


---------78:23----------
things about the environment the soil


---------78:26----------
that you you put yourself in and like


---------78:29----------
the air that you put yourself in in the


---------78:32----------
sunlight that you put yourself in and


---------78:33----------
the water that you put yourself in that


---------78:35----------
will allow you to grow into a different


---------78:37----------
person


---------78:38----------
yeah and so I think that that you were


---------78:42----------
able to really make a couple of serious


---------78:44----------
steps forward that were sort of like


---------78:46----------
meant like in a sense mental health


---------78:48----------
related it sounds like you were in a


---------78:50----------
dangerous and traumatic relationship


---------78:51----------
which you've got the [ __ ] out of it also


---------78:54----------
sounds like you saw a trauma therapist


---------78:56----------
who helped you kind of work through


---------78:57----------
these things which is awesome and then


---------79:00----------
somewhere along the way you started to


---------79:02----------
like channel this like universe but


---------79:04----------
Eastern Western whatever like this sort


---------79:07----------
of truth about take what is given to you


---------79:09----------
start to appreciate life and all this


---------79:11----------
[ __ ] that everyone wants to learn how to


---------79:12----------
do but no one knows how do you learn how


---------79:15----------
to do that and I think the really


---------79:17----------
grateful thing I'm grateful to you Anita


---------79:19----------
because you've given us like the story


---------79:21----------
of like how that happens and I think


---------79:23----------
there were a couple of key things about


---------79:25----------
basically listening to yourself changing


---------79:27----------
a couple circumstances really like


---------79:30----------
thinking about the way that you see the


---------79:32----------
world there's a lot of self-reflection


---------79:33----------
and growth as opposed to a playbook that


---------79:37----------
you follow and I think unfortunately


---------79:39----------
that's what I've found is that like


---------79:41----------
everyone has to walk this journey on


---------79:43----------
their own there's no no one can give


---------79:45----------
these answers to you you have to figure


---------79:46----------
them out yourself but we can sort of get


---------79:49----------
a guide book as to how to figure them


---------79:51----------
out yourself which starts with things


---------79:53----------
like listening to yourself okay thoughts


---------79:57----------
questions can I move on to part two can


---------80:01----------
I just take it no I I feel like I need


---------80:04----------
to say this out loud because I


---------80:05----------
remember things better when I see them


---------80:07----------
but so this conversation is kind of


---------80:09----------
making me feel like I'm being a bit


---------80:10----------
greedy I feel like we've touched on them


---------80:13----------
that I'm a bit too busy I think in


---------80:16----------
aspect but I haven't really acknowledged


---------80:17----------
about it is that I don't have enough


---------80:19----------
time to be all the things I want to be


---------80:20----------
and I just I'm not allowing myself to


---------80:23----------
settle for a few and do them well I'm


---------80:24----------
trying to do everything oh yeah yeah


---------80:28----------
that's part two so we're gonna we're


---------80:31----------
gonna talk about that right now so Anita


---------80:34----------
I think you're an amazing person and I


---------80:36----------
still think there are some things about


---------80:39----------
you that my hope is that you can get to


---------80:41----------
a place of even more peace like I think


---------80:44----------
you've attained a lot of happiness


---------80:46----------
despite your circumstances and even some


---------80:48----------
of your internal conflicts and my hope


---------80:51----------
is that some of those internal conflicts


---------80:53----------
can even become a little bit easier on


---------80:55----------
you and let me share with you what I


---------80:57----------
mean so like the first thing is like you


---------80:59----------
just said it right despite all of this


---------81:01----------
you feel greedy sometimes you feel


---------81:04----------
guilty sometimes you put yourself in


---------81:05----------
danger sometimes you you feel burnt out


---------81:07----------
um and I think there are like reasons


---------81:10----------
for that like I think there are things


---------81:11----------
that you can still look at in your life


---------81:14----------
in ways that you can reflect and grow


---------81:16----------
and and maybe therapy is a part of this


---------81:19----------
maybe not where you don't have to be as


---------81:23----------
burdened as you are but I think that's


---------81:26----------
gonna be tough and I'm gonna just start


---------81:30----------
talking so I think you've got to be


---------81:32----------
careful about I want to be the kind of


---------81:35----------
person that dot dot dot so underneath a


---------81:40----------
lot of this I think that there's a lot


---------81:42----------
of genuine growth and appreciation but


---------81:46----------
there's also like I'm getting some


---------81:48----------
undertones and this may be wrong okay


---------81:51----------
about like you really force yourself


---------81:54----------
into a particular kind of view of like


---------81:57----------
what's acceptable for you like I want to


---------82:00----------
be the kind of person because if I ask


---------82:02----------
myself like who the [ __ ] is so forgiving


---------82:05----------
like and and I wonder if if somewhere in


---------82:08----------
there is that like you want to be the


---------82:10----------
kind of person who can be forgiving and


---------82:14----------
so you become the kind of person who's


---------82:16----------
forgiving even though maybe you


---------82:18----------
shouldn't be so


---------82:19----------
forgiving but it's almost like you hold


---------82:21----------
a standard for yourself that's so high


---------82:24----------
that you don't allow yourself to like


---------82:27----------
hold negative qualities what do you


---------82:33----------
think about that


---------82:36----------
can I just think for a second


---------82:47----------
it feels like with the forgiving thing


---------82:50----------
in particular it's not so much a


---------82:53----------
standard that I'm trying to


---------82:54----------
cookie-cutter fit into you I'm not


---------82:56----------
contorting myself out of my own rage I


---------82:58----------
think it comes from a position of


---------83:00----------
empathy I kind of feel like I was late


---------83:04----------
to the social scene I was socially


---------83:06----------
awkward and dumb luckily I didn't have


---------83:09----------
social media at the time so no one can


---------83:12----------
hold some like ancient tweets against me


---------83:14----------
or whatever but I was not I was clueless


---------83:16----------
and I needed to be forgiven to have the


---------83:20----------
chance to grow and learn to be fun to


---------83:23----------
hang around I needed the chance to be


---------83:25----------
able to see what a good friend is and


---------83:28----------
receive friendship and connection before


---------83:30----------
I could be a good friend and and connect


---------83:33----------
and so I really relate to people who are


---------83:36----------
messing up I really relate to people


---------83:38----------
here come to me and they bungle our


---------83:42----------
interactions in some way or are only


---------83:44----------
appropriate or cross boundaries or don't


---------83:46----------
know that something isn't right because


---------83:48----------
to me it doesn't feel like an offense or


---------83:50----------
an attack initially I don't feel scared


---------83:52----------
or I don't feel you know the feelings


---------83:55----------
but I should feel what I feel is that


---------83:56----------
this person needs help I don't feel it


---------83:58----------
I'll know I'm in danger I should call


---------84:00----------
the police


---------84:00----------
okay so so let's sorry can I interrupt


---------84:03----------
for a second why don't you feel the


---------84:05----------
feelings that you should feel


---------84:08----------
I I don't know I don't know why I'm


---------84:12----------
you've made me very a rather i I think


---------84:15----------
what causes these extreme situations is


---------84:18----------
that I keep giving people chances after


---------84:20----------
they show that maybe I should let them


---------84:21----------
go I think I think it's like I keep


---------84:24----------
giving people the benefit of the doubt


---------84:25----------
when I went deep down I know what's


---------84:27----------
happening like I keep yes I think though


---------84:32----------
the hard thing here Anita is that in a


---------84:36----------
bizarre way I think maybe your goodness


---------84:39----------
needs to change so now I'm gonna I'm


---------84:42----------
gonna build on this hypothesis a little


---------84:44----------
bit ok


---------84:44----------
and I'm not telling you that you


---------84:46----------
shouldn't be a good person but I think


---------84:47----------
that you are a good person at the


---------84:50----------
detriment to yourself and and that's


---------84:53----------
something that as someone who also feels


---------84:56----------
empathy and caring and as someone who


---------84:58----------
cares about a lot of people when I see


---------85:01----------
you I see you cannibalizing yourself for


---------85:04----------
the sake of other people and that hurts


---------85:06----------
me to see but I don't know that that


---------85:09----------
causes dissonance in me I I don't I


---------85:14----------
don't think it does cause dissonance


---------85:16----------
within you and that's actually what


---------85:19----------
bothers


---------85:21----------
I know it's weird hear me out okay so so


---------85:27----------
the first thing is that like I just


---------85:29----------
could be wrong here okay I just couldn't


---------85:31----------
be wrong


---------85:31----------
I just don't this is something that any


---------85:34----------
that there's one thing you've


---------85:35----------
demonstrated to me and that's an amazing


---------85:37----------
capacity for self-reflection exploration


---------85:40----------
and growth and so I am going to trust


---------85:43----------
you to know all I'm gonna give you is


---------85:46----------
something to think about and if you


---------85:48----------
explore it and then you are conclude


---------85:50----------
that what I'm saying is like not really


---------85:51----------
applicable fine I think there's a decent


---------85:54----------
chance of that but let me just tell you


---------85:58----------
like a couple of other patterns okay


---------85:59----------
so the first is is is that there is this


---------86:02----------
pattern of like stuckness of sort of


---------86:05----------
like okay like I'm a good person I help


---------86:08----------
lots of people you take care of your mom


---------86:09----------
you take care of bunnies you take care


---------86:11----------
of those people who used to be loved and


---------86:13----------
they're loved to no longer noble spirit


---------86:16----------
beautiful amazing right and then on the


---------86:20----------
flip side of that there's also some


---------86:21----------
amount of guilt or feeling like you're


---------86:24----------
letting people down if you sit still


---------86:25----------
there's a sense of burnout you're kind


---------86:28----------
of like a fixer you're like the person


---------86:30----------
who never gives up on other people what


---------86:32----------
are you feeling right now feeling okay


---------86:33----------
yeah what do you feel him just squeeze


---------86:39----------
just good yep I had a feeling this was


---------86:43----------
going to happen so I tried to apologize


---------86:44----------
that ahead of time so stick with me if


---------86:46----------
you can if it becomes uncomfortable let


---------86:48----------
me know okay and I'm absolutely gonna


---------86:52----------
squeeze you so I'm gonna keep squeezing


---------86:53----------
and you got to let me know if I'm being


---------86:55----------
a dick okay okay one second Bunny's


---------86:57----------
getting too hot oh my god I'm just gonna


---------86:59----------
put him away great sometimes we got to


---------87:06----------
hit the pause bot


---------87:22----------
I need are you okay if I keeps you okay


---------87:27----------
if I you okay if I keep squeezing or


---------87:29----------
should we stop it's fine it's okay


---------87:32----------
you'll let me know if it's not okay yes


---------87:35----------
okay so you know it's interesting


---------87:39----------
because I I mean I see that like you


---------87:41----------
know you're clearly a good person and


---------87:43----------
yet you have some of these negative


---------87:45----------
feelings which it sounds like you kind


---------87:47----------
of manage by chunking them up and


---------87:49----------
dealing with them a piece at a time


---------87:51----------
which sounds like a really good strategy


---------87:54----------
there are a couple of other things that


---------87:56----------
so if we look at a lot of the different


---------87:58----------
things that you do there's like sort of


---------88:00----------
a good side and a bad side right like


---------88:01----------
taking care of your mom has a good side


---------88:03----------
and it has a bad side


---------88:04----------
generally speaking the good side is for


---------88:06----------
other people the bad side is for you


---------88:07----------
that tends to be how your relationships


---------88:10----------
work right so if we look at like the


---------88:12----------
stalkers like they benefit from your


---------88:15----------
your saintly forgiveness and that comes


---------88:19----------
at the cost of you sometimes being like


---------88:21----------
in situations that are dangerous and you


---------88:24----------
you are just you're such a good person


---------88:26----------
and sometimes it honestly it scares me


---------88:28----------
how good of a person you are because


---------88:31----------
anyway so so I I don't know where that


---------88:34----------
relentless positivity comes from I think


---------88:36----------
a lot of it is is very very genuine and


---------88:39----------
comes from because I I hear absolutely


---------88:41----------
like the result of genuine reflection


---------88:46----------
and appreciation for what life has given


---------88:48----------
you and it's it's beautiful to watch and


---------88:51----------
I also wonder like I don't know if this


---------88:52----------
is just me being cynical but I also


---------88:54----------
wonder if there's some amount of


---------88:56----------
yourself that won't let you be less than


---------88:59----------
what you are because it sounds like when


---------89:02----------
you stay still for a minute


---------89:03----------
feelings negative emotions start to come


---------89:05----------
up and then like you don't want to let


---------89:08----------
yourself feel that way and then we get


---------89:11----------
to a couple of other like just


---------89:12----------
interesting things okay so there are ups


---------89:14----------
and downs to most things in your life


---------89:17----------
it kind of goes back to this idea of


---------89:19----------
being stuck where like you know you


---------89:21----------
can't eat or like you can't you need to


---------89:24----------
have flatmates because like sometimes


---------89:27----------
physically like it sounds like for a


---------89:28----------
safety issue like you need to have


---------89:30----------
people around in case you choke and at


---------89:32----------
the same time you're kind of damned if


---------89:33----------
you do and damned if you don't because


---------89:35----------
whatever you do have


---------89:36----------
flatmates they start you know burbling


---------89:39----------
your underwear and and the pheromones


---------89:41----------
and things like that so it's kind of


---------89:43----------
like damned if you do and damned if you


---------89:44----------
don't so the two other things that I'd


---------89:47----------
really think about is like that's a


---------89:48----------
pattern that I see in so many parts of


---------89:50----------
your life there's one part that I don't


---------89:53----------
see this pattern which is in the


---------89:55----------
Bergling of the underwear and the


---------89:57----------
obsessional worshipfulness of anita and


---------90:00----------
so the the the the cynical part of me


---------90:03----------
wonders like what what's the positive of


---------90:05----------
that side of the relationship right cuz


---------90:07----------
everything else in your life has like a


---------90:09----------
good part in a bad part and the people


---------90:12----------
obsessing over you seems to be all bad


---------90:16----------
but generally speaking I don't think


---------90:19----------
that patterns like like you said like


---------90:21----------
the patterns that you have have pros and


---------90:23----------
cons right they're the adaptations that


---------90:25----------
you've formed and it is very possible


---------90:28----------
that there is something like purely


---------90:30----------
physiologic about you your pheromones


---------90:33----------
that does this but there's a part of me


---------90:37----------
that says that we would be like it would


---------90:39----------
be remiss if we did not consider what


---------90:42----------
are you getting out of this like where's


---------90:44----------
the positive here or is this just the


---------90:46----------
one dimension of your life where there's


---------90:47----------
just negative because I generally


---------90:51----------
speaking I think patterns persist


---------90:53----------
because they do something for us and


---------90:54----------
even the most bizarre negative patterns


---------90:57----------
still do something for us and a good


---------91:00----------
example of this is like abusive


---------91:02----------
relationships because like people ask


---------91:05----------
that you know why do people stay in


---------91:07----------
abusive relationships and I'm sure you


---------91:08----------
have some thoughts about that but


---------91:10----------
sometimes it's like like when I remember


---------91:12----------
talking to a couple of people who had


---------91:13----------
trauma and what they shared was that


---------91:15----------
like


---------91:16----------
the idea that they would rather be with


---------91:20----------
someone who they know is abusive then


---------91:23----------
sort of take the chance with someone who


---------91:25----------
isn't abusive and then one day may


---------91:27----------
become abusive yeah yeah I mean I think


---------91:34----------
it's different for different people but


---------91:35----------
I mean it's really bizarre things and


---------91:38----------
earlier on Street we were talking to


---------91:39----------
someone who was embroiled with some of


---------91:41----------
this sexual harassment stuff and it was


---------91:44----------
bizarre to discover that part of the


---------91:46----------
reason that she did not speak was not


---------91:49----------
out of fear or power dynamics but was


---------91:52----------
actually out of love which is like


---------91:54----------
strange like that's not why we think


---------91:55----------
women remain silent when it comes to


---------91:57----------
sexual harassment and assault and and my


---------92:01----------
point is that like it's just it's it's


---------92:02----------
too persistent of a pattern I think


---------92:05----------
there's some order to it and could it be


---------92:08----------
physiologic absolutely could it be that


---------92:10----------
like you evoke something so here's


---------92:12----------
another hypothesis for example that you


---------92:15----------
evoke something very very like


---------92:17----------
primordial and almost like carnal in


---------92:22----------
people that there's something about the


---------92:24----------
person that you are and kind of the


---------92:26----------
light that you give off and the


---------92:28----------
gratitude that you bring in the


---------92:30----------
forgiveness that you bring that just


---------92:32----------
like some people's like brain just can't


---------92:35----------
handle it and they start to get confused


---------92:38----------
about the relationship with you I think


---------92:39----------
there could be a bunch of hypotheses but


---------92:42----------
the the real the real question that I


---------92:44----------
think could offer growth if it happens


---------92:46----------
to be true is like what are you getting


---------92:48----------
out of it and and in a bizarre way and


---------92:52----------
maybe I'm projecting here because I have


---------92:56----------
felt this way before that like


---------93:00----------
the more the harder the worse people


---------93:03----------
treat me the greater I become if I


---------93:07----------
forgive them in bizarrely that ended up


---------93:10----------
being about my ego not about me being a


---------93:14----------
good person but about convincing myself


---------93:16----------
that I'm a good person


---------93:19----------
and this you are making me step back and


---------93:25----------
observe how how I feel when I interact


---------93:27----------
with these people that kept pushing my


---------93:28----------
boundaries as I allowed them to do so


---------93:31----------
and kept forgiving them and I don't


---------93:34----------
think I felt like a better person I felt


---------93:36----------
an encroaching sense of unease and skip


---------93:39----------
like fear like not fear of being harmed


---------93:41----------
but fear of losing them like I felt like


---------93:44----------
every every step was like ah don't do


---------93:46----------
that okay cuz I'm gonna have to not


---------93:48----------
friends with you one day so I'm gonna


---------93:50----------
forgive you and I understand why this


---------93:52----------
happened but you have to stop now and


---------93:55----------
I'd be so gentle because every step of


---------93:57----------
the way as they step closer and closer


---------93:59----------
and I keep stepping back and back I I


---------94:01----------
feel scared of losing them I feel like I


---------94:05----------
really enjoy playing tap you go into


---------94:08----------
this person I really enjoy having


---------94:09----------
friends and building connections I'm so


---------94:11----------
proud of myself being able to actually


---------94:13----------
connect with people because it was so


---------94:15----------
hard for me before and I really want


---------94:17----------
this to continue and I don't want this


---------94:19----------
to be what it's the coming and I don't


---------94:21----------
want to acknowledge that it's becoming


---------94:22----------
the same pattern I don't want I don't


---------94:25----------
want this to go this way


---------94:26----------
I'm gonna keep giving you chances to


---------94:28----------
take it in another direction please and


---------94:30----------
I don't feel good about it I feel weak I


---------94:32----------
feel degraded because I am surrendering


---------94:36----------
my self-respect I I know deep down that


---------94:40----------
I should be able to just say I don't


---------94:42----------
like this you know don't do this to me


---------94:45----------
but I feel like I would rather feel


---------94:48----------
humiliated I fight I'd rather feel like


---------94:50----------
a soft touch and feel like oh I'm being


---------94:53----------
really weak here then keep losing people


---------94:56----------
and keep feeling like I can't connect I


---------94:59----------
keep feeling so alone I just fear I


---------95:01----------
think I fear I fear the loss more than I


---------95:05----------
fear the situations I end up in I fear I


---------95:09----------
feel losing these people more than I


---------95:11----------
fear the assault yeah so that makes a


---------95:15----------
lot of sense and and then the other


---------95:18----------
interesting thing there


---------95:19----------
Anita is it's not just the fear of


---------95:24----------
losing people it's the fear I mean once


---------95:28----------
again a hypothesis right so I trust to


---------95:30----------
you so I encourage you to think about


---------95:33----------
this it's it may not just be the fear of


---------95:37----------
losing people it may be the fear of


---------95:39----------
becoming the person who loses people


---------95:47----------
does that make sense I think I need you


---------95:51----------
to expand on that so you used to be


---------95:55----------
someone who couldn't form relationships


---------95:57----------
with people right and now you've become


---------96:02----------
someone who forms relationships with


---------96:05----------
people and so sometimes it's not about


---------96:08----------
the loss of an individual relationship


---------96:11----------
it's about rewinding and going back to


---------96:15----------
square one and being banked to the


---------96:18----------
person you used to be who can't form


---------96:20----------
relationships with people I wonder if


---------96:23----------
that's really what you're afraid of it's


---------96:24----------
not the loss of a particular


---------96:25----------
relationship it's about like the like is


---------96:28----------
like I just I'm getting this vibe from


---------96:30----------
you that this is about you is a person


---------96:33----------
it's not about them it's about you and


---------96:38----------
and anyway so you guys just you just got


---------96:40----------
to think I mean think through it and I


---------96:42----------
think you'll know and I trust whatever


---------96:44----------
your answer is so is it about the loss


---------96:46----------
of that particular relationship and like


---------96:48----------
maybe there's something with abandonment


---------96:49----------
there or is about is it about becoming


---------96:51----------
going back to the person that you used


---------96:53----------
to be because that would make a lot of


---------96:55----------
sense to me that you are [ __ ]


---------96:57----------
terrified of losing what you gained


---------97:00----------
losing your gratitude like if there was


---------97:02----------
one motivator that would Trump all other


---------97:05----------
motivators if I had to hypothesize for


---------97:07----------
you it's about losing what you've gained


---------97:09----------
because holy [ __ ] Anita


---------97:12----------
you've gained so much through sweat


---------97:14----------
blood and tears


---------97:18----------
and if anything could possibly take that


---------97:20----------
away I this is my empathy speaking I


---------97:23----------
would be absolutely terrified absolutely


---------97:27----------
terrified because you have gained so


---------97:31----------
much you have triumphed and climbed


---------97:33----------
mountains and loved an appreciation for


---------97:35----------
life where people are stealing your


---------97:37----------
underwear you wake up every day with


---------97:39----------
aspirational pneumonia you can't eat


---------97:41----------
because you vomit you punch yourself in


---------97:43----------
the face and you have emotional moments


---------97:45----------
of rage and somehow you have triumphed


---------97:48----------
over this [ __ ] and there's a chance that


---------97:52----------
something can take this away ah no


---------97:55----------
[ __ ] way


---------97:56----------
you will deal with as much abuse as they


---------97:58----------
have to give but you're not going to


---------98:00----------
slide back on on the road that you've


---------98:02----------
traveled so far


---------98:05----------
that would make sense to me does it make


---------98:08----------
it true


---------98:08----------
it does make a lot of sense to me - yeah


---------98:12----------
I think it's not just about losing them


---------98:15----------
and I do mourn them I miss those friends


---------98:17----------
that I've yes trations but I yeah I am


---------98:21----------
terrified of the being an isolated


---------98:24----------
person again sees people outside the


---------98:27----------
window having fun enjoying summer and


---------98:29----------
just seeing every moment slip away and


---------98:31----------
not being able to connect and feeling


---------98:33----------
really alone and feeling like I'm losing


---------98:35----------
like my life is drifting away while I


---------98:37----------
sit here too afraid to connect and live


---------98:40----------
and do things and yeah a lot of things


---------98:42----------
that I do are about our fear of of


---------98:45----------
sliding back into that trap again of


---------98:47----------
being in those same four walls for years


---------98:49----------
because I was like a phobic - so yeah it


---------98:54----------
stands to reason that not not not being


---------98:57----------
accepting and not being forgiving and


---------98:59----------
not trying to rectify the issues in my


---------99:02----------
friendships even when it's beyond repair


---------99:05----------
yeah it was feel like I'm sliding back


---------99:09----------
to that place like it's weird right


---------99:11----------
because it's like you're not yeah cuz I


---------99:14----------
mean you know they're beyond repair so


---------99:16----------
there has to be something really


---------99:17----------
powerful and oddly enough I think


---------99:19----------
positive and keep it close like if you


---------99:21----------
think about it who puts up with that


---------99:23----------
much weird [ __ ] there's got to be


---------99:25----------
something to balance those scales right


---------99:27----------
otherwise you wouldn't be in the


---------99:28----------
relationship to begin with and the last


---------99:32----------
thing is and this is this is where I I


---------99:34----------
hope for you because I think that on


---------99:36----------
some level you've processed a lot of


---------99:39----------
emotions but like I think this part of


---------99:41----------
you somewhere along the way you still


---------99:43----------
haven't been able to feel secure enough


---------99:45----------
that you're not gonna go back there


---------99:47----------
because Anita you're not gonna go back


---------99:48----------
to it I don't think you're gonna go back


---------99:50----------
there I think you're just a different


---------99:52----------
person I don't think that any amount of


---------99:54----------
anything can take you back there and I


---------99:57----------
would love it if you could somehow come


---------100:00----------
to understand that and feel secure in


---------100:02----------
that and be free of that fear


---------100:05----------
because like there's still a lot of


---------100:07----------
stuff that you're like I think holding


---------100:09----------
on to and and suppressing and it sounds


---------100:11----------
like you've got a pretty good strategy


---------100:12----------
for kind of chunking up and managing it


---------100:14----------
over time and and at the same time I


---------100:18----------
still see you carrying a burden that I


---------100:21----------
wish you didn't have to and I want to


---------100:24----------
believe that one day you'll get to put


---------100:28----------
that burden down yeah the last thing is


---------100:35----------
that if you do have suppressed emotion


---------100:37----------
it's gonna make your autoimmune stuff


---------100:40----------
worse so this is a generally like known


---------100:42----------
thing that like you know psychological


---------100:46----------
distress makes autoimmune disorders


---------100:48----------
worse and that's not it's not


---------100:50----------
psychological there is something called


---------100:52----------
psychoneuroimmunology which is like a


---------100:54----------
fascinating field which looks at the


---------100:55----------
relationship between your mind your


---------100:58----------
brain and your immune system and


---------101:00----------
generally looks at the dysregulation of


---------101:03----------
your immune system based on


---------101:05----------
psychological insults and and so the


---------101:09----------
last thing that I would hope is it that


---------101:11----------
if you can continue moving on the path


---------101:13----------
that you're moving I would hope because


---------101:15----------
it's a lie I mean I don't know what your


---------101:16----------
autoimmune disorder is but it sounds


---------101:18----------
like it's [ __ ] awful and it also


---------101:20----------
sounds like you know generally speaking


---------101:22----------
with autoimmune disorders we don't


---------101:23----------
really have great treatments where you


---------101:24----------
take a pill in that [ __ ] goes away and


---------101:26----------
yet I've seen a lot of hope with people


---------101:29----------
with autoimmune disorders because they


---------101:31----------
wind up in my office and then we help


---------101:33----------
them psychologically and and then their


---------101:36----------
autoimmune stuff sort of gets better and


---------101:38----------
and so I really hope that your


---------101:40----------
autoimmune stop can get better too and I


---------101:43----------
hope I just because Anita you're such an


---------101:45----------
amazing and remarkable person I think it


---------101:47----------
like it makes me sad and I think this is


---------101:50----------
maybe a little bit pity and I apologize


---------101:52----------
for feeling that way it's just how I


---------101:54----------
feel like like I I think I'm not trying


---------101:58----------
to pity you it's just it's just how I


---------102:00----------
feel like I feel sad for you and I feel


---------102:03----------
like you don't deserve to feel like for


---------102:07----------
everything that you've gained I think


---------102:08----------
it's incredibly unfair that at the edges


---------102:12----------
you still have chunks of guilt and


---------102:14----------
chunks of fear and chunks of like maybe


---------102:17----------
other [ __ ] I don't know because you


---------102:19----------
like you make the world such a better


---------102:21----------
place by your existence and I feel like


---------102:24----------
you know the people who are deserving of


---------102:26----------
those chunks of negative emotion or the


---------102:28----------
[ __ ] that are the panty peeves they


---------102:32----------
describe feel that way not you which is


---------102:35----------
it fair and isn't true but that's just


---------102:37----------
the way that I feel


---------102:40----------
thank you I really I really appreciate


---------102:43----------
that and I appreciate that you know it's


---------102:46----------
so nice to speak to someone especially


---------102:48----------
about the whole panty stealers thing


---------102:50----------
without judgement it's such a hard arena


---------102:52----------
to come forward about this stuff because


---------102:53----------
it only ever evokes hate people assume


---------102:58----------
that it's my fate or that I'm doing


---------102:59----------
something wrong and I'm it's so good to


---------103:02----------
hear to talk to someone who once you


---------103:04----------
help me understand what's going on and


---------103:07----------
fix it rather than just blame me yeah


---------103:10----------
I've been the most inappropriate thing


---------103:12----------
that I feel about the panties seriously


---------103:14----------
can I sure it's gonna be able to maybe a


---------103:15----------
little bit humorous it's just like this


---------103:17----------
this bizarre curiosity like like what's


---------103:23----------
going on there anyway I don't mean to


---------103:25----------
devalue like because because it is I


---------103:29----------
mean it's it's the rebuttable pattern


---------103:31----------
I've never heard of this before


---------103:33----------
Anita and anyway I apologize for not


---------103:38----------
meeting you where you were emotionally


---------103:40----------
there in that moment no no no it's fine


---------103:42----------
like I I joke about it quite often -


---------103:44----------
yeah it's like I've been through so much


---------103:46----------
regarding it recently with multiple


---------103:48----------
people not just the panty stealing but


---------103:50----------
you know the pushing of boundaries and


---------103:51----------
just the weird people yeah people do


---------103:54----------
that I'm just like I would joke I've got


---------103:57----------
so many jokes about it you wouldn't


---------103:58----------
believe but I've been laughing this off


---------104:00----------
for years yeah yeah oh you have no idea


---------104:04----------
- it's just so much I think it doesn't


---------104:10----------
make it but get I think being a stream I


---------104:12----------
kind of contributes quite a bit I mean I


---------104:13----------
get people who DME you're like can I pay


---------104:16----------
you 350 euros to have 50 minutes live


---------104:18----------
stream of your feet and things so like I


---------104:21----------
think it's really hard to differentiate


---------104:23----------
when people first make friends with you


---------104:24----------
they're not like hi I'm secretly


---------104:26----------
planning to get to marry you but you


---------104:28----------
don't know that yeah and I totally not


---------104:30----------
into you okay how we're just friends and


---------104:32----------
like so I I think that there's a higher


---------104:34----------
risk factor of it now just because I'm a


---------104:36----------
streamer and you know it's just


---------104:38----------
something as a side effect of streaming


---------104:40----------
so it's I think it's probably not going


---------104:43----------
to go away even if I figure out my


---------104:46----------
aspects of it yeah really highlighted


---------104:48----------
and helped me out I think it's just a


---------104:50----------
side effect of what's going on with me


---------104:52----------
now as well but


---------104:54----------
at least when I stop streaming they'll


---------104:56----------
be hope but you know I can reduce this


---------104:58----------
and kind of get back to kind of like a


---------105:00----------
very safe respectful level with people


---------105:02----------
again well assuming it isn't pyramids


---------105:07----------
yeah I mean my mom's 50 and she's still


---------105:10----------
getting it like every kara we've gotten


---------105:12----------
has fallen in love with her and like men


---------105:15----------
would fight over her yeah like two guys


---------105:17----------
I remember when I was a kid two guys


---------105:18----------
bent down to kiss a hand at once and


---------105:20----------
they both bind heads against each other


---------105:21----------
it's hilarious but I have so many


---------105:23----------
stories like that my mom has at West K


---------105:25----------
she's very very beautiful she's 50 she


---------105:28----------
looks like my younger sister she


---------105:30----------
everyone just is infatuated with her


---------105:33----------
it's ridiculous so she has a lot less


---------105:36----------
than me in terms of that level of


---------105:38----------
attention so I guess I always scared as


---------105:42----------
well because you know she hasn't ever


---------105:43----------
she's just stayed away from people has


---------105:45----------
been her coping mechanism and I really


---------105:48----------
didn't want that to be mine interesting


---------105:51----------
yeah that that gets me even more curious


---------105:54----------
because like that's like they're mean


---------105:55----------
there could be something genetic I mean


---------105:58----------
yeah I mean she traced our family


---------106:00----------
history and a lot of our the women in


---------106:03----------
our family like from back home from the


---------106:05----------
ancient cult level used to be sold off


---------106:08----------
to marriage to Nobles and things because


---------106:10----------
we were notorious for having a lot of


---------106:11----------
women that attracted a lot of male


---------106:13----------
attention and that you know they were


---------106:15----------
all different body types and they were


---------106:18----------
all different you know age groups and


---------106:19----------
stuff and it's not like we all look the


---------106:22----------
same or act the same we're all very very


---------106:24----------
unique people from each other and yet


---------106:26----------
this still happens to us so I don't know


---------106:31----------
sounds like some Sir Topham something


---------106:36----------
special there some cats fax us it's


---------106:38----------
interesting but you know it cause


---------106:40----------
problems like he said that two of our


---------106:42----------
family members in art history were


---------106:44----------
burned as witches and that the story


---------106:47----------
that runs in our family is that there


---------106:48----------
were just some jealous women in the


---------106:50----------
village whose husbands and partners took


---------106:52----------
an interest in them so they accused them


---------106:54----------
to get them out of the way so it doesn't


---------106:56----------
it's not a good thing it's not fun thing


---------106:58----------
no it certainly doesn't sound fun it


---------107:03----------
sounds you know remarkable but not fun I


---------107:07----------
can't you know thank yes they're all a


---------107:13----------
lot more that's a lot better looking


---------107:14----------
than meet a lot of my family those


---------107:17----------
really gorgeous women in my family um I


---------107:20----------
wish I wish it been more positive thing


---------107:22----------
for them honestly sounds like awesome I


---------107:29----------
don't want to eat with your time and I'm


---------107:31----------
actually quite excited to see what you


---------107:32----------
can do for this kid in his project yeah


---------107:35----------
so thank you very much indeed I I really


---------107:37----------
appreciate your openness and and I hope


---------107:39----------
I didn't say anything that was out of


---------107:40----------
line you know I I think yeah I and I


---------107:45----------
apologize if I did I apologize if I made


---------107:48----------
that off-color jokes or made you feel


---------107:50----------
squeezed


---------107:51----------
I gave consent it's so good yeah I I


---------107:57----------
think sometimes you know there has to be


---------107:59----------
a little bit of discomfort when we look


---------108:01----------
at the parts of ourselves that we just


---------108:03----------
haven't looked at before and and I hope


---------108:05----------
that that was okay and I hope it's


---------108:07----------
helpful to you and I'd really rethink


---------108:10----------
about maybe exploring this with someone


---------108:11----------
who is a professional just to see if


---------108:13----------
it's valuable because Anita you're so


---------108:15----------
self reflective on your own it's like I


---------108:17----------
mean a professional is just gonna be


---------108:20----------
accelerant to anything that you would do


---------108:22----------
on your own and it sounds like you make


---------108:24----------
really good use of that time so I'd


---------108:25----------
really think about getting you know


---------108:27----------
thinking about that thank you


---------108:30----------
what you've given me is a lot and I


---------108:32----------
think it might really help me to set


---------108:34----------
better boundaries and be safer you know


---------108:37----------
I really appreciate you and everything


---------108:39----------
you've done for me and I hope people


---------108:39----------
you've been listening to have taken


---------108:41----------
something good from it as well


---------108:44----------
and yeah with that Allah
