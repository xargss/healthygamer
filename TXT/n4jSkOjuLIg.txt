---------00:00----------
if you weren't paying attention to your


---------00:01----------
dad what are the chances that you get


---------00:03----------
beat if I wasn't paying attention to my


---------00:08----------
father yeah I always I was always paying


---------00:10----------
attention to my father that's the first


---------00:12----------
thing I did I step in the door good so


---------00:14----------
my point is that you are always paying


---------00:16----------
attention and why is that because even


---------00:18----------
before you remember there were times


---------00:20----------
that you weren't paying attention and


---------00:22----------
when you weren't paying attention you


---------00:23----------
didn't see the look because you were


---------00:25----------
playing with your Legos and then you got


---------00:27----------
beat so you learned from a very very


---------00:29----------
early age you always have to pay


---------00:32----------
attention because that is survival


---------00:34----------
mechanism think about it like


---------00:36----------
evolutionarily like in one scenario you


---------00:38----------
get beat and in one scenario you don't


---------00:40----------
get beat so your six-year-old brain


---------00:43----------
learns I have to pay attention and now


---------00:46----------
what's happening is you haven't learned


---------00:47----------
to stop paying attention or you haven't


---------00:49----------
realized that you're still paying


---------00:51----------
attention


---------00:53----------
well let's see if we can help you out


---------00:55----------
with that what what are you nervous


---------00:56----------
about let's start there talking about


---------01:00----------
what what are we talking about uh


---------01:02----------
PTSD and trauma I'm just this is


---------01:05----------
something that like I keep well I kept


---------01:08----------
bottled up for a long time so just


---------01:09----------
letting it out it's nerve-wracking but


---------01:12----------
it's something I feel like I need to do


---------01:15----------
why have you kept it bottled ah I'm


---------01:19----------
scared scared of like cuz it if you keep


---------01:26----------
it bottled up it's like it's your burden


---------01:28----------
to bear I guess I've been vocal about


---------01:30----------
this on my stream a couple of times and


---------01:32----------
stuff and every time I let it out I just


---------01:34----------
get so emotional and I get so like and I


---------01:38----------
don't really like as a streamer like you


---------01:41----------
want to entertain your chat you don't


---------01:42----------
want to like burden them with your


---------01:44----------
troubles you know but I can't do my job


---------01:47----------
and entertain if I'm feeling the way I


---------01:50----------
feel does that make sense sure I'm not


---------01:55----------
so sure that I agree with this idea of


---------01:59----------
entertainment so I think part of the


---------02:01----------
reason that twitch is such a powerful


---------02:04----------
platform is because it's not just one in


---------02:08----------
games right it's fun and games most of


---------02:11----------
the time but there's enough of reality


---------02:13----------
in there which is why I think it's like


---------02:18----------
like I think there are other platforms


---------02:20----------
out there that are a little bit more


---------02:21----------
soulless like it's not about like


---------02:23----------
there's no human connection there's no


---------02:26----------
interaction and part of what I think


---------02:29----------
makes twitch actually amazing is that


---------02:30----------
it's it's the stuff that I'm guessing


---------02:33----------
that you perceive is unentertaining like


---------02:36----------
burdening twitch chat is actually part


---------02:39----------
of what makes them form a connection


---------02:42----------
with you and it's not entertainment but


---------02:46----------
it's like you know like their movies


---------02:48----------
that are really good that are not fun


---------02:52----------
right yeah and what makes them good it's


---------02:56----------
because like there's something about


---------02:57----------
life and reality and like it's a blend


---------03:00----------
of like fun stuff that we do and also


---------03:02----------
[ __ ] that's


---------03:05----------
so I don't mean but I'm with you like I


---------03:09----------
know that you know I'm sure you feel


---------03:10----------
burdened to like entertain people


---------03:13----------
because that's why they watch right


---------03:15----------
wow that's gigantic bottle of water yeah


---------03:18----------
it's I I'm too lazy to have a cup to go


---------03:21----------
downstairs to refill it so I just have


---------03:23----------
this and it keeps a cold it's like a


---------03:25----------
thermal water thing so there's like ice


---------03:27----------
cubes in there how much water does that


---------03:29----------
store I have I have it's a lot I drink


---------03:35----------
this whole I try to drink this whole


---------03:36----------
thing once a day to keep hydrated nice


---------03:39----------
well let me see yours


---------03:42----------
but like don't you get tired of like


---------03:45----------
having that glass and just refilling it


---------03:47----------
with water all the time yeah I do and it


---------03:52----------
gets like warm it gets like hoop warm


---------03:54----------
like room temperature you know I mean


---------03:56----------
this is this is some temperature [ __ ] I


---------03:57----------
have here yeah so I mean I get that


---------04:02----------
you're nervous so like is there you say


---------04:05----------
that you you do let this out on stream


---------04:07----------
from time to time yeah because I feel


---------04:11----------
like if I can let people in on the


---------04:13----------
things I've gone in my life it can help


---------04:16----------
people go through or it can help people


---------04:20----------
go through what they're what's going on


---------04:22----------
in their lives because everyone has some


---------04:23----------
sort of trauma everyone has some sort of


---------04:25----------
like so they everyone has demons in the


---------04:27----------
skeletons in the closet so if I can


---------04:30----------
share my story and share my skeletons in


---------04:34----------
the closet maybe it can help somebody


---------04:36----------
else absolutely man that's an Elsa it


---------04:40----------
also helps me to get through it because


---------04:42----------
I I've never been vocal about what


---------04:46----------
happened in my childhood to anybody


---------04:49----------
other than my girlfriend and my stream


---------04:54----------
okay I've never told anyone


---------04:56----------
except for my girlfriend and thousands


---------04:58----------
of people on the Internet I haven't told


---------05:01----------
like my closest friends I haven't told


---------05:03----------
like family I mean so twitch chat was


---------05:08----------
just trolling me about like I was like


---------05:10----------
yeah twitch chat I'm gonna trust you


---------05:11----------
guys and they're like law what like


---------05:13----------
you're trusting us and I'm like


---------05:14----------
I'm trusting you because you were


---------05:16----------
trustworthy it's kind of a mind-boggling


---------05:19----------
they don't understand that yeah but yeah


---------05:23----------
yeah my torch dad knows more about me


---------05:25----------
than my family than my friends that my


---------05:28----------
family than anyone


---------05:31----------
strong worked twitch at talk about being


---------05:32----------
good listeners so okay can I and you


---------05:37----------
know if I ask a question that is too


---------05:38----------
fast or you don't want to answer but I


---------05:41----------
find myself being curious when you say


---------05:43----------
like stuff that happened to you that you


---------05:45----------
know your friends don't know I find


---------05:47----------
myself being curious like what what


---------05:48----------
happened to you man


---------05:52----------
so me and my family we grew up in a we


---------05:57----------
grew up in poverty we're really really


---------05:59----------
poor and I don't really know if it was


---------06:04----------
the poverty that drove my dad to the way


---------06:07----------
became or if it was just he was he was


---------06:09----------
gonna become that way either way I think


---------06:11----------
being poured definitely made it worse


---------06:16----------
but he she was an alcoholic a raging


---------06:23----------
alcoholic he was she was abusive


---------06:26----------
emotionally and physically towards me


---------06:30----------
and my mother


---------06:34----------
yeah that's he


---------06:37----------
[Music]


---------06:39----------
he beat me and my mom


---------06:44----------
and emotionally he you know he'd say a


---------06:49----------
lot of things


---------06:51----------
it-it-it berry from day to day and yeah


---------07:00----------
how do i I mean do you want a story


---------07:03----------
there's like feel like telling one I was


---------07:06----------
just kind of listening there for a


---------07:07----------
second I to be completely honest and


---------07:09----------
what am i calling my calling you coconut


---------07:10----------
B you can just call me Coco Coco so Coco


---------07:14----------
I mean just what you shared actually


---------07:16----------
sort of like knocked me over emotionally


---------07:18----------
to be honest I didn't I just didn't have


---------07:21----------
words in my head for a little bit yeah


---------07:25----------
people say that so I was just kind of


---------07:29----------
processing you know it's kind of


---------07:32----------
interesting because you didn't really


---------07:33----------
use a whole lot of like language but


---------07:36----------
just something about the way that you


---------07:38----------
said it I think carried a certain weight


---------07:40----------
to it mmm you know cuz you kind of said


---------07:46----------
he was a raging alcoholic and he was


---------07:48----------
physically and emotionally abusive and


---------07:50----------
that sentence isn't I mean it's a bad


---------07:53----------
sentence but it's not like I felt


---------07:56----------
something from you and like what do what


---------07:59----------
did you what did you feel that's what I


---------08:01----------
was trying to figure out


---------08:05----------
I think I think what I felt was a weight


---------08:10----------
like it's you know like you can say you


---------08:15----------
got punched and you can say you got


---------08:17----------
slugged mm-hmm like what's the


---------08:20----------
difference between getting punched and


---------08:22----------
getting slugged can you slug sounds more


---------08:25----------
funny interesting Lex I got you know I


---------08:28----------
got slugged by that guy like you might


---------08:30----------
laugh but you know that guy punched me


---------08:32----------
like it's like oh smart move


---------08:35----------
yeah there's more umph yeah so like I


---------08:38----------
mean I didn't perceive that as is funny


---------08:40----------
I perceived it as like maybe a piece of


---------08:43----------
[ __ ] no you know you each carry


---------08:47----------
different connotations to certain words


---------08:48----------
and they just sounded it just sounded


---------08:51----------
heavy it sounded give me a second I'll


---------08:55----------
tell you what I heard I heard a certain


---------08:59----------
sense of finality to it I heard a


---------09:01----------
certain sense of inescapability to it I


---------09:04----------
heard a certain sense of you trying to


---------09:07----------
understand and like try to figure out


---------09:10----------
what was going on maybe almost you


---------09:13----------
trying to forgive him by understanding


---------09:16----------
that poverty may have had a role to play


---------09:19----------
that you're not sure if it was his fault


---------09:23----------
or if it was all his fault or how much


---------09:25----------
was that his fault and was he under


---------09:27----------
pressure but that it was his fault to a


---------09:29----------
certain amount but that there are other


---------09:32----------
factors that went into it I saw I heard


---------09:36----------
hurt on you I also heard almost and you


---------09:41----------
know this is all just me projecting


---------09:43----------
right because like I can't really know


---------09:44----------
any of this [ __ ] but I I heard almost


---------09:48----------
like more heart with you watching the


---------09:50----------
way that he treated your mom


---------09:53----------
I heard powerlessness


---------09:58----------
inevitability


---------10:04----------
yeah


---------10:06----------
that sounds about right yeah


---------10:11----------
and I think something about what you


---------10:13----------
shared carried all of that uh so my


---------10:22----------
father is he's now dead yeah


---------10:25----------
he pretty much drank himself to death he


---------10:28----------
had cancer liver cancer it started in


---------10:34----------
his throat and my guess it's because of


---------10:37----------
his use of cigarettes and then it's um


---------10:39----------
everyone was saying it's gonna be okay


---------10:42----------
like it's literally nothing serious you


---------10:44----------
know one surgery will fix it but then it


---------10:47----------
spread everywhere and like in an in span


---------10:49----------
of beer he he died you know from going


---------10:54----------
from it's nothing serious and the


---------10:56----------
doctors all saying it's it's not it's


---------10:58----------
not gonna be a big of a deal to him


---------11:00----------
dying and it's not it's not the pain


---------11:04----------
that he caused me and my my mother that


---------11:10----------
hurts me it's cuz this all happened when


---------11:13----------
I was 14 me my mother we ran away from


---------11:16----------
him


---------11:16----------
we was put ties with them we had no


---------11:19----------
communication I'm 21 now and what's


---------11:23----------
crazy is I don't think I was emotionally


---------11:26----------
mature enough to understand everything


---------11:29----------
that was going on and now that I'm 21


---------11:32----------
you know when you're a kid and like an


---------11:34----------
adult can tell you the sky is purple and


---------11:36----------
you're like okay it's purple you know


---------11:38----------
why cuz they're an adult you just


---------11:39----------
believe and then when you become an


---------11:41----------
adult you yourself you're just like that


---------11:43----------
guy was full of [ __ ] this guy wasn't


---------11:46----------
purple what did he tell you that was


---------11:48----------
full of [ __ ] what did they tell you that


---------11:49----------
was [ __ ]


---------11:51----------
it wasn't what he told me it's what he


---------11:53----------
did like he had always uh back to the


---------11:56----------
emotional part he would always looking


---------12:00----------
back he pretty he mirrored he was a very


---------12:02----------
insecure man he projected his


---------12:05----------
insecurities onto me and my mother but


---------12:08----------
me I think emotionally I actually I


---------12:12----------
don't know I think my mother and your


---------12:14----------
two different types of things but he you


---------12:17----------
know I didn't really do that good in


---------12:19----------
school


---------12:20----------
and he would just what am i why why did


---------12:24----------
I make you or or why are you my son or


---------12:30----------
you know call me a bunch of swear words


---------12:33----------
and always question what I'm doing with


---------12:37----------
my life and always told me I'm wasting


---------12:39----------
my time and why couldn't you get an


---------12:41----------
a-plus why couldn't you do this better


---------12:44----------
why couldn't you know and if it weighs


---------12:47----------
on you sand could never be good enough


---------12:50----------
for him yeah and now that I'm grown up


---------12:53----------
he did nothing he didn't do anything he


---------12:58----------
he spent all the money on cigarettes and


---------13:01----------
alcohol tons of money and he would scold


---------13:05----------
me for wanting to buy a chocolate bar a


---------13:08----------
$1 chocolate bar which every kid wants


---------13:10----------
chocolate every kid wants can't write


---------13:11----------
but he would turn it around into


---------13:13----------
something like how dare you ask for him


---------13:16----------
how dare you ask for this dad can I go


---------13:19----------
on this field trip how dare you ask to


---------13:21----------
go on the field trip you know what did


---------13:26----------
that how did you feel when he when he


---------13:30----------
said that


---------13:32----------
I felt like holy [ __ ]


---------13:36----------
maybe I am asking for too much you know


---------13:38----------
maybe I am a piece of [ __ ] mm-hmm


---------13:41----------
why am I asking to go on the field trip


---------13:42----------
wow I'm so uh why I'm so spoiled because


---------13:47----------
he would call me spoiled and I'd be like


---------13:48----------
I am spoiled I believe them cuz he's my


---------13:51----------
dad and I loved him used to love him


---------14:02----------
I don't I don't know I I don't really


---------14:07----------
when I try to recollect my memories I


---------14:10----------
don't really have any with him except


---------14:12----------
negative experiences how does it feel to


---------14:17----------
realize that


---------14:24----------
uh it's just messed up it's it just and


---------14:29----------
this goes back to when I said when he


---------14:34----------
what he passed away it's there's no


---------14:38----------
there's no fairytale ending there's no


---------14:43----------
you made a mistake and you're able to


---------14:46----------
come back and we were able to meet up as


---------14:49----------
grown men and talk about it there's none


---------14:54----------
of that it just could all ask me like


---------14:58----------
you got robbed man that's the sense that


---------15:00----------
I'm getting you got robbed of so many


---------15:07----------
things there's possibility of good


---------15:10----------
memories with your dad


---------15:12----------
possibility of a dad possibility of a


---------15:16----------
dad who supports you


---------15:20----------
the possibility to tell your dad to go


---------15:24----------
[ __ ] himself which I don't know if you


---------15:26----------
ever there yeah yeah did you yeah 100%


---------15:31----------
how did that feel - what pretty bad


---------15:39----------
pretty bad I mean it's like I said it's


---------15:43----------
just no potential


---------15:45----------
there's nothing it's he's gone and that


---------15:49----------
I think that hurts me even more cause


---------15:52----------
it's just cuz I cuz a crazy thing is is


---------16:01----------
my dad I found this out for my sister


---------16:06----------
she's not really myself she's my


---------16:08----------
half-sister she was she was from a


---------16:10----------
failed marriage previously of my


---------16:11----------
father's but I consider my sister and


---------16:14----------
she told me think a few months I think a


---------16:18----------
month ago she told me my father was


---------16:22----------
abused as a child - he was he was beat


---------16:27----------
really bad by his father


---------16:31----------
and when I heard that at first I I


---------16:36----------
laughed cuz the irony


---------16:38----------
you know you get beat as a child by your


---------16:40----------
own father and that you become into him


---------16:42----------
mm-hmm and then it broke me because you


---------16:48----------
know he knew what that feels like


---------16:51----------
he knew oh [ __ ] he knew what that felt


---------16:55----------
like to get hurt and he did it to me


---------17:04----------
so I I just


---------17:07----------
that's heavy man because you know I I


---------17:10----------
wonder if there was some part of you


---------17:11----------
that you know there's some comfort in


---------17:16----------
obliviousness right there's like there's


---------17:19----------
a difference between making a mistake


---------17:22----------
because you didn't know where it wasn't


---------17:25----------
under your control or maybe it was the


---------17:27----------
poverty or maybe it was the alcohol or


---------17:32----------
maybe he you know maybe you were a


---------17:34----------
spoiled kid and and like those are all


---------17:36----------
like good explanations like they're safe


---------17:38----------
explanations yeah but if you know what


---------17:42----------
it's like to be hurt and you do it to


---------17:44----------
someone else it's like so much more


---------17:45----------
intentional yeah well that's kind of


---------17:51----------
hurt like way more yeah that and now


---------17:56----------
that I'm more emotionally aware and I


---------18:00----------
think very emotionally aware Coco I'm


---------18:02----------
pressed to be honest by the way if I'm


---------18:05----------
talking about being grown up at the age


---------18:06----------
of 21 I was like damn son I know I mean


---------18:09----------
it's more than fourteen it's more than


---------18:11----------
fifteen you know yeah but let's be let's


---------18:14----------
I mean maybe in your case you really are


---------18:16----------
growing up but in my case I was like


---------18:17----------
basically developmentally 14 when I was


---------18:19----------
21 it's not an exaggeration and I think


---------18:23----------
we're you know we're not adults at 21


---------18:26----------
like we call ourselves adults but like


---------18:30----------
how many 21 year olds know how to pay


---------18:32----------
their taxes in my mind you're not an


---------18:33----------
adult until you learn how to pay your


---------18:35----------
taxes I paid my taxes we'll see your


---------18:38----------
your separate your different cocoa


---------18:40----------
you're not one of us then


---------18:46----------
why I think I've done a lot of critical


---------18:50----------
thinking and I got a lot of what has


---------18:55----------
happened in my childhood and because of


---------18:58----------
the experiences and the ranges of


---------19:00----------
emotion I felt I more emotionally


---------19:04----------
intelligent very much so


---------19:06----------
and I I do a lot of self-criticism and a


---------19:12----------
lot of self thinking and the reason why


---------19:15----------
I came to you is because I feel as if my


---------19:18----------
worst fear is becoming like my father


---------19:22----------
ah that's my worst fear we can help you


---------19:27----------
with that


---------19:37----------
can I just think for a second yeah yeah


---------19:39----------
for sure


---------19:51----------
so I'm gonna just think out loud okay


---------19:54----------
I'm gonna try to imagine some of your


---------19:56----------
thoughts and I'm gonna try to imagine


---------19:58----------
some of your reservations and I'm going


---------20:01----------
to try to address them the short answer


---------20:04----------
Koko is I'm not worried about you


---------20:05----------
becoming abusive at all and I've known


---------20:08----------
you for all of 15 minutes so what the


---------20:10----------
[ __ ] do I know


---------20:11----------
not much and so I think the challenge


---------20:15----------
here is that you see some amount of like


---------20:18----------
I said at the very beginning I mean


---------20:20----------
after your first kind of couple


---------20:21----------
sentences I said there's a certain


---------20:22----------
inevitability to it right and what I'm


---------20:26----------
hearing even in that question is an


---------20:27----------
issue of inevitability like your dad got


---------20:31----------
beat when he was a kid really bad and so


---------20:34----------
he beat you really bad and even though


---------20:36----------
he knew what it was like he still did it


---------20:41----------
and and so there's a part of me that


---------20:44----------
wonders like I'm just trying to put


---------20:45----------
myself in your shoes like is it possible


---------20:48----------
to break that cycle because it seems


---------20:50----------
like it isn't like there's a certain


---------20:51----------
sense of you know powerlessness about


---------20:55----------
this whole thing does that resonate with


---------21:00----------
you at all


---------21:01----------
it scares me yeah so I think it's


---------21:04----------
completely reasonable that it does and


---------21:06----------
that's actually why I have faith in you


---------21:11----------
because it scares you so I don't think


---------21:15----------
that your dad I don't think when he was


---------21:19----------
21 I would be really really surprised to


---------21:23----------
hear words like what's coming out of


---------21:25----------
your mouth come out of his mouth I think


---------21:30----------
your dad was maybe we can't capable of


---------21:32----------
all kinds of things and I really don't


---------21:33----------
know him I never met the guy never will


---------21:35----------
so this is an unfair judgment but he


---------21:37----------
doesn't seem to me someone who's very


---------21:39----------
self-reflective he wasn't right and so


---------21:43----------
in my mind power comes I mean our whole


---------21:47----------
ethos is that power comes from awareness


---------21:50----------
like this is what confuses people they


---------21:52----------
say like what do i do once I understand


---------21:54----------
then I say like I kind of say you don't


---------21:56----------
do anything you just understand it's


---------21:59----------
very like a weird idea for people that


---------22:01----------
understanding is enough so I think the


---------22:04----------
things that


---------22:06----------
what do you play Coco that play rust not


---------22:10----------
too familiar with rust can you tell me


---------22:12----------
about it


---------22:13----------
uh it's pretty much you spotted naked


---------22:17----------
with a rock and then you go kill other


---------22:19----------
nakeds with rocks okay it's like a huge


---------22:24----------
like you know like the saying like crabs


---------22:27----------
in a bucket yeah each trying to pull


---------22:30----------
each other down yeah yeah it's it's


---------22:32----------
literally just people pull each other


---------22:33----------
down for no reason this may sound kind


---------22:36----------
of weird but do you feel abusive when


---------22:38----------
you're playing rust yeah I kill people


---------22:43----------
and like I take like it you know


---------22:44----------
minecraft you know how you can farm and


---------22:46----------
you like get you have a box and you put


---------22:49----------
all your farm in the box and you like


---------22:51----------
and you start upgrading you go from dirt


---------22:53----------
to stone to like obsidian whatever


---------22:55----------
diamond rusts like the same concept you


---------22:58----------
like it's really like satisfying to the


---------23:00----------
brain because you can like you start


---------23:02----------
with a rock and then you slowly progress


---------23:03----------
and you go from like a primitive Rock


---------23:06----------
player you're on that island and then


---------23:08----------
you progress and you like start getting


---------23:09----------
you get a bow and then you get like a a


---------23:11----------
handmade like handmade yoga gun and then


---------23:16----------
you go from that to like a double-barrel


---------23:19----------
shotgun you just progress and as you're


---------23:21----------
progressing in order to progress you


---------23:23----------
have to kill other real players and you


---------23:27----------
have to take their stuff it's either


---------23:29----------
they take your stuff or you take their


---------23:30----------
stuff so it's you against them yeah is


---------23:33----------
there a particular if you played


---------23:34----------
Minecraft before yeah I have like 2000


---------23:37----------
hours in Minecraft so do you do the


---------23:39----------
games feel different to you yeah I love


---------23:43----------
games where it's like open world


---------23:44----------
survival games I love that concept like


---------23:46----------
almost huge fan of dayz minecraft rust


---------23:48----------
glass noises no I think that game [ __ ]


---------23:52----------
why it just doesn't really look that


---------23:55----------
good I don't know I I checked it out


---------23:57----------
like I haven't played it but I'm just I


---------24:03----------
think I'm just really addicted to rust


---------24:04----------
got it


---------24:05----------
fair enough I mean I just think it's


---------24:07----------
kind of like you know this is this is me


---------24:09----------
being a little bit academic and Freudian


---------24:11----------
but you know it seems to be like so I I


---------24:14----------
just know that some of my friends play


---------24:16----------
last oasis and they're just like super


---------24:17----------
toxic humans


---------24:19----------
for us is really bad it's pretty toxic


---------24:22----------
so oddly enough yeah I think that's not


---------24:28----------
necessarily a bad thing so I think


---------24:29----------
sometimes we need outlets for certain


---------24:31----------
feelings that we have and I'd just be a


---------24:33----------
little bit curious I don't know that we


---------24:35----------
need to go talk about this or if this is


---------24:36----------
me really connecting dots because really


---------24:38----------
none of this stuff is supported by


---------24:40----------
science or very little of it but there


---------24:42----------
is some evidence that people are drawn


---------24:44----------
to video games for particular reasons


---------24:47----------
music and so you know they're different


---------24:50----------
like six subtypes of like kinds of


---------24:52----------
gamers so there's like the Explorer so


---------24:56----------
this is someone who enjoys games where


---------24:57----------
you like explore things there are people


---------24:59----------
who are more interested in narrative


---------25:00----------
there are people who are more interested


---------25:01----------
in competition there are people who are


---------25:04----------
interested in progression you know there


---------25:06----------
are so many different kinds of video


---------25:08----------
games like there are people who are


---------25:09----------
interested in like strategy and tactics


---------25:13----------
and so the question is does that


---------25:15----------
correlate to our personality and this is


---------25:17----------
really the first time that I've ever


---------25:19----------
wondered about and I'm not please don't


---------25:22----------
interpret this like this because I'm


---------25:23----------
about to say something that I think can


---------25:24----------
very easily get taken out of context but


---------25:26----------
whether there's an abuser that is


---------25:29----------
growing within you that finds an outlet


---------25:31----------
a trust hmm I mean my first game was


---------25:35----------
Starcraft it was Starcraft 1 and the


---------25:38----------
Starcraft 2 and then I got into dayz and


---------25:41----------
then I got it to rust but what you said


---------25:43----------
about like I thought about this too I


---------25:46----------
was like man I didn't like in rust like


---------25:49----------
I have a rock that guy's a rock we gain


---------25:51----------
nothing from killing each other I kill


---------25:55----------
him anyways and I thought about this I


---------25:57----------
was like why did I kill him like I said


---------26:00----------
there was another like time and rust


---------26:02----------
when someone builds like a sign is like


---------26:05----------
a rust lemonade shack I broke it and I


---------26:10----------
don't I just broke it because I wanted


---------26:12----------
to break it and I thought about I was


---------26:15----------
like why do i why do I enjoy doing that


---------26:19----------
like why did that make me happy to


---------26:21----------
destroy someone like what someone built


---------26:24----------
you know what I'm saying yeah it could


---------26:28----------
be because I just wanted to entertain


---------26:29----------
the chat and like like oh look it's a


---------26:31----------
lemonade chat


---------26:32----------
Stan let's break it you know or it could


---------26:35----------
be because I had a puce and I'm just


---------26:38----------
abusing a pixelated rust and I don't I


---------26:42----------
don't know which oddly enough I think


---------26:44----------
even if that latter thing is true so I'm


---------26:46----------
really curious about that too I'd love


---------26:48----------
to catch you in those moments cocoa and


---------26:50----------
actually talk to you about like what's


---------26:52----------
going on in your head mm-hmm


---------26:54----------
and maybe we can do a little bit of that


---------26:56----------
now but oddly enough I think that that's


---------26:57----------
okay so I think we have like tendencies


---------27:01----------
and I think that video games can


---------27:03----------
sometimes be a healthy way for us to


---------27:07----------
like work out our tendencies like they


---------27:09----------
can satisfy a part of us so that we


---------27:11----------
don't have to do that in the real world


---------27:12----------
I'll get it it's it's like break like


---------27:17----------
dominoes you know you set all the


---------27:19----------
dominoes up you spend hours doing it and


---------27:21----------
then you just break it and it's super


---------27:23----------
satisfying to do it


---------27:25----------
you know so it doesn't matter to you


---------27:28----------
that it is someone else do you break


---------27:31----------
your own dominoes yeah I I would like


---------27:33----------
make well I was terrible at making Legos


---------27:36----------
but I would do what I can to make the


---------27:38----------
leg goes as a child and then I would


---------27:40----------
just break it or like I would how does


---------27:44----------
it feel to break things feels like I


---------27:48----------
don't know it just you build it up and


---------27:50----------
then you break it like I would I would


---------27:52----------
make like a big base in Minecraft and


---------27:54----------
then I'd spend like hours doing it and


---------27:56----------
then I put TNT inside the base and I'd


---------27:59----------
blow it all up and it felt good to do


---------28:02----------
satisfy what's satisfying I don't know


---------28:08----------
just seeing it all just like blow up and


---------28:10----------
like the darts like coming out of the


---------28:11----------
sky and you're just like oh and like I


---------28:14----------
don't know hmm is that weird


---------28:20----------
is that like odd yes [ __ ] okay I think


---------28:29----------
it's okay I don't think it's bad so you


---------28:30----------
asked me if it's weird right so is it


---------28:34----------
odd is it outside in the norm I just


---------28:36----------
think about so like let me let me


---------28:38----------
explain what I mean I don't mean to be


---------28:39----------
judgmental there but you asked me a


---------28:40----------
question and sometimes in other people


---------28:41----------
is that okay no you're fine okay


---------28:44----------
so like let me just put it this way when


---------28:47----------
I see most people who play with Legos I


---------28:51----------
see the operative part of playing with


---------28:54----------
LEGOs is the building not the breaking


---------28:56----------
like ie like that like even I'll go into


---------28:58----------
adults homes and I'll see they'll have


---------29:01----------
like Legos on shelves instead of


---------29:03----------
trophies mm-hmm right yeah and I think


---------29:08----------
about like why like you know when I


---------29:10----------
think about like breaking apart Legos


---------29:12----------
like generally speaking the reason most


---------29:14----------
people break I mean I don't know about


---------29:16----------
most cuz I've never done a study about


---------29:17----------
this but when I think about like


---------29:18----------
breaking Legos I think about the goal of


---------29:20----------
breaking Legos is so that you can build


---------29:21----------
them again like there's the there's


---------29:25----------
enjoyment in the building and then like


---------29:27----------
a lot of times like you know for example


---------29:31----------
like my kids get really bent out of


---------29:33----------
shape if I try to put their Legos away


---------29:35----------
because they've built something and they


---------29:36----------
want to keep this truck or whatever that


---------29:38----------
they put together I want to lose a


---------29:40----------
little bit distracted like more like


---------29:42----------
it's a little bit destructive but I do


---------29:43----------
think it is I mean generally speaking in


---------29:45----------
my singular anecdotal experience most


---------29:50----------
people who play with Legos are into the


---------29:52----------
building is opposed to the breaking does


---------29:55----------
it mean you're damaged in some way


---------29:56----------
please don't interpret it that way all


---------29:58----------
I'm saying is that it does seem to be


---------30:00----------
different from most of what I've seen


---------30:02----------
about why people use Legos what do you


---------30:05----------
think about that I think there's some


---------30:08----------
truth like I've thought of like why I do


---------30:10----------
the things I do in rust or I thought


---------30:12----------
that things like like you know in


---------30:13----------
Minecraft I would go in grief people


---------30:14----------
like I would like there'd be like a


---------30:17----------
wooden base and I'd be like man [ __ ]


---------30:19----------
this guy and I'd wide his base on fire


---------30:22----------
man he would type in Chadwicks why the


---------30:24----------
hell did you do that I said [ __ ] you


---------30:26----------
then I ran away yeah I don't I think


---------30:29----------
there's some truth to it truth to what


---------30:31----------
what do we say what are you saying cuz I


---------30:33----------
think I did it because I felt powerless


---------30:35----------
like at the time like I was 13 and there


---------30:39----------
was I had no control I had no control


---------30:40----------
over my life I was super insecure I


---------30:43----------
still am super insecure I'm still like


---------30:45----------
battling through that and it felt I


---------30:48----------
think that's why we go to video games no


---------30:50----------
to like have an outlet to like have some


---------30:52----------
type of control it feels really good to


---------30:54----------
get good I don't like it to become


---------30:56----------
really really good at a game and have


---------30:58----------
control in the video game because you


---------30:59----------
have no control in your life ok so just


---------31:03----------
pause for a second Coco I'm gonna ask


---------31:05----------
you a magic question are you getting the


---------31:07----------
sense that I'm saying this what do you


---------31:10----------
mean like all the stuff that you just


---------31:12----------
said are you getting the sense that


---------31:13----------
that's coming from me or is that coming


---------31:15----------
oh no that's coming from me okay because


---------31:17----------
I just all I was saying is that I think


---------31:19----------
it is unusual like that most people when


---------31:21----------
I hear them talk about Legos


---------31:23----------
they talk about building or they seem to


---------31:25----------
emphasize building and so you ask me is


---------31:27----------
that weird and I said yes I'm not


---------31:28----------
interpreting what that means I get the


---------31:32----------
sense that that interpretation is coming


---------31:34----------
from you hmm right so like I haven't


---------31:37----------
said anything about you being powerless


---------31:38----------
as a thirteen-year-old like that shits


---------31:40----------
oh you know I'm saying that I mean I


---------31:43----------
think it's a good insight and I would


---------31:45----------
agree with it and it's a hypothesis that


---------31:46----------
I had which maybe you picked up on but I


---------31:49----------
just was a little bit confused because I


---------31:51----------
hadn't shared that with you yet so then


---------31:55----------
let me ask you this like you know that


---------32:00----------
feeling that you get before you break


---------32:02----------
something down yeah like you want to


---------32:08----------
break it down what you want it to be


---------32:10----------
broken you don't want it to be the way


---------32:11----------
that it is you want to take something


---------32:13----------
away from someone yeah do you remember


---------32:17----------
feeling that way at home or at school or


---------32:21----------
when you were growing up no not really


---------32:25----------
now


---------32:29----------
I wanted to take someone's stuff yeah or


---------32:33----------
maybe like more related to your dad like


---------32:36----------
did your dad ever like evoke that


---------32:38----------
feeling like I know you couldn't act on


---------32:39----------
it uh so you are basically asking if I


---------32:45----------
had any like negative I wanted to do


---------32:48----------
something negative to my father is that


---------32:49----------
what you're asking me yeah yeah yeah a


---------32:53----------
lot of times I when he would hit my mom


---------32:57----------
I would envision me picking up the golf


---------33:01----------
club next to me and hitting him with it


---------33:02----------
or I would envision me hitting him


---------33:05----------
really hard in the head and stopping him


---------33:06----------
or I would try to like figure out a way


---------33:09----------
I could physically stop him how did it


---------33:12----------
feel to not be able to do those things


---------33:18----------
they still haunt me to this day the


---------33:20----------
feeling the feeling of not being able to


---------33:25----------
protect my mom and not being able to


---------33:32----------
stand up and do something about it and


---------33:43----------
powerless like I'm not like what kind of


---------33:48----------
son am i if I'm not able to protect my


---------33:50----------
own mother so Coco that makes I cannot


---------33:57----------
imagine that you would feel that way I


---------33:59----------
think anyone in that situation any


---------34:01----------
thirteen-year-old who's watching one of


---------34:03----------
their parents hit another one of their


---------34:05----------
parents is gonna feel ashamed and guilty


---------34:08----------
that they didn't do something to protect


---------34:10----------
them and that's what I'm hearing you say


---------34:13----------
yeah you're aware that you feel this way


---------34:17----------
like this is not new to you right no no


---------34:20----------
okay


---------34:21----------
so now I'm gonna ask you so like


---------34:23----------
sometimes people come here and I'm not


---------34:24----------
quite sure what what our goal is here


---------34:28----------
today but my sense is generally speaking


---------34:30----------
I try to help people possibly explore


---------34:33----------
things that they haven't explored before


---------34:34----------
and so the the takeaway from that whole


---------34:38----------
story is that


---------34:41----------
you were not good enough of a person


---------34:44----------
right like you weren't good enough you


---------34:47----------
weren't strong enough and so you blame


---------34:50----------
yourself for that right yeah I wonder if


---------34:54----------
there's actually like a weird shadow to


---------34:58----------
that light or that object which is that


---------35:01----------
do you blame yourself at all for like


---------35:04----------
not being an [ __ ] and not being evil


---------35:07----------
enough and being too good to not hurt


---------35:10----------
your dad like you wish I was more evil


---------35:14----------
absolutely I mean if if that's what it


---------35:18----------
takes to be able to prevent him from


---------35:19----------
touching my mom from hurting my mother


---------35:22----------
if that if that's what it takes then


---------35:24----------
absolutely but yes 100% in my mind those


---------35:29----------
two three different things and maybe


---------35:31----------
they're not to you but like like so not


---------35:33----------
being able to stand up to your dad for


---------35:36----------
your mom's sake makes me think like you


---------35:40----------
are not good enough right like you're


---------35:43----------
not like honorable enough or protective


---------35:45----------
enough you're you're missing a positive


---------35:48----------
quality with me hmm


---------35:52----------
ya know like I'm following it okay but I


---------35:56----------
wonder if there's also like some sense


---------35:58----------
in you that you're missing a negative


---------36:00----------
quality like you're not evil enough to


---------36:03----------
do a bad thing and I wonder if you blame


---------36:06----------
yourself for that like what is the


---------36:10----------
absence of a good thing like I'm not


---------36:14----------
able to sacrifice for my mom and one is


---------36:16----------
the absence of a bad thing it's like I'm


---------36:18----------
not enough of a bastard to hit him over


---------36:20----------
the back of a head with a golf club like


---------36:23----------
you see how ones like a good person and


---------36:25----------
one's a bad person


---------36:26----------
yeah like which one of those resonates


---------36:31----------
with you or both both of them do cuz


---------36:34----------
it's I don't know if it's because I


---------36:36----------
don't know if it's all like I'm such a


---------36:39----------
good person I couldn't hit my dad I


---------36:41----------
I just felt fear okay I was terrified


---------36:44----------
what were you afraid of


---------36:48----------
that you would that he would hurt me


---------36:51----------
back but she he did anyways sure so like


---------36:56----------
what's the point then like you might as


---------36:58----------
well you might as well do something you


---------37:01----------
know and so that's what I'm like it's


---------37:06----------
just like it's just a constant back and


---------37:08----------
forth and I think a lot of my


---------37:11----------
insecurities stems from my childhood


---------37:12----------
what do you mean by insecurity what are


---------37:14----------
you insecure about not being in control


---------37:19----------
like of my own like mind in my own body


---------37:23----------
and not being in control of like what's


---------37:26----------
going on like how my like how like how


---------37:31----------
my emotions lead me to do something I


---------37:33----------
wouldn't want to do such as like happen


---------37:36----------
yeah like I have like random emotional


---------37:39----------
outbursts and like that weed me to


---------37:41----------
hitting holes in the wall what do you


---------37:45----------
think is going on there


---------37:52----------
what do you mean by rain can you give an


---------37:54----------
example of a random emotional hoppers


---------37:56----------
like something that's so like miniscule


---------37:58----------
something that's like a minor thing like


---------38:00----------
a random annoyance like like something


---------38:03----------
I'm arguing about with my girlfriend or


---------38:06----------
something like a problem I'm having with


---------38:08----------
somebody right I get really angry like I


---------38:13----------
can go zero to a hundred for no reason


---------38:15----------
in it and then it pisses me off even


---------38:17----------
more because I'm just like you're acting


---------38:19----------
like your father now hmm so then I get


---------38:23----------
moring I can see why you're so concerned


---------38:25----------
about being becoming an abusive parent


---------38:28----------
Jim yeah because it sounds like


---------38:31----------
sometimes you're not in control No


---------38:38----------
I'm more worried about you becoming an


---------38:40----------
abusive parent now what do you think


---------38:41----------
about that I think I agree with you


---------38:46----------
I think maybe my statement earlier of


---------38:49----------
having faith because you're good or you


---------38:54----------
know you try to emotionally explore was


---------38:56----------
maybe a bit premature what do you think


---------38:58----------
I think so too


---------39:01----------
I'm glad we're on the same page so we


---------39:04----------
should take this seriously right maybe


---------39:07----------
you aren't as good of a person as as dr.


---------39:09----------
K thought you were what do you think


---------39:16----------
yeah and that's why we're here today


---------39:19----------
beautiful well I'm glad you're here


---------39:21----------
today man I really hope I can help you


---------39:22----------
out in some way I'm glad you're having


---------39:24----------
me so let me think can I teach for a


---------39:32----------
little bit instead I ask you questions


---------39:33----------
would that help you know yeah I mean I


---------39:35----------
know you've shared a lot so I kind of


---------39:36----------
want to take the pressure off


---------39:44----------
there are a couple of different angles


---------39:46----------
to this the short answer first of all


---------39:49----------
Coco let me start by saying I am still


---------39:53----------
confident that you can become a warm and


---------39:56----------
loving parent who is not abusive so let


---------39:59----------
me start there I don't think you're


---------40:01----------
hopeless I think it's gonna be a steeper


---------40:05----------
road then I thought it was gonna be what


---------40:06----------
is it like to hear that was that sigh


---------40:10----------
relief okay so I think I think it's


---------40:13----------
gonna be your it's gonna be an uphill


---------40:15----------
battle but I think you can do it and


---------40:17----------
furthermore I think you're on the right


---------40:18----------
track I still have faith in you although


---------40:20----------
I'm recognizing that this isn't going to


---------40:22----------
be as easy as I thought it was so the


---------40:25----------
first thing that I'm going to share with


---------40:26----------
you is actually something about


---------40:27----------
neuroscience so when you take so our


---------40:31----------
brain has emotional circuitry like the


---------40:33----------
amygdala and the hippocampus and there


---------40:36----------
are studies that show that different


---------40:38----------
people the activity of their emotion how


---------40:42----------
can I say this their emotional responses


---------40:45----------
vary compared let me just think okay so


---------40:52----------
I'll just I was gonna try to simplify


---------40:54----------
things but I'm not gonna simplify things


---------40:55----------
it's actually easier to explain if I


---------40:57----------
don't simplify there is something called


---------40:59----------
borderline personality disorder have you


---------41:01----------
ever heard of it borderline personality


---------41:05----------
disorder yeah I think I've heard of it


---------41:07----------
okay do you know what like you know like


---------41:09----------
in the media there's kind of this common


---------41:11----------
conception of a crazy ex-girlfriend yeah


---------41:14----------
like you don't like the attributes of a


---------41:16----------
crazy ex-girlfriend like they flip out


---------41:17----------
right it's small things they stalk you


---------41:20----------
they show up here they do this there's


---------41:22----------
like something about them that's like a


---------41:24----------
little bit crazy or very crazy and I'm


---------41:28----------
not I'm not trying to say that women are


---------41:29----------
more so than men or anything like that


---------41:31----------
but I'm just pointing out that this is a


---------41:32----------
stereotype that a lot of people


---------41:34----------
understand and I think it illustrates


---------41:35----------
some neuroscientific concepts so the


---------41:38----------
stereotype in common media of a crazy


---------41:41----------
ex-girlfriend is actually clinically


---------41:44----------
what we tend to call borderline


---------41:45----------
personality disorder so these are issues


---------41:47----------
these are people that have generally


---------41:49----------
speaking the following buckets of issues


---------41:52----------
okay so the first is that they have a


---------41:54----------
fear of abandonment so whenever someone


---------41:56----------
pulls away from them they kind


---------41:58----------
like flip now the second thing is that


---------42:00----------
they tend to be like emotionally like


---------42:02----------
zero to a hundred very quickly so in


---------42:05----------
studies of people with borderline


---------42:07----------
personality disorder they take a


---------42:10----------
particular emotional insult and they do


---------42:13----------
it to someone with BPD and someone


---------42:14----------
without BPD and what they find is that


---------42:17----------
the the activity level of the emotional


---------42:21----------
parts of their brain spikes way faster


---------42:24----------
and also stays elevated way longer than


---------42:28----------
other people


---------42:28----------
so if a healthy person gets let's say a


---------42:32----------
bad performance review at work they're


---------42:34----------
gonna get bummed out over the course of


---------42:36----------
the interview where they get the


---------42:38----------
performance review like it's gonna


---------42:39----------
happen like thirty minutes into the


---------42:40----------
interview they feel really bad about


---------42:41----------
themselves and they're gonna feel bad


---------42:43----------
about themselves for like between one


---------42:45----------
and three days for someone with BPD they


---------42:48----------
start to feel bad about themselves sixty


---------42:50----------
to ninety seconds in the interview even


---------42:53----------
before they get the bad news they start


---------42:54----------
to like feel really terrible about


---------42:56----------
themselves and then they they beat


---------42:59----------
themselves up for an entire week so


---------43:01----------
literally the brains of people with


---------43:03----------
borderline personality disorder or more


---------43:07----------
emotionally responsive to small stimuli


---------43:10----------
and stay more emotionally responsive for


---------43:13----------
way longer than a normal person's brain


---------43:16----------
does that make sense


---------43:17----------
yeah that makes sense what do you think


---------43:20----------
is the number one risk factor for


---------43:22----------
borderline personality disorder trauma


---------43:26----------
absolutely so what what we've come to


---------43:31----------
understand is that borderline


---------43:32----------
personality disorder is like it's not


---------43:34----------
like an infection right look they don't


---------43:36----------
just wake up one day huh are they bad


---------43:38----------
people no no I know it no oftentimes


---------43:41----------
they are perceived at bad people because


---------43:43----------
they do things and this is why I'm


---------43:46----------
explaining this to you because I don't


---------43:47----------
think you're a bad person they do things


---------43:49----------
that are perceived as crazy by other


---------43:51----------
people because other people don't


---------43:52----------
understand why they behave the way that


---------43:55----------
they do and the other thing that people


---------43:57----------
don't understand is that BPD people are


---------44:00----------
not stupid or crazy or knots or bad


---------44:03----------
their brains literally wired this way to


---------44:07----------
protect them from certain circumstances


---------44:10----------
so I'll give you just a


---------44:12----------
simple example why is it that a normal


---------44:15----------
person gets feels bad about themselves


---------44:17----------
30 minutes into a performance review


---------44:19----------
when your boss is telling you you've


---------44:21----------
done a [ __ ] job at a B & C whereas the


---------44:23----------
person with BPD within 90 seconds of the


---------44:26----------
start of the interaction the person with


---------44:28----------
BPD feels like their [ __ ] like how the


---------44:31----------
[ __ ] does that work your boss comes in


---------44:32----------
they say hey like how are you doing


---------44:34----------
today what'd you have for lunch and at


---------44:36----------
this point the person with BPD starts


---------44:38----------
thinking oh I'm an absolute piece of


---------44:40----------
[ __ ] oh [ __ ] I'm gonna get fired how did


---------44:42----------
they even know to think that does that


---------44:45----------
experience relate to you at all by the


---------44:47----------
way like can you understand that yeah


---------44:51----------
yeah I think I do so Alex what way do


---------44:55----------
you relate to that the fear of


---------44:58----------
abandonment okay so I'll explain to you


---------45:01----------
why people with BPD are the way that


---------45:03----------
they are so I want you to imagine I mean


---------45:07----------
in your case you don't have to imagine


---------45:08----------
what it's like to grow up so for people


---------45:11----------
who haven't grown up with abusive


---------45:12----------
parents imagine what it's like to grow


---------45:14----------
up in an abusive household let me ask


---------45:19----------
you this how likely like let's say you


---------45:23----------
get home from school one day was your


---------45:26----------
dad at home when you got home yeah how


---------45:29----------
long would it take you to know if you


---------45:31----------
were gonna get beat that day did give me


---------45:35----------
the look absolutely so now we get to the


---------45:40----------
look is actually something that has been


---------45:42----------
scientifically validated so what this


---------45:46----------
means is that people with border like so


---------45:47----------
in your case what your child brain was


---------45:50----------
doing is interpreting information and it


---------45:54----------
learned how to predict how someone is


---------45:57----------
going to behave based on how they look


---------45:58----------
at you so a look is way more significant


---------46:03----------
to you than it is to the average person


---------46:04----------
and that's absolutely a survival


---------46:06----------
mechanism do you get that yeah like you


---------46:09----------
have to know the minute you walk in the


---------46:11----------
door which of your dads you're gonna


---------46:13----------
you're dealing with where is he on his


---------46:15----------
spectrum so there's a really really


---------46:17----------
fascinating study it's my favorite study


---------46:20----------
on BPD where they take people they take


---------46:23----------
people with BPD and they show them a


---------46:25----------
face


---------46:25----------
expression so like this so like how long


---------46:31----------
does it take me to change from going


---------46:33----------
like this to this second it's like a


---------46:38----------
second yeah


---------46:39----------
so then what they did is they filmed


---------46:40----------
that that one second and they broke it


---------46:43----------
into 100 frames so if we think about it


---------46:46----------
like it halfway through the second I'm


---------46:48----------
halfway through smile and halfway


---------46:49----------
through frown I'm kind of like this


---------46:52----------
right and if you show my face to a


---------46:55----------
normal person who's halfway between


---------46:57----------
smile and halfway between frown what do


---------47:00----------
you think they interpret he's happy and


---------47:04----------
then he's frowning on the contrary they


---------47:06----------
don't know what the [ __ ] to interpret


---------47:07----------
okay whereas you can show someone with


---------47:10----------
BPD


---------47:11----------
20 frames in so when this person is


---------47:14----------
still smiling 80 percent but they only


---------47:17----------
have 20% of anger in their face a person


---------47:20----------
with BPD picks up the anger whereas a


---------47:23----------
normal person they have to be eighty


---------47:26----------
percent angry before they they pick up


---------47:28----------
the anger that's interesting that's


---------47:32----------
that's fascinating fascinating this is


---------47:35----------
the look you know exactly what the look


---------47:38----------
is and other people who haven't grown up


---------47:41----------
with abusive parents don't understand


---------47:42----------
they like their brain literally cannot


---------47:44----------
process that degree of information to


---------47:48----------
like interpret how someone is going to


---------47:49----------
react this is a consequence of your


---------47:54----------
brain adapting to trauma so now we get


---------47:58----------
to why do you blow up it seems random


---------48:01----------
it's not random


---------48:03----------
it's because all you take is a very very


---------48:08----------
it takes a very very small signal for


---------48:10----------
you to pick up and get emotionally


---------48:12----------
activated and then everyone else is


---------48:14----------
[ __ ] confused because they're like


---------48:15----------
I'm 80% happy and 20% upset your


---------48:19----------
girlfriend can be eighty percent happy


---------48:20----------
and 20 percent upset and you're gonna


---------48:22----------
pick up on the 20% upset and that's what


---------48:24----------
you're gonna react to absolutely


---------48:26----------
absolutely and why do you do that is it


---------48:29----------
because you're an uncontrollable


---------48:31----------
emotional person no it's because like


---------48:34----------
literally I want you to think about this


---------48:36----------
there are two Coco's


---------48:39----------
one who goes home and pays attention to


---------48:41----------
the look and one who goes home and does


---------48:43----------
not to pay attention to the look and


---------48:45----------
what happens to those two Coco's what


---------48:50----------
happens to one who pays attention he


---------48:52----------
gets emotional okay what are his chances


---------48:55----------
of getting beat on the week like Barry's


---------49:01----------
okay super sporadic sure if you weren't


---------49:05----------
paying attention to your dad what are


---------49:07----------
the chances that you get beat if I


---------49:12----------
wasn't paying attention to my father


---------49:14----------
yeah I always I was always paying


---------49:16----------
attention to my father that's the first


---------49:17----------
thing I did I step in the door good so


---------49:20----------
my point is that you were always paying


---------49:21----------
attention and why is that because even


---------49:23----------
before you remember there were times


---------49:25----------
that you weren't paying attention and


---------49:27----------
when you weren't paying attention you


---------49:29----------
didn't see the look because you were


---------49:30----------
playing with your Legos and then you got


---------49:32----------
beat so you learned from a very very


---------49:35----------
early age you always have to pay


---------49:37----------
attention because that is survival


---------49:39----------
mechanism think about it like


---------49:41----------
evolutionarily like in one scenario you


---------49:43----------
get beat and in one scenario you don't


---------49:45----------
get beat so your six-year-old brain


---------49:48----------
learns I have to pay attention and now


---------49:51----------
what's happening is you haven't learned


---------49:52----------
to stop paying attention or you haven't


---------49:54----------
realized that you're still paying


---------49:56----------
attention and you haven't realized it's


---------49:59----------
not that you're like emotionally


---------50:00----------
unstable no it's that you're emotionally


---------50:03----------
your ability to detect negative emotion


---------50:07----------
and other things from people is way


---------50:09----------
higher than the average person even far


---------50:11----------
beyond what you're consciously Cape like


---------50:13----------
aware of and so then your girlfriend


---------50:16----------
gets really [ __ ] confused but the


---------50:18----------
problem here is that you respond to the


---------50:21----------
way that she's feeling which she doesn't


---------50:22----------
even know herself she's not conscious of


---------50:25----------
it and you're not conscious of it but


---------50:28----------
you put you detect it and then the part


---------50:29----------
of your brain that form when you were


---------50:31----------
six to protect you from getting beat


---------50:33----------
takes over oh my god that's insane cuz I


---------50:42----------
I remember like I'd walk I always walked


---------50:46----------
home from school so I'd walk home might


---------50:47----------
open the door and the first thing I do


---------50:50----------
is sometimes he wasn't home sometimes he


---------50:51----------
was I let's get


---------50:52----------
entire house and look for him I would


---------50:56----------
just I would not like look at him lately


---------50:58----------
like I would try to just get a look at


---------51:00----------
him


---------51:00----------
cuz the doors really wowed by the time


---------51:03----------
I'm in he already knows I'm in the house


---------51:04----------
you know so I try to just get a look at


---------51:07----------
him and I first thing I do is I'd look


---------51:08----------
at his face always and if he gave me the


---------51:13----------
look I was like oh I'm getting my ass


---------51:14----------
kicked that's fascinating


---------51:21----------
that's it's weird what's weird about it


---------51:26----------
what's because I didn't I didn't I


---------51:29----------
didn't know this I I wasn't conscious


---------51:32----------
about this I I had no idea like I wasn't


---------51:36----------
aware of what I was doing you know but


---------51:41----------
then you brought it up and it just makes


---------51:42----------
sense


---------51:43----------
I'm just trying to protect myself


---------51:45----------
absolutely so now the question is if you


---------51:49----------
want to change you're afraid that you're


---------51:51----------
a particular kind of person right yeah


---------51:55----------
and so now what we have to do is we have


---------51:56----------
to ask ourselves like when you blow up


---------51:59----------
for no reason is it truly no reason or


---------52:03----------
are you just picking up on something


---------52:05----------
that you're not consciously aware of and


---------52:07----------
your girlfriend is not consciously aware


---------52:09----------
of


---------52:09----------
I think it's thing it's number two I'm


---------52:13----------
not a way I'm picking up on something


---------52:15----------
and right so what and the person doesn't


---------52:18----------
realize what I'm blowing up for and I


---------52:20----------
don't realize when I'm blowing up for


---------52:21----------
but it's because I picked up on


---------52:22----------
something that the person isn't even


---------52:23----------
aware of yep and just think about this


---------52:25----------
when you went home when you were like


---------52:27----------
seven or eight years old like


---------52:29----------
consciously like just think about the


---------52:30----------
eight-year-old if I were to ask you Coco


---------52:32----------
is an 8 year old what are you doing


---------52:35----------
you would say I don't know like the 8


---------52:38----------
year old has no conscious do you see how


---------52:40----------
like the survival mechanism of your


---------52:42----------
brain has nothing to do with


---------52:43----------
consciousness mm-hmm like as the 8 year


---------52:46----------
old doesn't understand why he's checking


---------52:47----------
every room in the house yeah and then I


---------52:50----------
asked you like Coco what are you doing


---------52:52----------
and you say I'm looking for my dad and


---------52:55----------
then I'd ask you why are you looking for


---------52:59----------
your dad and then you're like I don't


---------53:00----------
know like 8 year olds don't understand


---------53:03----------
why they do things with me yeah


---------53:05----------
so that part of your brain evolved and


---------53:08----------
sort of like leveled up to a certain


---------53:10----------
capability and then like set itself


---------53:12----------
aside and started operating autonomously


---------53:13----------
that's how our brain works and then your


---------53:16----------
conscious mind developed after the age


---------53:19----------
of 14 15 16 so it's started growing over


---------53:22----------
here but it was never aware of like this


---------53:23----------
other like it's like a program that's


---------53:25----------
running in the background yeah it is


---------53:29----------
right and then and then you think you're


---------53:31----------
a bad person because the conscious you


---------53:32----------
doesn't understand that like when you


---------53:34----------
hit control-alt-delete


---------53:35----------
and you look at the task manager there


---------53:37----------
are all kinds of these processes that


---------53:39----------
are that are running and you just have a


---------53:42----------
process you have you literally have a


---------53:43----------
survival process it's not like a I'm an


---------53:45----------
[ __ ] process or I'm an evil person


---------53:47----------
it's literally a survival process and


---------53:52----------
then there are a couple of other things


---------53:54----------
like you have you do have I mean I


---------53:56----------
imagine so one thing that we see is you


---------53:57----------
know trauma is correlated with what we


---------53:59----------
call emotional instability which i think


---------54:01----------
is a terrible it's the second worst term


---------54:05----------
in medicine the number one term in


---------54:07----------
medicine that I think is dumb in


---------54:09----------
judgmental is incompetent cervix which


---------54:12----------
if you guys know what that means it's


---------54:13----------
like anyway when women are pregnant


---------54:16----------
sometimes you know they have this thing


---------54:18----------
called a cervix which has to open up so


---------54:20----------
like the uterus is different from the


---------54:21----------
vagina and the cervix is like the door


---------54:23----------
between the uterus and the vagina and


---------54:25----------
the baby is in the uterus and then the


---------54:29----------
cervix opens up during birth so then the


---------54:32----------
baby passes through the uterus through


---------54:34----------
the cervix into the vagina and then out


---------54:36----------
and then an incompetent cervix is a


---------54:38----------
cervix that is like too loose and so


---------54:40----------
like it doesn't keep the baby in the


---------54:42----------
uterus so you can have like a premature


---------54:44----------
birth and it can end bad but the word


---------54:46----------
incompetent is just like it's like your


---------54:48----------
cervix is [ __ ] dumb no it's not dumb


---------54:50----------
anyway it's just anyway so like


---------54:52----------
emotional instability I think is a


---------54:54----------
really judgmental term that I don't


---------54:56----------
think is fair it's not that you're I


---------54:58----------
don't think like even sensitivity is is


---------55:00----------
like has a negative connotation to it so


---------55:03----------
I would say this Coco your brain is


---------55:07----------
emotionally primed so you're like like


---------55:12----------
you know when you play rust and you're


---------55:13----------
primed for conflict and you're looking


---------55:16----------
for it yeah so you're paying at


---------55:18----------
to every little thing in the environment


---------55:21----------
because that could mean you get beat


---------55:23----------
yeah and so that's what your brain is in


---------55:27----------
terms of motions you're looking for


---------55:28----------
things you're always on the lookout


---------55:30----------
because when you weren't on the lookout


---------55:32----------
you got beat hmm so it's not that you're


---------55:37----------
emotionally unstable it's just that your


---------55:39----------
emotions do react more quickly and part


---------55:42----------
of that is all go ahead


---------55:44----------
I think me living in New York like has


---------55:47----------
elevated that to because in New York


---------55:49----------
when you're walking by yourself at 2:00


---------55:51----------
in the morning you're always looking


---------55:53----------
around you're always making like some


---------55:55----------
guy looks at you up and down and looks


---------55:56----------
at your shoes right oh I don't it's


---------55:59----------
funny you say that about emotion and


---------56:02----------
being able to judge someone cuz like


---------56:03----------
when we go out to a party or we'd go out


---------56:06----------
somewhere I get one look at group of


---------56:09----------
guys and I'd be like it's gonna be a


---------56:11----------
long night yeah it's gonna be a long


---------56:13----------
night so I will tell you this Koko I


---------56:16----------
have walked up and down the streets of


---------56:17----------
New York and I have never once thought


---------56:20----------
about anyone looking at my shoes like


---------56:23----------
I've never once noticed what people are


---------56:26----------
looking at or not I mean I I have once


---------56:27----------
or twice like I can tell when people are


---------56:30----------
predatory and or mentally ill like have


---------56:32----------
schizophrenia and things like that but


---------56:33----------
you know like because that's what I've


---------56:35----------
been primed to look look at but I'm


---------56:37----------
generally oblivious to things like that


---------56:39----------
hmm and so this is just like your brain


---------56:43----------
is prone to survival mechanism now the


---------56:44----------
problem that you run into is that your


---------56:47----------
brain evolved to function in a hostile


---------56:51----------
environment right now the problems that


---------56:56----------
you run into and this is where you need


---------56:57----------
to grow and change is not that you're a


---------56:59----------
bad person


---------57:00----------
but you're no longer in a hostile


---------57:02----------
environment so your brain is freaking


---------57:05----------
the [ __ ] out when it doesn't need to


---------57:07----------
anymore that doesn't make you a bad


---------57:09----------
person doesn't make you emotionally


---------57:11----------
unstable it just means that you need to


---------57:13----------
learn and you need to intentionally


---------57:15----------
teach your brain how to respond


---------57:17----------
differently because hopefully your


---------57:19----------
girlfriend doesn't be and she's not


---------57:20----------
gonna be mm-hmm


---------57:22----------
right hopefully is very very patient


---------57:24----------
with me yeah so so hopefully that's the


---------57:27----------
case and it's just gonna take you some


---------57:29----------
time to like learn that and you can


---------57:31----------
intentional


---------57:32----------
do that to speed up the process like you


---------57:36----------
know hopefully most people like to learn


---------57:37----------
how to get over this at some point but


---------57:38----------
we can definitely help you understand a


---------57:40----------
little bit about how to do that so I


---------57:42----------
wonder if I mean I let me just pause for


---------57:45----------
a second and ask you one or two


---------57:46----------
questions so the first is what do you


---------57:48----------
think about our conversation so far I


---------57:51----------
opening okay


---------57:53----------
very very eye-opening because you're


---------57:55----------
telling me things I'd even realize it's


---------57:58----------
about the whole emotional thing like it


---------58:01----------
it makes sense


---------58:02----------
it makes complete sense the first thing


---------58:06----------
I do is look at a person's face and


---------58:07----------
their body posture and I I can like tell


---------58:10----------
how they're feeling just like this yeah


---------58:12----------
I get one read very common in trauma and


---------58:15----------
I think in order to understand it my


---------58:20----------
outburst we have to you know go deeper


---------58:22----------
than that deeper in what way cuz cuz my


---------58:26----------
my my idea was like I just had these


---------58:30----------
random emotional outbursts that's what I


---------58:32----------
initially said to you right yeah and


---------58:34----------
then you talked about this idea of order


---------58:36----------
line personality disorder and you're


---------58:39----------
reacting you're in a hospital I feel I


---------58:43----------
have not changed or I've been able to


---------58:46----------
fix this is cuz it varies I haven't had


---------58:49----------
one in two weeks but I have I have


---------58:54----------
nightmares


---------58:56----------
it's are flaring it flared around when I


---------58:58----------
left I couldn't sleep in a room with the


---------59:02----------
room was dark because as a child my dad


---------59:06----------
would strain and would come in the room


---------59:08----------
and beat me up in the dark so I couldn't


---------59:11----------
sleep in a room that was dark too I was


---------59:13----------
like 13 14 I was terrified of the dark


---------59:15----------
now I could sleep in the dark but when


---------59:18----------
we left and ran away from my father I


---------59:20----------
started having emote the emotional


---------59:24----------
number one the emotional outbursts well


---------59:26----------
you know what we talked about and number


---------59:29----------
two I started having nightmares I've


---------59:32----------
recreated scenarios that my father has


---------59:33----------
done and scenarios that never happened


---------59:37----------
but still terrifies me and


---------59:41----------
it happens once a week okay Coco are you


---------59:47----------
seeing a therapist


---------59:48----------
no hear us I had an evaluation done like


---------59:53----------
four for ADHD but that's was that even a


---------59:58----------
therapist I don't even know but probably


---------60:00----------
you're the first maybe


---------60:02----------
you're the first so a couple of concrete


---------60:05----------
things okay the first is that you know I


---------60:07----------
really think you should see a therapist


---------60:09----------
by the way I don't think you have


---------60:10----------
borderline personality disorder like


---------60:11----------
there's a you know I'm not diagnosing


---------60:13----------
through something I'm using that as an


---------60:15----------
example of generally speaking so I used


---------60:17----------
that because the studies on BPD are


---------60:19----------
pretty good but essentially this is


---------60:21----------
common of trauma so you don't have to be


---------60:22----------
peppy PD but like my conception so a big


---------60:26----------
part of the way that I view mental


---------60:27----------
health which is like sort of different


---------60:29----------
from some of my colleagues is they view


---------60:31----------
it as an illness and it's absolutely


---------60:32----------
like an illness in the sense that it


---------60:34----------
interferes with your life right because


---------60:36----------
you don't want to have these emotional


---------60:37----------
outbursts it's maybe puts a strain on


---------60:38----------
your relationship or things like that so


---------60:41----------
I get that it's like not good for you


---------60:42----------
but the more that I've come to


---------60:44----------
understand mental illness the first


---------60:46----------
thing that I start with is that this


---------60:47----------
person is not crazy and the more that


---------60:51----------
I've adopted that mindset the more I've


---------60:53----------
come to learn that like our mind does


---------60:55----------
things to protect us and it just doesn't


---------60:58----------
know any better


---------60:59----------
right because your responsiveness to


---------61:02----------
like subconscious stimuli or like


---------61:05----------
literally a survival mechanism freedom


---------61:07----------
and so now the question is so now this


---------61:11----------
is kind of sort of sort of the second


---------61:12----------
part is like now I'd like to ask you


---------61:15----------
where you want to go so there are two or


---------61:18----------
three different directions one is that I


---------61:20----------
can talk to you about your thoughts and


---------61:22----------
feelings and we can hear stories about


---------61:24----------
your past and sometimes people feel like


---------61:27----------
emotionally unburdened for that


---------61:28----------
sometimes people watch for people


---------61:30----------
telling really heavy [ __ ] and they cry


---------61:32----------
and they have this beautiful moment at


---------61:34----------
the end and all this kind of stuff we


---------61:36----------
can talk about your past and you can


---------61:38----------
share the dark parts I'm happy to talk


---------61:40----------
to you about that leaning a little bit


---------61:42----------
away from it because what I've actually


---------61:43----------
like to do is help you I get the sense


---------61:46----------
that you've explored some of those parts


---------61:48----------
yourself in terms of getting to the


---------61:51----------
emotions some people struggle and


---------61:53----------
reaching the emotions it doesn't seem


---------61:54----------
like you


---------61:55----------
you've done a lot of good work around


---------61:56----------
that so the next two things that we


---------61:59----------
could do is to help you reinterpret and


---------62:02----------
understand the impact of that stuff on


---------62:05----------
your current life so to help you tunnel


---------62:08----------
down into what precisely is an emotional


---------62:11----------
outburst what are the sequence of the


---------62:13----------
sequences of events and how can you


---------62:16----------
understand like what that process is


---------62:18----------
because once you know to look for it


---------62:21----------
like in rust that is camouflage right do


---------62:25----------
you how does yeah do you know how to


---------62:26----------
spot camouflage if a bush is green and I


---------62:32----------
mean it's pretty obvious of a guy just


---------62:34----------
hiding in a bush okay so like my point


---------62:36----------
is that generally speaking like you know


---------62:38----------
there are people like there are things


---------62:39----------
that are camouflage that are hard to see


---------62:41----------
and once we learn how to spot camouflage


---------62:44----------
we come better we become better at like


---------62:46----------
detecting it and then we can act on it


---------62:48----------
so I think that what's going on in your


---------62:50----------
emotional outbursts is that there's a


---------62:52----------
lot of stuff that you're blind to and


---------62:54----------
once we teach you how to not be blind


---------62:56----------
then you can start to control it


---------62:59----------
because right now the problem is like oh


---------63:01----------
I have this random emotional operation


---------63:03----------
it's not random you think you're just


---------63:05----------
like you wake up and you're like in the


---------63:06----------
middle like in the middle of a four-hour


---------63:08----------
stream you just have an emotional


---------63:09----------
outburst you're like taking your third


---------63:12----------
piss of the day or you're refilling your


---------63:14----------
bottle and you like just have this


---------63:15----------
emotional outburst I mean maybe you do


---------63:17----------
that's what it feels like yeah so I


---------63:20----------
think that there's actually but that


---------63:21----------
doesn't make sense to me because like


---------63:23----------
you're not I mean human brains are not


---------63:25----------
random right like you don't just you


---------63:28----------
know wake up one day and decide to dress


---------63:29----------
like a chicken and pretend and make


---------63:31----------
monkey noises like that's random like


---------63:34----------
the human brain responds and generally


---------63:36----------
like when do you eat when you get hungry


---------63:38----------
when do you get sad when you talk about


---------63:40----------
sad [ __ ] or you listen to sad [ __ ] or


---------63:42----------
when you stop distracting yourself and


---------63:44----------
you're sitting alone right like there's


---------63:47----------
an order to our mind and our thoughts


---------63:49----------
and so you just don't get you're sad at


---------63:50----------
random times when you watch a sad movie


---------63:52----------
like there are things that trigger our


---------63:55----------
thoughts and emotions in particular ways


---------63:57----------
when do you feel like eating pizza when


---------63:59----------
you see an advertisement for pizza or


---------64:01----------
when you smell someone else eating pizza


---------64:03----------
there's like order to our mind so I


---------64:05----------
don't believe that your emotional


---------64:07----------
outbursts are random


---------64:08----------
I think the reason there are a couple of


---------64:10----------
principles around that so I'd like to


---------64:12----------
help you maybe understand your emotional


---------64:13----------
operas the third option and this is kind


---------64:15----------
of opening a different can of worms so


---------64:16----------
maybe like Session two or like you know


---------64:19----------
twitch stream to is to really talk about


---------64:22----------
your fear of abandonment and where that


---------64:25----------
comes from and sort of thinking about


---------64:27----------
relationships but I leave it up to you


---------64:29----------
I'm happy to just listen and then you


---------64:31----------
know as you talk about things maybe I


---------64:32----------
can bring up a couple of other things so


---------64:34----------
if you want to just tell us about you


---------64:35----------
know what it was like to run away at 14


---------64:37----------
what you understood I mean all that


---------64:39----------
stuff I think is gonna be interesting


---------64:40----------
although I don't know exactly where


---------64:41----------
that's gonna go and this option number


---------64:44----------
two is for us to dig into the emotional


---------64:46----------
outbursts and maybe try to get some


---------64:48----------
understanding of them because I think


---------64:49----------
that when I look at you I see one one


---------64:54----------
foundation to all of your fear and it's


---------64:57----------
that you're not in your control


---------64:59----------
yeah and so if I think about how can I


---------65:01----------
help this guy the simplest way is to


---------65:04----------
teach you to help you see that you can


---------65:07----------
be in control and if I can do that


---------65:08----------
everything comes tumbling down all of


---------65:10----------
your fears about being an abusive father


---------65:12----------
will come tumbling down


---------65:13----------
and the third is to talk about a man in


---------65:15----------
it what do you think we've got about


---------65:20----------
maybe 15 20 minutes left so we can kind


---------65:22----------
of tie things up okay


---------65:25----------
maybe half an hour do you feel like it I


---------65:31----------
think by me telling what cuz like at the


---------65:35----------
start you're like I don't think I have a


---------65:37----------
fear of you becoming like your father


---------65:40----------
and then after I told another story


---------65:42----------
alright I told you more about myself you


---------65:45----------
understood more and you're able to you


---------65:46----------
know get more insight and more knowledge


---------65:49----------
to me so I think by me telling you my I


---------65:53----------
think telling you more about me and my


---------65:55----------
character can help you help me sure


---------65:58----------
beautiful so what do you want to tell me


---------66:00----------
about your character so my fear


---------66:10----------
my fear of abandonment I think comes


---------66:13----------
from cuz like you mentioned like people


---------66:22----------
with borderline personality disorder


---------66:25----------
like they get very emotional when people


---------66:28----------
leave yeah right I think I do that too I


---------66:33----------
think I can I think I've done that and I


---------66:36----------
have I've done that in the past before


---------66:38----------
one other it's ex-girlfriends or it's


---------66:40----------
some you're the crazy ex-boyfriend I'm


---------66:44----------
not crazy and they're like oh like


---------66:45----------
stalking the profile and like go into


---------66:47----------
their house I'd never done anything like


---------66:48----------
yeah I've never done anything like that


---------66:50----------
but I feel some type III definitely feel


---------66:53----------
emotion but more from friends from like


---------66:56----------
people I conserve good friends and


---------66:58----------
ex-girlfriends because if relationship


---------67:00----------
doesn't work then [ __ ] it doesn't work


---------67:01----------
can't do it we got to move on but with


---------67:04----------
friends it's more of like when I


---------67:06----------
befriend someone I see them as like a


---------67:08----------
brother or a sister like I it's either


---------67:10----------
were associates or were very very very


---------67:13----------
close and when that person when there's


---------67:18----------
the threat of that person weaving and


---------67:20----------
weaving my life I can get very emotional


---------67:22----------
can you tell me about that I get


---------67:28----------
frustrated because it's like can you


---------67:30----------
tell me an actual instance like who are


---------67:32----------
we talking okay do you talk to me about


---------67:33----------
something okay so me and this guy knew


---------67:36----------
each other for I'd say two years and we


---------67:41----------
were really good friends we went to the


---------67:42----------
same high school we were on the same


---------67:44----------
wrestling team really good friends we


---------67:47----------
went to each other birthday parties we


---------67:49----------
hung out all the time blah blah blah uh


---------67:51----------
how old were then when you guys became


---------67:54----------
friends


---------67:54----------
oh we were we were fifteen when we


---------67:56----------
became friends and then we were friends


---------67:58----------
told were seventeen and then I remember


---------68:01----------
when we became seventeen he started to


---------68:06----------
kind of drift away he kind of got


---------68:08----------
distant in our conversations and he


---------68:10----------
didn't check up on me as often as he did


---------68:12----------
and


---------68:16----------
I got really really angry and I got


---------68:23----------
really angry and I saw him in the


---------68:24----------
hallway and I pushed him for no reason


---------68:28----------
and then after that he blocked me and we


---------68:31----------
didn't talk after that


---------68:35----------
so when you say for no reason mm-hmm


---------68:40----------
help me understand are you detecting a


---------68:42----------
reason now or at the time did you think


---------68:45----------
it was no reason at the time I detected


---------68:50----------
the dozin right no reason I think I


---------68:52----------
think what happened now I was telling


---------68:55----------
the story of like what I thought back


---------68:57----------
then not like yep now like I think now


---------69:00----------
what happened is he just found new


---------69:03----------
friends


---------69:04----------
he just cuz in high school and college


---------69:06----------
like people just you know like they they


---------69:08----------
bounced around from social circle to


---------69:10----------
social circle people change and I think


---------69:12----------
like he found his own like group his own


---------69:16----------
little group cuz he he leaned more


---------69:18----------
towards uh what's what's the thing


---------69:22----------
called when we argue debate team he


---------69:25----------
joined a debate team and I continued


---------69:27----------
with wrestling hmm so he was more busy


---------69:29----------
with his schedule and I was busy with


---------69:30----------
mine and I understand that now but back


---------69:34----------
then I just chalked it up as she hates


---------69:36----------
me but he was just busy with his own


---------69:39----------
thing yeah so let's let's not think


---------69:44----------
about now because that actually doesn't


---------69:46----------
help us very much let's think about then


---------69:48----------
because if we think about you know I


---------69:51----------
okay I put you remember what we talked


---------69:53----------
about with Minecraft blowing up the tnt


---------69:55----------
building whatever I destroyed our


---------69:57----------
friendship yes I decided to destroy the


---------70:02----------
friendship and by pushing him and also


---------70:05----------
insulting him and just like kind of


---------70:07----------
clowning him I destroyed our


---------70:09----------
relationship I destroyed it before he


---------70:11----------
could destroy the relationship because I


---------70:13----------
felt like that's what he was doing at


---------70:14----------
the time okay that's very common for


---------70:20----------
people with BPD hmm so let me share with


---------70:24----------
you some thoughts so once again I'm not


---------70:26----------
diagnosing you cuz I yeah over the


---------70:28----------
Internet


---------70:28----------
but you understand that right I'm just


---------70:30----------
gonna share with you information so


---------70:33----------
having worked with some people with BPD


---------70:35----------
and this also doesn't necessarily to be


---------70:37----------
PD this is oftentimes people with trauma


---------70:41----------
the thought of someone leaving you can


---------70:46----------
be so painful and it can also be so


---------70:50----------
powerless


---------70:53----------
so sometimes it's kind of like this


---------70:55----------
sentiment well if it's gonna happen


---------70:57----------
let's just get it over with like some


---------71:01----------
people especially in the histories of


---------71:03----------
trauma more so than BPD some people kind


---------71:05----------
of you know have this mentality that


---------71:07----------
like I sure know not some people most


---------71:11----------
people actually assure no is easier to


---------71:15----------
deal with than an uncertain yes you know


---------71:20----------
you just like tell me do you like me or


---------71:22----------
do you not like me like let's just get


---------71:23----------
it over with because right now I don't


---------71:24----------
know and it's the not knowing that's


---------71:26----------
killing me yeah that has nothing to do


---------71:28----------
BP that's just normal okay right so like


---------71:32----------
sometimes what happens is like what we


---------71:34----------
do is like when we're we're not sure


---------71:36----------
where things are going but we don't


---------71:40----------
think they're going in the right


---------71:41----------
direction we like put things to a climax


---------71:45----------
like we put things to a test and it's


---------71:48----------
like what is he gonna do when I push him


---------71:51----------
is he gonna like try to fix things or is


---------71:55----------
he gonna like let things go


---------71:58----------
does that make sense yeah that makes


---------72:01----------
sense so let me ask you this like so so


---------72:04----------
we used a very interesting phrase which


---------72:09----------
is that he's he didn't check up on me as


---------72:11----------
much so generally speaking when I think


---------72:15----------
about two friends I don't think about


---------72:18----------
their interactions is checking up on


---------72:20----------
each other does that make sense say that


---------72:27----------
again so you used the phrase he didn't


---------72:29----------
check up on me as much mm-hmm he like


---------72:31----------
stops checking up on me yeah but like I


---------72:35----------
think about checking up on is not like


---------72:38----------
like you didn't say he like stop texting


---------72:40----------
you


---------72:41----------
right you stop texting me stopped like


---------72:43----------
he just kind of like fine went ended on


---------72:46----------
thing I


---------72:46----------
I completely I had her sent what you're


---------72:48----------
saying my point is that like used a


---------72:50----------
particular phrase which I don't usually


---------72:54----------
think about when I think about friends


---------72:56----------
hmm like I'm gonna like you know play


---------73:00----------
games with my friends tonight but like I


---------73:02----------
don't check up on them during the day


---------73:04----------
right like I message upon discordant


---------73:06----------
psych hey man what do you want to play


---------73:07----------
like I don't envision that is checking


---------73:09----------
up on does that make sense yeah that


---------73:12----------
makes sense so who do you check up on


---------73:16----------
when do we I use the word like check up


---------73:19----------
on as in like just like you know if you


---------73:21----------
have a friend that you consider close to


---------73:24----------
you yeah hey man how you doing how's


---------73:25----------
work going how's how's uh how's your


---------73:29----------
parents doing like you know smart like


---------73:31----------
checking up on them you know I


---------73:32----------
completely agree so you're using it


---------73:34----------
appropriately but how is the question so


---------73:37----------
let me put it this way like checking up


---------73:40----------
on is a sign of like how is your


---------73:43----------
interaction with your friends I


---------73:45----------
completely agree that's checking up on


---------73:46----------
I'm not saying it's not how is that


---------73:49----------
different from the way that I interact


---------73:51----------
with my friends like what is yours if I


---------73:53----------
if I message you and I'm like hey man


---------73:55----------
you don't play games tonight versus if I


---------73:57----------
message you know like hey man how are


---------73:58----------
your parents are they doing okay with


---------74:00----------
Kovan like what does one message imply


---------74:04----------
in another message not imply one message


---------74:08----------
is just you're trying to hang out yeah I


---------74:10----------
guess the other message is you trying to


---------74:12----------
be like you you trying to like hey man


---------74:14----------
like how you doing I guess yes what's up


---------74:17----------
like I would say that one is about


---------74:19----------
caring and one in a not so when I think


---------74:22----------
about mentally when I think about who do


---------74:24----------
I check up on it's the people that I'm


---------74:25----------
worried about it's the people that I


---------74:27----------
care about does that make sense


---------74:29----------
yeah and even the way that you interact


---------74:31----------
with people it sounds like you actually


---------74:32----------
like give a [ __ ] about them like you


---------74:34----------
care yeah so let's if we assume that the


---------74:38----------
fray is checking up on associates with


---------74:40----------
caring what does it mean if he stops


---------74:44----------
checking up on you he doesn't care is


---------74:46----------
that how you felt yeah right so then


---------74:51----------
looking back looking back I think he was


---------74:53----------
just we were both in high school and


---------74:55----------
looking back is fine now you understand


---------74:57----------
that but how did you feel back then I


---------75:00----------
felt like why is this piece of [ __ ]


---------75:02----------
ghosting me like what did what did I do


---------75:04----------
wrong it feels like he doesn't care he


---------75:06----------
doesn't care about me he doesn't care


---------75:08----------
about you right and if he doesn't care


---------75:12----------
about you then what does that make you


---------75:13----------
do makes me want to like hurt him not


---------75:18----------
yeah yes you want to loot Lee because


---------75:22----------
what does it like to be not cared about


---------75:25----------
feels terrible


---------75:27----------
in what way it my dad hurting me right


---------75:34----------
yeah because it's even worse with


---------75:37----------
friends because I think the people that


---------75:40----------
it's hard for you to get away from are


---------75:42----------
the ones that led you to believe that


---------75:44----------
they care mm-hmm it's like you


---------75:48----------
understand that there's associates and


---------75:51----------
you don't emotionally invest in them at


---------75:53----------
all no but once you open the door


---------75:57----------
because it's hard for you to do that


---------75:59----------
yeah it's really hard and then you let


---------76:02----------
someone in and you start caring about


---------76:04----------
them and they start caring about you and


---------76:06----------
then like it can be it can feel really


---------76:08----------
hurt I'm just gonna toss a sentence out


---------76:10----------
there and you let me know try to think


---------76:12----------
back to you being 17 and whether it felt


---------76:14----------
this way you were supposed to care yeah


---------76:18----------
after all we've done together you were


---------76:20----------
supposed to care absolutely beautifully


---------76:21----------
put


---------76:27----------
and I I saw him like my brother you know


---------76:31----------
like I said it's either Associates or we


---------76:35----------
we even called each other brothers yeah


---------76:37----------
it's either associates or it's you're


---------76:40----------
very very close to me there is no


---------76:42----------
in-between I can't juggle that so when


---------76:45----------
it's now I'm very like I'm very picky


---------76:49----------
with like who I let into my life and who


---------76:52----------
I opened the doors for because it's the


---------76:54----------
ones that's closest to you that can hurt


---------76:56----------
you the most so oddly enough Coco I'm


---------77:00----------
gonna suggest to you a different


---------77:02----------
strategy okay so the problem so let me


---------77:07----------
just let's walk through that strategy so


---------77:10----------
you're more selective about the people


---------77:12----------
that you let into your life


---------77:14----------
right so like ergo fewer people are


---------77:17----------
coming into your life what is the


---------77:18----------
likelihood that they will leave oh


---------77:23----------
you're talking about right now look not


---------77:26----------
really that like not really likely but


---------77:29----------
they're gonna leave right like just


---------77:33----------
think about it like you're 21 you're


---------77:34----------
dating a girl like what's the chance


---------77:36----------
that you're gonna marry you pretty high


---------77:39----------
okay I know you think that what's the


---------77:43----------
chance that 21 year-olds marry their


---------77:44----------
girlfriend pretty well gonna happen


---------77:48----------
right I'm not saying that your it's


---------77:50----------
gonna happen to your case I mean when I


---------77:51----------
was 21 I was dating a girl and she's the


---------77:53----------
one that I ended up married were


---------77:55----------
together 16 years later so knows I'm not


---------77:58----------
disputing that but I'm saying


---------77:59----------
statistically you're letting fewer


---------78:01----------
people in but because of stuff like


---------78:03----------
you're 21 right so like people are gonna


---------78:05----------
be like your friends are gonna be like


---------78:06----------
graduating and moving and things like


---------78:08----------
that like all that kind of [ __ ] is gonna


---------78:09----------
happen in the same way that you look


---------78:11----------
back on high school and you say people


---------78:13----------
grow and they change you're still 21 man


---------78:15----------
like people are still growing and


---------78:16----------
changing so those people are the people


---------78:19----------
that you choose to let in are gonna


---------78:20----------
leave your life and it's gonna hurt when


---------78:25----------
they do that and the problem is that


---------78:27----------
when they leave your life for completely


---------78:29----------
normal reasons what are you gonna do how


---------78:35----------
did you respond to being hurt in high


---------78:37----------
school what do you do now


---------78:38----------
I pushed them


---------78:40----------
you bet what's happen now I would just I


---------78:46----------
would just think about the good times we


---------78:48----------
had that's really that's really nice to


---------78:50----------
hear I think though that what you would


---------78:53----------
do is probably more of what you're doing


---------78:55----------
now so here's the pattern that I'm


---------78:57----------
seeing pretty open arms lots of people


---------79:01----------
in and out you get hurt a couple times


---------79:03----------
narrower arms I'm more selective fewer


---------79:07----------
people in and out chances of people


---------79:10----------
abandoning you less but it's still gonna


---------79:12----------
happen cuz you're 21 yeah and when you


---------79:15----------
get hurt again narrower very few people


---------79:19----------
coming in and out so I think over time


---------79:22----------
you're gonna isolate yourself I think a


---------79:26----------
better strategy is for you to when you


---------79:29----------
perceive that someone else is pulling


---------79:31----------
away from you having a conversation with


---------79:34----------
them


---------79:34----------
don't just mourn and think about the


---------79:36----------
good times like you can actually change


---------79:38----------
them leaving if you change the way you


---------79:40----------
talk to them right if you were 17 and


---------79:43----------
you were kind of saying like hey men you


---------79:45----------
have time to chat and then like not just


---------79:47----------
chat cuz like I'm sure you made good


---------79:49----------
efforts right you would check up on him


---------79:50----------
a couple times it started becoming


---------79:52----------
pretty one-way and you sort of saw


---------79:54----------
everybody I try I try to hang out with


---------79:55----------
them and like you wouldn't give you the


---------79:57----------
time of day oh you'd say yeah and then


---------79:59----------
you just ghost me absolutely right and


---------80:02----------
and so then like I think what you need


---------80:03----------
to like learn how to like not just push


---------80:06----------
him away at that point or say like [ __ ]


---------80:08----------
him he's not worth my time because


---------80:10----------
that's like another sort of impulse


---------80:11----------
right like when we get hurt we're like


---------80:13----------
[ __ ] that he's not worth my time


---------80:14----------
yeah it's to actually like authentically


---------80:17----------
share with people what you feel and it's


---------80:19----------
hard when you're 17 but like you know


---------80:21----------
it's to sit down with the guy and say


---------80:22----------
like hey man like we've made plans three


---------80:24----------
times and you've ghosted me three times


---------80:26----------
like I understand that people grow and


---------80:28----------
change and you've got a new batch of


---------80:29----------
friends and you're in a debate club I


---------80:30----------
think that's awesome but to be blunt


---------80:33----------
like I thought we were really tight and


---------80:35----------
I know that it's not it's not like you


---------80:36----------
hate me or anything but like frankly


---------80:37----------
dude I miss you like it's hard for a


---------80:40----------
17-year old male to tell another 17-year


---------80:43----------
old male who are platonic and close that


---------80:45----------
they miss each other our society has not


---------80:49----------
made it easy for us to say things like


---------80:50----------
that yeah but if you feel like people


---------80:53----------
are


---------80:54----------
leaving your life like rather than like


---------80:56----------
try to maneuver around it which once


---------80:58----------
again your brain is gonna do because do


---------81:00----------
you see like how your brain shut down


---------81:03----------
any kinds of attempts at direct


---------81:05----------
communication about how you feel because


---------81:08----------
if you told your dad how you felt


---------81:12----------
nothing [ __ ] didn't matter yeah so


---------81:16----------
you have literally shut off a particular


---------81:18----------
path of interacting with people and the


---------81:22----------
reason that you shut it off is because


---------81:23----------
you had such a big influence in your


---------81:25----------
life with which that path of


---------81:27----------
communication was useless but imagine


---------81:31----------
this for a second right like if you base


---------81:34----------
a strategy about how to live your life


---------81:36----------
on the interactions with your dad you're


---------81:38----------
[ __ ] yeah cuz thankfully people are


---------81:42----------
not your dad oh thank god and so you've


---------81:49----------
got to learn a different way of


---------81:51----------
interacting with people right it's to


---------81:53----------
let people know like hey man like I'm


---------81:56----------
feeling like we're drifting apart in


---------81:57----------
this relationship


---------81:59----------
I mean it's some hard [ __ ] to say but


---------82:01----------
it's kind of like literally telling


---------82:02----------
people hey man I feel like we're


---------82:04----------
drifting apart and I value our


---------82:06----------
friendship


---------82:07----------
and I want you to be a part of my life


---------82:10----------
it's like if you say that to like one of


---------82:13----------
your friends on discord like what the


---------82:16----------
[ __ ] like they don't even know what to


---------82:17----------
do with that right but then you can


---------82:18----------
model with that the chances are you feel


---------82:20----------
the same way and then like they're gonna


---------82:21----------
say something to you they're gonna say


---------82:24----------
like yeah man I'm really busy like


---------82:25----------
actually it turns out that like my dad


---------82:27----------
has cancer and I don't have enough time


---------82:28----------
and then it's like oh [ __ ] and then you


---------82:31----------
understand cuz there's a part of you


---------82:33----------
that feels like you were a piece of [ __ ]


---------82:34----------
because remember your dad a long time


---------82:36----------
ago you started believing that you're a


---------82:38----------
piece of [ __ ] and now this is where we


---------82:39----------
get into the psycho now this is


---------82:41----------
psychobabble kind of stuff so you have a


---------82:42----------
part of you that starts with the idea


---------82:45----------
that takes the truth that you're a piece


---------82:46----------
of [ __ ] and then what it does is it it


---------82:49----------
like you've got some sort of lethal


---------82:50----------
combination of shits - it's the perfect


---------82:53----------
tornado you know part of yourself


---------82:55----------
believing that you're a piece of [ __ ] an


---------82:57----------
oversensitive or a highly primed sensory


---------83:01----------
system that detects any kind of


---------83:03----------
discomfort so even if people are 80%


---------83:05----------
happy with you in 20


---------83:07----------
sad with you or frustrating 20% sad


---------83:10----------
you're gonna you see how that's like


---------83:12----------
that's a double whammy yeah those two


---------83:16----------
things combined to make it hard for you


---------83:18----------
to engage in relationships if we def we


---------83:21----------
took away either one you'd be fine it's


---------83:23----------
the combination of the two and that's


---------83:28----------
gonna change the way and then the third


---------83:30----------
the third like if you want three strikes


---------83:32----------
and you're out the third strike is that


---------83:34----------
you have not been taught how to relate


---------83:36----------
to people with your feelings because


---------83:40----------
that entire process was [ __ ] a waste


---------83:43----------
of time when you were growing up like


---------83:45----------
your mom maybe tried talking to your dad


---------83:47----------
and they're like please don't hit Coco


---------83:49----------
and your dad was like [ __ ] you and then


---------83:50----------
smack turn and then smack to you and so


---------83:53----------
then your six-year-old brain was like oh


---------83:55----------
talking to people is a waste of [ __ ]


---------83:56----------
time


---------83:58----------
what's way better is for you to


---------84:01----------
interpret to mind-read and then adjust


---------84:04----------
accordingly which is exactly what you do


---------84:07----------
you mind read oh this person doesn't


---------84:09----------
care about me oh I'm gonna do this and


---------84:11----------
I'm gonna do this like you never


---------84:11----------
interact with them you interpret it


---------84:14----------
becomes truth in your mind you know


---------84:16----------
exactly what their thoughts are and then


---------84:18----------
you just adjust your behavior without


---------84:19----------
ever directly communicating with them


---------84:21----------
with that I said to her because I was


---------84:23----------
thinking about your girlfriend is that


---------84:24----------
what you do with your girlfriend yeah


---------84:27----------
absolutely


---------84:28----------
you know what's in her mind I don't know


---------84:31----------
what's in her mind but like I look at


---------84:32----------
her face and my mood can insulate just


---------84:35----------
like that right so now I'm gonna give


---------84:38----------
you something super super concrete okay


---------84:41----------
which is when you look at her face and


---------84:44----------
your mind shifts like this I want you to


---------84:47----------
try to see what the mind has had what's


---------84:50----------
happened in your mind and all even even


---------84:52----------
if you don't seek if you can't piece it


---------84:54----------
together what I want you to do is tell


---------84:57----------
her in that moment I'm not sure exactly


---------85:00----------
what happened but something just shifted


---------85:02----------
in my mind and I'm feeling kind of like


---------85:03----------
antsy or stressed out just communicate


---------85:08----------
with that to her and then the cool thing


---------85:10----------
is because she's not your dad she's


---------85:12----------
actually hopefully gonna like help you


---------85:14----------
work through that and then maybe you


---------85:16----------
guys can have a conversation about it


---------85:17----------
and maybe you'll feel better and then


---------85:20----------
you don't have to


---------85:21----------
let that shift control and that's where


---------85:24----------
you're gonna get your power back makes


---------85:30----------
sense that makes so much sense


---------85:47----------
Thank You dr. kay thank you for watching


---------85:50----------
coca I still have faith in you man I


---------85:52----------
think you're gonna be okay


---------85:54----------
it's gonna be you know it's gonna be


---------85:56----------
hard like it's hard to do that but just


---------85:58----------
start with catching catch the shift as


---------86:00----------
best as you can


---------86:01----------
mm-hmm and then shirt like like catch it


---------86:05----------
and communicate like you don't need to


---------86:06----------
fix it you don't need to get her to do


---------86:08----------
anything you don't need to do anything


---------86:09----------
yourself catch it and communicate that's


---------86:11----------
really all you need to do questions so


---------86:20----------
not just my girlfriend but just like


---------86:22----------
people in general like if I get it's


---------86:26----------
like second nature like if I can look at


---------86:29----------
a person to say it's first nature its


---------86:32----------
first Nate if I can look at a person's


---------86:33----------
face and my I can't it's it's not like a


---------86:37----------
thought process it just happens


---------86:39----------
yeah it just happens anyway how do i how


---------86:41----------
do I control that if it's just impulse


---------86:43----------
it's it's like drinking water you don't


---------86:45----------
you know you don't drink water in your


---------86:46----------
nose you drink in your mouth yeah see


---------86:49----------
you can't control the first step you can


---------86:52----------
control the way that you respond to it


---------86:54----------
so this is it's kind of weird but when


---------86:57----------
you say its second nature it's not


---------86:58----------
second nature its first nature what you


---------87:00----------
can actually control the second nature


---------87:04----------
you can't control the way that your face


---------87:07----------
interprets I mean the way that your


---------87:09----------
senses interpret their face because


---------87:13----------
that's been programmed in that process


---------87:15----------
is running what you can do is control


---------87:18----------
the way that you respond to that that's


---------87:23----------
where the control comes from you can't


---------87:25----------
and maybe over time you can actually you


---------87:27----------
can over time rewire that brain that


---------87:30----------
part of your brain there's good data to


---------87:31----------
support that but it takes a couple of


---------87:34----------
years but what you can you can also do


---------87:37----------
is like you can catch it and then you


---------87:39----------
can choose not to respond in the way


---------87:42----------
that you normally do which honestly the


---------87:44----------
way that you normally respond is by


---------87:46----------
doing nothing you see that like you do


---------87:50----------
something way down the road from when


---------87:53----------
you know the problem arises does that


---------87:55----------
make sense


---------87:55----------
mm-hmm there's like you notice point a


---------87:58----------
point B


---------87:59----------
see point D point e point F you notice


---------88:02----------
lots and lots of things and your brain


---------88:04----------
is interpreting lots and lots of


---------88:05----------
information you act around like X Y & Z


---------88:10----------
and at that point like that's where the


---------88:12----------
emotional outburst comes from nowhere it


---------88:14----------
doesn't come from nowhere


---------88:15----------
it comes from 97 percent of [ __ ]


---------88:18----------
building up and then you just overflow


---------88:20----------
yeah like I want you to imagine it this


---------88:24----------
way let's say my trashcan is full and


---------88:26----------
then I throw one banana in the trash and


---------88:29----------
then the banana spills out and then I


---------88:32----------
scratch my head and I'm like holy [ __ ]


---------88:33----------
it's completely random sometimes I throw


---------88:36----------
one banana in the trash and it doesn't


---------88:38----------
overflow and sometimes I feel like it's


---------88:40----------
completely random like my my trashcan is


---------88:42----------
random like one banana can make it


---------88:44----------
overflow sometimes it's not how it works


---------88:46----------
man it's not random you're overflowing


---------88:49----------
and you're just not aware that your


---------88:50----------
trashcan is filling up throughout the


---------88:52----------
day so the solution is to catch as


---------88:58----------
little the any point that you can catch


---------89:00----------
it and then I would say start with your


---------89:02----------
girlfriend because that's kind of easy


---------89:03----------
like it's weird to do this with other


---------89:05----------
humans but you have to pick someone


---------89:07----------
that's kind of like intimate that you're


---------89:08----------
close with you can pick your mom or


---------89:10----------
someone who can be patient with you it


---------89:12----------
sounds like she's patient and then you


---------89:14----------
know she comes home one day and then you


---------89:16----------
see her like you're telling her about


---------89:18----------
your day and she's texting and then you


---------89:20----------
get like jealous or pissed off at her


---------89:22----------
because it feels to you like she doesn't


---------89:24----------
care because if she cared she wouldn't


---------89:27----------
paying attention and then what you do is


---------89:31----------
you catch it and then as best as you can


---------89:33----------
you try to explain it to her and gonna


---------89:35----------
say like I don't know why like and this


---------89:37----------
is what you have to be careful because


---------89:39----------
this is where like the abusive part of


---------89:41----------
you could come in if you try to control


---------89:42----------
her behavior and make her stop texting


---------89:44----------
then you go down the abusive Road


---------89:46----------
gotcha so you don't want to control it


---------89:49----------
you just want to acknowledge and say


---------89:50----------
like I'm not saying and then you have to


---------89:52----------
let her do that right like you have to


---------89:53----------
give her the power to sort of say like


---------89:56----------
hey I'm not saying you should stop


---------89:57----------
texting but right now in this moment I


---------90:01----------
feel like you're not really paying


---------90:02----------
attention to me and I just really want


---------90:05----------
you to and then it's like you guys have


---------90:07----------
to work out like - sure she stopped


---------90:09----------
texting right now or should you learn


---------90:11----------
how to manage your own feelings and then


---------90:13----------
she's


---------90:13----------
finish your texting and then she'll like


---------90:15----------
you guys will connect in 15 minutes and


---------90:16----------
then you guys can talk about it


---------90:20----------
how's a question yeah I think she should


---------90:26----------
so if she's texting and I see her and I


---------90:29----------
don't like that she's texting I


---------90:31----------
immediately catch myself and I say hey I


---------90:34----------
don't really like that you're texting


---------90:35----------
it's bothering me I have a feeling do


---------90:38----------
what I shouldn't say put the phone down


---------90:40----------
do I just say how I'm feeling absolutely


---------90:42----------
and in fact what you want to say is I'm


---------90:44----------
not asking you to put the phone down I'm


---------90:46----------
trying to share with you the way that I


---------90:47----------
feel okay right so sure okay you don't


---------90:52----------
want to guilt-trip her into putting the


---------90:54----------
phone down which is what's gonna happen


---------90:55----------
so you even need to collect correct on


---------90:57----------
the opposite side and then like if


---------91:01----------
there's an impulse to you that's like


---------91:02----------
put the [ __ ] phone down [ __ ] you


---------91:05----------
need to notice that - I don't think I


---------91:07----------
don't think like that okay good I have I


---------91:15----------
am like that's just like like why is she


---------91:17----------
not paying attention to me yeah like I


---------91:19----------
look at her face I'm like oh she doesn't


---------91:21----------
really care what I'm saying her eyes are


---------91:22----------
you know right I know I know that see


---------91:25----------
but you don't this is the thing you


---------91:27----------
can't know your brain tells you you know


---------91:30----------
but you literally cannot know what's in


---------91:32----------
someone's head but that's not what your


---------91:34----------
brain tells you your brain is like I see


---------91:36----------
that look in her eyes and I know like


---------91:39----------
just pause and think about that for a


---------91:40----------
second can you like can you read minds


---------91:43----------
no but you feel that way yeah right so


---------91:48----------
like like people who have had a history


---------91:51----------
of trauma can become mind reader's


---------91:53----------
that's what they feel they start to


---------91:55----------
believe that the thoughts are facts


---------91:57----------
right and looking back on it now like


---------92:00----------
you recognize that that your body just


---------92:02----------
like you know he grew into a different


---------92:04----------
person because you guys met when y'all


---------92:05----------
were 15 and then like he was 17 and then


---------92:08----------
like y'all are different people but back


---------92:10----------
then you knew that he didn't care about


---------92:12----------
you you see that difference yeah I see


---------92:16----------
the difference and you're gonna have it


---------92:18----------
now - you're gonna know that she doesn't


---------92:21----------
care about you and then you can also


---------92:24----------
like let her know cuz it's gonna be


---------92:25----------
[ __ ] weird for you got to get


---------92:26----------
like some kind of like background about


---------92:28----------
this conversation and that you're gonna


---------92:30----------
try something new I'll just have her


---------92:32----------
watch a stream she's not watching right


---------92:34----------
now because I asked her not to but I


---------92:35----------
just have our watches sure right and


---------92:39----------
then and and so you're right like so you


---------92:41----------
gotta be really careful because you


---------92:43----------
don't want her to act what you want to


---------92:46----------
be able to do is separate because this


---------92:49----------
is exactly your goal so just listen


---------92:51----------
carefully separate your emotions from


---------92:53----------
other people's actions and your own


---------92:56----------
actions separate decouple emotion and


---------92:59----------
action oh that's so hard yes and here's


---------93:03----------
the thing Koko once you can do that you


---------93:05----------
don't have to worry about being an


---------93:06----------
abusive father anymore okay I'll try you


---------93:10----------
with me yeah I'm with you because it's


---------93:12----------
the abusive father is gonna come from


---------93:14----------
uncontrolled emotion it's gonna come


---------93:16----------
from emotion leads to action and there's


---------93:18----------
no control in between so you can


---------93:21----------
literally train yourself to uncouple


---------93:23----------
those things by sharing your feelings


---------93:25----------
with her and asking her not to put the


---------93:27----------
phone down mm-hmm and then saying can we


---------93:29----------
talk about this in 15 minutes and then


---------93:32----------
as you learn to wait 15 minutes or five


---------93:35----------
minutes or 60 seconds it starts with as


---------93:38----------
pathetic of a time amount as you want to


---------93:40----------
then it becomes 90 seconds then it


---------93:42----------
becomes 10 minutes then it becomes 15


---------93:44----------
minutes hey can we check in about this


---------93:46----------
tomorrow and then one day you're gonna


---------93:49----------
wake up in your emotions don't control


---------93:50----------
you dad that'd be the best day ever but


---------93:54----------
it's gonna be hard and it's gonna be


---------93:56----------
slow so catch it and communicate this


---------93:59----------
step one you ready to meditate yeah I'm


---------94:07----------
ready to try really try to get this


---------94:08----------
thing under control okay good so we're


---------94:11----------
gonna start sit up straight I have a


---------94:14----------
really really hard meditation technique


---------94:16----------
for you okay mmm close your eyes I want


---------94:23----------
you to notice your breath


---------94:32----------
so unfortunately Coco this technique is


---------94:35----------
gonna be hard and I'm not going to give


---------94:37----------
you any training wheels so I want you to


---------94:40----------
can you tell the difference between the


---------94:42----------
inhalation and exhalation like like I'm


---------94:47----------
inhaling and exhaling mm-hmm can you


---------94:49----------
tell the difference it's kind of a silly


---------94:50----------
question I know but it's a simple yeah


---------94:52----------
obviously so I want you to find the


---------94:56----------
moment where inhalation becomes


---------94:58----------
exhalation


---------95:08----------
okay


---------95:11----------
can you find it find the moment


---------95:15----------
inhalation becomes exhalation yes


---------95:26----------
it happens when I mean it happens when I


---------95:31----------
inhale and then when I feel like I've


---------95:33----------
been held enough I exhale I am not sure


---------95:36----------
okay


---------95:37----------
so let me ask you something is there a


---------95:39----------
moment where you pause the breath yeah


---------95:42----------
don't pause okay let the breath flow


---------95:47----------
naturally from inhalation to exhalation


---------95:50----------
I'm doing it and now catch the moment


---------95:55----------
where one becomes the other well that's


---------96:01----------
weird


---------96:03----------
good that means you're doing it right


---------96:12----------
slow down breathe through your nose


---------96:18----------
slow slow slow breathing way too fast go


---------96:21----------
slow I understand why you're breathing


---------96:23----------
fast because you're trying to collect


---------96:24----------
more data at the transition yeah let


---------96:27----------
yourself sit in the exhalation is


---------96:31----------
inhalation and then sit in the


---------96:33----------
exhalation and then notice that


---------96:35----------
transition


---------96:51----------
by way too fast


---------96:56----------
I think you're doing better if you feel


---------96:59----------
like you're breathing too fast then slow


---------97:00----------
down don't get lightheaded take a break


---------97:06----------
for a couple of breaths if you need to


---------97:09----------
just breathe normally and then return to


---------97:11----------
the technique


---------97:24----------
I think I'm doing it okay what are you


---------97:27----------
doing tell me I'm inhaling and then


---------97:31----------
break before I hit spring I'm exhaling


---------97:33----------
and I'm catching it again on the inhale


---------97:35----------
I'm sorry can you say that again I'm


---------97:37----------
inhaling and then before it hits like


---------97:41----------
the top I'm exhaling and then it like


---------97:43----------
before it like I'm switching it over and


---------97:45----------
over again so how are you exhaling if it


---------97:49----------
hasn't hit the top yet cuz I'm just I'm


---------97:53----------
just letting it out what is that what do


---------97:56----------
you mean by the top is that not the end


---------97:57----------
of the inhalation and I am I supposed to


---------98:00----------
be going at the end of an inhalation


---------98:03----------
can you I think you're doing it right


---------98:08----------
but maybe let's just understand our


---------98:09----------
terminology so what I'm hearing from you


---------98:12----------
is that you are catching the moment


---------98:15----------
where inhalation becomes exhalation yes


---------98:18----------
sir yeah yeah okay describe that moment


---------98:21----------
to me it feels I don't know it feels


---------98:29----------
pretty good it feels like I feel really


---------98:31----------
relaxed it feels awkward too though I


---------98:35----------
have never breathed like this before and


---------98:37----------
what feels awkward about it because like


---------98:41----------
I feel like there's like a rhythm with


---------98:42----------
breathing and I'm like I'm just like


---------98:44----------
breaking that rhythm so I'm just not


---------98:49----------
used to this pattern of breathing like


---------98:51----------
this rhythm of breathing and what is the


---------98:54----------
rhythm of breathing that you're doing


---------98:55----------
are you doing something a rhythm across


---------98:58----------
multiple breaths are you changing the


---------99:00----------
way that a single breath is breathed I'm


---------99:04----------
changing the way that a single breath is


---------99:05----------
be and how are you changing it I when I


---------99:09----------
inhale I use the exhale


---------99:13----------
I think I'm not explaining myself


---------99:14----------
properly that's okay it's because it's


---------99:17----------
hard to describe they're just it's it's


---------99:19----------
a lack of sufficient words in our


---------99:21----------
language it has nothing to do with you


---------99:24----------
know your capability so it sounds to me


---------99:30----------
almost like you are starting to exhale


---------99:32----------
while you are still inhaling yeah yeah


---------99:35----------
okay so I think you're doing


---------99:37----------
you're doing this call it's what you're


---------99:40----------
doing is somewhat impossible but I think


---------99:42----------
you're doing it right because do you get


---------99:44----------
this like you can't inhale and exhale at


---------99:46----------
the same time that's like literally not


---------99:47----------
possible yeah yeah but you're doing it


---------99:52----------
right and so now what I want you to


---------99:58----------
notice is that what you're noticing is


---------100:00----------
that there's a phase where inhalation


---------100:03----------
and exhalation overlap right


---------100:10----------
but if inhalation and exhalation overlap


---------100:13----------
over a period of time that is not the


---------100:16----------
moment where inhalation becomes


---------100:19----------
exhalation right I guess so let me put


---------100:28----------
it this way I want you to zoom into that


---------100:29----------
transition and find where exactly they


---------100:32----------
crossover perfectly okay by the way


---------100:40----------
sometimes it takes people a couple of


---------100:41----------
months to do this yes I'm like I feel


---------100:46----------
really relaxed but at the same time I'm


---------100:48----------
like getting frustrated because I feel


---------100:50----------
like I'm not doing it right no you're


---------100:51----------
doing it right it just takes practice so


---------100:54----------
this - so very good Toma have I done


---------100:58----------
sort of now I want you to notice your


---------101:01----------
frustration right so notice your


---------101:05----------
frustration and then step away from it


---------101:07----------
and do three more breaths where you look


---------101:10----------
for the moment of an inhalation


---------101:11----------
exhalation okay just focus on the


---------101:16----------
practice notice that you're frustrated


---------101:17----------
maybe I'm not doing it right you're


---------101:19----------
doing fine by the way I'm telling that


---------101:20----------
you're doing it right but just notice


---------101:23----------
that frustration let it be separate from


---------101:25----------
you and return your mind to where you


---------101:29----------
want to go


---------101:36----------
do you feel the frustration I don't


---------101:41----------
really feel it right now no good where


---------101:44----------
did it go I don't know I just breathed


---------101:47----------
this I don't know I wonder I wonder if


---------101:54----------
this can help you the next time you add


---------101:58----------
a tiny little piece to the to the trash


---------102:01----------
mm-hmm so now we're done so now I'm


---------102:05----------
gonna explain us a couple things to you


---------102:06----------
fantastic job Coco first of all it's a


---------102:08----------
[ __ ] weird exercise okay so part of


---------102:11----------
it is like we're exploring things like


---------102:13----------
it's like trying to explain to someone


---------102:15----------
you know if I take my kid and I put them


---------102:17----------
like in the water for the first time in


---------102:19----------
their life and I ask them how it feels


---------102:21----------
like I asked them how does it feel how


---------102:24----------
does the water feel different from the


---------102:26----------
air they're not gonna have words to


---------102:28----------
describe their experience even though


---------102:30----------
they're feeling it does that make sense


---------102:33----------
and then they may even get frustrated


---------102:36----------
when they try to describe how water


---------102:37----------
feels different from air because then we


---------102:38----------
just don't have language for so you're


---------102:40----------
so let yourself get frustrated so be it


---------102:42----------
but return to this practice and this


---------102:45----------
practice is gonna help you in two ways


---------102:46----------
the first is that it's training you and


---------102:49----------
catching it's training you to notice


---------102:54----------
that which you have never noticed before


---------102:56----------
which is gonna be like that's your rock


---------102:59----------
in rust right that's where you get


---------103:02----------
started and sure you can upgrade you can


---------103:04----------
do fancy meditation you can become a


---------103:06----------
good communicator you can decouple your


---------103:09----------
emotions from your actions and all that


---------103:10----------
stuff you can wonderfully build up over


---------103:12----------
time but your rock the thing that you


---------103:14----------
start with naked man whether rock is


---------103:16----------
catching catching is where it all begins


---------103:20----------
and you were doing it today because you


---------103:22----------
notice things about yourself that you've


---------103:24----------
never noticed before you see that yeah


---------103:26----------
that's the [ __ ] point it doesn't


---------103:28----------
matter whether you figure out the answer


---------103:29----------
or not it's not about the answer it's


---------103:32----------
that you're training yourself to look


---------103:36----------
man so just do that and the second thing


---------103:40----------
bonus little side advantage is that as


---------103:44----------
you experience frustration if you look


---------103:47----------
for the transition of the breath it will


---------103:48----------
give you


---------103:49----------
power over the frustration that's down


---------103:54----------
the road okay questions no questions


---------103:58----------
awesome man thank you so much for sure


---------104:01----------
thank you dude


---------104:02----------
thank you so much very welcome and thank


---------104:04----------
you so much for coming on and sharing


---------104:06----------
honestly I think that's the only time we


---------104:09----------
can do our work is when people are


---------104:10----------
authentic and like had the courage to


---------104:12----------
say what I was shaking last night like


---------104:15----------
my hands were shaking last night I was


---------104:17----------
shaking when I came on I was a nervous


---------104:18----------
wreck I was like oh my god how am I


---------104:20----------
gonna like I'm gonna really go on here


---------104:23----------
and but I feel so much better I feel so


---------104:27----------
much better


---------104:27----------
good I I cuz you can't solve a problem


---------104:30----------
if you don't know the question it's


---------104:34----------
impossible to solve it so it's like my


---------104:37----------
entire life I'd be like oh there's emo


---------104:39----------
but the trash cans overflowing I don't


---------104:42----------
know why it's overflowing why is it


---------104:44----------
overflowing I put a banana in there I


---------104:45----------
don't know and my entire life was based


---------104:47----------
on that and now like no it's you're just


---------104:51----------
not taking out the trash dumbass you


---------104:53----------
know yes perfect so this is why I have


---------104:57----------
faith with you for you Coco because if


---------105:00----------
you can learn how to take out the trash


---------105:01----------
you're not going to be an abusive father


---------105:03----------
it's that simple is it easy


---------105:06----------
no but there's absolutely a way forward


---------105:09----------
absolutely okay and you've got years I


---------105:13----------
imagine before you become a father never


---------105:16----------
know yeah yeah so you've got some time


---------105:19----------
so I'm glad you came on today really


---------105:22----------
really happy with how you're feeling and


---------105:24----------
I'm great kid to you as well so good


---------105:26----------
luck man thank you so much dr. kay Thank


---------105:29----------
You Brad take care yeah my pleasure


---------105:32----------
all right


---------105:39----------
[Music]


---------105:41----------
mmm okay let's see


---------105:52----------
we got time for questions can we do like


---------105:54----------
three questions yeah let's do it okay


---------106:01----------
sorry midstream hey okay hey what's that


---------106:04----------
mean


---------106:04----------
alright so my question in grants to


---------106:07----------
stream so say I'm making an effort and I


---------106:12----------
mean effort sort of like reflexive


---------106:13----------
listening


---------106:14----------
sort of like taking from the


---------106:15----------
communication stream so I'm again effort


---------106:17----------
to communicate to a person like how I


---------106:19----------
feel but then I noticed that person


---------106:21----------
comes like defensive so quotations like


---------106:23----------
why are you questioning me like why do


---------106:24----------
you care so much for me those type of


---------106:27----------
responses what would be like the most


---------106:29----------
like safe strat to respond other than


---------106:31----------
like I care for you dude or like I I'm


---------106:34----------
worried about you ah so this does


---------106:38----------
require like you have to level up your


---------106:39----------
communication past level one


---------106:41----------
so so there are two things right so how


---------106:44----------
do you reflectively listen - why do you


---------106:47----------
care for me how do you reflectively


---------106:54----------
listen - why do you care for me I guess


---------106:58----------
like I give me I would give reasons as


---------107:02----------
to why I would care that's not


---------107:03----------
reflective listening right sure yeah


---------107:06----------
okay yeah so like literally how do you


---------107:11----------
reflectively listen like if I say so


---------107:17----------
let's play this game okay you're what am


---------107:20----------
i calling you buddy


---------107:21----------
I assumed zero so Xiao Xue Xue okay so


---------107:28----------
still I care about you now you play your


---------107:31----------
friend we're gonna roleplay


---------107:32----------
so you play your friend and I say Zil I


---------107:35----------
care about you wait like why so why do


---------107:41----------
you care so much about me like I like I


---------107:43----------
don't like I don't need you it sounds


---------107:46----------
like you're kind of confused as to why I


---------107:49----------
would care about you yes


---------107:55----------
can you help me understand why you're


---------107:58----------
why you think it's strange that are like


---------108:00----------
why you have trouble like help me


---------108:03----------
understand why you think that I wouldn't


---------108:05----------
care about you


---------108:13----------
I think because like okay I see like I'm


---------108:18----------
trying trial play like the other


---------108:19----------
person's like yeah like they have like I


---------108:21----------
guess like their own sort of like


---------108:22----------
reasons as to why


---------108:23----------
okay sure and then you reflectively


---------108:25----------
listen to those it's like the way that


---------108:27----------
you reflectively listen to a question so


---------108:29----------
this is the thing you guys think


---------108:30----------
reflective listening is hard because you


---------108:31----------
all get caught up and then you try to


---------108:32----------
provide reassurance no man it's


---------108:34----------
literally it sounds like and then you


---------108:36----------
fill in literally what they said let's


---------108:39----------
try it again


---------108:41----------
so Zil now you try it


---------108:43----------
I'm gonna play your friend and you're


---------108:46----------
gonna play you okay so like hey man like


---------108:55----------
so I I feel as if like you're you're


---------108:59----------
being more distant and I I noticed that


---------109:02----------
you've acted differently around me


---------109:04----------
versus other people and I just want to


---------109:06----------
know why is that okay so I don't know


---------109:13----------
we're gonna have to talk about that


---------109:15----------
communications though but so I don't


---------109:17----------
understand like why like I don't


---------109:19----------
understand why you would care about like


---------109:21----------
what I think like I don't understand why


---------109:23----------
you think I'm like why you care about me


---------109:26----------
like what what difference does it make


---------109:28----------
whether I treat you a certain way or


---------109:29----------
another way I guess like to pard a like


---------109:37----------
that difference kind of feels makes me


---------109:40----------
feel kind of you're answering the


---------109:41----------
question it's not reflectively listening


---------109:43----------
wrong okay gotcha


---------109:45----------
what is reflectively listening gonna be


---------109:49----------
trying to understand it's like oh I'm


---------109:54----------
sorry that no be like it's literally


---------109:56----------
literally say it sounds like and then


---------109:58----------
repeat the words that I say let's try


---------110:01----------
again yeah okay Zil express your caring


---------110:07----------
for everybody we'll get you there hey


---------110:11----------
man like you it it seems like you you've


---------110:16----------
changed a bit you've acted differently


---------110:17----------
around me I don't know why you care man


---------110:20----------
like I don't know what the big deal is


---------110:22----------
like I don't know why you would care


---------110:23----------
about like how I act around


---------110:27----------
so you're saying that you don't


---------110:31----------
understand why I care about you yeah I


---------110:35----------
mean that's what I'm saying man like I


---------110:36----------
don't understand why you care so why do


---------110:42----------
you think that is though that's not


---------110:46----------
reflective listening actually okay I


---------110:49----------
might need I'm I needed a refresher in


---------110:51----------
terms of like this contact so it's it's


---------110:53----------
literally okay we're gonna try it one


---------110:54----------
more time okay I'm gonna play you and


---------110:56----------
you're gonna play your friend okay the


---------110:59----------
problem is that you're responding to my


---------111:01----------
questions instead of repeating them


---------111:03----------
pretend that you're repeating bond and


---------111:05----------
you just repeat like you should be a


---------111:08----------
make yourself into an NPC people in chat


---------111:11----------
are saying like NPC simulator simulator


---------111:13----------
and you guys think that this is easy


---------111:15----------
it's not [ __ ] easy


---------111:16----------
I trained six years to learn how to do


---------111:18----------
this okay gotcha okay so let's try it


---------111:22----------
one more time I'm gonna be you and


---------111:26----------
you're gonna be your friend okay so hey


---------111:28----------
man like I'm concerned about like how


---------111:30----------
our interactions have been going


---------111:32----------
recently it sounds like you know I feel


---------111:33----------
like you're kind of treating me


---------111:34----------
differently why should that matter to


---------111:40----------
you like why do you care so much about


---------111:41----------
what I need to do like don't need to


---------111:43----------
worry about y'all so it sounds like


---------111:46----------
you're feeling like I shouldn't care so


---------111:48----------
much about what you I shouldn't care so


---------111:52----------
much about what you're doing I should


---------111:53----------
really pay more attention to like how


---------111:55----------
I'm acting yeah yeah so can you tell me


---------112:02----------
a little bit about how you think I


---------112:03----------
should be acting differently well I


---------112:08----------
think you should try not to worry about


---------112:11----------
me


---------112:11----------
I see so you think that I shouldn't be


---------112:14----------
worrying about you very much yeah and


---------112:16----------
help me understand why I shouldn't worry


---------112:19----------
about you very much


---------112:22----------
because I'm trying to do my own things


---------112:25----------
like I got my own problems like I don't


---------112:27----------
need you to care about me like I'm an


---------112:28----------
independent person yeah so you're you're


---------112:31----------
an independent person it doesn't sound


---------112:32----------
like you need my help yeah


---------112:39----------
so how has this been so far so now I'm


---------112:44----------
talking to you you got so we did like


---------112:46----------
three three reflective listening


---------112:48----------
statements yeah right so like you just


---------112:53----------
roll with it whatever he says you just


---------112:55----------
repeat it back


---------112:56----------
you don't answer his questions you don't


---------112:59----------
say like yeah man you do need my help


---------113:01----------
yeah man like if you if he says like


---------113:04----------
yeah you should like why don't we talk


---------113:05----------
about you for a minute and then you say


---------113:07----------
yeah okay let's talk about me for a


---------113:09----------
minute what should I say differently all


---------113:12----------
right so so the safe strats sort of like


---------113:15----------
rolling with it like continue rolling


---------113:17----------
with it to you not answering questions


---------113:20----------
repeating questions right yeah yeah yeah


---------113:26----------
it's just you don't answer his questions


---------113:28----------
you just reflect them back like I want


---------113:31----------
you to imagine that like you have 100%


---------113:34----------
damage resistance and anything he sends


---------113:37----------
your way you just bounce right off you


---------113:41----------
send it right back to him okay right


---------113:45----------
it's like and the problem is like when


---------113:47----------
you let something in and then you give


---------113:49----------
something back out you can't have 100%


---------113:51----------
damages this is resistance it's like


---------113:53----------
you're like you know you've ever played


---------113:55----------
an RPG where you have a defend action


---------113:58----------
yeah like we guard yeah and when you


---------114:01----------
guard you can't attack you can't cast a


---------114:03----------
spell when you're guarding the only


---------114:04----------
thing you can do is guard and so the


---------114:06----------
second you start answering his questions


---------114:08----------
you're no longer guarding reflective


---------114:10----------
listening goes away gotcha okay so just


---------114:14----------
guard and keep cockpit and so basically


---------114:17----------
what I do is like I'm a turtle right so


---------114:20----------
like way to do therapy is like you're a


---------114:22----------
turtle or you're an NPC bot that's also


---------114:25----------
a turtle and you show up in you guard


---------114:26----------
with people and then they get really


---------114:29----------
confused and then they explore things on


---------114:31----------
their own if you never say anything in


---------114:33----------
someone's like talking to a blank wall


---------114:34----------
but you're kind of encouraging them to


---------114:36----------
keep talking and then they'll figure


---------114:37----------
things out on on their own basically


---------114:39----------
what I do you want to see a good example


---------114:41----------
of people figuring [ __ ] out on your own


---------114:43----------
go back to the beginning of the stream


---------114:44----------
and then listen to Coco's first


---------114:47----------
interpretation that I even pointed out I


---------114:48----------
was like I didn't


---------114:49----------
give you any that [ __ ] man that all came


---------114:51----------
from you that's what happens when you


---------114:53----------
guard constantly as people start


---------114:55----------
leveling up it's weird yeah good luck


---------114:59----------
yeah all right thank you


---------115:00----------
I'd also be careful about your initial


---------115:02----------
statements because they're very like


---------115:03----------
judgmental and defense provoking yeah


---------115:06----------
yeah yeah like yeah


---------115:08----------
yeah right like so yeah well I mean


---------115:13----------
think about those but I guess I guess


---------115:15----------
I'll repeat them just like sure I'll


---------115:17----------
clarify


---------115:17----------
[Music]


---------115:19----------
yeah repeat them go I don't know I guess


---------115:23----------
like the the like what what makes it


---------115:25----------
judgmental I guess so so repeat what you


---------115:28----------
said originally because I you know hey I


---------115:32----------
feel as if you're you feel like you're


---------115:35----------
dreaming or like you're acting


---------115:36----------
differently around me versus other


---------115:37----------
people I just want to what yeah so I


---------115:41----------
wouldn't use the word why why invokes


---------115:44----------
defensive --mess so I feel like you're


---------115:47----------
treating me differently so I would say


---------115:50----------
and I wouldn't make a comparison to


---------115:53----------
other like what do you mean when you say


---------115:54----------
like when you say you're treating me


---------115:57----------
differently from other people like that


---------115:58----------
smells of [ __ ] like what are you


---------116:00----------
actually talking about like what does he


---------116:04----------
do


---------116:04----------
to other people that he doesn't do to


---------116:06----------
you or vice versa


---------116:07----------
oh god yes like for some reason or like


---------116:11----------
for example like that's gonna set off


---------116:14----------
his [ __ ] meter does that make sense


---------116:16----------
yeah yeah so what does he actually do Oh


---------116:22----------
like it's like hanging out less okay so


---------116:27----------
I would say that right I would say hey


---------116:30----------
man like I feel like we don't hang out


---------116:32----------
as much as we used to and I noticed that


---------116:34----------
you still hang out with like a lot of


---------116:35----------
these other people and I'd like to hang


---------116:37----------
out more don't cloak it in [ __ ]


---------116:41----------
because that's gonna make people


---------116:43----------
defensive tell people what you want and


---------116:45----------
be transparent with that gotcha okay


---------116:51----------
good luck man thank you


---------116:54----------
if it's a sheen no big deal all right


---------116:57----------
we're ready for round two hey man so


---------117:06----------
yeah my question is earlier industry you


---------117:09----------
mentioned that it's okay or it's good to


---------117:13----------
satisfy destructive urges and tendencies


---------117:15----------
in video games like cocoa doesn't rust


---------117:18----------
my question is why is it good and is


---------117:22----------
there something you can learn from what


---------117:23----------
your tendencies are in games destructive


---------117:27----------
tendencies and your tendencies in real


---------117:29----------
life like is there a correlation yeah so


---------117:33----------
first of all I wouldn't say that it's


---------117:34----------
good so that's what I said I would walk


---------117:36----------
that statement back a little bit I think


---------117:39----------
I mean I may have said it's good but I I


---------117:41----------
think what I was doing was wondering so


---------117:44----------
I like I think it can probably serve


---------117:46----------
some purpose to have a healthy outlet


---------117:49----------
for some of your frustrations so let me


---------117:52----------
put it that way but I think that the


---------117:54----------
tricky thing about your question is you


---------117:56----------
know there's a difference between using


---------117:58----------
games as an outlet for your frustrations


---------118:01----------
and using games as a feeding source for


---------118:04----------
your frustrations right like you can use


---------118:08----------
it as a way to like decompress some


---------118:10----------
emotion or you can use it to rile you up


---------118:12----------
emotionally um does it does a sit


---------118:18----------
destructive or toxic behavior not


---------118:20----------
reinforce that behavior in some way in


---------118:22----------
real life absolutely so I think it's


---------118:25----------
like I don't understand it very well


---------118:27----------
myself man to be honest like I don't


---------118:29----------
know but I've just noticed that like


---------118:31----------
sometimes when I'm feeling bad you know


---------118:34----------
it's satisfying to crush a noob on the


---------118:36----------
internet and like sometimes I feel


---------118:39----------
better about that I think you've got to


---------118:40----------
be careful about letting your emotions


---------118:43----------
out in video games which I think can can


---------118:45----------
be healthy and also like there's some


---------118:47----------
kind of balance which I'm not really


---------118:49----------
sure about about like when does that


---------118:50----------
become toxicity right when I make a


---------118:53----------
smurf and all I do on video games is


---------118:55----------
like crushing noobs like that's not


---------118:56----------
healthy but I think occasionally


---------118:58----------
crushing a noob from time to time I want


---------119:02----------
to say that that's healthy because it


---------119:03----------
feels so damn good


---------119:06----------
yeah okay all right so I don't really


---------119:09----------
know I mean I think it's something that


---------119:11----------
we as a healthy gamer community should


---------119:12----------
explore together is it the same thing as


---------119:15----------
the Germantown what's it called


---------119:17----------
schadenfreude or something yeah maybe


---------119:19----------
but I don't know that schadenfreude is


---------119:20----------
healthy to begin with right oh so just


---------119:23----------
something about something about a


---------119:27----------
specifically Coco's case where he's like


---------119:29----------
playing games like rust makes me feel


---------119:31----------
like he has an outlet for some of those


---------119:34----------
frustrations that is less damaging than


---------119:37----------
what he would do in the real world


---------119:38----------
that's just an instinct that I have and


---------119:41----------
I want you guys to understand that like


---------119:43----------
half of what I say is not substantiated


---------119:45----------
by science or even like any kind of


---------119:47----------
expert opinion sometimes what I offer


---------119:49----------
you guys is just instincts and opinions


---------119:51----------
that are just mine so I don't stand


---------119:53----------
behind that statement it's more of a


---------119:54----------
hypothesis that I would love it if you


---------119:56----------
guys could explore that and like try to


---------119:58----------
figure out is there a good limit to it


---------120:00----------
is there an unhealthy limit to it like I


---------120:02----------
don't really know it's something I'm


---------120:04----------
really curious about okay yeah that's


---------120:07----------
thanks a lot man thank you


---------120:09----------
[Music]


---------120:11----------
ready for the next Hey yes please and


---------120:36----------
what am i calling you by the way lily


---------120:48----------
mooie-mooie


---------120:51----------
so Mui so how can you help someone with


---------120:54----------
PTSD so I think that's a tricky question


---------120:57----------
because I think you have to understand


---------120:59----------
like depending on what your role is you


---------121:01----------
can or can't help them alright so the


---------121:05----------
first thing to understand is that


---------121:06----------
someone with PTSD may need treatment and


---------121:08----------
may need like a professional therapist


---------121:10----------
and just because you care about someone


---------121:13----------
or just because you love someone doesn't


---------121:15----------
mean that


---------121:16----------
you can actually provide them with what


---------121:17----------
they need right if someone's having a


---------121:20----------
heart attack and you were to ask the


---------121:21----------
question like how do I help someone with


---------121:23----------
a heart attack it's like you can do


---------121:24----------
chest compressions but what they


---------121:26----------
probably need is like a medical doctor


---------121:28----------
we're hacking you out then find a right


---------121:31----------
way to get that do they want to get that


---------121:35----------
well


---------121:37----------
innocent yes but at the same time


---------121:39----------
they're very scarce you okay so I think


---------121:42----------
you can start by like talking to them


---------121:44----------
about what they're afraid of


---------121:45----------
right so the short answer that I would


---------121:48----------
give you is that you should meet them


---------121:49----------
where they're at so if you have concerns


---------121:52----------
about them start by sharing those


---------121:54----------
concerns and say like hey I noticed that


---------121:56----------
you're suffering a lot because of this


---------121:58----------
and this and I did some reading on WebMD


---------122:01----------
and I'm wondering like have you ever


---------122:03----------
thought about whether you have PTSD you


---------122:05----------
start with like your concerns and like


---------122:08----------
why you think they have PTSD and give


---------122:11----------
them some chance like don't say I think


---------122:13----------
you have PTSD because of XYZ start by


---------122:16----------
saying hey I'm concerned this is what


---------122:18----------
I've noticed and then like give them


---------122:20----------
like does that bother you start with


---------122:22----------
like a super open-ended question so what


---------122:24----------
have you noticed about this person that


---------122:25----------
makes you concerned they have PTSD well


---------122:29----------
when I talked with her she used to live


---------122:32----------
with me here in the frost dome but she


---------122:34----------
got back home so her mom wanted her back


---------122:37----------
and now she lives in a different country


---------122:40----------
so every single time I talk with her she


---------122:44----------
always kind of whispers a little bit


---------122:47----------
she's scared of being too loud or if she


---------122:50----------
hears a little bit of cracking like


---------122:52----------
under floor she stops talking like it's


---------122:55----------
like breathing almost like she just gets


---------122:56----------
quiet completely sigh and and it's like


---------123:00----------
I want to help her admit you know be


---------123:02----------
comfortable and not being scared and so


---------123:04----------
she can feel relaxed because she's a


---------123:07----------
child you know it's sad to see that how


---------123:10----------
old is this person she's white teen


---------123:13----------
yeah so I'd steer clear of the term PTSD


---------123:16----------
okay so like if you're with a


---------123:18----------
fourteen-year-old you also have to


---------123:20----------
remember that like cognitively and


---------123:21----------
emotionally like did you watch the


---------123:22----------
stream with Koko a little bit I was very


---------123:27----------
busy okay


---------123:29----------
that that's okay so I was just gonna say


---------123:30----------
like if you imagine so Coco told us that


---------123:33----------
like him and his mom essentially ran


---------123:35----------
away from their dad at the age of


---------123:36----------
fourteen he and supporting a


---------123:39----------
fourteen-year-old is very different from


---------123:41----------
supporting an adult so everything that I


---------123:43----------
say is about supporting like adults so


---------123:45----------
with a 14 year old I would just start


---------123:48----------
with something really really simple so


---------123:49----------
the way to support them is very


---------123:51----------
different it's just creating a safe


---------123:53----------
space where they can talk to you if they


---------123:55----------
want so I wouldn't mention PTSD or try


---------123:59----------
to get them to do anything the way to


---------124:02----------
support someone or help someone with


---------124:04----------
PTSD is by making them feel safe with


---------124:07----------
you because a lot of times when people


---------124:09----------
deal with trauma like what they feel is


---------124:11----------
very alone and they feel very unsafe


---------124:13----------
that's why she speaks very quietly


---------124:14----------
that's why she doesn't you know it


---------124:17----------
sounds like this person like stops


---------124:18----------
talking when they hear the floorboards


---------124:19----------
creak yeah she did tell me that


---------124:22----------
yesterday when I talk protected she


---------124:24----------
likes talking with me and another guy


---------124:26----------
because they listen to her then I think


---------124:29----------
you're doing great yeah I was just


---------124:32----------
curious on how to help her out of their


---------124:33----------
home and support her because yeah so so


---------124:36----------
I think first of all you're already it


---------124:38----------
sounds like they're supporting her


---------124:39----------
pretty well and I would you know the


---------124:40----------
most I would ask her and maybe you guys


---------124:42----------
can talk about that is sometimes I've


---------124:44----------
noticed that you seem pretty scared like


---------124:47----------
you won't speak up very much


---------124:49----------
or you like speak very softly and then


---------124:52----------
start with something really really


---------124:53----------
simple like what do you think about that


---------124:56----------
or do you feel scared or something who's


---------125:00----------
super super super simple and then give


---------125:03----------
her a chance to talk and if she chooses


---------125:04----------
not to talk that's okay you don't have


---------125:07----------
to get her to talk so this is another


---------125:08----------
thing that I'll share with people a lot


---------125:10----------
of people think that helping people


---------125:11----------
involves getting those people to receive


---------125:14----------
to actually get help but remember that


---------125:17----------
like you know some people can be


---------125:19----------
struggling and it can be enough to know


---------125:21----------
that you care so I have you know I was


---------125:25----------
working with a patient of mine who was


---------125:27----------
trying to get one of her family members


---------125:29----------
into therapy and years later she decided


---------125:33----------
to go into therapy and now years later


---------125:35----------
that person has come back and expressed


---------125:38----------
so much gratitude she's like I know I


---------125:40----------
turned you down every time you told me I


---------125:42----------
the therapist but it actually like


---------125:45----------
really mattered to me that you cared


---------125:47----------
enough to keep mentioning it to me


---------125:49----------
and I know I got frustrated with you and


---------125:52----------
I know that I got angry with you but


---------125:55----------
like it's really nice to know that like


---------125:57----------
you you knew that I was feeling like


---------125:59----------
alone and you tried to help it's kind of


---------126:04----------
like you know if you invite someone over


---------126:05----------
for like you know let's say you have


---------126:07----------
like you're having people over you're


---------126:08----------
having a party and you may have one


---------126:10----------
friend that you invite over all the time


---------126:12----------
and they always say no even though the


---------126:14----------
person doesn't come it can still feel


---------126:16----------
really nice to be invited and be wanted


---------126:19----------
yeah thank you and so a lot of times


---------126:22----------
what happens is when we think about


---------126:23----------
supporting other people we think about


---------126:25----------
whether our support lands in a


---------126:28----------
particular way so you can think like oh


---------126:31----------
this person never comes over I should


---------126:33----------
stop inviting them and instead you


---------126:36----------
shouldn't stop inviting them you should


---------126:38----------
keep on inviting or even just have a


---------126:39----------
conversation with them say hey by the


---------126:41----------
way I've noticed like I've invited you a


---------126:42----------
couple of times and like I know you've


---------126:44----------
been busy or whatever do you want me to


---------126:46----------
keep inviting you and then they're gonna


---------126:49----------
say yes or no and then you just keep


---------126:51----------
doing it but you don't you maybe have


---------127:03----------
like like other than support her like


---------127:05----------
that maybe make the Calgary get out of


---------127:07----------
their innocence yeah I mean I think that


---------127:12----------
has way more detail than I can kind of


---------127:14----------
offer right so the question is what is


---------127:16----------
her situation what is wrong you know


---------127:19----------
what are her resources what are her


---------127:21----------
options so I think you know really like


---------127:24----------
it's like I mean you may be able to do


---------127:26----------
something on all of those fronts but not


---------127:28----------
knowing more about the situation I can't


---------127:30----------
really say what I can say is that


---------127:32----------
supporting even though it doesn't create


---------127:35----------
a whole lot of change can count for a


---------127:36----------
lot like I literally have patients that


---------127:40----------
I see in my office that the reason that


---------127:42----------
they don't care they don't commit


---------127:44----------
suicide is because they have one friend


---------127:46----------
who keeps on inviting them to parties


---------127:48----------
even though they never go like all it


---------127:51----------
takes is one person to care about you


---------127:54----------
for you to like feel like there's hope


---------127:55----------
and


---------127:56----------
that's true that's very true I I know


---------127:59----------
that already that that's what I was I


---------128:01----------
wanna do to her it was this I don't mean


---------128:04----------
on the professional anything and I don't


---------128:06----------
wanna give her any wrong advice I don't


---------128:09----------
want to make her think something there's


---------128:11----------
wrong and I don't I don't want it to get


---------128:13----------
hurt because she is a kid and it's


---------128:15----------
really hard for a kid to go through all


---------128:17----------
that kind of trauma so that is exactly


---------128:19----------
what I would say to her what you just


---------128:22----------
said is like hey like I know that I I


---------128:25----------
can see that your life is hard right now


---------128:27----------
or I'm thinking your life is hard right


---------128:28----------
now and you can even tell someone like


---------128:30----------
one of the nicest things that you can


---------128:32----------
ever say to someone is I want to help


---------128:35----------
you and I don't know how like see we get


---------128:38----------
so concerned about how to help people


---------128:40----------
you're like how do I support her


---------128:41----------
supporting people is not about the house


---------128:44----------
it's about wanting to in the first place


---------128:49----------
that make sense I guess yeah it's


---------128:51----------
bizarre you know just having her know


---------128:55----------
that you're there and you want to


---------128:57----------
support her and then she'll guide you


---------128:59----------
right if you say I want to help you and


---------129:02----------
I don't know how she'll say actually


---------129:04----------
this is enough like it's just nice to


---------129:06----------
have someone to talk to


---------129:07----------
she's probably gonna say something like


---------129:08----------
that cuz she's 14 and she's not gonna


---------129:10----------
understand her own feelings thank you


---------129:13----------
and so then if she says it's nice to


---------129:14----------
have someone to talk to


---------129:15----------
then you know that your duty is to be


---------129:17----------
that person for her to talk to don't


---------129:19----------
guide her just be a space that she can


---------129:21----------
come to and feel safe okay and then when


---------129:24----------
she's ready to make a change she'll let


---------129:26----------
you know sorry I keep talking over you


---------129:28----------
it's like anyway I can't thank you I'm


---------129:31----------
sorry she just always let her like if


---------129:34----------
she like she always says that when she


---------129:36----------
like she wanted to tell me about


---------129:37----------
something to happen with her mom or


---------129:39----------
something she did to herself she want me


---------129:42----------
to read something part of her diary


---------129:43----------
where she's like talking bleep


---------129:45----------
specifically about really scary details


---------129:48----------
about what you want to do and and I was


---------129:50----------
just curious what do I do if that


---------129:52----------
information she just listen to it should


---------129:54----------
I call something what should I do with


---------129:57----------
that I mean if you're concerned for her


---------129:59----------
actual like life or safety you can


---------130:01----------
definitely call someone like that's


---------130:03----------
something you should do I'll you know


---------130:05----------
like if you're concerned for her like in


---------130:07----------
a physical sense like if


---------130:10----------
it's like you know if there isn't like


---------130:12----------
an imminent threat


---------130:13----------
you can always encourage her I mean I


---------130:16----------
would in any way I would encourage her


---------130:17----------
to speak to a professional


---------130:19----------
so she's hopefully yes so you can even


---------130:22----------
start with someone that she knows so


---------130:23----------
instead of telling her to see a


---------130:25----------
therapist you can tell her like to talk


---------130:26----------
to her pediatrician yeah I wanted her to


---------130:30----------
do that but the thing is her mom keeps


---------130:33----------
coming into picture up if she calls her


---------130:35----------
crazy if you want to do that and then


---------130:37----------
she gets she goes I mean she's gonna see


---------130:39----------
her pediatrician at some point anyway


---------130:41----------
right no okay


---------130:47----------
yeah so I think a lot of these like come


---------130:49----------
down to the detail of the situation I


---------130:51----------
think the takeaway though is that it


---------130:53----------
sounds like you're actually doing a


---------130:54----------
pretty good job of supporting her and


---------130:56----------
then maybe try to like just continue to


---------130:58----------
talk to her and give her a space for her


---------131:00----------
to listen for you to listen and for her


---------131:02----------
to speak and then you can make


---------131:04----------
suggestions at some point if they feel


---------131:06----------
like good suggestions to you and you can


---------131:07----------
asked what she thinks about those sounds


---------131:11----------
like you're doing an awesome service to


---------131:12----------
this person thank you feel safe and grab


---------131:17----------
with my knowledge I love it yeah I mean


---------131:20----------
I don't know if you can give her a


---------131:21----------
normal childhood unless you want no I


---------131:22----------
can't but I want to try yeah good so do


---------131:25----------
what you can and good luck to you and


---------131:28----------
