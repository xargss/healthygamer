---------00:00----------
I think one concept since we have new


---------00:02----------
people so I'm gonna start talking a


---------00:03----------
little bit about the ego so feral cat


---------00:06----------
was talking a lot about this and I think


---------00:09----------
it was sort of tricky because gamers


---------00:11----------
have a really tricky relationship with


---------00:12----------
ego so I'd like to explain a little bit


---------00:17----------
about


---------00:20----------
Oh sort of my understanding of ego and


---------00:22----------
I'm gonna use some Sun script phrases so


---------00:26----------
apologies if this gets a little bit hard


---------00:28----------
to access


---------00:29----------
so in sanskrit the ego is something


---------00:33----------
called the Omkar so a hum car is really


---------00:35----------
more closely translated as the


---------00:37----------
eye-feeling


---------00:38----------
so it's sort of when I think about Who I


---------00:40----------
am I think of the that's a hum gar so I


---------00:44----------
can describe myself as a man I can


---------00:46----------
describe myself as Indian I can describe


---------00:47----------
myself is is a physician I can describe


---------00:50----------
myself as faculty at Harvard Medical


---------00:52----------
School I can describe myself as a


---------00:54----------
husband as a parent so those are all


---------00:58----------
things that are my ahum card that's not


---------00:59----------
really who I know it's not the true self


---------01:03----------
it's actually the false self so when I


---------01:06----------
but the the problem is that we tend to


---------01:08----------
think that this is who we are so we I


---------01:12----------
think about a hum car is anything that


---------01:14----------
you can put on a resume right I can read


---------01:16----------
a resume that tells me like kind of who


---------01:19----------
you like they tells me about you but the


---------01:21----------
resume doesn't actually tell me who you


---------01:23----------
are and so a hunk are we it's tricky


---------01:27----------
because when we think about things like


---------01:28----------
so feral cat was talking about how for a


---------01:30----------
while she was very concerned about you


---------01:33----------
know the the streamer count I started


---------01:35----------
the viewer count on her stream so when


---------01:37----------
she started streaming she just streamed


---------01:38----------
for fun but at some point her identity


---------01:42----------
her ego got caught up in who she is like


---------01:48----------
sorry who's on the viewer account so


---------01:51----------
like her value as a human being started


---------01:53----------
to get tied into how many subs she has


---------01:56----------
how many viewers she has so that's all


---------01:58----------
ego so the tricky thing is that a lot of


---------02:02----------
gamers have trouble with ego because the


---------02:05----------
ego of the Omkar arises as a protective


---------02:08----------
mechanism so I'm gonna give you guys an


---------02:10----------
example so let's say that I'm let's say


---------02:14----------
that like my first job like I was


---------02:15----------
serving ice cream and so I worked at


---------02:18----------
like an ice cream shop and there was a


---------02:20----------
that let's say that there's a there's a


---------02:21----------
cute girl who's like I'm 16 years old


---------02:23----------
you know I'm working at the ice cream


---------02:25----------
shop I have a co-worker who's 16 and


---------02:26----------
she's cute too and I get up the courage


---------02:30----------
to ask her out and she says No


---------02:33----------
and then a weird thought goes through my


---------02:36----------
head I'm like talking to my friends


---------02:38----------
about it afterward and I'm like oh yeah


---------02:39----------
like you know I really wasn't that into


---------02:41----------
her anyway like she's not even that


---------02:42----------
attractive you know I just thought you


---------02:44----------
know it's like it's really like I'm


---------02:45----------
really not that into her does that make


---------02:48----------
sense to you guys is that like can you


---------02:49----------
guys see how someone would think that


---------02:51----------
but the funny thing is that that's like


---------02:53----------
completely false right like if I wasn't


---------02:54----------
into her and I didn't find her


---------02:55----------
attractive I wouldn't have asked her out


---------02:57----------
in the first place so like what's going


---------02:59----------
on in your mind there what's going on is


---------03:02----------
the hum car is activating so let's think


---------03:05----------
through what's actually going on in that


---------03:06----------
person's head so when I ask someone out


---------03:08----------
and they say no I feel some kind of


---------03:11----------
negative emotion right I feel shame I


---------03:13----------
feel like oh man like I feel shame and


---------03:15----------
like I start to have these really really


---------03:16----------
scary thoughts and the scary thoughts


---------03:20----------
that I have like I don't really


---------03:21----------
consciously think these but they're like


---------03:22----------
really buried beneath the surface I I


---------03:24----------
start to think like is anyone ever gonna


---------03:26----------
say yes cuz like you're 16 and you don't


---------03:28----------
have confidence and you start to feel


---------03:30----------
shame and stuff like that but you bury


---------03:32----------
it real deep you express a little bit of


---------03:33----------
frustration you're like aw man like


---------03:35----------
that's that's annoying


---------03:38----------
and then what happens is the hum car


---------03:39----------
steps in because I want you guys to


---------03:41----------
understand your ego is actually a


---------03:42----------
protective mechanism it's like the


---------03:44----------
bouncer for your mind and anytime you


---------03:47----------
feel negative emotion the ego is gonna


---------03:48----------
step in and it's gonna try to protect


---------03:50----------
you


---------03:50----------
so my ego steps in that says hey man


---------03:52----------
like you didn't really like her that


---------03:54----------
much did you like she's not even that


---------03:55----------
attractive like you nothing to worry


---------03:57----------
about you don't have to feel shame you


---------03:58----------
don't have to feel any of those negative


---------03:59----------
things because you're not really that


---------04:00----------
into her so then what happens is like


---------04:04----------
your ego activates so ego is a very


---------04:07----------
protective mechanism and then the other


---------04:08----------
thing that the ego does is it starts to


---------04:10----------
like it builds up your identity right it


---------04:12----------
builds up all these false things about


---------04:13----------
you it's like oh man you're awesome like


---------04:14----------
your friends really like you


---------04:18----------
yeah so nice guys is a classic that's


---------04:20----------
beautiful so nice guys is all a hunk are


---------04:22----------
right these people have this image of


---------04:25----------
themselves and the image of themself is


---------04:29----------
like like has this sort of positive


---------04:32----------
shell for like a lot of negativity


---------04:34----------
underneath which is exactly how the


---------04:36----------
Omkar works because the hum car doesn't


---------04:38----------
need to be around unless you're


---------04:40----------
experiencing negative emotion so yeah if


---------04:46----------
you guys want to talk about nice guys we


---------04:48----------
can do that and but anyway yeah


---------04:52----------
[Music]


---------05:02----------
hmm the masks we wear is that a man to


---------05:07----------
be accepted in certain situations is


---------05:09----------
that a manifestation of ego I'd say yes


---------05:12----------
so I'd say so let's remember that


---------05:15----------
acceptance let's just think about that


---------05:17----------
question so what he's asking is


---------05:19----------
acceptance is valuing another person's


---------05:23----------
opinion so if you were bending yourself


---------05:26----------
over backwards for another person's


---------05:29----------
opinion chances are your ego is involved


---------05:31----------
another thing that we talked a lot about


---------05:33----------
with feral cat was like this sense of


---------05:35----------
authenticity she was stumbling through


---------05:37----------
this phase where she started streaming


---------05:39----------
and did it because she thought it was


---------05:41----------
fun and then what happened is like


---------05:43----------
something magical happened in her head


---------05:45----------
and what happened in her head is she


---------05:48----------
started like not having fun streaming


---------05:50----------
but felt like tied to doing it like when


---------05:53----------
I was listening to her it almost sounded


---------05:54----------
like she was like chained to a ball and


---------05:56----------
like the ball was like someone tossed


---------05:58----------
the ball in the water and she's like


---------06:00----------
struggling to swim and she started


---------06:02----------
getting like caught up in like


---------06:03----------
viewership and partnerships and subs and


---------06:05----------
all that good stuff


---------06:06----------
and so she started putting on a mask for


---------06:09----------
other people like for their approval and


---------06:10----------
that's absolutely what the ego is


---------06:12----------
because then her identity becomes as a


---------06:15----------
successful or unsuccessful streamer


---------06:17----------
right that's how she and then her value


---------06:20----------
of herself as a human being is


---------06:22----------
determined by the number of viewers she


---------06:24----------
has so that's that's exactly how ego


---------06:28----------
works and so the tricky thing is that


---------06:30----------
like how do you get around that you


---------06:31----------
start just like living for the sake of


---------06:33----------
like doing what you're doing right you


---------06:34----------
don't worry about what other people are


---------06:35----------
thinking that's difficult but you start


---------06:38----------
sort of living in kind of like living in


---------06:41----------
the moment because the other thing about


---------06:42----------
the ego in opinions is they're all sort


---------06:45----------
of future oriented so if you think about


---------06:47----------
like you're trying to win someone over


---------06:49----------
you're not trying to win them over in


---------06:50----------
the present you're trying to win them


---------06:51----------
over in the future like if I go to a


---------06:54----------
party and I put on a mask like why am i


---------06:56----------
putting on the mask it's because I want


---------06:59----------
to be invited to the next one


---------07:02----------
so the tricky thing is that as long as


---------07:04----------
you're thinking about the future you're


---------07:06----------
gonna be like wrapped up in all this


---------07:08----------
crap one really simple way to move away


---------07:12----------
from ego is to like live in the present


---------07:14----------
so if I think about my resume like my


---------07:17----------
resume is like all about the past and I


---------07:20----------
think about expectations in the future


---------07:22----------
but if I want to step away from ego like


---------07:24----------
look at a sunset right like watch a


---------07:27----------
sunset or actually this is a really good


---------07:29----------
one you guys want an interesting


---------07:30----------
meditative exercise ask yourself the


---------07:33----------
next time you take a dump ask yourself


---------07:35----------
who's taking the dump


---------07:38----------
right like are you a man or a woman like


---------07:40----------
are you a student or you do you have a


---------07:43----------
net worth when you're taking a dump like


---------07:45----------
does any of that even matter nope you're


---------07:48----------
just someone taking a dump when I'm


---------07:50----------
taking a dump I'm no different from


---------07:51----------
anyone else like it doesn't matter that


---------07:52----------
I'm a doctor or not it doesn't matter


---------07:54----------
that I'm a man it doesn't matter that


---------07:55----------
I'm a parent I'm just a guy take exactly


---------07:57----------
you're just a human and the truth is


---------08:00----------
that anytime you do something in the


---------08:02----------
present that's all you are when you're


---------08:03----------
looking at a sunset it doesn't matter


---------08:05----------
who's looking at the sunset


---------08:06----------
once again you're not a man or a woman


---------08:08----------
you're just someone who's looking at the


---------08:09----------
sunset


---------08:13----------
yeah I mean you got to watch out


---------08:14----------
constipation is a dangerous thing you


---------08:16----------
guys you know you're joking about that


---------08:18----------
but like you guys ever heard of a manual


---------08:20----------
disimpaction you guys know what that is


---------08:22----------
not funny dude


---------08:23----------
seriously like I've worked with people


---------08:25----------
who are suicidal from not being able to


---------08:27----------
take it dumb like it's bad yeah it's


---------08:31----------
like so I was working with this woman


---------08:33----------
who was like 70 something and had like


---------08:35----------
cancer like stage four cancer and one


---------08:38----------
day I asked her like what's the worst


---------08:40----------
part of your life and she's like it's


---------08:41----------
the constipation like she was on pain


---------08:44----------
medications and it's just like it's the


---------08:45----------
worst feeling like it's just awful


---------08:48----------
but it looked like we had another


---------08:50----------
question okay


---------08:59----------
it can be right so the question is how


---------09:01----------
do you view it right it so I'd put it


---------09:05----------
another way like so is your job your ego


---------09:07----------
for some people the answer is absolutely


---------09:08----------
yes and for some people the answers


---------09:10----------
absolutely no so for some people their


---------09:13----------
job is just a job and for some people


---------09:15----------
it's their identity so I work with a lot


---------09:18----------
of like executives like like CEOs and


---------09:21----------
things like that and for a lot of these


---------09:22----------
people it's like it's really tough like


---------09:24----------
I'm working with someone right now who


---------09:25----------
recently kind of got into a problem with


---------09:31----------
like board members and and other people


---------09:33----------
in this company so he's out and and this


---------09:36----------
is a company that he had been a huge


---------09:38----------
part of had built like from tiny to big


---------09:41----------
and so like that's who he was because


---------09:44----------
like that's what he did like that his


---------09:47----------
his entire he had sacrificed so much of


---------09:49----------
his life like all of his best years of


---------09:51----------
his life to become this thing in this


---------09:54----------
company and then someone took it away


---------09:55----------
from him and when they took it away from


---------09:57----------
him like who is he then he's like he


---------09:59----------
feels like a no one and so we're working


---------10:02----------
to start to discover okay like who are


---------10:04----------
you really


---------10:04----------
I think the beautiful thing about his


---------10:07----------
Karma his Karma is that he's given he's


---------10:10----------
been given like an amazing opportunity


---------10:13----------
to discover who he is because if he had


---------10:15----------
not left that company he would just be a


---------10:18----------
bored of that train and would be


---------10:19----------
chugging along and then like ten years


---------10:21----------
later he would have a midlife crisis


---------10:24----------
and that's what yeah so like all these


---------10:26----------
crises that people experience it's


---------10:27----------
because you build up this identity of


---------10:29----------
who you are and then if something


---------10:32----------
attacks that external thing you as a


---------10:34----------
human being your identity gets attacked


---------10:36----------
but if all I am is a dude who's taking a


---------10:39----------
dump like no one can take that away from


---------10:42----------
me well I mean I guess you could be


---------10:43----------
constipated but like I'm watching a


---------10:45----------
sunset if I'm just like if I'm existing


---------10:47----------
in the moment and I'm just doing what


---------10:49----------
I'm doing like even if it's playing a


---------10:50----------
video game or like eating a piece of


---------10:51----------
food or studying for a test in that


---------10:54----------
moment if all I'm doing is that thing


---------10:56----------
and I don't care about Who I am then


---------10:59----------
it's not ego so right now I'm streaming


---------11:02----------
and so is this a part of my identity


---------11:05----------
like not really I'm just like I just get


---------11:07----------
up here and like basically what I do in


---------11:09----------
my life is I talk at people so sometimes


---------11:13----------
you know I'm a therapist and so like


---------11:15----------
someone comes to my to office and like I


---------11:17----------
talk at them slash to them sometimes I


---------11:20----------
run a workshop or I give lectures and so


---------11:23----------
I just like I show up and I just sort of


---------11:24----------
say things now you know is this a part


---------11:28----------
of my ego not yet but if I'm not careful


---------11:30----------
the same thing is gonna happen to me


---------11:32----------
right so right now I see that I have 45


---------11:35----------
viewers if I'm not I'm not you know if


---------11:39----------
I'm not careful like that number is


---------11:41----------
gonna start meaning something to me


---------11:42----------
because I'm not any better or worse than


---------11:44----------
feral cat or anyone else who streams


---------11:47----------
there are parts of my brain that value


---------11:50----------
that thing because that's the way my


---------11:52----------
brain is wired there are parts of our


---------11:54----------
brain that developed when we're in


---------11:56----------
puberty that start to like really care


---------11:59----------
about the opinions of others and the


---------12:01----------
reason that happens in puberty so if you


---------12:04----------
think about like why high school is such


---------12:05----------
a tough time there's a really


---------12:06----------
fascinating cognitive thing that happens


---------12:08----------
in high school which is that your brain


---------12:11----------
develops the capacity to understand that


---------12:13----------
people have sustained nuanced opinions


---------12:17----------
of yourself so like if you talk to a


---------12:20----------
nine year old they have this idea that


---------12:24----------
you know someone likes me or doesn't


---------12:26----------
like me when you're 15 you start to


---------12:28----------
realize that people have sustained


---------12:30----------
opinions about you that are like


---------12:32----------
complicated


---------12:34----------
and why does that happen in in high


---------12:36----------
school it's because like when as we


---------12:38----------
start to develop like as we go through


---------12:40----------
puberty we prepared a mate and a big


---------12:42----------
part of mating is actually like social


---------12:44----------
circuitry and our standing within a


---------12:46----------
society so those are linked like the


---------12:48----------
developmental kind of the development of


---------12:50----------
ego and that happens when you're a


---------12:52----------
teenager and sexual development are


---------12:54----------
linked in those parts of my brain are


---------12:56----------
active too so as is streamers start to


---------13:00----------
like as they start to develop a value of


---------13:02----------
themselves as a human being based on the


---------13:05----------
amount of like viewers they have that's


---------13:07----------
absolutely ego the other thing though is


---------13:10----------
that there may be strong some streamers


---------13:12----------
out there I don't really know who


---------13:14----------
understand that they have inherent value


---------13:16----------
as a person and so they don't need to


---------13:18----------
get that value from the external world


---------13:20----------
right and if we circle but once once


---------13:23----------
again back to feral cat we were talking


---------13:25----------
about her how her mom her mom cares what


---------13:28----------
other people think and a lot of the


---------13:29----------
grief that happens between feral cat and


---------13:31----------
her mom is because feral cat is


---------13:33----------
concerned about how I mean sorry feral


---------13:35----------
cats mom is concerned about how things


---------13:36----------
are going to look right so if there are


---------13:40----------
people who are concerned about how


---------13:41----------
things are gonna look that's all ego so


---------13:44----------
you can stream and you can sort of live


---------13:47----------
your life and you can try to make a good


---------13:48----------
product I mean I'm sure there's a lot of


---------13:50----------
you know calculation that goes into


---------13:52----------
successful stream in terms of like


---------13:53----------
timing and advertising and like widgets


---------13:56----------
and things like that but it doesn't have


---------13:59----------
to be ego but I would guess for most of


---------14:01----------
the people it is and the main reason for


---------14:03----------
that is because most streamers are young


---------14:05----------
right so most people like you know they


---------14:07----------
find themselves like in their 40s or


---------14:09----------
they have a midlife crisis if they


---------14:11----------
haven't found themselves but it takes


---------14:13----------
time to develop confidence in who you


---------14:15----------
are as a person and I think that if you


---------14:18----------
start streaming early you really have to


---------14:20----------
be careful about you have to start doing


---------14:21----------
additional things to help yourself


---------14:24----------
develop a healthy identity for yourself


---------14:26----------
that's sort of separate from your ego if


---------14:30----------
you guys are curious we can talk about


---------14:31----------
that


---------14:38----------
Oh


---------14:41----------
not really it's a little bit tricky to


---------14:43----------
this experience of ADHD


---------14:51----------
rejection manifestation is for


---------14:55----------
so I don't know what that is is a


---------14:57----------
clinical term but I have a lot of


---------15:00----------
experience with ADHD


---------15:06----------
Payne Emily you will perceive negative


---------15:12----------
situation in situation yeah so that I


---------15:17----------
understand so but yeah so I mean it sort


---------15:21----------
of makes sense to me so let's so let's


---------15:25----------
talk a little bit about ADHD in


---------15:27----------
rejection sensitivity dysphoria so


---------15:30----------
rejection sensitivity dysphoria I mean


---------15:33----------
I'm not familiar with it sort of in a


---------15:35----------
clinical technical term but it you know


---------15:36----------
I understand the psychology behind it


---------15:38----------
like is essentially you know when


---------15:41----------
someone perceives a lot of negative


---------15:44----------
things and suffers a lot from either


---------15:47----------
rejections or perceived rejections so I


---------15:51----------
think this has to do a lot with


---------15:55----------
yeah so so I mean it makes a lot of


---------15:57----------
sense to me too I wasn't sure if there


---------15:58----------
was like a particular definition of it


---------16:00----------
that I was unfamiliar with so this makes


---------16:02----------
a lot of sense to me so I think this


---------16:04----------
goes back to some ideas behind like


---------16:06----------
cognitive bias and actually senses of


---------16:08----------
identity so when we approach like this


---------16:10----------
kind of mental stuff I actually think


---------16:12----------
Eastern perspectives are better than


---------16:14----------
Western perspectives so sometimes what


---------16:16----------
happens is human beings have this really


---------16:18----------
crazy thing where they're like if they


---------16:20----------
believe something about themselves they


---------16:24----------
have this kind of cognitive bias to sort


---------16:27----------
of like prove it to be true so for


---------16:30----------
example I'll give you guys just an


---------16:33----------
example of someone that I used to work


---------16:34----------
with was afraid that their partner was


---------16:38----------
gonna break up with them they were like


---------16:39----------
terrified that their partner was gonna


---------16:40----------
break up with them and so they would


---------16:42----------
actually like do things to like push


---------16:44----------
their partner to break up with them and


---------16:45----------
they would like drive their partner


---------16:47----------
crazy and and it was kind of weird but


---------16:49----------
they'd say like oh absolutely I


---------16:51----------
self-fulfilling prophecies they're like


---------16:52----------
bit like you know the person would come


---------16:54----------
home and then be like yeah you're gonna


---------16:55----------
break up with me aren't you and then


---------16:57----------
like if you're the partner in that


---------16:58----------
situation like what are you gonna say


---------16:59----------
you're like no I'm I'm not gonna break


---------17:02----------
up with you but then the person is like


---------17:04----------
no I like your you're gonna you're gonna


---------17:06----------
break up with me like I just I know it


---------17:07----------
like I'm gonna do something and like and


---------17:09----------
then the partner gets frustrated and so


---------17:11----------
then this person like then sees the


---------17:13----------
frustration and then they start to think


---------17:15----------
it's true they're like oh it's happening


---------17:17----------
right now right you're mad at me now and


---------17:19----------
now you're gonna break up with me


---------17:21----------
because now you're mad and then the the


---------17:23----------
the more like I insist that this person


---------17:26----------
is going to break up with me the more


---------17:28----------
frustrated that they get and the more


---------17:30----------
that like I feel like this is actually


---------17:31----------
happening and so it becomes kind of a


---------17:34----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------17:35----------
and so this is a problem because the


---------17:37----------
mind has this bias for like the kind of


---------17:40----------
information that it interprets


---------17:44----------
and so when it comes to rejection


---------17:46----------
sensitivity this is a problem


---------17:49----------
essentially of confidence so there's a


---------17:51----------
weird thing that happens to their ahum


---------17:53----------
car where they believe that they are


---------17:55----------
like not like worthwhile human beings


---------17:58----------
and so what happens is that there's a


---------18:01----------
there's actually like there's there


---------18:02----------
studies that should sort of show this


---------18:03----------
negative cognitive bias like Studies on


---------18:06----------
depression where if you know if I have a


---------18:10----------
low opinion of myself and then like I


---------18:13----------
walk into let's say I enter a


---------18:15----------
conversation where I get 50% compliments


---------18:17----------
and 50% insults like what's gonna happen


---------18:22----------
is I'm gonna prioritize


---------18:23----------
the insults over the compliments and the


---------18:25----------
other crazy thing that happens is if you


---------18:27----------
really have low self-confidence what do


---------18:29----------
you think happens when someone


---------18:30----------
compliments you what do you say in


---------18:31----------
response


---------18:39----------
you


---------18:43----------
absolutely right


---------18:47----------
you you don't you don't accept it yeah


---------18:51----------
so now now just think about that for a


---------18:53----------
second right like so imagine that you


---------18:55----------
have a brain that is being presented


---------18:58----------
with positive data but then you just


---------19:00----------
discount the data right like you just


---------19:03----------
throw it out and then what happens isn't


---------19:06----------
when there's negative data like that


---------19:07----------
we're gonna accept like that's a


---------19:08----------
legitimate that's a legitimate judgment


---------19:11----------
do you think I'm a [ __ ] I can get


---------19:13----------
behind that


---------19:13----------
but if you think I'm a good person no no


---------19:16----------
no you're wrong right and so then what


---------19:19----------
happens is it reinforces your settle


---------19:23----------
your lack of confidence because all of


---------19:25----------
the positive information that you're


---------19:27----------
receiving actually gets thrown out the


---------19:29----------
window


---------19:31----------
and then then what happens is like it


---------19:34----------
only reinforces it so then you kind of


---------19:36----------
get into this vicious cycle that you


---------19:38----------
kind of can't get out of because if


---------19:40----------
people are trying to help you if they're


---------19:41----------
trying to reassure you like let's say


---------19:43----------
once again you know I'm convinced that


---------19:44----------
my partner is gonna break up with me my


---------19:46----------
partner can be doing everything that


---------19:48----------
they can to reassure me and it's just


---------19:49----------
not sinking it and so the reason for


---------19:52----------
that is because the lack of self


---------19:54----------
confidence actually comes from somewhere


---------19:56----------
else and so that needs to be addressed


---------19:58----------
with directly and once you start to


---------20:01----------
address it directly then you can start


---------20:03----------
to conquer rejection sensitivity


---------20:04----------
syndrome


---------20:06----------
because rejection sensitivity syndrome


---------20:08----------
has nothing to do with being rejected it


---------20:10----------
actually has everything to do with your


---------20:12----------
belief that the only thing that's


---------20:14----------
appropriate is rejection you just won't


---------20:19----------
accept anything else so you have to


---------20:22----------
learn how to like develop confidence in


---------20:24----------
yourself as a person


---------20:26----------
and then like move from there so I think


---------20:29----------
we have other questions and comments so


---------20:31----------
let me just think for a second


---------20:34----------
another question yeah what this is


---------20:39----------
what if you feel like you were very


---------20:40----------
confident you still handle compliments


---------20:45----------
yeah then then you're not a confident


---------20:47----------
person right so that meant that's where


---------20:51----------
you feel like you're confident but it's


---------20:53----------
like let's just think about it so sorry


---------20:55----------
the question was you know what if what


---------20:57----------
if you're a confident what if you feel


---------20:59----------
like you're a confident person but you


---------21:00----------
handle compliments and insults the same


---------21:02----------
way and I'm assuming the same way means


---------21:03----------
that you knock down


---------21:06----------
compliments and you accept insults then


---------21:09----------
I'd say that in your core of self you're


---------21:11----------
not confident because if you were truly


---------21:13----------
confident in yourself you could be


---------21:15----------
unbiased with the way that you receive


---------21:16----------
things and so you may have an impression


---------21:20----------
of being confident or that you may be


---------21:22----------
confident in some areas because


---------21:24----------
confidence is not like a monolith right


---------21:26----------
it's not like one quality you can be


---------21:28----------
confident in your appearance versus in


---------21:33----------
your ability to like play dota or


---------21:35----------
overwatch or Fortnight versus your


---------21:38----------
ability to like be financially


---------21:40----------
independent so confidence has a lot of


---------21:43----------
different dimensions what I guess is


---------21:45----------
that either you have learned how to act


---------21:47----------
confident in a particular way or that


---------21:50----------
you're confident in a particular


---------21:51----------
environment but that there's a


---------21:53----------
particular some part of you that doesn't


---------21:54----------
feel confident in who you are and so you


---------21:58----------
just have to tunnel down and try to


---------21:59----------
figure out okay what is it that I'm


---------22:01----------
confident in myself about and like why


---------22:03----------
is it that I can't accept a compliment


---------22:04----------
like what about that feels wrong to me


---------22:07----------
when someone you know looks at me and


---------22:09----------
says like oh yeah like you know you're a


---------22:12----------
very attractive person like what why do


---------22:13----------
I feel like I'm not attractive you know


---------22:15----------
why can't I sit with what they're saying


---------22:17----------
and just accept it for what it is where


---------22:20----------
did I get the idea that I am NOT the way


---------22:22----------
that this person is thinking I am


---------22:26----------
Oh God so body dysmorphia for


---------22:30----------
bodybuilders is one of the most


---------22:32----------
difficult things to treat in psychiatry


---------22:35----------
so I don't know if this really answers


---------22:39----------
your question but so when we talk about


---------22:42----------
generally speaking like psychiatric


---------22:44----------
illness and I even then I mean I don't


---------22:47----------
really like the idea of psychiatric


---------22:48----------
illness because it's based on like a


---------22:50----------
Western medical model like by medical I


---------22:53----------
mean like physical medicine so


---------22:55----------
psychiatry followed along with like


---------22:57----------
cancer and disease in other ways but it


---------23:00----------
our minds aren't like that you know like


---------23:01----------
a heart attack is like a very real thing


---------23:04----------
whereas body dysmorphia is like sort of


---------23:06----------
a it's a description that we have for


---------23:08----------
someone's mind it's not necessarily like


---------23:10----------
an illness we call it an illness because


---------23:12----------
it causes people suffering but but


---------23:15----------
here's the the big thing to understand


---------23:17----------
about body dysmorphia and we're trying


---------23:19----------
to help people with psychological stuff


---------23:22----------
the first question is whether something


---------23:24----------
is ego-syntonic or ego-dystonic and this


---------23:26----------
is a different ego from what I was


---------23:27----------
talking about earlier this is like a


---------23:28----------
clinical term so ego-syntonic is


---------23:31----------
something that people like agree with


---------23:34----------
internally and ego-dystonic is something


---------23:37----------
that people like disagree with


---------23:38----------
internally so I'll give you guys an


---------23:40----------
example so a lot of people say that


---------23:43----------
their OCD because they like to keep


---------23:45----------
things clean that's very ego-syntonic


---------23:47----------
like they want things clean and if you


---------23:50----------
try to tell them to relax they're going


---------23:52----------
to fight you against it right versus


---------23:55----------
something that like true OCD is when


---------23:57----------
people recognize that they should stop


---------23:59----------
washing their hands after they've done


---------24:01----------
it for the ninth time in a row with


---------24:03----------
blistering hot water and excessive


---------24:05----------
amounts of bleach but they literally


---------24:07----------
cannot stop because they have a


---------24:09----------
compulsion that is so strong like their


---------24:11----------
hands are wrapped in bandages and they


---------24:13----------
take off the bandages and they'd like


---------24:14----------
mix soap with bleach and they rub them


---------24:16----------
because they feel unclean that is true


---------24:18----------
ego that that is oh that is true OCD and


---------24:22----------
that is very ego-dystonic the person is


---------24:24----------
doing it but they know that they don't


---------24:25----------
want to do it and they don't feel good


---------24:27----------
doing it versus someone who's a neat


---------24:29----------
freak is ego-syntonic which means they


---------24:32----------
don't think there's anything wrong with


---------24:33----------
their with what they're doing they're


---------24:34----------
convinced that what they're doing is the


---------24:36----------
right way to do it


---------24:38----------
so the tricky thing about body


---------24:40----------
dysmorphia


---------24:41----------
so there are two kinds of like people


---------24:43----------
who come in with like problems about


---------24:45----------
their appearance you know some people


---------24:47----------
like recognize that it's a problem and


---------24:49----------
they say like okay you know I know I'm


---------24:52----------
not like I feel unconfident in my


---------24:54----------
appearance but like I'm trying to work


---------24:55----------
on that and I don't want to feel that


---------24:57----------
way anymore the problem with the body


---------24:59----------
builders I've worked with is that they


---------25:01----------
don't start there they don't think they


---------25:03----------
have a problem at all they're just


---------25:05----------
convinced that it's factually true that


---------25:07----------
their body does not look good enough


---------25:09----------
it's not an issue in their psychology


---------25:11----------
they don't want to change they just


---------25:13----------
think it's like I just don't look good


---------25:15----------
enough and I need to train harder so


---------25:17----------
that I can look better and despite being


---------25:19----------
in the top one percentile of the


---------25:20----------
population in terms of like body fat or


---------25:23----------
like musculature or how much they can


---------25:25----------
benchpress they're just not unsatisfied


---------25:27----------
because their beliefs are actually


---------25:29----------
really ego-syntonic they don't see a


---------25:30----------
problem with what what's going on so I


---------25:36----------
mean I think I think it's tricky because


---------25:38----------
how do you convince someone so that then


---------25:40----------
we kind of get into denial right so like


---------25:42----------
how do you convince someone that they


---------25:43----------
have a problem that's a whole different


---------25:45----------
can of worms which is tricky


---------25:51----------
sure um could you comment on the wordage


---------25:54----------
of easy you're currently take talking


---------25:56----------
about confidence and I think part of it


---------25:58----------
is the concept of easy in instruction


---------26:00----------
and teaching I will often hear how are


---------26:02----------
you not confident in your abilities it's


---------26:04----------
easy I really dislike the concept of


---------26:05----------
easy so do I so I think that's stupid to


---------26:08----------
be honest so I mean know so I'm


---------26:11----------
confident right like you guys probably


---------26:13----------
get that impression but nowhere along


---------26:15----------
the way did I say that this was easy


---------26:16----------
like sure I you know I'm confident in


---------26:20----------
myself and I think you guys can be


---------26:21----------
successful if you're struggling but


---------26:24----------
nowhere to do I think it's easy I think


---------26:25----------
calling something easy is one of the the


---------26:27----------
most devaluing things that you can do


---------26:30----------
because let's just think about that for


---------26:32----------
a second if you say that how are you not


---------26:36----------
confident in your abilities it's easy


---------26:37----------
like if you think about it what you're


---------26:38----------
telling the person is that they're


---------26:39----------
incompetent right because you're like


---------26:41----------
how can you not do this it's so [ __ ]


---------26:43----------
easy like you're it the easier it is so


---------26:46----------
if something is super super easy and


---------26:47----------
they're not doing it that means that


---------26:49----------
they're super super idiotic right so I


---------26:53----------
think that like calling things easy is a


---------26:55----------
really really big mistake I don't think


---------26:57----------
that confidence is easy


---------26:58----------
and I think if someone else is calling


---------27:01----------
something that you're struggling with


---------27:02----------
easy they just really don't understand


---------27:05----------
or have not faced what you are facing


---------27:08----------
they just really have no idea so one


---------27:10----------
example is that you know so let's say


---------27:14----------
that like you have social anxiety and


---------27:16----------
then like a buddy of yours doesn't and


---------27:19----------
they're like I don't know I don't know


---------27:20----------
what the problem is why don't you just


---------27:21----------
go to a party and hang out man it's just


---------27:24----------
easy just like don't think about it like


---------27:26----------
just try to have a good time man like


---------27:29----------
they have no idea what you're what's at


---------27:31----------
they have never experienced in your mind


---------27:33----------
what what you are experiencing and so it


---------27:38----------
you know if someone says that like you


---------27:41----------
know how are you not confident in your


---------27:42----------
abilities it's easy like you have to


---------27:44----------
pause for a second the first thing is


---------27:45----------
that they probably don't understand what


---------27:47----------
you're actually going through and the


---------27:49----------
second thing is that you should really


---------27:50----------
think a little bit about you know why


---------27:53----------
why is it that this person perceives


---------27:55----------
such respect in my abilities and I do


---------27:57----------
not


---------27:58----------
so I think if you want to grow there


---------28:00----------
what you really have to do is grapple


---------28:01----------
with yourself why is it that everyone


---------28:03----------
else sees me as amazing and I don't like


---------28:06----------
where does that come from why is it hard


---------28:09----------
because it is hard because if it was


---------28:10----------
easy you'd be doing it like that's


---------28:12----------
stupid why is it hard for you to see


---------28:14----------
yourself that way


---------28:16----------
[Music]


---------28:19----------
ah no so this is a great question so


---------28:30----------
subtly no so people do all kinds of


---------28:32----------
destructive self-destructive [ __ ]


---------28:34----------
which is completely ego-syntonic all the


---------28:35----------
time and in fact I'd even say that the


---------28:38----------
more self-destructive it is the more


---------28:40----------
likely it is to be ego-syntonic so if we


---------28:43----------
think about self-destructive behavior


---------28:44----------
it's things that you do to yourself I'll


---------28:46----------
repeat the question


---------28:48----------
so eager to stock is ego-dystonic like


---------28:51----------
self-destructive behavior so what's the


---------28:55----------
relationship between being ego-dystonic


---------28:57----------
and and self-destructive so I would


---------29:00----------
actually say that most people who do and


---------29:03----------
by the way guys I really appreciate your


---------29:05----------
patience with like me learning the ropes


---------29:07----------
of this stuff I'm new to this and and


---------29:09----------
your feedback and stuff is awesome so


---------29:11----------
thank you for you know letting me know


---------29:12----------
when I'm doing something wrong and


---------29:13----------
please let me know if I need to be doing


---------29:15----------
something differently but just kind of


---------29:17----------
going back to ego-dystonic and


---------29:19----------
self-destructive behavior so if you


---------29:21----------
think about like really self-destructive


---------29:23----------
behavior most of the stuff that's


---------29:25----------
self-destructive people aren't really


---------29:26----------
aware of right like if you're thinking


---------29:29----------
about self sabotaging relationships or


---------29:32----------
like let's say that you you know you you


---------29:35----------
have a tendency to like date the wrong


---------29:36----------
kind of person so there's a lot of stuff


---------29:39----------
that I work with that's really


---------29:40----------
self-destructive and what I've actually


---------29:41----------
found is that self-destructive behaviors


---------29:43----------
ego-syntonic you don't recognize that


---------29:46----------
it's self-destructive in fact you think


---------29:47----------
what you're doing is exactly right even


---------29:50----------
though like your torpedoing some part of


---------29:51----------
your life does that make sense


---------29:56----------
yeah so like this is where it's it's not


---------29:58----------
it's not ego-dystonic at all like you


---------30:01----------
sure you suffer later but the thing


---------30:03----------
about ego-dystonic is that someone


---------30:05----------
doesn't want to be doing what they're


---------30:07----------
doing in the moment exactly so they


---------30:10----------
don't want to be doing what they want to


---------30:11----------
do in the moment and like it's someone


---------30:13----------
with true OCD can't help themselves they


---------30:17----------
have to wash their hands even though


---------30:19----------
they know that they shouldn't and that


---------30:21----------
they don't want to and so when it comes


---------30:26----------
to self-destructive behavior a lot of


---------30:27----------
that stuff is like ignoring red flags


---------30:29----------
it's like you know and you think that


---------30:32----------
you're doing everything right even


---------30:33----------
though you're doing everything wrong and


---------30:35----------
so that kind of self-reflection is


---------30:38----------
tricky and difficult


---------30:42----------
yeah so locking the door usually


---------30:43----------
repetitive behaviors okay well will do


---------30:47----------
like maybe one or two more questions and


---------30:49----------
then we'll wrap up for the day for or


---------30:53----------
will transition to like doing a little


---------30:54----------
bit of meditation and then I have one or


---------30:56----------
two closing thoughts because we've been


---------30:58----------
talking about a lot about confidence and


---------30:59----------
so I want to share just a little bit


---------31:01----------
about how to become confident


---------31:05----------
we have any other questions or should we


---------31:07----------
transition okay


---------31:12----------
I think we've gotten to most of


---------31:16----------
so I'm just gonna talk to you guys a


---------31:18----------
little bit so you know we're talking


---------31:20----------
about confidence we're talking about


---------31:21----------
it's hard so in my mind like talking


---------31:24----------
about this stuff really is not gonna


---------31:26----------
change y'all's lives right like you're I


---------31:28----------
mean so let me just tell you guys so a


---------31:33----------
simple way that I think you should you


---------31:35----------
can develop confidence is so we've


---------31:37----------
talked a lot about ego and go for it


---------31:41----------
we'll block we've talked a lot about ego


---------31:44----------
and we've talked a lot about you know


---------31:46----------
how streamers and other people in


---------31:48----------
general like how our identity starts to


---------31:50----------
be built up based on how others judge us


---------31:53----------
so I think one of the best things you


---------31:55----------
can do for your confidence is to do


---------31:58----------
something that know to challenge


---------32:00----------
yourself in a way that no one can judge


---------32:03----------
you in the simplest way to do that is to


---------32:06----------
do things in nature so what I would


---------32:09----------
recommend that you guys do is like like


---------32:11----------
go like to a national park or something


---------32:13----------
and like find a boulder like be safe but


---------32:15----------
I remember like there was a time when I


---------32:17----------
was I would just like go out in nature


---------32:18----------
and I would just like do stuff like I


---------32:21----------
would look at some point on a hill and I


---------32:23----------
would say to myself I'm gonna get to the


---------32:24----------
top of that hill or I would like look at


---------32:27----------
a boulder and I'd be like I'm gonna see


---------32:29----------
if I can climb that Boulder and


---------32:30----------
sometimes I would succeed and sometimes


---------32:33----------
I would fail but the cool thing about


---------32:35----------
nature is like nature doesn't give a


---------32:37----------
[ __ ] like nature doesn't care whether


---------32:39----------
you succeed or fail it doesn't care


---------32:40----------
about living up to expectations or not


---------32:42----------
living up up to expectations and when


---------32:45----------
you succeed the this is a tricky thing


---------32:46----------
about confidence because when you do


---------32:48----------
something in the real world like what's


---------32:51----------
just as damaging or insidious for your


---------32:52----------
confidence is the reward right if I get


---------32:55----------
if I become valedictorian of my high


---------32:56----------
school I'm screwed because my ego is


---------32:58----------
gonna like take a boost from that right


---------33:00----------
so whether you do good things whether


---------33:03----------
you get bullied in high school or you


---------33:05----------
get praised for how smart you are both


---------33:07----------
of them are gonna screw you over and


---------33:08----------
lead to ego and move you away from


---------33:10----------
confidence so the simple solution is to


---------33:13----------
spend time with nature because nature


---------33:14----------
doesn't care Nature doesn't care if


---------33:16----------
you're you're fat or skinny it doesn't


---------33:18----------
care if you're strong or you're weak


---------33:19----------
it doesn't care if you're smart or


---------33:21----------
you're stupid it doesn't care if you're


---------33:22----------
a good-looking or bad-looking and so


---------33:24----------
your brain needs time away from all of


---------33:28----------
those thoughts


---------33:30----------
so like go and like swim somewhere go


---------33:32----------
and climb something for a long time like


---------33:35----------
a big part of my personal growth was


---------33:36----------
like I would go mountain climbing so I


---------33:37----------
spent like you know time in Colorado


---------33:39----------
mountain climbing I spent time in like


---------33:41----------
climbed Kilimanjaro and and things like


---------33:43----------
that and it was it was like an awesome


---------33:45----------
experience like go and spend time with


---------33:46----------
nature because nature doesn't judge you


---------33:48----------
nature just it just doesn't and what you


---------33:51----------
really need to do to develop confidence


---------33:53----------
as being a judgment-free zone
