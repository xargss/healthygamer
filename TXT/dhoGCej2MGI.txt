foreign


---------00:17----------
i'm afraid i won't be able to unequip my


---------00:19----------
armor


---------00:22----------
okay plug in your keyboard bro hey guys


---------00:25----------
bit of a long post


---------00:27----------
um i'm on mobile


---------00:30----------
okay i recently have gone through a


---------00:32----------
completely unanticipated breakup with


---------00:34----------
the first girl i think i've ever truly


---------00:36----------
loved


---------00:37----------
in her entirety and as unselfishly as i


---------00:39----------
think i can


---------00:42----------
okay so you've unselfishly left her all


---------00:44----------
right got it


---------00:45----------
i don't know how many details are


---------00:46----------
necessary but essentially she blindsided


---------00:48----------
me two years into a relationship


---------00:50----------
with which i thought the future was


---------00:52----------
bright and clear


---------00:53----------
um i was looking at rings the week


---------00:55----------
before and essentially told me she


---------00:56----------
needed


---------00:57----------
time to be single and focus on god okay


---------01:01----------
my concern isn't with her reasons i'll


---------01:02----------
admit i'm very frustrated and don't


---------01:04----------
entirely understand what she needs


---------01:06----------
but i respect her decision and believe


---------01:08----------
that she needs


---------01:09----------
us to be a part although her behavior


---------01:12----------
since the breakup has been somewhat


---------01:13----------
confusing


---------01:15----------
my concern is that i'm not sure that


---------01:17----------
i'll ever be able to trust someone the


---------01:18----------
way i trusted her again


---------01:20----------
i grew up in a household with a


---------01:21----------
narcissistic mother who constantly told


---------01:23----------
my twin and i how much she hated us and


---------01:25----------
dreaded us coming


---------01:27----------
coming coming home to us every day every


---------01:30----------
day until we


---------01:31----------
were 18 and went out went our separate


---------01:34----------
ways


---------01:35----------
there's something in dr k's guides about


---------01:37----------
this scenario too okay we're not going


---------01:38----------
to play that video but


---------01:40----------
we'll just talk about this this


---------01:42----------
obviously led to a severe relationship


---------01:44----------
led to severe relationship with issues


---------01:46----------
with which i've been


---------01:47----------
a serial dater always looking for


---------01:49----------
affection that i didn't grow up with


---------01:51----------
and i feel like a certain void is filled


---------01:52----------
during relationships


---------01:54----------
contested with severe security issues


---------01:58----------
which has at worst led me to being over


---------02:01----------
possessive and at best


---------02:02----------
led me to keep my relationships at arm's


---------02:04----------
length and not to let them get too close


---------02:07----------
um i will give myself a credit and say


---------02:09----------
that i've come a long way in this regard


---------02:11----------
okay we'll get to that


---------02:13----------
it wasn't until this past relationship


---------02:15----------
that i feel felt completely at ease in


---------02:17----------
the relationship and 100


---------02:18----------
trusted the other person she was also


---------02:20----------
honest with me and i


---------02:22----------
and i with her and i felt like we grew


---------02:23----------
so well together and built an amazing


---------02:25----------
foundation for a future together


---------02:27----------
never in my mind did i think that


---------02:28----------
breaking up would have been an option


---------02:30----------
for us


---------02:33----------
with that trust and perspective being


---------02:34----------
absolutely shattered i feel i've


---------02:36----------
reverted back to a completely apathetic


---------02:38----------
person


---------02:39----------
nothing has purpose to me anymore in the


---------02:42----------
idea of speaking or seeing anyone


---------02:44----------
that isn't her just sounds gut-wrenching


---------02:47----------
to borrow a term from dr dr k used in


---------02:50----------
this conversation with destiny


---------02:51----------
i feel like i was wearing emotional


---------02:53----------
armor with her


---------02:55----------
i was wearing emotional armor when her


---------02:57----------
and i met and she helped me take it off


---------02:59----------
and now i feel as as if it's stuck and


---------03:01----------
i'm not sure how to take it off on my


---------03:03----------
own thank you


---------03:05----------
great great post um


---------03:09----------
okay so let's talk about this couple of


---------03:12----------
different dimensions


---------03:13----------
first of all huge huge props not only


---------03:15----------
for posting but like this person has


---------03:17----------
obviously come a long way right like and


---------03:19----------
i


---------03:19----------
i love it i love so much about this post


---------03:21----------
i mean i know that this person is


---------03:22----------
struggling a lot right now but


---------03:24----------
i can't help but appreciate a lot of the


---------03:26----------
growth


---------03:27----------
that this person has gone through so


---------03:28----------
like first of all they recognize


---------03:31----------
so much about themselves and if there's


---------03:33----------
one thing that makes me


---------03:34----------
like optimistic about your future it's


---------03:37----------
awareness awareness precedes control


---------03:40----------
in all things it's a fundamental yogic


---------03:43----------
principle


---------03:44----------
which if you don't understand you just


---------03:46----------
have to think about the last time you


---------03:47----------
had dental work numb


---------03:48----------
done and you got numbed up right like


---------03:50----------
when you're numbed up you can't feel


---------03:51----------
anything


---------03:52----------
like that you can't control anything so


---------03:54----------
you have to be aware of something before


---------03:56----------
you can change it


---------03:57----------
okay so this person grew up with


---------03:59----------
narcissistic parents


---------04:01----------
and it took a lot of work for them to be


---------04:03----------
able they started to enter into


---------04:05----------
unhealthy relationship patterns


---------04:07----------
where either they were like overly


---------04:09----------
callous


---------04:10----------
or like other things right so what did


---------04:12----------
they say


---------04:13----------
so because they grew up in a


---------04:14----------
narcissistic household


---------04:17----------
you know they became a serial dater


---------04:19----------
first always looking for affection that


---------04:21----------
i didn't grow up with


---------04:22----------
and they were filling a void from their


---------04:24----------
like upbringing through like romantic


---------04:26----------
relationships which was unhealthy


---------04:29----------
and then they kind of potentially grew


---------04:31----------
out of that or at the same time


---------04:32----------
navigated being like


---------04:34----------
overly possessive or overly callous


---------04:37----------
so this is like very very um


---------04:40----------
it's a very insightful like


---------04:44----------
understanding of their situation so when


---------04:46----------
we grow up with people


---------04:48----------
and we sort of have a void of emotion


---------04:50----------
like emotional love from parents or


---------04:52----------
other figures


---------04:53----------
we try to like solve that in our


---------04:54----------
romantic relationships and then these


---------04:56----------
relationships tend to do poorly because


---------04:59----------
we're trying to fix something from the


---------05:01----------
past with a different person


---------05:03----------
in our current relationship and that


---------05:04----------
just doesn't work out


---------05:06----------
so you become a serial dater you become


---------05:08----------
overly possessive or overly callous


---------05:10----------
really actually common pattern then they


---------05:12----------
meet someone


---------05:14----------
they fall in love they're able to be


---------05:16----------
vulnerable they're able to like connect


---------05:17----------
with them


---------05:18----------
they're able to take down their


---------05:19----------
emotional armor right and that makes a


---------05:21----------
lot of sense because


---------05:22----------
over time when you grow up in a


---------05:24----------
narcissistic household you build up


---------05:26----------
defenses to keep yourself from getting


---------05:28----------
hurt


---------05:29----------
and now this person is like i let down


---------05:31----------
my defenses and this person broke up


---------05:33----------
with me


---------05:34----------
and now i feel like i can never take off


---------05:36----------
my armor again


---------05:38----------
so let me say this the first thing is


---------05:41----------
that when we go through a stressful and


---------05:42----------
traumatic experience there's a tendency


---------05:44----------
to regress


---------05:46----------
okay so this is like the equivalent of


---------05:48----------
like going back to what you know


---------05:50----------
it's like so every now and then so i'm


---------05:52----------
gonna give you guys dota analogy okay so


---------05:54----------
like i usually play position five so i


---------05:56----------
usually play support


---------05:57----------
and every now and then i'll get it into


---------05:59----------
my mind it's like i'm gonna play mid


---------06:00----------
or i'm gonna play carrie and i'm gonna


---------06:02----------
show these noobs like because i just got


---------06:04----------
destroyed by some hero like some you


---------06:06----------
know


---------06:06----------
carry in the last game it's like i'm


---------06:07----------
gonna step outside of my comfort zone


---------06:09----------
and i'm gonna and then i get punished


---------06:11----------
for it right


---------06:12----------
i try something i step out of my comfort


---------06:14----------
zone i get punished what happens in my


---------06:16----------
mind it's like back to position five


---------06:18----------
back to what we know back to safe ground


---------06:21----------
like let's go back to like what works


---------06:24----------
for us like we've tried this for years


---------06:26----------
it's worked for us emotional armor is


---------06:28----------
good


---------06:29----------
right like let's go back to our


---------06:30----------
emotional armor that's what we need


---------06:32----------
so the first thing is that's actually


---------06:34----------
completely okay


---------06:36----------
don't worry about it like i know it


---------06:37----------
sounds weird i know it sounds like oh my


---------06:39----------
god i was able to trust this person i


---------06:40----------
don't think i'll ever


---------06:41----------
ever be able to trust again you'll be


---------06:43----------
able to trust again you just won't be


---------06:45----------
able to trust anytime soon and it's


---------06:46----------
going to take some time


---------06:48----------
okay but this is how you learn how to


---------06:51----------
take armor off and put armor on


---------06:53----------
so like you've been wearing it your


---------06:54----------
whole life and you like it took you a


---------06:56----------
couple years but you figured out how to


---------06:57----------
take it off


---------06:59----------
and then you got hurt so then you put it


---------07:01----------
back on you strapped it back on very


---------07:03----------
quickly


---------07:03----------
and the second time it'll be easier and


---------07:06----------
the third time it'll be easier


---------07:08----------
and the fourth time it'll be easier now


---------07:11----------
each time you take it off


---------07:13----------
will you is there a possibility you'll


---------07:15----------
get hurt again absolutely will it hurt


---------07:17----------
will it suck absolutely


---------07:18----------
but the skill that we want to teach you


---------07:20----------
is how to take the armor off and


---------07:22----------
on which you have to practice right so


---------07:26----------
if you're worried that you won't be able


---------07:27----------
to love anyone ever again and won't be


---------07:29----------
able to trust anyone ever again like


---------07:31----------
i think that's a valid worry but i don't


---------07:33----------
think that's actually what's going to


---------07:34----------
happen because


---------07:35----------
what your story tells me is that you're


---------07:37----------
someone who probably


---------07:39----------
has really hard problems like if you


---------07:42----------
think about growing up with a


---------07:42----------
narcissistic mother and being a serial


---------07:44----------
dater and


---------07:45----------
learning how to take it off the first


---------07:46----------
time like you've done this before


---------07:48----------
right you've completed it once and


---------07:50----------
you'll be able to do it again


---------07:52----------
but don't rush and don't force yourself


---------07:55----------
right so like


---------07:56----------
it hurts you're feeling that rejection


---------07:58----------
you're gonna protect yourself


---------07:59----------
protect yourself don't try to take the


---------08:02----------
armor off for six months one year


---------08:03----------
whatever


---------08:05----------
right it's it's actually completely okay


---------08:07----------
you don't i mean i know that you're


---------08:08----------
worried about like


---------08:09----------
being you know permanently this way but


---------08:11----------
i don't think that's gonna happen i


---------08:12----------
think it's just


---------08:13----------
you're hurting right now and so like


---------08:15----------
what does the mind do


---------08:16----------
when we're hurt it protects itself so as


---------08:19----------
the hurt decreases and as you get over


---------08:21----------
the hurt you'll be able to take off the


---------08:23----------
armor again it'll take some work but


---------08:24----------
you'll get there


---------08:26----------
so it's okay all right so like for those


---------08:28----------
of you who feel like you know i


---------08:30----------
i took my um armor off and and now i got


---------08:33----------
hurt and now i can't


---------08:34----------
like i'm never gonna be able to take it


---------08:36----------
off again it's okay for you to oh wow we


---------08:38----------
got a thousand dollar donation thank you


---------08:39----------
very much


---------08:40----------
be cool man um and so


---------08:44----------
uh yes sorry damn it people donate a lot


---------08:47----------
i just lose my train of thought


---------08:49----------
okay so you're not gonna you're not


---------08:50----------
gonna stay like stuck forever without


---------08:52----------
with armor on okay so just a couple of


---------08:55----------
things okay


---------08:56----------
so the first is that like you know i i


---------09:00----------
know that


---------09:00----------
this person is feeling like rejected and


---------09:02----------
hurt but i don't know that this is a


---------09:04----------
betrayal


---------09:05----------
per se right so i'd like i'd encourage


---------09:07----------
this person to think a little bit about


---------09:09----------
you know you can be you know really into


---------09:11----------
someone and you guys can be like


---------09:14----------
in a good healthy relationship


---------09:17----------
but i think it's important to remember


---------09:19----------
that um


---------09:21----------
you know people grow over time it sounds


---------09:23----------
like you were dating this person for two


---------09:25----------
years


---------09:26----------
people grow they can change they can


---------09:28----------
sort of evolve


---------09:29----------
as people and like it's okay for you to


---------09:32----------
be dating someone and like you all be in


---------09:33----------
the perfect relationship for that year


---------09:36----------
but as you each grow as individuals like


---------09:38----------
y'all could essentially grow apart and


---------09:40----------
like


---------09:41----------
you can sort of part ways right so i'm


---------09:44----------
hearing


---------09:44----------
you know this some of this stuff sounds


---------09:46----------
a little bit strange to me but


---------09:48----------
um you know like i i think it's actually


---------09:52----------
like


---------09:53----------
pretty respectful on on i'm assuming


---------09:56----------
it's a woman


---------09:57----------
um yeah first girl so like i you know i


---------10:00----------
think if if she's in a headspace where


---------10:02----------
she doesn't think that like


---------10:04----------
like she's ready for this commitment of


---------10:06----------
relationship and she wants to focus on


---------10:08----------
other issues i actually think it's sort


---------10:09----------
of like healthy for her to


---------10:11----------
let you know that right here you are


---------10:13----------
looking at rings and she's like yeah i'm


---------10:15----------
not sure if this is the relationship for


---------10:16----------
me


---------10:16----------
or this is not the time to be in a


---------10:19----------
relationship for me


---------10:21----------
and so i think it's actually i'd hope


---------10:22----------
that you can see you know over time that


---------10:24----------
like


---------10:24----------
this could be actually like a good sort


---------10:26----------
of


---------10:28----------
good move on her part in terms of like


---------10:30----------
not actually betraying your trust but


---------10:32----------
if she's not feeling the same way you do


---------10:34----------
then then like you know i think it's


---------10:35----------
actually really healthy for her to let


---------10:37----------
you know that


---------10:38----------
so that you don't get hurt more down the


---------10:41----------
road


---------10:42----------
um the other thing that i want to talk a


---------10:44----------
second about is like i'd be careful


---------10:45----------
about boundaries here too


---------10:46----------
okay i'll admit i'm very frustrated and


---------10:48----------
don't entirely understand what she needs


---------10:50----------
but i respect her decision and beliefs


---------10:52----------
that she needs us to be a part


---------10:54----------
although her behavior since the breakup


---------10:56----------
has been somewhat confusing


---------10:58----------
this you got to be careful about okay


---------11:02----------
so when it comes to a healthy


---------11:04----------
relationship


---------11:05----------
when when this person says i'll admit


---------11:08----------
that i'm frustrated with not


---------11:10----------
understanding what she needs


---------11:12----------
so like this is where like it is the


---------11:14----------
responsibility


---------11:16----------
of each person in the relationship to


---------11:19----------
communicate


---------11:20----------
what their needs are to the other person


---------11:22----------
so this is where you know i don't wanna


---------11:24----------
like bash this person but i'm gonna say


---------11:26----------
a couple of things which


---------11:27----------
i'm gonna infer for a moment they may be


---------11:29----------
unfair


---------11:30----------
you all need to really stop donating


---------11:31----------
because it's distracting there was a 69


---------11:33----------
donation from anonymous a 27 and a 250


---------11:37----------
donation because i want to say something


---------11:38----------
it's important wait chat thank you for


---------11:40----------
the donation wait


---------11:42----------
okay so boundaries and relationships are


---------11:45----------
important if you feel frustrated because


---------11:46----------
this person is not communicating their


---------11:48----------
needs to you you can be in love with


---------11:50----------
them they can be amazing


---------11:51----------
and at the same time like you got to be


---------11:53----------
a little bit careful right because


---------11:55----------
if someone has like if she's going


---------11:58----------
through stuff and is not able to


---------11:59----------
communicate that with you


---------12:01----------
in a healthy way like you got to be


---------12:03----------
really careful because what does that


---------12:04----------
mean down the road


---------12:06----------
right what if she's like going through


---------12:07----------
another internal crisis and then like


---------12:09----------
you're kind of confused because you're


---------12:11----------
into this and her head is somewhere else


---------12:13----------
and like


---------12:14----------
that can be really dangerous and then


---------12:16----------
the last thing that you got to be


---------12:17----------
careful about is you said


---------12:18----------
i'm confused about her behavior since


---------12:21----------
we've broken up


---------12:22----------
which implies that you guys are still


---------12:23----------
like communicating or interacting in


---------12:25----------
some way


---------12:26----------
and this is where i really cautioned you


---------12:28----------
to be very careful


---------12:29----------
because if you guys aren't dating and


---------12:31----------
she's essentially broken up with you i'd


---------12:33----------
be careful about what kind of


---------12:34----------
relationship you maintain with her


---------12:36----------
because even though there may be a part


---------12:38----------
of you that wants to be with her if


---------12:39----------
she's someone that's not


---------12:41----------
communicating with you in a healthy way


---------12:43----------
and like wants to work through things


---------12:44----------
and


---------12:44----------
it's like breaking up with you while she


---------12:46----------
works through stuff


---------12:48----------
instead of having you be a part of that


---------12:49----------
process and growth which you don't


---------12:51----------
necessarily have


---------12:52----------
to right depending on what she's trying


---------12:53----------
to do but generally speaking when i see


---------12:55----------
healthy relationships


---------12:57----------
they usually like have communication


---------12:59----------
prior to the by the way i'm dumping you


---------13:01----------
because i need to focus on god


---------13:03----------
like that's fine like in the sense it's


---------13:06----------
healthy because she's sort of letting


---------13:07----------
you know what she needs


---------13:08----------
and at the other hand it's like kind of


---------13:10----------
unhealthy for her to kind of blindside


---------13:12----------
you


---------13:12----------
right like that right so like presumably


---------13:14----------
she didn't make that decision over 24


---------13:15----------
hours


---------13:16----------
and if you guys are like in a


---------13:18----------
relationship where you're thinking about


---------13:20----------
stuff that you don't think is going well


---------13:22----------
in the relationship


---------13:23----------
i strongly encourage you to talk to your


---------13:26----------
partner about it


---------13:28----------
right and then like give them the


---------13:29----------
opportunity to help you through it think


---------13:31----------
through it


---------13:32----------
you know i know that a lot of people


---------13:34----------
kind of talk about the relationship i


---------13:35----------
have with my wife we've


---------13:36----------
struggled a lot well like we're we're


---------13:38----------
like you know we've talked about


---------13:40----------
breaking up before we've talked about


---------13:41----------
getting divorced before and things like


---------13:43----------
that like you know part of that is like


---------13:45----------
you know it's about having the


---------13:46----------
conversation and being like hey this is


---------13:48----------
how i feel


---------13:49----------
where do you think this is going is this


---------13:51----------
something that we can work through


---------13:53----------
and at the end of the day what i want


---------13:54----------
you all to understand is like a


---------13:55----------
relationship


---------13:56----------
is a co-op game right so if you guys


---------13:59----------
want to succeed you all got a co-op and


---------14:02----------
that


---------14:02----------
involves like facing difficult problems


---------14:05----------
so if you're thinking about breaking up


---------14:06----------
with someone don't


---------14:08----------
you know i i mean you're entitled to do


---------14:10----------
whatever you want to like you can just


---------14:11----------
drop it on them


---------14:13----------
but i think it's like healthy from like


---------14:15----------
a relationship skills building way


---------14:17----------
to voice your concerns with the other


---------14:19----------
person


---------14:20----------
and then like give them a chance to


---------14:22----------
respond because maybe you're like


---------14:24----------
mistaken about something maybe they've


---------14:26----------
been feeling the same thing


---------14:27----------
maybe like give them an opportunity to


---------14:29----------
kind of work on it


---------14:33----------
you know so like give them an


---------14:34----------
opportunity to like play co-op with you


---------14:36----------
especially if you've been in a


---------14:36----------
relationship for two years


---------14:38----------
okay we're gonna review comments let's


---------14:39----------
see let's see what people on the


---------14:40----------
subreddit think let's go chat


---------14:43----------
hey man first of all i'm sorry breakups


---------14:45----------
suck i'm still healing from mine and


---------14:47----------
that was months ago i can only suggest


---------14:49----------
what worked for me because i don't know


---------14:50----------
your situation go no contact on your ex


---------14:53----------
this just means that you do not initiate


---------14:55----------
contact with her in any way shape or


---------14:57----------
form


---------14:58----------
you won't ignore her if she talks to you


---------15:00----------
but you need this time to grieve and go


---------15:01----------
through your feelings


---------15:03----------
and seeing talking to her when she's not


---------15:04----------
receptive won't help you oh this is


---------15:06----------
great dude


---------15:07----------
i love this comment because sometimes


---------15:09----------
people mean sometimes people think that


---------15:10----------
go


---------15:11----------
no contact like they interpret that as


---------15:13----------
um you know don't even respond to her


---------15:15----------
but like


---------15:16----------
i think not initiating contact is like


---------15:18----------
really a far healthier way to do it


---------15:20----------
okay journal and meditate i'm not much


---------15:22----------
of a journaling


---------15:24----------
person myself before the breakup but i


---------15:26----------
can tell you that this is the last


---------15:27----------
change i needed i started just under a


---------15:29----------
month ago and i already feel a huge


---------15:31----------
difference


---------15:32----------
this is part uh this is the part when


---------15:34----------
you work through unequipping your armor


---------15:36----------
beautiful


---------15:37----------
dude love the subreddit fb fbc


---------15:40----------
music i don't know if that's music or


---------15:44----------
magic


---------15:45----------
thanks randy and print and anonymous for


---------15:48----------
the donations by the way


---------15:50----------
y'all can donate as much as you all want


---------15:51----------
now okay


---------15:53----------
oh and by the way that confusing


---------15:55----------
behavior towards the breakup might just


---------15:56----------
be that she is being hot and cold


---------15:58----------
because she is also confused


---------16:00----------
no contact helps with that too it might


---------16:02----------
sound hard but at this point


---------16:04----------
anything that is not hey babe i want us


---------16:06----------
to work this out is just breadcrumbs


---------16:09----------
yeah so what when when this person says


---------16:11----------
she is confused i think that's a good


---------16:13----------
way to put it and


---------16:14----------
we're going to talk about you know i


---------16:16----------
want to make a guide to relationships at


---------16:17----------
some point


---------16:18----------
and i want you all to understand that


---------16:19----------
like a lot like most human beings are


---------16:21----------
ambivalent about most things


---------16:23----------
so like very few human beings are 100


---------16:26----------
towards a particular direction


---------16:28----------
most of the time they like their reasons


---------16:30----------
that she wants to be with you


---------16:32----------
and their reasons why she doesn't want


---------16:33----------
to be with you and that's why she's been


---------16:35----------
in a relationship for two years


---------16:37----------
so it's not that she's like a hundred


---------16:38----------
percent towards breaking up it's like


---------16:40----------
she's probably 51


---------16:42----------
plus towards breaking up which means


---------16:44----------
that she may be exhibiting a lot of


---------16:46----------
behavior that feels quote unquote hot


---------16:48----------
and cold


---------16:48----------
because obviously she's getting


---------16:50----------
something out of the relationship she


---------16:51----------
cares about you to some degree


---------16:53----------
and i think this is good advice too


---------16:54----------
that's sort of not cultivating a


---------16:56----------
particular kind of thought where you're


---------16:58----------
thinking about her all the time


---------17:00----------
is actually really important and that's


---------17:01----------
why no contact actually helps okay so


---------17:04----------
thanks i appreciate that i've been no


---------17:05----------
contact since we broke up


---------17:08----------
she initiated all the contact we've had


---------17:09----------
since then as i've tried to respect her


---------17:11----------
space so she can get up


---------17:13----------
can get what she needs out of this cool


---------17:18----------
one of the hardest things is it seems


---------17:20----------
like i'm doing everything right


---------17:21----------
post-breakup but i'm not getting better


---------17:24----------
i typically recover from relationships


---------17:26----------
in a few weeks but this one just feels


---------17:28----------
different yeah man


---------17:29----------
first of all i feel for you growing up


---------17:31----------
with narc parents sucks i don't have any


---------17:33----------
advice for your specific situation but i


---------17:35----------
will say that many of us who grew up


---------17:36----------
with narc parents have similar core


---------17:38----------
wounding


---------17:39----------
and issues you describe are very common


---------17:40----------
in children raised in such households


---------17:42----------
absolutely true specifically the thing


---------17:45----------
about emotional armor boundary issues


---------17:46----------
how you commune how to communicate your


---------17:48----------
needs etc


---------17:49----------
i found this channel very helpful for


---------17:50----------
advice for people who grew up with


---------17:52----------
um narcissistic parents interesting i'm


---------17:55----------
not sure if you've


---------17:56----------
seen it but there's a video talking with


---------17:58----------
william about healing from ctpsd


---------18:01----------
cptsd from narc parents that's probably


---------18:03----------
pretty helpful that's a good one


---------18:05----------
i like that one


---------18:10----------
cool okay next


---------18:14----------
seriously everyone thank you so much for


---------18:16----------
