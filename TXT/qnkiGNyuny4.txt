---------00:49----------
and so uh sam and ben can you all help


---------00:51----------
me understand a little bit about how you


---------00:53----------
guys got into streaming


---------00:56----------
um i'll start because it's your origin


---------00:58----------
story so


---------00:59----------
um so way back when i think what 2016


---------01:04----------
destiny 1 uh had a game mode called


---------01:07----------
trials of osiris added and i decided to


---------01:09----------
i had like a channel that i used to use


---------01:11----------
to watch myself afk farm


---------01:13----------
uh diablo while i was at work yeah i'd


---------01:16----------
never watched twitch work but yeah


---------01:17----------
um but it was it was like the origin of


---------01:20----------
just the channel existing


---------01:21----------
never really used it for anything until


---------01:23----------
trials came out and then


---------01:24----------
i started streaming to help my friend


---------01:26----------
brian


---------01:27----------
uh try and grow his channel i got pretty


---------01:29----------
lucky


---------01:30----------
uh not to his benefit but when he went


---------01:33----------
to college


---------01:34----------
he moved into a dorm that did not have


---------01:37----------
uh didn't have good internet so i


---------01:40----------
benefited from that


---------01:41----------
by continuing i was like i'm just gonna


---------01:42----------
keep that our little community that we


---------01:44----------
grew together uh going i'll continue to


---------01:47----------
stream on my channel because i was


---------01:48----------
i already had like a career i worked in


---------01:50----------
i.t for years and years i went to


---------01:52----------
college and graduated all that um


---------01:54----------
and so i i was only streaming just to


---------01:56----------
help him out


---------01:57----------
and when he couldn't stream anymore i


---------01:59----------
continued to


---------02:00----------
keep things going and it just kind of


---------02:02----------
grew from there i


---------02:03----------
i think that i got lucky a bunch of


---------02:06----------
times in a row to get to where i am now


---------02:08----------
uh or maybe right place right time and


---------02:10----------
capitalize on it


---------02:11----------
and it grew to where it is now


---------02:15----------
and can do you guys mind if i so just a


---------02:17----------
couple of ground rules you know anything


---------02:18----------
that you if i ask a question that y'all


---------02:20----------
don't feel comfortable answering or is


---------02:21----------
out of line in any way shape or form


---------02:23----------
just let me know


---------02:24----------
but since we are talking about parenting


---------02:26----------
you know i thought i would ask y'all one


---------02:28----------
or two questions about y'all's


---------02:29----------
relationship and maybe how y'all met


---------02:31----------
is that cool so how did you guys meet


---------02:34----------
i'll take this one uh i lived in a


---------02:37----------
duplex in college with four other girls


---------02:39----------
and on the other side were five other


---------02:41----------
guys and one of them happened to be


---------02:44----------
ben's childhood best friend and


---------02:47----------
he came over to watch a star trek


---------02:51----------
rift tracks movie i don't remember i


---------02:53----------
never remember which one it is benjamin


---------02:55----------
whatever star trek movie


---------02:56----------
wrath of khan yeah shatner climbs uh you


---------02:59----------
know el cap in yosemite at the beginning


---------03:00----------
of it


---------03:02----------
but i was outside with one of the


---------03:04----------
neighbor guys trying to help me


---------03:06----------
fix my car and uh


---------03:09----------
you know it was just a pos and i was


---------03:12----------
kicking it and


---------03:13----------
super upset because i needed to get to


---------03:14----------
work the next day and ben and the other


---------03:17----------
guys walk up and they


---------03:18----------
got my car started so i can go to work


---------03:20----------
tomorrow and


---------03:21----------
uh like go clean up come over and and


---------03:24----------
watch


---------03:24----------
this movie with us so you can relax okay


---------03:27----------
come over


---------03:28----------
throughout the whole entire thing


---------03:28----------
everybody's talking and then this guy


---------03:30----------
across the room just keeps like staring


---------03:32----------
at me


---------03:34----------
and he keeps trying to be part of this


---------03:36----------
conversation that i'm in


---------03:38----------
i'm like who the heck is this guy i


---------03:41----------
don't know


---------03:42----------
um and it wasn't until i left


---------03:45----------
that as i walked past him to leave to go


---------03:48----------
to


---------03:49----------
my side of the the building he grabbed


---------03:51----------
my arm and he's like hey i'm ben


---------03:53----------
and i was like hi i'm sam okay bye like


---------03:56----------
just bounce right out of there uh it


---------03:59----------
wasn't until like a couple weeks after


---------04:01----------
we you know met that uh


---------04:04----------
he added me on facebook when it wasn't


---------04:06----------
weird to add random people on social


---------04:08----------
media


---------04:10----------
and we just this was okay yeah this was


---------04:12----------
before what it was like this is just


---------04:14----------
2007.


---------04:16----------
it wasn't weird yet to do that kind of


---------04:18----------
stuff


---------04:21----------
and he just we just started talking i


---------04:24----------
was casually seeing somebody else at the


---------04:25----------
time


---------04:26----------
and uh basically you know that guy


---------04:30----------
screwed up too many times and ben was


---------04:31----------
there when i was upset he was the first


---------04:33----------
person i called


---------04:35----------
crying because this guy stood me up and


---------04:37----------
uh


---------04:38----------
he was in the best part is is


---------04:41----------
he never was pushy about it


---------04:44----------
like but he also wasn't like complacent


---------04:47----------
that i was seeing another guy


---------04:50----------
uh he this movie sounded horrible


---------04:54----------
i knew that you liked me but it wasn't


---------04:56----------
like you were trying to put yourself in


---------04:58----------
between


---------04:59----------
like you were respectful that i was


---------05:00----------
seeing somebody else


---------05:03----------
but you also made sure to make it known


---------05:06----------
that you really liked me and that you


---------05:08----------
cared about me and stuff like that and


---------05:10----------
so


---------05:10----------
when i was sick of the other guy i was


---------05:12----------
just like


---------05:13----------
oh well there's this dude here so he's


---------05:15----------
really nice and then what we had


---------05:17----------
our our first date um maybe like a week


---------05:21----------
or so after we


---------05:23----------
uh after i was done seeing that guy and


---------05:26----------
there you go


---------05:27----------
now it's been what it's been


---------05:30----------
14 years this summer yep


---------05:34----------
yeah so can i get ben's version of


---------05:36----------
events


---------05:38----------
okay so because i feel like that's


---------05:41----------
okay well i'm gonna start all the way


---------05:42----------
but yeah i'll start at the beginning


---------05:44----------
so i my friend tom and i we were gonna


---------05:47----------
go over to hang out


---------05:48----------
and watch uh a rifftrax dub of wrath


---------05:51----------
khan i was super excited


---------05:52----------
and when we're we're walking up the


---------05:54----------
duplex and there's this girl outside


---------05:56----------
in a blue and white flannel shirt uh


---------05:59----------
ripped up jeans you know


---------06:00----------
kind of she she was same age as us but


---------06:04----------
she was very frustrated with her vehicle


---------06:06----------
uh and was swearing at it and so we


---------06:08----------
offered to


---------06:09----------
uh to help her with it and just like you


---------06:12----------
know go relax get a long day


---------06:13----------
take a shower you know get cleaned up


---------06:15----------
come over and just hang out and


---------06:17----------
and forget about the problem for a


---------06:19----------
little while so she did that


---------06:21----------
um and while we're watching the movie uh


---------06:24----------
raw conversations i was not staring


---------06:27----------
across the room i


---------06:28----------
made glances as one does all right uh


---------06:32----------
from time to time


---------06:33----------
and i never got an opportunity to


---------06:36----------
introduce myself directly so before she


---------06:38----------
left i said you know what eff it


---------06:39----------
uh i reached out and i grabbed her arm


---------06:41----------
and said hey by the way i'm ben and she


---------06:43----------
said she sam


---------06:44----------
and she left and that was it it wasn't


---------06:46----------
weird okay


---------06:47----------
but it was definitely not pushy it was


---------06:49----------
one of those like hey she's cute i want


---------06:51----------
to


---------06:52----------
i i don't even i didn't get a chance to


---------06:54----------
like directly interact with her at all


---------06:56----------
so i figured i might as well give it a


---------06:57----------
shot and go for it


---------06:58----------
and um like she said i did find her on


---------07:01----------
on facebook and edit her and we started


---------07:03----------
talking a little bit um


---------07:05----------
do you remember the you're gonna go on a


---------07:07----------
trip to yosemite


---------07:08----------
and do you remember what i said to you i


---------07:10----------
asked you how long before you leave


---------07:12----------
yes you this is before this is after i


---------07:15----------
stopped seeing the other guy


---------07:16----------
and you had said when are you supposed


---------07:18----------
to go on that trip to yosemite and i


---------07:20----------
said two weeks and you're like all right


---------07:21----------
i have two weeks for you to go on a date


---------07:23----------
with me then


---------07:24----------
and it worked so here we are yeah the


---------07:26----------
next day was our date


---------07:29----------
so that was uh i gotta say ben well


---------07:31----------
played sir


---------07:32----------
thank you i appreciate that it's pretty


---------07:34----------
smooth no because like here's the thing


---------07:36----------
right so i think a lot of times like


---------07:37----------
people say like oh nice guys finish


---------07:39----------
last right but like i think there's this


---------07:41----------
very tricky tightrope


---------07:43----------
of like letting your intentions be known


---------07:46----------
and like not


---------07:46----------
pretending that nothing is going on and


---------07:48----------
at the same time like still being


---------07:50----------
respectful of boundaries


---------07:52----------
yeah which is like really hard i think a


---------07:54----------
lot of people like either they


---------07:56----------
they don't they're not transparent


---------07:57----------
enough like i i'm you know i'm a favor


---------07:59----------
i'm in favor of being


---------08:00----------
transparent um and like if you have you


---------08:03----------
know if you're attracted to someone or


---------08:04----------
interested in them and like like i think


---------08:06----------
like


---------08:07----------
like solid bro like you know not letting


---------08:09----------
her like like you know


---------08:10----------
she's walking out the door taking your


---------08:12----------
last chance to at least introduce


---------08:13----------
yourself


---------08:14----------
not asking for her number no compliments


---------08:16----------
or anything


---------08:17----------
just you know because it says a lot but


---------08:19----------
like it's also like really like it's


---------08:21----------
super smooth bro


---------08:22----------
the idea is kind of like i don't there's


---------08:24----------
nothing to lose at that point you might


---------08:25----------
as well go for it right


---------08:26----------
yep but also like but don't go too far


---------08:30----------
oh yeah there's a line i could have been


---------08:32----------
like hey so you should stop what you're


---------08:34----------
doing and hang out and talk with me


---------08:35----------
right now yes


---------08:36----------
obviously she was on her way out on the


---------08:38----------
front porch with me in chat


---------08:40----------
that was not the goal the goal was just


---------08:42----------
literally to to try and


---------08:44----------
plant the seed which i don't know you


---------08:45----------
could take all sorts of ways because we


---------08:47----------
have a kid now but


---------08:48----------
you know what i mean like but to to try


---------08:50----------
and start some sort of conversation


---------08:52----------
can we just appreciate for a moment that


---------08:55----------
ben remembers what she was wearing


---------08:57----------
i wore that same shirt on our wedding


---------08:59----------
day too to get to get ready


---------09:00----------
uh specifically because he very much


---------09:04----------
that was like his visual and i still


---------09:06----------
have the shirt to this day


---------09:08----------
yeah so so let me ask you something ben


---------09:10----------
like and i i'm


---------09:11----------
sort of i have a hypothesis here um how


---------09:13----------
long did it take you to fall in love


---------09:15----------
with sam


---------09:16----------
[Laughter]


---------09:18----------
um probably with an


---------09:21----------
internally probably not very long i


---------09:23----------
remember with the first time


---------09:25----------
do you remember where we were the first


---------09:26----------
time i said it to you uh we were walking


---------09:29----------
past the fabric section of hobby lobby


---------09:31----------
yep and i and i said it and


---------09:34----------
do you remember whether you said it back


---------09:36----------
or not because i do don't i don't think


---------09:37----------
i said it back


---------09:38----------
right away not initially and that was


---------09:40----------
fine yeah i've always been the girl that


---------09:43----------
you know i've i felt like i had to say


---------09:46----------
it back


---------09:47----------
in my younger relationships but as i got


---------09:50----------
older i was like no


---------09:51----------
like they don't deserve that unless i'm


---------09:53----------
ready for it right


---------09:54----------
and i wasn't gonna be i wasn't gonna try


---------09:56----------
and force her to do or say something


---------09:58----------
she'd want to say but it would


---------10:00----------
but like you said transparency is


---------10:01----------
important so there's no reason for me to


---------10:03----------
to not be open about how i felt


---------10:07----------
i think you stopped me and you looked at


---------10:08----------
me and said it and then i just looked


---------10:10----------
i looked back at you and just smiled and


---------10:12----------
i gave you a hug and then we kept


---------10:13----------
walking to like go by yarn or something


---------10:16----------
yep sounds about right yeah


---------10:19----------
yep uh yeah i i you know i'm gonna say


---------10:23----------
that


---------10:23----------
i think maybe it was like maybe the


---------10:25----------
moment you saw her just a tiny bit


---------10:28----------
so if we think about neuro


---------10:29----------
scientifically okay i i know i know you


---------10:31----------
guys have figured out


---------10:32----------
it may not be true but here's just maybe


---------10:34----------
i'm drawing from my own experience which


---------10:35----------
was that i fell


---------10:36----------
absolutely in love with my wife the


---------10:37----------
moment i saw her it just took me years


---------10:39----------
to realize it


---------10:41----------
and i think it's kind of interesting


---------10:42----------
because like you know if we look at


---------10:44----------
memory in the way that memory works


---------10:46----------
you know you can remember a moment from


---------10:48----------
a decade ago


---------10:50----------
and you cannot remember what you had for


---------10:52----------
lunch two days ago


---------10:54----------
so temporality has a piece of it right


---------10:57----------
but actually it's your current emotional


---------11:00----------
state


---------11:00----------
that is the closest the the strongest


---------11:03----------
influence


---------11:04----------
for what you remember so like how deep a


---------11:07----------
memory sinks in


---------11:09----------
depends on the emotional activation


---------11:12----------
in that moment so it's really


---------11:14----------
fascinating that you remember so many


---------11:16----------
details like you guys remember so many


---------11:18----------
details


---------11:19----------
like you remember like what the movie


---------11:21----------
was you remember what the circumstances


---------11:22----------
were you remember what she was wearing


---------11:24----------
like


---------11:25----------
you guys remember so much about just


---------11:27----------
think about this this is what like


---------11:29----------
you know a 60-second span 14 years ago


---------11:33----------
and it's like crystal clear in your mind


---------11:36----------
which just from like a neuroscience


---------11:37----------
perspective


---------11:38----------
implies one of two things either you


---------11:40----------
guys have talked about it a ton which is


---------11:42----------
certainly a possibility


---------11:43----------
or but even then i think it's like


---------11:46----------
something


---------11:47----------
there's like a spark something like


---------11:49----------
something like


---------11:50----------
you know sunk in and and so anyway


---------11:54----------
there's a visual memory of ben walking


---------11:56----------
up to my car with the group of guys


---------11:58----------
before i even met him


---------11:59----------
like i have a very split two-second


---------12:03----------
clip in my brain that maybe i created or


---------12:05----------
not but


---------12:06----------
i visually remember i was sitting on the


---------12:08----------
curb and like even the angles of


---------12:10----------
everything


---------12:10----------
on my street and stuff like that yeah


---------12:13----------
awesome so it sounds like


---------12:15----------
yeah i um y'all's origin story is


---------12:18----------
super dope let's put it that way and and


---------12:22----------
so


---------12:22----------
can can y'all help me understand a


---------12:24----------
little bit so you guys it sounds like


---------12:25----------
y'all started dating


---------12:26----------
and then uh ben was streaming at that


---------12:28----------
point


---------12:29----------
already or no no okay okay i okay so


---------12:33----------
i didn't actually start until after i


---------12:36----------
had already graduated from college


---------12:38----------
and had i had a career i i worked in i.t


---------12:40----------
for a long time


---------12:41----------
i was a senior systems engineer at an


---------12:43----------
insurance company where i live


---------12:45----------
and by doing all the networking and data


---------12:48----------
center management virtual machine


---------12:49----------
deployment i'm a big nerd is what it


---------12:51----------
comes down to it's like


---------12:52----------
i.t and computer science that was my


---------12:54----------
thing that's what i i majored in in


---------12:55----------
college and


---------12:56----------
and all that and um we i didn't actually


---------12:59----------
even start streaming


---------13:00----------
until this was 20 2017 so i


---------13:04----------
i well your did i graduate from college


---------13:06----------
i don't even remember twenty


---------13:07----------
you graduated in uh 2005.


---------13:10----------
from high school through that so 2009


---------13:13----------
and so it was multiple so you started


---------13:15----------
streaming before i got pregnant though


---------13:17----------
so that would have been


---------13:18----------
2014. well that's that's when


---------13:22----------
no 2017 is when 2016 is when i started


---------13:25----------
then


---------13:26----------
the dates are all i literally my the


---------13:28----------
date is based on an event in a game that


---------13:31----------
i could go look up i know exactly when


---------13:33----------
it's like may


---------13:34----------
the second week of may of 2016 had to be


---------13:37----------
when i actually first started


---------13:39----------
well yeah in 2015 though


---------13:44----------
oh that means wait yeah 2005 it would


---------13:46----------
have been 2015. look it up this is what


---------13:48----------
happens when you get this old doing


---------13:49----------
twitch it's like


---------13:50----------
everything blends together no this is so


---------13:53----------
it would have been 14. no you're right


---------13:55----------
she's right


---------13:57----------
as i'm sure as usual um yeah


---------14:00----------
no typically yeah um so so but


---------14:03----------
you know i just the reason i'm asking


---------14:06----------
about the the streaming in the


---------14:07----------
relationship thing is i'm really curious


---------14:09----------
if you guys sort of


---------14:10----------
because like here's ben who's got a


---------14:11----------
career right and then like


---------14:13----------
streaming is something that's like


---------14:14----------
recreational hobby like i'm really


---------14:17----------
curious if if you guys would be okay


---------14:18----------
with sharing like what that conversation


---------14:20----------
went like


---------14:22----------
what the early days of streaming was


---------14:23----------
like and if you guys sort of had a


---------14:25----------
conversation about


---------14:26----------
i'm assuming you don't work in i.t


---------14:28----------
anymore no


---------14:29----------
okay no no not anymore and so just you


---------14:32----------
know how did you guys


---------14:33----------
as a as a couple kind of like make that


---------14:35----------
transition and what did those


---------14:37----------
conversations look like


---------14:38----------
it actually was pretty easy and this is


---------14:40----------
largely in part


---------14:41----------
the fact that she has always been super


---------14:43----------
accepting of who i am


---------14:45----------
uh because i used to braid and wow world


---------14:48----------
warcraft


---------14:48----------
pretty religiously like five nights a


---------14:51----------
week five hours a night


---------14:52----------
after work we would get i'd get home


---------14:54----------
from work and i'd


---------14:55----------
we'd have dinner or whatever and then


---------14:57----------
i'd sit down to raid for the evening and


---------14:59----------
she would work on her photography stuff


---------15:01----------
we'd be in the same room but it was a it


---------15:04----------
was


---------15:04----------
she's never looked at me and said you


---------15:06----------
have to stop playing video games because


---------15:08----------
she's always known that that's


---------15:10----------
the biggest part of my life the most


---------15:11----------
important thing as far as like hobbies


---------15:13----------
go


---------15:14----------
and so it was it was a no-brainer and


---------15:17----------
she never


---------15:17----------
tried to manipulate me or force me she


---------15:19----------
never gave me an ultimatum quit gaming


---------15:21----------
and hang out with me you're too old for


---------15:23----------
that


---------15:24----------
because she knew she knew who she was


---------15:27----------
dating right she it wasn't like she was


---------15:29----------
trying to mold me


---------15:31----------
into a person that i wasn't it's because


---------15:33----------
she


---------15:34----------
accepted who i was and that's who she


---------15:36----------
loved you were very upfront though


---------15:38----------
like when we first started dating you're


---------15:40----------
like maybe it was after about two weeks


---------15:42----------
of us


---------15:42----------
kind of seeing each other and you're


---------15:44----------
like hey by the way


---------15:46----------
i now that we're seeing each other more


---------15:48----------
often you might notice that like


---------15:49----------
i play video games a plot a lot i he was


---------15:52----------
raiding like he said in world of


---------15:53----------
warcraft and it wasn't


---------15:54----------
uh until maybe a few months after he


---------15:56----------
started dating he actually


---------15:58----------
changed his raid schedule to start later


---------16:01----------
in the evening so by the time i would go


---------16:03----------
home or go to bed


---------16:04----------
he would start raid and i was just like


---------16:06----------
well obviously if this is important to


---------16:08----------
him


---------16:09----------
i'm not going to take it away because i


---------16:10----------
don't want to like i like him for who he


---------16:12----------
is not


---------16:12----------
for who i want to turn him into and he's


---------16:16----------
making strides to accommodate me


---------16:20----------
so why would i be upset that he still


---------16:23----------
you know plays games and stuff like that


---------16:25----------
so yeah it we it's always been in our


---------16:27----------
relationship that in the evenings


---------16:29----------
we hang out together but like kind of


---------16:33----------
doing our own thing and then so even now


---------16:35----------
like in the evening


---------16:36----------
charlie goes to bed ben goes downstairs


---------16:38----------
and streams i do my stuff


---------16:40----------
after he's done streaming we watch a


---------16:41----------
show and go to bed kind of thing


---------16:43----------
so so i'd like to revise what i said


---------16:45----------
earlier about the moment


---------16:46----------
ben fell in love i think the moment he


---------16:50----------
fell in love is when he moved his raid


---------16:52----------
schedule to accommodate his girlfriend


---------16:56----------
because that's not a sacrifice for years


---------16:59----------
too


---------16:59----------
it's such a big sacrifice ben


---------17:02----------
to if you look at the in the grand


---------17:05----------
scheme of things


---------17:06----------
maybe not but i think for me it was yeah


---------17:09----------
it was a big hobby related thing it was


---------17:11----------
a part of my life and i


---------17:12----------
and we decided that it was it was best


---------17:15----------
for everybody involved nobody else had a


---------17:17----------
complaint that i was writing with and so


---------17:18----------
it's like this is the smartest thing to


---------17:20----------
do right


---------17:21----------
so so you know sam i i really oh i'm


---------17:24----------
hearing a lot here


---------17:25----------
that sounds awesome like this is like i


---------17:27----------
don't know if you guys are pretending to


---------17:28----------
be


---------17:29----------
an awesome couple but y'all um y'all are


---------17:32----------
doing a lot of the things that i think


---------17:34----------
the unhappy couples who wind up in my


---------17:36----------
office don't do


---------17:38----------
so it sounds like there's like a mutual


---------17:39----------
kind of respect it also sounds like


---------17:41----------
there's like accommodations of each


---------17:42----------
other it sounds like


---------17:44----------
sam never asked ben to shift his raid


---------17:47----------
schedule


---------17:49----------
uh so it's just it's been communication


---------17:52----------
and transparency is


---------17:53----------
super helpful we have a rule especially


---------17:56----------
with


---------17:56----------
when it comes to streaming and gaming


---------17:59----------
and stuff like that but


---------18:00----------
usually for the most part of our


---------18:01----------
marriage in in our relationship is


---------18:03----------
we can come to each other and we that


---------18:06----------
person that we go to with like some kind


---------18:08----------
of situation so if ben was


---------18:10----------
streaming too much in the evening and i


---------18:11----------
wanted to hang out with him i


---------18:14----------
in pre-agreement with each other can go


---------18:16----------
up to him and be like i've


---------18:18----------
not seen you enough we need to figure


---------18:20----------
something out


---------18:21----------
and in that first conversation the other


---------18:23----------
person cannot come back defensive


---------18:26----------
until we figure out what's going on it


---------18:28----------
doesn't always work


---------18:29----------
sure but we we know going into that


---------18:31----------
conversation


---------18:32----------
that that you just you have to put it


---------18:34----------
out there and then


---------18:36----------
not like knowing that you're not going


---------18:37----------
to get attacked or anything right away


---------18:40----------
there might be an argument in a later


---------18:42----------
conversation that gets drawn out


---------18:44----------
for whatever uh but that initial one


---------18:46----------
that's always been something for us


---------18:48----------
especially when it comes to


---------18:50----------
streaming and because it's his job now


---------18:52----------
but with gaming before


---------18:54----------
um i'm sure what led you to changing


---------18:57----------
your schedule is us having a


---------18:58----------
conversation about how


---------19:00----------
like we were trying to find a night to


---------19:02----------
hang out and it just didn't work for


---------19:03----------
a week because when we first started


---------19:05----------
dating we were only seeing each other


---------19:06----------
maybe two times a week because we were


---------19:09----------
both busy


---------19:10----------
with school and work and you were


---------19:11----------
raiding and all that kind of stuff


---------19:13----------
so we we settled down that fairly early


---------19:16----------
for most parts of our relationship is


---------19:18----------
we just just put it out there kind of


---------19:20----------
thing yeah


---------19:21----------
i i'm hearing not just put it out there


---------19:23----------
but also that


---------19:24----------
the pers like so the person who puts it


---------19:27----------
out there


---------19:29----------
the person who's receiving it also


---------19:31----------
listens


---------19:32----------
first as opposed to defending attacking


---------19:35----------
you know like like i think that's a


---------19:37----------
really important part that like if we


---------19:38----------
try


---------19:39----------
right yeah i'm not trying to put this


---------19:41----------
front then we're perfect but at least we


---------19:44----------
um and that seems really important you


---------19:46----------
know i gotta say sam i'm i'm a little


---------19:48----------
bit


---------19:48----------
surprised um and so i'd love to ask you


---------19:52----------
one or two more questions because like


---------19:54----------
you know i i i wrapped up college um


---------19:57----------
you know uh uh a year or two after it


---------20:00----------
sounds like ben started so i think we're


---------20:02----------
all


---------20:02----------
you know in the same decade in terms of


---------20:05----------
age and so i i would still be shocked


---------20:07----------
like i still remember i went on like one


---------20:09----------
or two dates with this girl


---------20:11----------
and then i told her i was like hey like


---------20:13----------
warcraft 3 frozen throne is coming out


---------20:15----------
and i'm gonna be like


---------20:16----------
m.i.a for two weeks and then you know i


---------20:19----------
never went out with her again


---------20:21----------
because she was like i don't know what


---------20:24----------
this


---------20:24----------
is and and so she's as far as i can tell


---------20:28----------
is a completely


---------20:29----------
normal woman um and and so i'm i'm


---------20:32----------
really surprised because i can't imagine


---------20:34----------
many people like in the mid 2000s like


---------20:37----------
having a boyfriend who was playing wow


---------20:40----------
for five hours a night five days a week


---------20:43----------
like i think it's rare for people to be


---------20:45----------
okay with that


---------20:46----------
is that fair i mean it wasn't a common


---------20:50----------
thing


---------20:51----------
and and a lot of people look at you know


---------20:53----------
look at gaming like it's a waste of time


---------20:55----------
and stuff


---------20:56----------
um but to be honest like i was an only


---------20:59----------
child until i was 10 and even then my


---------21:01----------
brother


---------21:02----------
was born with physical mental


---------21:03----------
disabilities so it wasn't like i had a


---------21:05----------
sibling or anything


---------21:06----------
until later on in life with step


---------21:07----------
siblings so i'm totally


---------21:09----------
fine spending time by myself


---------21:12----------
um i like i enjoy spending time with


---------21:15----------
people


---------21:16----------
but even then ben and i have joked about


---------21:18----------
it that if we were like a regular couple


---------21:20----------
where we spent


---------21:21----------
every single night seven nights a week


---------21:23----------
together we would probably


---------21:25----------
you know end up getting annoyed with


---------21:27----------
each other after a long


---------21:28----------
a long time so when when he was just


---------21:31----------
like hey i do this stuff and i was like


---------21:33----------
oh cool it's on a schedule


---------21:34----------
okay well you know i i ran a


---------21:37----------
corporate portrait studio around that


---------21:39----------
time and i was like


---------21:41----------
i'll just change my schedule to kind of


---------21:43----------
line up with yours if i can


---------21:45----------
and call it a day so i do my thing and


---------21:47----------
you do your thing and then we don't have


---------21:49----------
to worry about trying to figure out when


---------21:50----------
we can hang out with each other


---------21:52----------
so sounds really awesome yeah the


---------21:55----------
funny part though is like i was a super


---------21:57----------
outdoorsy


---------21:59----------
hippie kind of person so


---------22:02----------
uh we were definitely like i played


---------22:04----------
video games growing up but we definitely


---------22:05----------
were learning


---------22:06----------
from each other kind of different


---------22:09----------
different hobbies and stuff so


---------22:12----------
that's awesome and so it sounds like


---------22:14----------
when you were


---------22:15----------
when you were ready to become a


---------22:16----------
full-time streamer like i'm assuming


---------22:18----------
that things sort of gradually picked up


---------22:20----------
and it was sort of like a stable shift


---------22:23----------
or was it really like kind of rolling


---------22:24----------
the dice um


---------22:26----------
i i would say it was pretty stable a


---------22:29----------
gradual increase until fortnight


---------22:31----------
happened


---------22:31----------
and then everything kind of exploded in


---------22:34----------
a way that


---------22:35----------
kind of nobody expected i mean there's


---------22:38----------
no way you could go into it and be like


---------22:40----------
oh yeah one day


---------22:41----------
fortnite's gonna come out and my


---------22:42----------
career's gonna skyrocket and i'm gonna


---------22:44----------
yeah i met tyler ninja and we became


---------22:48----------
friends and during pub g before fortnite


---------22:50----------
even happened and


---------22:51----------
a bunch of people like it was wild it


---------22:53----------
was an unprecedented kind of thing and


---------22:55----------
actually that's where


---------22:56----------
around that times when she took a a


---------22:59----------
larger role


---------23:00----------
on the on the the business side of stuff


---------23:02----------
for me because


---------23:03----------
before fortnight um


---------23:06----------
like my business email wasn't really


---------23:08----------
inundated with a lot of stuff


---------23:10----------
and then fortnite happened popularity


---------23:12----------
absolutely skyrocketed


---------23:14----------
uh and suddenly i was getting like waves


---------23:16----------
of emails


---------23:17----------
and requests to do things and and you


---------23:20----------
know


---------23:21----------
ad opportunities all sorts of stuff and


---------23:23----------
i needed somebody i i can't i couldn't


---------23:25----------
sit there and check my email


---------23:26----------
the whole time so i that's where she


---------23:28----------
stepped into the role of being the


---------23:30----------
manager for my job


---------23:31----------
um so i i don't even really look at my


---------23:34----------
work email too much


---------23:36----------
uh she does a lot of it and then we also


---------23:38----------
have a management team on


---------23:39----------
on the back end that takes care of a lot


---------23:41----------
of the coordination for


---------23:42----------
contractual stuff all that but i it it


---------23:45----------
was in the span of i would say like


---------23:47----------
six months where it went from a pretty


---------23:50----------
easily


---------23:50----------
manageable thing for one person and then


---------23:52----------
it exploded and i needed to back up


---------23:54----------
real quick and she stepped up to the


---------23:56----------
plate uh without missing a beat


---------23:58----------
wow yeah it's i don't know if you guys


---------24:01----------
could tell from my


---------24:02----------
you know when i added y'all as friends


---------24:04----------
or when i messaged you and i was like i


---------24:06----------
was a little bit confused


---------24:08----------
it's because i'm like matt and i don't


---------24:10----------
understand what's happening


---------24:12----------
i just i just was like maybe this is the


---------24:15----------
wrong one that i added yeah no i was


---------24:17----------
like oh this is


---------24:18----------
wonderful nice to meet you and i was


---------24:20----------
like a little bit concerned


---------24:21----------
and then i was also like oh okay baby


---------24:23----------
and so i'm i'm the same way and it's


---------24:25----------
you know it's interesting because um in


---------24:27----------
my case it sort of happened almost


---------24:28----------
slightly in reverse so i was running


---------24:30----------
healthy gamer for about a year and no


---------24:31----------
one had heard of us


---------24:33----------
and then my wife took over and now


---------24:35----------
people have heard of us


---------24:36----------
hooray and and and so


---------24:39----------
it's really interesting to hear like how


---------24:41----------
do you guys kind of manage


---------24:43----------
i mean i i don't even know how i would


---------24:45----------
go about answering that question if


---------24:46----------
someone asked it to me


---------24:48----------
any um you know i was just curious


---------24:49----------
what's what's the experience been like


---------24:51----------
working together


---------24:53----------
um it is there


---------24:57----------
you have to separate benjamin and


---------24:59----------
samantha


---------25:00----------
from dr lupo and mrs dr lupo that the


---------25:03----------
relationships almost have to be


---------25:06----------
different relationships because we'll


---------25:08----------
even we'll even


---------25:09----------
uh remind the other person when we're


---------25:12----------
about to talk about something for like


---------25:14----------
streaming or whatever it is like by the


---------25:15----------
way this is between me and my manager


---------25:18----------
not husband and wife right now and


---------25:19----------
that's the we have to set the


---------25:21----------
like the tone for the conversation so


---------25:23----------
otherwise things i think can get kind of


---------25:24----------
muddied if you're


---------25:27----------
there are certain business opportunities


---------25:28----------
like hey you have a whole crap ton of


---------25:30----------
viewers today you should probably keep


---------25:31----------
streaming for like another half hour or


---------25:33----------
hour past when you would normally end


---------25:35----------
and the wife side would say no you know


---------25:38----------
we have a schedule for reason come


---------25:40----------
upstairs


---------25:40----------
but then the manager side is like yeah


---------25:41----------
you don't get this opportunity very very


---------25:43----------
often so it's


---------25:44----------
it is uh it's a balancing act of what is


---------25:48----------
of you know what which conversation


---------25:50----------
you're having either the business side


---------25:51----------
or the non-business side


---------25:53----------
and sometimes we have to start the


---------25:55----------
conversation or even mid-conversation we


---------25:57----------
have to stop and be like who are you


---------25:58----------
talking to right now yeah


---------26:00----------
cause cause i might be coming to him as


---------26:02----------
sam and he might be coming to me as dr


---------26:04----------
lupo


---------26:05----------
and you can tell real quick in the


---------26:07----------
conversation that


---------26:08----------
we're not talking to the same person so


---------26:10----------
we have to be like wait


---------26:12----------
which hat are we both putting on because


---------26:14----------
we both need to be in the same mindset


---------26:15----------
for it


---------26:16----------
yeah so i'm noticing that there's


---------26:18----------
there's some pretty clear boundary


---------26:20----------
setting in terms of like


---------26:22----------
you know what is this a business


---------26:23----------
conversation or a personal conversation


---------26:26----------
definitely um yeah i sometimes joke


---------26:30----------
about this is


---------26:31----------
you know i think part of the the fun is


---------26:33----------
that this is the one situation


---------26:35----------
where potentially sexual harassment


---------26:37----------
between employees is


---------26:38----------
acceptable


---------26:41----------
good thing hr's never seen any stuff


---------26:43----------
we've done to each other okay i mean i


---------26:44----------
am hr so


---------26:45----------
[Laughter]


---------26:48----------
so you know uh


---------26:51----------
but so and and what


---------26:54----------
yeah i i i'm gonna just ask a couple


---------26:57----------
more questions is that cool


---------26:58----------
yeah so like how did you guys decide um


---------27:01----------
to have children


---------27:02----------
or a kid sounds like you'll have one


---------27:04----------
correct


---------27:06----------
you want to start


---------27:09----------
how do we decide i can i can at least


---------27:11----------
set the precedent


---------27:12----------
out of the gate i'm going to be honest i


---------27:14----------
i know that i'm i play video games all


---------27:16----------
day


---------27:17----------
i'm a man child uh you know there's only


---------27:19----------
a certain amount of


---------27:21----------
external focus that my brain has the


---------27:23----------
capacity to give out and so i


---------27:25----------
i initially didn't want to i just


---------27:28----------
i didn't i didn't want kids uh to start


---------27:31----------
with and then


---------27:32----------
i think things started to change when i


---------27:34----------
was exposed more and more to


---------27:36----------
because she was a photographer so she


---------27:37----------
would work with like babies to take


---------27:39----------
pictures and stuff like that and being


---------27:41----------
shown those things


---------27:42----------
um changed my opinion because it's it's


---------27:46----------
kind of incredible what a little human


---------27:48----------
being can learn to do and now that we


---------27:50----------
have


---------27:51----------
charlie i'm like it's it's like watching


---------27:53----------
a cloned version of me slowly grow up


---------27:56----------
and


---------27:56----------
and being able to see the see him


---------27:59----------
experiencing things like mario


---------28:01----------
and and all the games that i loved when


---------28:03----------
i was little when i was hit his age


---------28:06----------
watching someone else see those things


---------28:09----------
and experiencing them for the first time


---------28:11----------
is i mean it's a pretty typical


---------28:13----------
stereotypical parent thing to do but i'm


---------28:15----------
living vicariously


---------28:16----------
through him seeing those things for the


---------28:18----------
first time it's


---------28:20----------
absolutely amazing i've always wanted to


---------28:23----------
be


---------28:23----------
a parent a mom uh like i said before my


---------28:26----------
brother was born


---------28:27----------
with mental physical disabilities when i


---------28:30----------
was 10 and around 12 my mom kind of went


---------28:32----------
m.i.a for a few years


---------28:34----------
so i was the mom for about 12 to 14


---------28:38----------
ish and um she


---------28:42----------
you know she's back she's great


---------28:45----------
everything's all good


---------28:46----------
uh but i i just always knew


---------28:50----------
after taking care of my brother that i


---------28:51----------
wanted to be a mom even at 12 i was good


---------28:54----------
at it


---------28:55----------
and my mom uh did a daycare growing up


---------28:59----------
and then once i got into photography i


---------29:02----------
mean a lot of those kids


---------29:03----------
i was just talking about this a couple


---------29:05----------
days ago my oldest or my longest running


---------29:07----------
client


---------29:08----------
is now 16 and i met her when she was one


---------29:12----------
um and so it's just it's


---------29:16----------
watching all those kids grow up and it's


---------29:19----------
just something that i've always wanted


---------29:20----------
to do


---------29:20----------
and i know i never wanted a big family


---------29:22----------
like one


---------29:23----------
maybe two if someone really pushed me i


---------29:26----------
i think it's important to explain


---------29:29----------
some of the other reasoning behind that


---------29:31----------
with your brother


---------29:32----------
yeah so i am potentially a carrier of my


---------29:34----------
brother's uh genetic mental disorder


---------29:37----------
and um we we don't have know like


---------29:40----------
the exact name that he has because back


---------29:42----------
then the testing was not there and


---------29:44----------
available


---------29:45----------
now i don't want to just go poke and


---------29:46----------
prod him just so i can figure it out or


---------29:49----------
not


---------29:49----------
so we tried with charlie and charlie's


---------29:52----------
100


---------29:52----------
good and golden and uh so we got we got


---------29:55----------
lucky with that


---------29:56----------
um and so i never wanted a large family


---------29:59----------
because there's always still that


---------30:00----------
possibility that


---------30:01----------
i can pass on if we have another son but


---------30:05----------
um yeah do you remember uh how you told


---------30:08----------
me that you were ready to have kids


---------30:10----------
no i don't you're at least not looking


---------30:13----------
at my head


---------30:14----------
oh god you


---------30:17----------
and this is this is one way that we used


---------30:19----------
to communicate to each other um


---------30:21----------
is is you know one of us we weren't


---------30:24----------
living


---------30:24----------
together for obviously a beginning of


---------30:26----------
our relationship but


---------30:28----------
uh there was some nights like if


---------30:30----------
something was really on our minds


---------30:32----------
we would just write it all out in an


---------30:34----------
email and send it to the other person


---------30:35----------
and be like oh yeah


---------30:36----------
i just sent you an email so before yeah


---------30:38----------
before i get absolutely ridiculed for


---------30:40----------
this for


---------30:40----------
for eternity okay it was one of the it


---------30:43----------
was the way that we


---------30:44----------
we decided was like best for just


---------30:47----------
sometimes it's easier to get your


---------30:48----------
thoughts out if you have time to write


---------30:50----------
them down and stare at them for a little


---------30:51----------
bit


---------30:51----------
and and consider the correct phrasing


---------30:53----------
and then we send it along right


---------30:55----------
instead of like a face-to-face


---------30:56----------
conversation sometimes especially about


---------30:58----------
something like that where even


---------30:59----------
internally i'm like i don't know what


---------31:01----------
the right thing to do is what the right


---------31:02----------
right thing to say is you you can


---------31:05----------
muddy the waters real quick if you


---------31:08----------
misspeak and then you have to backpedal


---------31:10----------
and and blah blah you know so i so


---------31:12----------
before i get


---------31:14----------
people go in on me over this yeah i


---------31:16----------
wrote an email because it was the right


---------31:18----------
i remember now because it was the


---------31:19----------
easiest way to write out my thoughts and


---------31:21----------
then look at my own thoughts and see if


---------31:23----------
that's like it's like


---------31:24----------
is that what i really mean to say or is


---------31:27----------
there a better way to phrase it so that


---------31:28----------
it makes sense or even if that is is


---------31:31----------
that the way that you actually feel


---------31:33----------
or is that something that you're just


---------31:34----------
kind of feeling like you have to feel


---------31:36----------
kind of think too yeah i i think thanks


---------31:39----------
for clarifying that because oddly enough


---------31:41----------
that's actually something i recommend


---------31:43----------
to my patients is that you know a lot of


---------31:45----------
times if we think about the most


---------31:46----------
important communications there are two


---------31:48----------
things that we can never get back


---------31:50----------
one is time that's passed and the second


---------31:52----------
is the words that leave our mouth


---------31:54----------
and and so it's kind of interesting


---------31:56----------
because if you really have something


---------31:57----------
super important you know when you said


---------31:59----------
wrote you an email i mean i was


---------32:00----------
imagining a


---------32:02----------
one-liner which is like okay let's have


---------32:06----------
kids


---------32:08----------
okay thanks mike i mean there were some


---------32:10----------
that were like that


---------32:12----------
but between us but yeah it was the


---------32:15----------
children go go go go go go go


---------32:20----------
and then you know so so but what i what


---------32:22----------
i'm hearing is it's it's not really so


---------32:24----------
much an email as it was like a letter


---------32:26----------
yeah right just in electronic format


---------32:28----------
yeah that it was


---------32:29----------
you thought about it a lot you expressed


---------32:31----------
a lot um


---------32:33----------
i'm still a little bit surprised to be


---------32:35----------
honest ben


---------32:37----------
because i can't imagine that looking at


---------32:39----------
pictures of babies and this is probably


---------32:40----------
me just projecting because it's just


---------32:42----------
my experience is like oh it wasn't just


---------32:44----------
looking at pictures it was like


---------32:46----------
it so she did her photography uh


---------32:49----------
when we got married one of the things


---------32:51----------
that i did is take on a job that i


---------32:53----------
didn't necessarily want to provide


---------32:54----------
enough money so that she could leave


---------32:56----------
her she quit her studio job so she could


---------32:58----------
start her own business


---------32:59----------
that was one of the things that we did


---------33:01----------
um but that i did because


---------33:03----------
she had worked her butt off when i


---------33:05----------
didn't have a job and


---------33:07----------
and trying to get to a stable place and


---------33:09----------
so when


---------33:10----------
when i had the opportunity to give back


---------33:12----------
i did that


---------33:13----------
but she ran her business out of our


---------33:15----------
house and so


---------33:17----------
i got to see in person these little tiny


---------33:20----------
snuggly you know human loaves of bread


---------33:22----------
is what they basically boil down to


---------33:25----------
when they're when they're that young and


---------33:26----------
and that was one of the big things for


---------33:28----------
me that


---------33:28----------
helped that that i would say i mean


---------33:31----------
helped it's everybody's


---------33:32----------
ultimately the path you take and whether


---------33:34----------
you have kids or not is is going to be


---------33:36----------
individual for each person right my


---------33:38----------
path isn't going to be different than


---------33:39----------
somebody else's but i definitely was one


---------33:41----------
that was like i don't want


---------33:42----------
to to have kids and i started to see the


---------33:45----------
seed babies


---------33:46----------
in person in a way that i hadn't before


---------33:48----------
because she's so good with kids man


---------33:50----------
she working with kids through


---------33:51----------
photography studio and like


---------33:53----------
it's wild some of the stuff that that i


---------33:56----------
have learned from watching her work


---------33:58----------
that it opened up a different side of of


---------34:02----------
an infant to me that i didn't really


---------34:04----------
expect right because


---------34:06----------
before before seeing that my exposure to


---------34:09----------
them was so limited because i'm the


---------34:10----------
youngest of four


---------34:11----------
in my family so i never there were never


---------34:12----------
any babies around and all i knew was


---------34:14----------
like


---------34:15----------
that it's just gonna cry a lot it's


---------34:17----------
gonna poop i'm gonna have to clean it up


---------34:18----------
and then and and feed it and then


---------34:20----------
hopefully it's still not upset about


---------34:22----------
something


---------34:22----------
but then she kind of she changed my


---------34:25----------
opinion


---------34:26----------
on on pretty much all of it as a whole


---------34:29----------
because yeah there's


---------34:30----------
there's that stuff and as a parent you


---------34:32----------
end up with like poop on your


---------34:34----------
fingernails in a way you wouldn't expect


---------34:35----------
right when you change your diapers and


---------34:37----------
all that but but when you actually get


---------34:39----------
to hold


---------34:41----------
it's it if you have kids you know what


---------34:44----------
i'm talking about it's it's almost an


---------34:46----------
indescribable thing


---------34:47----------
to see your you know your your offspring


---------34:50----------
slowly turn into a human being that can


---------34:53----------
do things it's crazy


---------34:55----------
yeah absolutely so i'm guessing that sam


---------34:58----------
uh ben you knew that sam wanted to have


---------35:01----------
kids


---------35:02----------
um i knew yeah and had you guys


---------35:06----------
had you all talked about it before was


---------35:08----------
it sort of like because when you said


---------35:10----------
like i


---------35:10----------
i'm ready so you you send off the email


---------35:13----------
but like


---------35:14----------
was the assumption that sam was already


---------35:17----------
ready


---------35:18----------
or wanted to have kids before that so


---------35:19----------
you were sort of like


---------35:21----------
you know i know i think i really like


---------35:23----------
and


---------35:24----------
yeah i don't think i ever felt like it


---------35:26----------
was a waiting for me kind of thing i


---------35:29----------
think it was more like


---------35:30----------
a waiting for us to come to a mutual


---------35:32----------
agreement


---------35:33----------
kind of thing because i think she she


---------35:35----------
knew that


---------35:37----------
i was not interested and i knew that she


---------35:40----------
was interested


---------35:41----------
and it eventually we


---------35:44----------
found our way to a mutual agreement and


---------35:46----------
it was just not like she forced me


---------35:48----------
or strong handed me and to be like give


---------35:51----------
me your seed


---------35:52----------
it just eventually like i i decided


---------35:55----------
on my own that having a kid was the


---------35:57----------
right idea


---------35:59----------
there were definitely lots of


---------36:00----------
conversations and stuff leading up


---------36:02----------
to that letter being sent um yeah there


---------36:06----------
were there were situations where


---------36:08----------
you just flat out said that you would


---------36:09----------
never change your mind and uh


---------36:12----------
and obviously that was something that i


---------36:13----------
had to sit and really think about if


---------36:15----------
that's something that i'm


---------36:16----------
okay with you know not being a mom and


---------36:19----------
so it taken a few years i mean


---------36:22----------
what we got pregnant five years


---------36:26----------
after charlie or after we got married so


---------36:28----------
uh


---------36:29----------
so we never really rushed into anything


---------36:32----------
with it and i was totally okay being an


---------36:35----------
older


---------36:35----------
parent as well um so i had charlie when


---------36:38----------
i was 30


---------36:38----------
when all my friends were having them


---------36:40----------
when having their kids like when they


---------36:42----------
were 23


---------36:42----------
24 and stuff like that and i was totally


---------36:45----------
fine


---------36:46----------
with waiting if that's just what it took


---------36:48----------
um


---------36:49----------
so it wasn't just like i knew from day


---------36:52----------
one and then


---------36:53----------
and then i was just like okay but it was


---------36:56----------
conversations that definitely led up to


---------36:58----------
that letter being sent and then even


---------36:59----------
then we still had plenty of


---------37:00----------
conversations


---------37:02----------
after that letter of like


---------37:05----------
okay but now that now that i heard your


---------37:07----------
side and you know my side let's like


---------37:09----------
push them together and make sure 100


---------37:12----------
that we're on the same page before we


---------37:14----------
dive into this


---------37:15----------
forever long thing okay you want to


---------37:17----------
actually


---------37:19----------
how about now because this is also very


---------37:21----------
telling about the


---------37:22----------
about where we are now when we have


---------37:24----------
conversations about kids


---------37:26----------
because she so so she


---------37:29----------
made the one for us and did 99.9


---------37:32----------
of the work and now i've god


---------37:36----------
you're gonna do the second one well


---------37:38----------
please


---------37:39----------
if only uh no i i have kind of changed


---------37:42----------
gears to where i wouldn't be upset if we


---------37:43----------
had another kid


---------37:46----------
and i would not be upset having another


---------37:47----------
kid either but it's not coming out of me


---------37:50----------
yeah that's that's one of the


---------37:52----------
stipulations but i i definitely never


---------37:53----------
saw myself as someone who was like yeah


---------37:55----------
i could


---------37:55----------
i could have a second one um and i think


---------37:58----------
that it definitely helps seeing like


---------38:00----------
we went to we went over to my mom's


---------38:01----------
house for mother's day uh


---------38:04----------
this weekend and i saw other family


---------38:06----------
members there and my one of my


---------38:08----------
older brothers has three and their


---------38:10----------
youngest


---------38:11----------
is adorable and uh she's


---------38:15----------
not a year yet almost one almost one but


---------38:18----------
like they're they're typically pretty


---------38:19----------
timid about interactions and she came


---------38:22----------
here and read and like climbed up on me


---------38:24----------
and gave me a hug and i about melted


---------38:26----------
into a puddle


---------38:27----------
it was it it's just it's such a cool


---------38:29----------
experience


---------38:30----------
that i never thought i would i would be


---------38:32----------
like yeah i'm on board let's go again


---------38:34----------
i'm i'm ready uh so you know


---------38:37----------
ben and sam i've been sort of thinking


---------38:39----------
at the be since the beginning of this


---------38:40----------
conversation if there's some way that i


---------38:42----------
can be helpful


---------38:44----------
um so when y'all came on today i i was


---------38:47----------
really thinking that what y'all share is


---------38:50----------
not really necessarily for your benefit


---------38:52----------
it's actually for like


---------38:53----------
other people's benefit you know to share


---------38:56----------
like a lot of interesting things about


---------38:57----------
you know relationships relationships


---------39:00----------
with streamers


---------39:01----------
relationships with people in gaming you


---------39:03----------
know how do you kind of adapt how do you


---------39:04----------
decide to have kids how do you raise


---------39:05----------
kids all that good stuff


---------39:07----------
but i'm wondering uh but for most people


---------39:10----------
that come on i'm


---------39:11----------
trying to help them with something right


---------39:13----------
and and i'm just curious whether


---------39:15----------
um there's something that i could be


---------39:18----------
helpful with here in terms of just


---------39:19----------
facilitating it sounds like you guys are


---------39:20----------
really solid communicators


---------39:23----------
um uh but you know is this something


---------39:26----------
that


---------39:26----------
it should i ask y'all questions about


---------39:28----------
this and and maybe we can try to have a


---------39:31----------
conversation about it or


---------39:33----------
whatever you think is going to be best


---------39:34----------
i'm fine yeah well i mean i don't know


---------39:36----------
about about you benjamin but you and i


---------39:37----------
have


---------39:38----------
these conversation it's like with you


---------39:40----------
know you're


---------39:41----------
first dating somebody and you're laying


---------39:43----------
in bed at night and you're like i wonder


---------39:44----------
what our life in the future would be


---------39:46----------
like and you start thinking about all


---------39:47----------
that kind of stuff and that's kind of


---------39:48----------
like the stage


---------39:50----------
where i feel like we both


---------39:53----------
are it's just like you you know i wonder


---------39:55----------
what a little girl version of us


---------39:57----------
would look like but at the same time i'm


---------39:59----------
like but it's not again it's not i'm not


---------40:01----------
doing that again


---------40:02----------
yeah oh yeah i i think ultimately it's


---------40:04----------
mostly hyperbole of us


---------40:05----------
just just yeah it's just saying it to


---------40:08----------
say it because


---------40:09----------
i i mean the way we are right now i


---------40:11----------
don't know if we could fit


---------40:13----------
having another kid into you know the the


---------40:16----------
power trio that we currently have just


---------40:19----------
be given the circumstances and how busy


---------40:20----------
i am and how much she works behind the


---------40:22----------
scenes for us and


---------40:24----------
taking care of boy all day and that kind


---------40:26----------
of thing so it it's


---------40:28----------
in this situation i think it's more of


---------40:30----------
just like a kind of a joking poking fun


---------40:32----------
at each other


---------40:33----------
yes which is the thing that we do a lot


---------40:34----------
it's i think


---------40:36----------
one of my you know how we have do we


---------40:38----------
have conversations about love languages


---------40:39----------
i always tell her that one of my


---------40:41----------
my main love languages is sarcasm uh


---------40:43----------
because we messed with each other a lot


---------40:45----------
behind the scenes um but it's just part


---------40:47----------
of the i think part of the dynamic


---------40:49----------
and this is another one of those things


---------40:50----------
because i know that i know that she


---------40:52----------
doesn't want to


---------40:53----------
grow another child uh and so i will


---------40:56----------
sometimes if like if we're


---------40:58----------
about to go to bed i'll tease her and


---------41:00----------
put my hand on her stomach and tell her


---------41:01----------
that i can feel


---------41:02----------
the baby kicking and [ __ ] like that like


---------41:04----------
we i poke fun of her a lot


---------41:06----------
i won't say we i i'll say me i do it a


---------41:08----------
lot uh can i


---------41:10----------
can i push y'all sure want to be pushed


---------41:12----------
are you going


---------41:13----------
so like i'm wondering whether um ben is


---------41:17----------
doing his equivalent of grabbing your


---------41:20----------
arm on the way out


---------41:21----------
right so what i'm what i'm noticing is


---------41:23----------
that ben is respecting


---------41:25----------
your boundary in terms of


---------41:28----------
sam saying like i'm okay with having


---------41:31----------
another kid theoretically it's just not


---------41:33----------
coming out of me


---------41:34----------
and and yet ben is also like i wouldn't


---------41:37----------
mind having another one


---------41:38----------
right so we've had this conversation


---------41:40----------
about i'm totally


---------41:42----------
100 down with adopting yep um and that


---------41:45----------
is something that benjamin has


---------41:46----------
expressed that he is not a hundred


---------41:48----------
percent sure if that's where


---------41:50----------
he sits comfortable with


---------41:53----------
um so sam can i do you mind if i ask a


---------41:57----------
couple of questions about


---------41:58----------
um you know your


---------42:02----------
because i so easy to skirt


---------42:06----------
to move into [ __ ] territory here but


---------42:08----------
um


---------42:09----------
so so i do please do go ahead i'm just


---------42:12----------
noticing that i


---------42:13----------
i think you know when when ben says


---------42:14----------
something like


---------42:16----------
and i feel sort of comfortable pushing


---------42:18----------
this because you guys clearly do have


---------42:20----------
such a strong marriage you clearly do


---------42:21----------
communicate really well


---------42:23----------
and so it's kind of hard because like


---------42:24----------
you guys do 90 of what i teach


---------42:27----------
so now like in terms of what i'm trying


---------42:29----------
to think about like can i help y'all in


---------42:31----------
some way i think it's maybe actually


---------42:32----------
like asking hard questions and bringing


---------42:34----------
things to the surface


---------42:36----------
um so sam can you help me understand


---------42:40----------
uh you know how you came to the decision


---------42:42----------
that you did not want to grow another


---------42:44----------
human being


---------42:45----------
um i just did okay


---------42:49----------
so when i imagine what i imagined


---------42:52----------
pregnancy before i


---------42:53----------
got pregnant is basically the chest


---------42:56----------
burster


---------42:56----------
from from alien


---------43:00----------
uh and uh so anytime that anybody's like


---------43:03----------
pregnant and they want me to touch their


---------43:05----------
belly and stuff like that


---------43:07----------
i know it freaks me out i really did not


---------43:10----------
enjoy a single


---------43:12----------
like long stretch of pregnancy there was


---------43:14----------
little sprinkles on that there of like


---------43:16----------
cool and everything but deep i don't


---------43:18----------
bend if you remember the first time that


---------43:19----------
charlie moved to my stomach and we sat


---------43:21----------
there and watched it


---------43:22----------
i was like shaking freaking out because


---------43:26----------
watching something move underneath your


---------43:29----------
skin is terrifying


---------43:31----------
all of a sudden you're like oh there's


---------43:32----------
his elbow


---------43:34----------
um so on top of i had a really bad first


---------43:38----------
trimester um i


---------43:41----------
have the whole thing potentially you


---------43:43----------
know passing on what my brother has in


---------43:45----------
the back of my mind on top of it


---------43:47----------
uh i just wasn't super comfortable


---------43:50----------
mentally with you know having something


---------43:52----------
growing inside of me and i don't know if


---------43:54----------
that's something that i can


---------43:56----------
get over i also since charlie was born


---------43:58----------
i've contracted chronic lyme disease


---------44:00----------
um and so i'm already at the point of


---------44:03----------
being as tired as somebody can be


---------44:05----------
without passing out


---------44:06----------
um i can't imagine adding in pregnancy


---------44:09----------
tiredness


---------44:10----------
on top of that uh and i didn't enjoy


---------44:14----------
the birth i didn't enjoy the afterwards


---------44:17----------
there's a reason why there's a chemical


---------44:18----------
in women's brains that make you forget


---------44:20----------
birthing because nobody would do that a


---------44:22----------
second time if they really


---------44:24----------
thought about it yeah unless like they


---------44:27----------
had the easiest pregnancies ever


---------44:28----------
kind of thing so that's where i am


---------44:33----------
what region of the you guys are in the


---------44:35----------
yep we yeah we're in nebraska


---------44:39----------
interesting you guys get a lot of lyme


---------44:41----------
disease up there


---------44:43----------
um being in uh


---------44:46----------
being a photographer you spend a ton of


---------44:48----------
time out in the fields


---------44:49----------
ah deer ticks yep um so i


---------44:53----------
i specifically remember when i found a


---------44:55----------
tick on me


---------44:56----------
uh and it wasn't until a few months


---------44:58----------
after that


---------44:59----------
and you know years later all the timing


---------45:01----------
lined up i go to see a doctor and


---------45:04----------
uh after almost man uh


---------45:07----------
six months or so testing of stuff she


---------45:09----------
just told me i'd left over part of


---------45:11----------
a flu and a year and a half after that


---------45:14----------
didn't go away and found a new doctor


---------45:16----------
got diagnosed and there we go i'm sorry


---------45:20----------
that


---------45:20----------
you're having to deal with that it's


---------45:22----------
actually one of the most frustrating


---------45:24----------
things to deal with that i've seen


---------45:25----------
medically


---------45:26----------
it is very frustrating but you know i've


---------45:29----------
always


---------45:30----------
had lots of you know ups and downs in my


---------45:32----------
life that


---------45:33----------
you i'm okay with the negative stuff


---------45:36----------
happening because it always ends up


---------45:38----------
leading me to where i currently am in my


---------45:39----------
life


---------45:40----------
so yeah so so sam you know that makes


---------45:43----------
perfect sense


---------45:44----------
in terms of pregnancy is is


---------45:47----------
statistically the most dangerous thing


---------45:49----------
that the average woman ever does um


---------45:52----------
in terms of disability mortality


---------45:56----------
it is it is like literally it's it's the


---------45:58----------
most dangerous part


---------46:00----------
of your life statistically um


---------46:04----------
you know and and and so obviously if it


---------46:07----------
you know if it felt awful like i'm kind


---------46:09----------
of with you in terms i mean as much as i


---------46:11----------
can be


---------46:12----------
in terms of you know recognizing that my


---------46:14----------
wife


---------46:15----------
she decided to go through it twice um


---------46:18----------
but


---------46:19----------
you know i think as you guys i'm sure


---------46:20----------
you all understand it's a very


---------46:22----------
individual decision just like having


---------46:23----------
charlie was like a really individual


---------46:25----------
decision it's not even like


---------46:26----------
couple like even within a couple so


---------46:29----------
there's like individual


---------46:30----------
individuality within a couple and then


---------46:33----------
the the timing of when you decide to


---------46:34----------
have a child and stuff like that i mean


---------46:36----------
there's so much individuality there


---------46:38----------
the one thing sam that i'm just a little


---------46:40----------
bit concerned about


---------46:42----------
and this is where you know you can swat


---------46:44----------
the societies


---------46:46----------
sometimes when i'm working with people


---------46:48----------
who have a fear


---------46:50----------
the fear tends to manifest in


---------46:54----------
a very irrefutable way so like for


---------46:57----------
example like i've worked with people who


---------46:59----------
have had


---------46:59----------
um you know one special needs child or


---------47:02----------
like


---------47:03----------
first and then decided to have a second


---------47:05----------
one or people who have had


---------47:07----------
one healthy child and then discover that


---------47:09----------
there is a like a genetic risk


---------47:12----------
it's a really challenging thing it's


---------47:13----------
kind of bizarre but um


---------47:15----------
you know i'm just wondering whether


---------47:18----------
a part of your mind and this is where i


---------47:21----------
feel like i'm going into [ __ ]


---------47:22----------
territory but i'm just going gonna be


---------47:23----------
transparent


---------47:24----------
whether a part of your mind because of


---------47:25----------
that fear of what could happen


---------47:28----------
is like pointing to things that clearly


---------47:31----------
like no one can blame you for


---------47:34----------
right so like does that make sense yeah


---------47:37----------
what do you think about that


---------47:40----------
um i know that i'm a person that


---------47:43----------
dwells on fears benjamin can attest to


---------47:46----------
that


---------47:47----------
a lot uh that um


---------47:50----------
i want to say that i let fear control


---------47:53----------
my life but there's definitely certain


---------47:56----------
types of fears that


---------47:57----------
i have a hard time you know facing and


---------48:00----------
letting go of


---------48:01----------
snakes and uh


---------48:04----------
because they don't let go of you yeah


---------48:07----------
you're you're not helping


---------48:08----------
you're not helping bad experience in


---------48:09----------
kindergarten okay like with a big one


---------48:13----------
um so i don't know i mean


---------48:16----------
if if if ben came to me


---------48:20----------
in in the the same seriousness as


---------48:23----------
writing that letter and said


---------48:25----------
i would love to have a second child with


---------48:27----------
you and i would love for it to be


---------48:29----------
between just me and you


---------48:31----------
then it would be a okay let's sit down


---------48:34----------
let's figure out


---------48:36----------
what we can do to make things better for


---------48:38----------
me


---------48:39----------
you know if we can ahead of time now


---------48:41----------
that we know now that we know


---------48:43----------
potentially how i react to pregnancy and


---------48:44----------
stuff like that


---------48:46----------
um but as far as like


---------48:49----------
having a second child added to our


---------48:52----------
family


---------48:53----------
i'm 100 on board when we get to that


---------48:56----------
serious point of conversation


---------48:58----------
of sure let's have a second child


---------49:01----------
but it again then


---------49:05----------
you're not next to me management but i'm


---------49:06----------
staring at you if you ever came to me


---------49:08----------
and you're just like


---------49:09----------
yes if if we have a second child and i


---------49:11----------
want one it


---------49:12----------
it i would love for it to be between me


---------49:14----------
and you only then


---------49:16----------
yeah i'm not gonna be like no definitely


---------49:18----------
not


---------49:19----------
but in this moment where i feel like we


---------49:22----------
aren't


---------49:22----------
we're more on like the hypothetical it


---------49:25----------
would be cool


---------49:26----------
joking kind of situation of having a


---------49:29----------
child then yeah i'm going to stay on my


---------49:31----------
ground about


---------49:31----------
not wanting to to birth another child


---------49:34----------
i want to be clear too i it's not


---------49:38----------
like with the with the having one that


---------49:41----------
is biologically bold of ours versus


---------49:43----------
adoption i have no issue with adoption i


---------49:45----------
think adoption is wonderful i think it's


---------49:46----------
an amazing thing that you


---------49:48----------
you can find people that choose to love


---------49:51----------
someone as their own and versus there


---------49:54----------
are some biological relationships


---------49:56----------
obviously that are not great that the


---------49:59----------
you have abuse of parents and stuff like


---------50:00----------
that so adoption is like


---------50:02----------
adoption is one of the most beautiful


---------50:05----------
things i think that


---------50:06----------
we as as human beings have decided to do


---------50:09----------
i just i just it's not like a like a


---------50:12----------
approval or disapproval for me it's more


---------50:14----------
of a


---------50:14----------
i just haven't spent the time to think


---------50:16----------
about if that's the way that i would


---------50:17----------
want to go


---------50:18----------
get if we ever got to the point where we


---------50:20----------
want a second


---------50:25----------
we kid oh no no no i'm not


---------50:28----------
stumped i'm quite the opposite i'm just


---------50:32----------
trying to figure out how far i want to


---------50:34----------
go


---------50:35----------
so this is probably further than we've


---------50:38----------
had as a conversation on the serious


---------50:40----------
side of things about this


---------50:41----------
ever sam can you tell me what growing up


---------50:44----------
was like with your younger brother


---------50:48----------
um sometimes i wish he wasn't there


---------50:53----------
just because my parents divorced right


---------50:55----------
after he was born


---------50:57----------
mom bounced is really difficult


---------51:00----------
uh he was in and out of hospitals for


---------51:02----------
his first five years


---------51:03----------
uh do with surgeries and stuff like that


---------51:06----------
and then his mental health or


---------51:08----------
mental disability on top of it


---------51:11----------
but i love him to death i told my


---------51:12----------
parents the first week that he was born


---------51:15----------
that


---------51:15----------
when they can't take care of him that i


---------51:17----------
will and i've stuck to that


---------51:19----------
and i'm getting all teary because i love


---------51:21----------
my brother so much


---------51:22----------
um i've broken up relationships with


---------51:26----------
people that couldn't handle him


---------51:28----------
um ben charged in


---------51:31----------
head first with my brother and


---------51:34----------
uh and has agreed from day one of


---------51:37----------
meeting him


---------51:38----------
that he will one day be our


---------51:41----------
responsibility


---------51:42----------
um yeah this i mean obviously it's


---------51:44----------
difficult when you're when your


---------51:46----------
sibling's 10 years apart but then on top


---------51:48----------
of it


---------51:49----------
you know a parent is gone you're going


---------51:50----------
through your own


---------51:52----------
change as a preteen and you know


---------51:56----------
then you have a baby to take care of too


---------52:00----------
obviously that's rough


---------52:09----------
so i'm just gonna go for it so


---------52:13----------
um i'm gonna talk now


---------52:16----------
okay i'm gonna use words like imagine


---------52:20----------
so like here's what i'm thinking if i


---------52:23----------
put myself in your shoes sam


---------52:26----------
you know like you said you love your


---------52:27----------
brother a lot and it can be kind of


---------52:29----------
confusing because you can love him


---------52:30----------
and you can also like sort of


---------52:33----------
you can have thoughts that you wish he


---------52:35----------
was never there right


---------52:37----------
and and you can see like what he did i


---------52:40----------
mean unclear whether


---------52:42----------
he's i don't think he split up your


---------52:44----------
parents but you know


---------52:45----------
it's it's an additional stress so a lot


---------52:47----------
of times what happens is when a special


---------52:49----------
needs child enters a family


---------52:50----------
it just exposes the weaknesses that are


---------52:52----------
already there


---------52:53----------
right it's an additional pressure um it


---------52:56----------
sounds like you really stepped up


---------52:58----------
in an amazing way between the ages of 12


---------53:00----------
and 14 and i would guess that


---------53:02----------
you don't regret that for a second and


---------53:06----------
it sucked


---------53:10----------
and and so you know i i'm kind of


---------53:12----------
hearing the same thing


---------53:13----------
about pregnancy is that i'm sure you


---------53:16----------
don't


---------53:16----------
regret it but it was awful


---------53:20----------
and you would never want to do it again


---------53:23----------
makes perfect sense right not even


---------53:26----------
having been pregnant


---------53:27----------
i can completely get behind you there


---------53:30----------
and at the same time i wonder if if you


---------53:32----------
know as someone who does sort of have


---------53:34----------
fears kind of like hang out in the back


---------53:37----------
of your mind


---------53:38----------
um i mean you have to


---------53:42----------
i guess i don't i shouldn't say that but


---------53:44----------
i i can't imagine a world in which you


---------53:46----------
haven't had a thought


---------53:47----------
about like what you're signing your son


---------53:49----------
up for if you do have


---------53:51----------
a second biological child what you're


---------53:54----------
signing like whether you're essentially


---------53:56----------
repeating history


---------53:58----------
and like what are you signing charlie up


---------54:00----------
for


---------54:01----------
and what kind of pressure is it gonna


---------54:03----------
put on you guys


---------54:06----------
and whether that sort of holds you back


---------54:11----------
i feel like ben and i are


---------54:14----------
stronger than my parents were my parents


---------54:16----------
um


---------54:17----------
from the age of about six until i was


---------54:20----------
about 12


---------54:22----------
would be separated back together


---------54:25----------
and you know i feel like my brother was


---------54:27----------
probably kind of that one last ditch


---------54:29----------
effort which obviously


---------54:30----------
very rarely works to save a marriage um


---------54:34----------
and uh so yeah they lived apart they


---------54:37----------
my dad lived in the basement they were


---------54:38----------
back together and everything was fine


---------54:40----------
and a year later


---------54:41----------
my mom would move out this time and so


---------54:43----------
on and so forth so


---------54:45----------
definitely for sure my brother was the


---------54:47----------
breaking point of them realizing that


---------54:49----------
it just isn't working yeah


---------54:53----------
and and do you ever think about what it


---------54:55----------
would mean for charlie if you guys oh


---------54:57----------
my camera just oh there we go do you


---------54:59----------
ever think about what it would mean for


---------55:00----------
charlie if you guys did have a


---------55:02----------
special needs child yeah for sure um


---------55:08----------
it it it would suck especially because


---------55:11----------
he's younger


---------55:12----------
i mean at 10 i was able to kind of grasp


---------55:15----------
the idea of what my future was going to


---------55:18----------
be like


---------55:19----------
um but let's say i get pregnant next


---------55:23----------
month


---------55:24----------
and so he'll be six by the time a baby


---------55:27----------
gets here


---------55:28----------
and you won't especially my brother's


---------55:30----------
disability


---------55:31----------
we don't know if we didn't notice it


---------55:32----------
earlier because we were more focused on


---------55:34----------
the physical disability than the mental


---------55:36----------
but we didn't know about my brother's


---------55:38----------
mental disability until he was about a


---------55:39----------
year and a half old


---------55:41----------
um because he was already so delayed


---------55:43----------
with his physical disability we just


---------55:45----------
kind of


---------55:46----------
attributed everything to that until all


---------55:48----------
of a sudden we realized that


---------55:49----------
he's not talking um


---------55:53----------
so yeah i mean of course i i


---------55:56----------
worry that that it would make


---------56:00----------
charlie's life harder and it's obviously


---------56:02----------
already hard as


---------56:03----------
an only child to have a sibling come in


---------56:05----------
sometimes at the beginning


---------56:07----------
um and i and i just think


---------56:10----------
that not that my brother has like a bad


---------56:14----------
life


---------56:15----------
at all uh but if there


---------56:19----------
there's other kids out there that are


---------56:20----------
already here


---------56:22----------
and already have a potentially


---------56:25----------
you know not so great life because


---------56:28----------
they're in the adoption system or


---------56:29----------
phosphorous system whatever


---------56:31----------
i feel like i could at least


---------56:34----------
save them maybe um


---------56:38----------
kind of thing so yeah i'm sort of


---------56:41----------
hearing like uh


---------56:42----------
you know having a biological child comes


---------56:44----------
with particular


---------56:45----------
risks and because i sam i know it sounds


---------56:49----------
kind of weird but


---------56:51----------
you know i know pregnancy is sort of


---------56:53----------
very uncomfortable and stuff but just


---------56:55----------
hearing you getting to know you a little


---------56:57----------
bit like i find it hard to believe that


---------57:00----------
and this may be me being an [ __ ] like


---------57:02----------
i think you've demonstrated so much


---------57:04----------
strength so much resilience


---------57:07----------
that i just find myself i don't know why


---------57:09----------
maybe this means i'm mean


---------57:10----------
or something but like i find myself


---------57:12----------
being a little bit surprised that that's


---------57:14----------
what would hold you back like physical


---------57:15----------
discomfort like hold you back


---------57:18----------
you know maybe i don't know you that


---------57:20----------
well but you know


---------57:24----------
i don't know i mean especially if we


---------57:25----------
have a girl like if we have a girl then


---------57:26----------
we're golden


---------57:27----------
because women don't only pass this


---------57:29----------
disorder on to their sons


---------57:31----------
very rarely do they does it show up in a


---------57:33----------
female


---------57:34----------
yeah but even then like as soon as we


---------57:36----------
found out that we were having a boy


---------57:38----------
uh both ben and i are anxiety like we


---------57:41----------
were excited but our anxiety went up and


---------57:43----------
we're like oh okay


---------57:44----------
well i mean now what how do we do we


---------57:47----------
need to start doing research what kind


---------57:48----------
of and we did the extra tests and stuff


---------57:50----------
like that beforehand


---------57:52----------
to make sure things were good but just


---------57:54----------
the anxiety of going up to that


---------57:56----------
appointment and finding out if we were


---------57:57----------
having a boy or a girl for both of us


---------57:59----------
if i remember correctly was very high we


---------58:02----------
were very excited


---------58:03----------
you know super stoked talking about the


---------58:05----------
whole week up but walking in there that


---------58:07----------
was kind of like our moment of


---------58:09----------
do we need to


---------58:12----------
do we need to potentially change and


---------58:15----------
learn a lot of stuff


---------58:16----------
in this very moment or are we going to


---------58:18----------
be okay if we have a girl


---------58:20----------
kind of thing so it sounds like you guys


---------58:23----------
were aware that there was a risk of this


---------58:25----------
when you had your first kid


---------58:28----------
correct yep and and how did you


---------58:31----------
how did you guys manage that


---------58:37----------
yeah lots of anxiety


---------58:42----------
i think it was around six months with


---------58:43----------
charlie that we that


---------58:45----------
it was very obvious that there there was


---------58:48----------
you know


---------58:49----------
nothing present uh and


---------58:52----------
even i remember after charlie was born


---------58:54----------
there was a couple times that


---------58:56----------
that ben had pulled me aside and he was


---------58:58----------
just like do you


---------58:59----------
recognize anything in charlie that that


---------59:01----------
you remember from your brother


---------59:03----------
uh just you know every randomly every


---------59:07----------
few months or whatever leading up until


---------59:09----------
we we realized that you know


---------59:10----------
we're we're good to go um


---------59:13----------
so a lot of anxiety


---------59:17----------
yeah that that makes a lot of sense


---------59:21----------
you know and and ben um can


---------59:24----------
am i have i stepped out of line yet no


---------59:27----------
i'll yell at you if you do don't worry


---------59:28----------
yeah i'm i'm just i'm not kidding i'm


---------59:31----------
relying on you to do that okay


---------59:32----------
this is stuff that she's openly talked


---------59:34----------
about with other people and that we've


---------59:36----------
talked about like


---------59:37----------
so with with her brother um


---------59:40----------
one of the things that early in our


---------59:42----------
relationship that i wanted to establish


---------59:44----------
and like


---------59:44----------
it we wrote our own vows for our wedding


---------59:47----------
and i included


---------59:48----------
in there that that her brother i keep


---------59:50----------
i'm trying to avoid saying


---------59:51----------
names just in case i'm sure but i i made


---------59:55----------
sure that she knew that i was going to


---------59:56----------
be supportive for her brother and


---------59:58----------
provide if if it came time to provide


---------60:00----------
somewhere for him to live i was


---------60:02----------
there ready to go um but like we i've


---------60:04----------
done a bunch of charity stuff with my


---------60:06----------
channel


---------60:06----------
and the first two charity streams we


---------60:08----------
ever did were for the national fragile x


---------60:10----------
foundation which is similar fragile x's


---------60:13----------
of what her brother has or something


---------60:14----------
similar to it it was just


---------60:16----------
it was such an important thing for me to


---------60:17----------
make sure that she understood because


---------60:19----------
obviously it was like such a main piece


---------60:21----------
of her life growing up it was a focus


---------60:24----------
around potentially why her parents split


---------60:26----------
up and and it was one of the


---------60:28----------
the most difficult times for her life


---------60:30----------
having to raise her brother and


---------60:32----------
like that's important to her and she's


---------60:34----------
important to me so i wanted to make sure


---------60:36----------
that


---------60:36----------
she knew that i was on board no matter


---------60:39----------
what ended up happening whether we had


---------60:41----------
to you know take her brother on as part


---------60:42----------
of our life


---------60:43----------
uh eventually whether it was earlier or


---------60:45----------
later that i was


---------60:46----------
there ready to go wow


---------60:50----------
and what you're saying sam makes a ton


---------60:51----------
of sense so can i just


---------60:53----------
share what i kind of heard from you and


---------60:56----------
i'm going to inject a little bit of my


---------60:57----------
own


---------60:58----------
um i'm going to fill in some of the gaps


---------61:00----------
in my mind so let me know if those are


---------61:01----------
like


---------61:02----------
you know could be completely off so like


---------61:05----------
i i can't imagine i mean you guys


---------61:07----------
didn't really know right like y'all


---------61:08----------
rolled the dice once


---------61:11----------
and you guys hit the jackpot with


---------61:12----------
charlie like in every way


---------61:14----------
very much and i can imagine that like


---------61:17----------
you know rolling the dice once was


---------61:19----------
bad enough and if you guys like win


---------61:22----------
right like if i bought gme at 50 cents


---------61:24----------
and it rose to 300 and i decided to sell


---------61:27----------
you know and i like like and then gme


---------61:29----------
like bob's down again like i don't even


---------61:31----------
know if i want to get back on that


---------61:32----------
roller coaster


---------61:34----------
you know i won once it's clearly enough


---------61:36----------
for me to retire on


---------61:38----------
right like you know it sounds like y'all


---------61:40----------
are happy and you guys have an amazing


---------61:42----------
son


---------61:43----------
and there's a part that's like why even


---------61:45----------
bother


---------61:46----------
and then there's also like this sort of


---------61:48----------
like two birds with one stone thing


---------61:50----------
right because


---------61:50----------
there are kids out there who don't have


---------61:53----------
such a good life


---------61:54----------
and you know if you guys decide that you


---------61:57----------
guys have the bandwidth for another kid


---------61:59----------
you can sort of like give a child who


---------62:01----------
doesn't have a promising life


---------62:03----------
like what sounds to me to be unless you


---------62:05----------
guys are really just super sociopathic


---------62:06----------
and i miss something completely


---------62:08----------
a loving home right with like two


---------62:11----------
parents who like really care about their


---------62:13----------
their child a lot their children a lot


---------62:16----------
two parents who communicate a lot


---------62:18----------
to parents who strive really hard to be


---------62:20----------
good parents


---------62:22----------
and there's already a kid out there who


---------62:24----------
doesn't have that


---------62:25----------
so you know why go back you know


---------62:30----------
why go back to the gambling table when


---------62:33----------
you know there's there's a kid out there


---------62:35----------
who may need your love and already


---------62:37----------
exists


---------62:38----------
um how is that for a summary


---------62:43----------
i would say you can hear the vacuum


---------62:45----------
cleaner our cleaning companies just


---------62:46----------
finishing up


---------62:48----------
um i mean for me that that's 100


---------62:51----------
percent like especially with um there's


---------62:54----------
been a few times


---------62:56----------
in taking photos and stuff like that


---------62:58----------
that i've had to call cps


---------62:59----------
because you know you a kid isn't smiling


---------63:03----------
and their dad takes him into the


---------63:04----------
bathroom and you can hear him


---------63:06----------
hitting the child like sorry that


---------63:08----------
flashback


---------63:09----------
um i'm having to call the cops on them


---------63:12----------
and making a huge scene


---------63:13----------
but got the kid out of there


---------63:17----------
um there's kids that are already hurting


---------63:20----------
i want to be able to help him


---------63:27----------
[Laughter]


---------63:36----------
but i'm also totally fine being three


---------63:38----------
musketeers too


---------63:40----------
he is a handful sometimes let's not


---------63:43----------
pretend that he did


---------63:44----------
i think every kid because he's a little


---------63:46----------
clone of me uh


---------63:47----------
let's remember that the three musketeers


---------63:49----------
had dartanian right


---------63:50----------
right nobody really remembered


---------63:54----------
yeah true true if there's if there's


---------63:57----------
ever


---------63:58----------
an analogy that says that you guys


---------63:59----------
should adopt it's the three musketeers


---------64:04----------
that reference is basically like there's


---------64:06----------
the three of us


---------64:07----------
and then there's a rando from the


---------64:09----------
outside that we're bringing in


---------64:11----------
it's like that


---------64:13----------
[Music]


---------64:16----------
you know younger different


---------64:20----------
you know and it's also interesting


---------64:22----------
because what i'm hearing from


---------64:24----------
if you really think about it like ben


---------64:26----------
has


---------64:27----------
it seems like a lot of ben's inspiration


---------64:29----------
to have a child actually came from a


---------64:31----------
child that wasn't his own right like


---------64:33----------
i remember still just for myself like


---------64:35----------
being


---------64:36----------
really uninterested in children


---------64:40----------
like when i was doing pediatrics and


---------64:41----------
stuff in ob gyn


---------64:43----------
like those were probably my two least


---------64:45----------
favorite rotations in medical school


---------64:47----------
and like with kids i just didn't you


---------64:49----------
know i didn't really get them like i was


---------64:50----------
good with kids


---------64:52----------
but i just had no you know i didn't


---------64:54----------
think they were particularly cute i


---------64:55----------
thought they were and then like once i


---------64:57----------
had a kid it's like some switch flipped


---------64:58----------
in my brain


---------65:00----------
and and i i know personally at least


---------65:02----------
like you know my my wife and i


---------65:04----------
routinely talk about like you know when


---------65:06----------
we'll see like an you know we visited a


---------65:08----------
friend


---------65:08----------
yesterday and they have a young kid and


---------65:10----------
just holding like you guys know the


---------65:11----------
denseness of a baby


---------65:13----------
yeah how like th you know they stay the


---------65:16----------
same weight but they just


---------65:17----------
stretch out and so like feeling that


---------65:19----------
denseness it's one of the things that i


---------65:21----------
really like you know it's just a


---------65:22----------
physical sensation that's associated


---------65:24----------
with a lot of good emotion for me just


---------65:26----------
like holding


---------65:26----------
like a baby and then we'll do it


---------65:28----------
sometimes and then like we had this


---------65:29----------
brief con


---------65:30----------
not even a conversation it was like one


---------65:32----------
exchange it was like


---------65:33----------
do you want to have another one i was


---------65:34----------
like nope i'm good and then she's like


---------65:36----------
yep


---------65:36----------
me too i i think going through it


---------65:40----------
twice i mean there are times where we


---------65:42----------
lose our minds a little bit and we think


---------65:44----------
about it but


---------65:45----------
i think we're set i think there's every


---------65:49----------
parent there's certain nights where


---------65:50----------
you crash into bed at the end of the


---------65:52----------
night and you look at each other you're


---------65:53----------
like why the hell did we decide to do


---------65:55----------
this in the first place yeah


---------65:56----------
yeah yeah


---------65:59----------
yeah so it sounds like um


---------66:02----------
hmm yeah i i'm it feels to me like this


---------66:06----------
is tied up a little bit i i don't


---------66:08----------
how do y'all feel about that i think


---------66:11----------
that's true


---------66:12----------
i mean this is one of those things that


---------66:13----------
we've talked about at least semi


---------66:15----------
regularly over the last


---------66:17----------
multiple years of being together of like


---------66:21----------
what direction do we are we going to go


---------66:24----------
if we ever go one way or another


---------66:25----------
and it's i especially with how busy busy


---------66:28----------
we are right now


---------66:30----------
because i never do you can't imagine


---------66:32----------
that this is going to be your job like i


---------66:33----------
never


---------66:34----------
i i i especially because the beginning i


---------66:36----------
got into streaming as like a side thing


---------66:38----------
right it was never really intended to be


---------66:40----------
my full-time gig and then suddenly here


---------66:42----------
we are


---------66:42----------
uh i i think it's something that we've


---------66:44----------
had a pin in just


---------66:46----------
just kind of sitting aside for a while


---------66:47----------
and it doesn't really surprise me if


---------66:49----------
if this is the way it continues to go


---------66:51----------
for a while too


---------66:53----------
jump into anything like oh yeah yeah we


---------66:57----------
tend to be pretty practical when it


---------66:59----------
comes to doing most things in our life


---------67:01----------
i'm not impulsive i sit in my basement


---------67:03----------
and play video games all day this is


---------67:05----------
nice


---------67:06----------
you know it's not like hey let's just


---------67:07----------
have a kid today for fun it's that's not


---------67:09----------
the kind of


---------67:10----------
that's not the kind of decision making


---------67:12----------
you're gonna find here yeah you don't


---------67:14----------
just


---------67:14----------
randomly change your raid schedule just


---------67:16----------
for any random


---------67:18----------
any random exactly thank you you have to


---------67:21----------
align the 39 other people


---------67:24----------
and shift them two hours into the future


---------67:27----------
now i before anybody goes after that one


---------67:29----------
that was


---------67:30----------
this was like a i need to change what


---------67:32----------
i'm doing just so everybody knows and


---------67:34----------
then


---------67:34----------
people jumped on board with that it


---------67:36----------
wasn't like you change or go aft


---------67:38----------
yourself


---------67:38----------
kind of thing so i was i i try not to


---------67:41----------
pressure people to do stuff they don't


---------67:42----------
want to do


---------67:44----------
um i'm sure that you know interacting


---------67:47----------
with the wow guild


---------67:48----------
quite so intensely actually probably


---------67:50----------
actually helped you in your marriage to


---------67:51----------
be honest because i i find that there's


---------67:53----------
a lot of communication that has to


---------67:54----------
happen in


---------67:55----------
a successful wow killed i think it got


---------67:57----------
me ready to


---------67:58----------
to be a father too because the amount of


---------68:00----------
parenting you feel like you have to do


---------68:01----------
something yeah absolutely the amount of


---------68:03----------
yelling that would come out of


---------68:04----------
that room when you were raiding


---------68:06----------
sometimes especially when you became


---------68:08----------
raid leader because you didn't start out


---------68:09----------
as a raid leader you you eventually came


---------68:11----------
into being like the full guild


---------68:13----------
leader and stuff like that too like the


---------68:15----------
amount of yelling


---------68:17----------
all the memes that came out of that


---------68:19----------
there was a lot of parenting practice


---------68:21----------
yeah


---------68:22----------
he's adopted many an orphan over the


---------68:24----------
yeah exactly


---------68:27----------
um one thing that i do want to say sam


---------68:29----------
just you know this isn't something we


---------68:31----------
have to get into now but


---------68:32----------
um or i would actually recommend against


---------68:35----------
it but


---------68:36----------
something that i just sort of like want


---------68:37----------
to mention to you is


---------68:39----------
i've worked with a lot of people with


---------68:40----------
chronic lyme and um


---------68:42----------
you know we're not entirely sure what


---------68:44----------
chronic lyme is do you guys want to


---------68:46----------
explain just for the audience like if


---------68:48----------
you feel comfort i mean you guys


---------68:49----------
have already mentioned it but can you


---------68:51----------
explain uh to people like what your


---------68:53----------
understanding of what chronic lyme is


---------68:55----------
um as far as like how it feels and stuff


---------68:58----------
or


---------68:59----------
just what is it uh basically it


---------69:03----------
tick bites you and uh then


---------69:06----------
you never remember scientific words but


---------69:08----------
basically


---------69:09----------
you become sick with the what's inside


---------69:12----------
the tick uh


---------69:13----------
you can usually treat it right away with


---------69:15----------
antibiotics and most people are good to


---------69:17----------
go but if it's caught later it kind of


---------69:19----------
spreads


---------69:20----------
and hides throughout your body and


---------69:23----------
um you can either like just blast


---------69:26----------
yourself with antibiotics non-stop


---------69:28----------
and try and see if you can catch it all


---------69:29----------
or you with the doctor that i will go


---------69:31----------
with we are just now kind of treating


---------69:33----------
the symptoms


---------69:34----------
um symptoms are different for everybody


---------69:36----------
which makes it very difficult


---------69:38----------
to diagnose it's also just very


---------69:39----------
difficult to diagnose in the first place


---------69:42----------
for uh the type of illness that it is


---------69:45----------
and um and who knows maybe maybe my


---------69:48----------
doctor


---------69:49----------
diagnosed me incorrectly too but uh for


---------69:52----------
me


---------69:53----------
it's a lot of joint and muscle pain


---------69:56----------
um and a lot of fatigue uh


---------70:00----------
before i got on my medication which


---------70:03----------
kind of helps me a little bit but i was


---------70:05----------
taking anywhere between


---------70:07----------
three to five naps a day going between


---------70:09----------
30 minutes to two hours


---------70:11----------
um and and the thick of it and now


---------70:14----------
i usually need to take one 30 to


---------70:18----------
40 minute nap a day if i don't get it


---------70:20----------
then i just


---------70:21----------
become really cranky um but


---------70:25----------
uh if i if i try to think back to


---------70:28----------
what tired was to me because my first


---------70:31----------
doctor just told me i was tired because


---------70:33----------
i had a kid


---------70:34----------
um and if i think back to like


---------70:38----------
the tiredness that i feel right now and


---------70:40----------
it's been four hours since i took my


---------70:42----------
medicine this morning uh


---------70:44----------
i could go to sleep and sleep for a


---------70:47----------
whole night's worth of rest


---------70:48----------
right now wow and be 100


---------70:52----------
okay with that uh but i can't like i


---------70:54----------
can't you know sleep all day long


---------70:56----------
so i just pushed through it the the one


---------70:59----------
thing i would


---------71:00----------
say sam so it's kind of weird but i'd


---------71:02----------
say probably like historically five


---------71:04----------
percent of people in my practice have


---------71:06----------
had chronic lyme


---------71:08----------
and and um i do a lot of work that's


---------71:10----------
sort of like in complementary and


---------71:11----------
alternative medicine


---------71:13----------
and what i've actually found is that


---------71:14----------
there's some weird immune stuff


---------71:16----------
i don't really know what's going on with


---------71:17----------
chronic lyme and they have they'll have


---------71:19----------
their lyme doctors


---------71:20----------
but i have seen a lot of like clinical


---------71:22----------
improvement through


---------71:23----------
some like things like psychotherapy now


---------71:25----------
a lot of people will think that if


---------71:27----------
psychotherapy


---------71:28----------
helps chronic lyme does that mean that


---------71:30----------
it's all in your head i really don't


---------71:32----------
think so


---------71:33----------
because like you're saying there there


---------71:34----------
are physical symptoms that are


---------71:36----------
not really psychological right it's like


---------71:39----------
very clearly something


---------71:40----------
physical is going on but we do know for


---------71:42----------
example that meditation


---------71:44----------
improves like immune markers and things


---------71:46----------
like rheumatoid arthritis


---------71:48----------
in lupus other autoimmune or electronic


---------71:51----------
like


---------71:52----------
immune or infectious states um and


---------71:55----------
and so i don't know exactly how this


---------71:57----------
works but just having you know talk to


---------71:58----------
you for a little bit there's like


---------72:00----------
there's actually a lot of emotion like


---------72:02----------
right under the surface that i think you


---------72:03----------
carry with you


---------72:05----------
um you kind of mentioned that you know


---------72:06----------
fears


---------72:08----------
they don't rent in your mind they buy


---------72:11----------
and they pay mortgages


---------72:13----------
and and so interestingly enough like i


---------72:15----------
i've seen some benefit from that and i


---------72:17----------
was just gonna say it may be something


---------72:18----------
that you wanna like you could think


---------72:20----------
about just in terms of like


---------72:21----------
if i tend to think about the body as


---------72:23----------
like a body and mind as a unit right


---------72:26----------
and if you're holding on if your mind is


---------72:28----------
trying to process or holding on to like


---------72:30----------
negative emotion


---------72:31----------
it just doesn't quite have the ram to


---------72:33----------
deal with


---------72:35----------
you know the physical stuff like you


---------72:36----------
can't do both if you think about


---------72:38----------
you know stress and pregnancy like you


---------72:39----------
just can't you could be stressed out or


---------72:41----------
you can be pregnant you can't be both


---------72:43----------
because that's like all


---------72:44----------
your your body and your mind can handle


---------72:46----------
yeah


---------72:47----------
just something to think about that you


---------72:49----------
know i've seen a lot of people find


---------72:51----------
some benefit doesn't mean that it's


---------72:52----------
psychological and origin i really don't


---------72:54----------
think it is


---------72:55----------
but um you know just letting go because


---------72:57----------
i can imagine you also feel like guilty


---------72:58----------
for having some of those thoughts that


---------73:00----------
you had about your brother in the past


---------73:01----------
because you do love him so much and


---------73:04----------
and like i found that you know their way


---------73:07----------
you know you you can let those you can


---------73:09----------
you can evict those fears if you


---------73:11----------
you know you try um


---------73:14----------
if you're lucky and if you give it a


---------73:16----------
shot so just something to think about


---------73:18----------
i hope that wasn't out of line no


---------73:20----------
definitely i definitely felt like a lot


---------73:22----------
of relief


---------73:23----------
uh i've done yoga on and off in


---------73:25----------
meditation on and off throughout my life


---------73:27----------
but


---------73:27----------
in the past four years i've definitely


---------73:29----------
like really dug into it


---------73:31----------
and sometimes like that's all i need is


---------73:33----------
just like 10-15 minutes to just go


---------73:36----------
if i get overwhelmed because i'm so


---------73:37----------
tired of things i just need to


---------73:39----------
step away and you know zen for a minute


---------73:43----------
yeah absolutely um so i i noticed that


---------73:46----------
we were supposed to talk about parenting


---------73:48----------
today


---------73:49----------
and i don't think we quite


---------73:53----------
got there how do y'all feel about that


---------73:56----------
if this is the way you want it to go


---------73:58----------
then that's i mean that's fine with me


---------74:00----------
it i think this is an opportunity for


---------74:01----------
you to ask away if there's anything


---------74:03----------
uh related to how where what we do and


---------74:06----------
with charlie and all that i mean now's


---------74:07----------
the time right


---------74:09----------
uh sure i mean how how do y'all feel i


---------74:11----------
mean this is


---------74:14----------
what i'm i've always been open to


---------74:16----------
talking about


---------74:17----------
feelings like i've never found it useful


---------74:20----------
to


---------74:21----------
you know hide feelings or or anything


---------74:23----------
like that so talking about all the all


---------74:26----------
that with


---------74:26----------
pregnancy and everything and babies and


---------74:30----------
cool like i think it's definitely


---------74:31----------
something afterwards that ben and i will


---------74:33----------
sit down and kind of probably go over


---------74:34----------
like the


---------74:35----------
the notes version of of everything


---------74:37----------
together so


---------74:39----------
ben do you do you want to talk about


---------74:41----------
charlie


---------74:44----------
i could talk about charlie all day


---------74:48----------
yeah so let's just i'm i'm a little bit


---------74:50----------
curious maybe we can just kind of get


---------74:52----------
like a short version but like


---------74:53----------
so uh if you don't mind me you know


---------74:55----------
don't share any information that


---------74:57----------
yeah isn't but like ballpark of how old


---------75:00----------
he is


---------75:01----------
uh he's five and a half is [ __ ] enough


---------75:04----------
okay


---------75:05----------
um and so what's it like you know being


---------75:08----------
just


---------75:08----------
being a streamer running a streaming


---------75:10----------
business and


---------75:11----------
having a kid he


---------75:15----------
is um the smartest


---------75:18----------
little human being i think i've ever met


---------75:20----------
and that ends up being really really


---------75:21----------
good he


---------75:22----------
he's reading it like first second grade


---------75:24----------
level already um


---------75:26----------
he's working on math stuff he can


---------75:28----------
articulate himself really well


---------75:29----------
he speaks clearly uh he


---------75:32----------
the other side of that though is like he


---------75:34----------
is wildly inquisitive


---------75:36----------
about everything so sometimes so i'm in


---------75:40----------
my my studio right now and sam will


---------75:41----------
bring me


---------75:42----------
coffee or lunch or whatever because i


---------75:44----------
obviously with streaming you have to be


---------75:45----------
engaged with your chat the entire time


---------75:47----------
or


---------75:47----------
doing something they don't like you just


---------75:48----------
sitting there doing nothing um


---------75:50----------
and so he'll come down with her but it's


---------75:53----------
like a


---------75:54----------
10 minute process of him going through


---------75:56----------
every little shiny because i got a lot


---------75:57----------
of toys in this room it's like this is


---------75:59----------
i don't blame him at all it's like a


---------76:01----------
shiny lights freaking playground


---------76:03----------
the of of all sorts of stuff to look at


---------76:06----------
and mess with that he's never messed


---------76:07----------
with before because just it sits down


---------76:09----------
here


---------76:10----------
but that spreads to so many other


---------76:13----------
aspects of our


---------76:16----------
conversation our engagement with him is


---------76:18----------
like


---------76:19----------
questioning of everything and i know


---------76:21----------
that's part of like being five


---------76:23----------
and trying to get a handle


---------76:26----------
of the social back and forth like at


---------76:29----------
that age obviously he doesn't


---------76:30----------
he doesn't know all social cues he


---------76:32----------
doesn't know yeah when is


---------76:34----------
appropriate or not appropriate to talk


---------76:35----------
he doesn't know about


---------76:37----------
like we're working on raising our hand


---------76:39----------
uh right now to get


---------76:40----------
to get a question in or like hey mommy


---------76:43----------
hey daddy i have something to say


---------76:44----------
but he's he's so he's almost like smart


---------76:47----------
to a


---------76:48----------
to a point of frustration for me because


---------76:52----------
he's a lot like me and that it's like a


---------76:54----------
i want to absorb all the knowledge that


---------76:56----------
i possibly can


---------76:57----------
even for him if it's that if it's like


---------76:59----------
to a point of


---------77:00----------
inconvenience for someone else he's like


---------77:03----------
now is the time to answer this question


---------77:05----------
mommy or daddy let's let's talk about


---------77:06----------
whatever this thing is that i want to


---------77:07----------
know about


---------77:10----------
yeah it's interesting um you know you're


---------77:13----------
you talk about his intelligence as a


---------77:15----------
double-edged sword almost


---------77:17----------
oh yeah i mean almost i i know that i


---------77:20----------
shouldn't look at it like that because i


---------77:21----------
would


---------77:22----------
i no you absolutely should you think so


---------77:25----------
absolutely so i had a supervisor who


---------77:28----------
blew my mind


---------77:29----------
one day so like i think we see this a


---------77:31----------
lot in


---------77:32----------
in you know the gaming community she


---------77:34----------
once told me something that


---------77:36----------
she said that a gifted child is actually


---------77:39----------
a special needs child


---------77:41----------
because if you really think about it


---------77:42----------
they actually have needs that the


---------77:44----------
average


---------77:45----------
child may not have right and when we


---------77:47----------
think about special needs we tend to


---------77:49----------
think about it sort of like in a in a


---------77:50----------
negative capacity in terms of like


---------77:52----------
inability to do things


---------77:54----------
but i mean i've seen this time and time


---------77:56----------
and time again with like you know


---------77:57----------
i was sort of this way where like i was


---------78:00----------
smart you know growing up


---------78:01----------
and i was kind of like a little bit


---------78:03----------
precocious and


---------78:04----------
and like i struggled a lot kind of


---------78:07----------
because of that


---------78:08----------
and and we see this a lot with sort of


---------78:10----------
like these burnt out like gifted kids


---------78:12----------
right like you're gifted and that comes


---------78:15----------
with a whole


---------78:17----------
pile of stuff like expectations


---------78:19----------
capabilities


---------78:20----------
frustration um some of the worst


---------78:23----------
situations that i've ever seen or when


---------78:25----------
you have a kid who's like very gifted


---------78:26----------
and has a high iq but also has something


---------78:29----------
like bad adhd or bad anxiety and then


---------78:32----------
they can feel like really really


---------78:34----------
stupid right they can feel a lot of


---------78:36----------
shame and stuff like that so


---------78:38----------
i i think that you know it's kind of


---------78:40----------
interesting because


---------78:41----------
i would absolutely you know


---------78:44----------
view almost everything about your kid as


---------78:46----------
a double-edged sword


---------78:48----------
um and that any capability can be like


---------78:50----------
healthy in one circumstance and also


---------78:52----------
like creates its own challenges and


---------78:53----------
needs in another


---------78:56----------
but i'm sure you guys know that yeah


---------79:00----------
it it first came like really stuck in my


---------79:03----------
head that


---------79:04----------
that he is you know everybody says that


---------79:07----------
their kid is the cutest and the smartest


---------79:09----------
and stuff like that so


---------79:10----------
this is mom bragging right now that the


---------79:12----------
first hit


---------79:13----------
when we were going to the library and he


---------79:15----------
started asking about chapter books at


---------79:17----------
five years old


---------79:18----------
and now he he doesn't read you know like


---------79:21----------
the regular


---------79:22----------
small print chapter books but he has the


---------79:24----------
early reader books of like eight


---------79:26----------
chapters or so


---------79:26----------
and he reads it all in the night and


---------79:28----------
he's just like all right where's the


---------79:29----------
next one and i was like okay


---------79:31----------
like i liked reading when i was a kid


---------79:33----------
but not like this


---------79:34----------
he just wants to absorb all the


---------79:36----------
knowledge we're


---------79:37----------
watch so many youtube videos about how


---------79:39----------
to fix flat tires


---------79:41----------
because he wants to just know how to fix


---------79:45----------
flat he's obsessed with flat tires so he


---------79:47----------
wants to know just in case


---------79:48----------
we somebody gets a flat tire he wants to


---------79:50----------
be the one to be able to help people


---------79:53----------
fix the flat tire he wants what's that


---------79:55----------
that youtube guy that he


---------79:56----------
he was watching what was that what's the


---------79:59----------
what's the youtube channel that he was


---------80:00----------
watching chris


---------80:01----------
chris fix this dude does like pov uh


---------80:05----------
of like fixing car parts and stuff like


---------80:07----------
that


---------80:08----------
and it's like he could he could watch it


---------80:10----------
for an entire day and know all about


---------80:12----------
this stuff in the inside of a car i'm


---------80:13----------
like


---------80:14----------
he's gonna know more about cars than i


---------80:16----------
do it in like


---------80:18----------
you give him a week he'll have it down


---------80:19----------
pat yeah


---------80:22----------
i mean i'm kind of i'm kind of wondering


---------80:23----------
whether he was like watching


---------80:26----------
when he saw his dad come to his mom's


---------80:27----------
rescue


---------80:29----------
when her car wasn't working


---------80:37----------
he just has such lofty goals for being a


---------80:39----------
kid he wants to be


---------80:41----------
uh an engineer and a scientist we just


---------80:43----------
learned about what a roboticist is so


---------80:45----------
now he wants to be a roboticist and he


---------80:47----------
wants to make robots


---------80:48----------
that uh the robot he wants to make


---------80:52----------
for saint jude because you do a lot of


---------80:53----------
work for saint jude so he's very aware


---------80:55----------
of of what goes on there


---------80:57----------
is he wants to make a robot that if a


---------80:59----------
kid doesn't want to go to their


---------81:00----------
appointment the robot will go pick up


---------81:01----------
the kid


---------81:02----------
and bring him into their appointment


---------81:05----------
it's great


---------81:09----------
my my older kid is somewhere between


---------81:12----------
wanting to be a


---------81:14----------
princess an artist


---------81:17----------
and a doctor the younger kid is trying


---------81:20----------
to decide


---------81:21----------
whether what kind of demon she wants to


---------81:24----------
be


---------81:25----------
i want to be her when i grow up because


---------81:28----------
like when they're playing pretend like


---------81:29----------
one of them is like


---------81:30----------
i'm a princess or a queen the other


---------81:32----------
one's like i'm a monster


---------81:34----------
[Laughter]


---------81:36----------
it's interesting they're they're very


---------81:37----------
different um


---------81:40----------
yeah so in any any kind of like uh


---------81:43----------
you know it sounds like charlie's an


---------81:44----------
amazing kid it sounds like you guys are


---------81:45----------
kind of treating him


---------81:47----------
um you know you're not using a standard


---------81:49----------
playbook i think you guys are kind of


---------81:51----------
develop like writing the playbook as you


---------81:53----------
go i'm really hearing that from y'all is


---------81:54----------
that fair to say


---------81:55----------
yeah i think so and anything um


---------81:58----------
you know anything that you would say to


---------82:02----------
you know streamers or people kind of


---------82:04----------
thinking about having kids in terms of


---------82:06----------
like


---------82:07----------
how to make it work well right because


---------82:10----------
like


---------82:10----------
most streamers i mean like i i know you


---------82:12----------
know ben


---------82:13----------
and i and and we're not going to comment


---------82:15----------
on sam's age because i'm sure he's


---------82:17----------
very young because she's older that's


---------82:20----------
ridiculous


---------82:21----------
i don't believe it um


---------82:24----------
you know so i've walked the tightrope as


---------82:27----------
well my friend


---------82:28----------
you know um but i think streamers you


---------82:31----------
know are getting older i think we work


---------82:33----------
with a fair number of streamers that are


---------82:35----------
you know concerned about like how to


---------82:36----------
find like a healthy relationship


---------82:38----------
and or thinking about having kids and


---------82:39----------
stuff like that i mean


---------82:41----------
what would you say to people who are


---------82:43----------
sort of like on the fence or


---------82:44----------
trying to figure out how to do it um


---------82:48----------
i think that everybody's journey is


---------82:51----------
going to end up being different it's


---------82:53----------
going to be a personal thing


---------82:54----------
that leads them one way or another in


---------82:57----------
fact


---------82:57----------
if anything there's a strong parallel


---------82:59----------
between being a parent and being a


---------83:01----------
streamer and that their people can write


---------83:03----------
people can give advice and write all


---------83:05----------
sorts of books about how to do it and


---------83:07----------
how to make it and how to raise your kid


---------83:08----------
and all that but there are so many


---------83:10----------
different


---------83:10----------
one-off scenarios instances of every


---------83:12----------
single person


---------83:14----------
every kid every stream being different


---------83:16----------
like


---------83:18----------
you almost you you can gather so much


---------83:20----------
information


---------83:21----------
and it's still not going to give you the


---------83:23----------
right answer and so having


---------83:25----------
have being able to like roll with the


---------83:27----------
punches is probably the most important


---------83:29----------
thing


---------83:30----------
for me that's that looking at it looking


---------83:31----------
back at it now it's like


---------83:33----------
as charlie has developed as a kid and as


---------83:36----------
my career has


---------83:37----------
grown and changed over time it's like


---------83:40----------
what what


---------83:41----------
what works one day might not work the


---------83:42----------
next day and you just got to be okay


---------83:44----------
with that and figure out what the next


---------83:45----------
thing is going to be


---------83:47----------
to continue to grow in the right way


---------83:51----------
well set same anything you want to add


---------83:52----------
to that i would definitely say that


---------83:55----------
there's


---------83:55----------
never a good time to have a kid


---------83:59----------
like you know everyone's just like you


---------84:00----------
know we're going to wait until we have


---------84:01----------
this and we do this and we do that and


---------84:03----------
yada yada


---------84:05----------
you're never going to find an


---------84:06----------
opportunity where you're like


---------84:08----------
everything's lined up perfectly let's


---------84:09----------
have a child now kind of thing


---------84:11----------
uh and that and also


---------84:16----------
kind of adding on to ben is that you


---------84:18----------
need to be okay with


---------84:20----------
things constantly changing um and


---------84:24----------
especially with like parents that want


---------84:28----------
to stream and they start out kind of


---------84:29----------
just like


---------84:30----------
part-time but they love it and they want


---------84:31----------
to do it so much that they want to go


---------84:33----------
full-time that they don't really


---------84:36----------
kind of think too much of the back end


---------84:38----------
like they think that they're going to


---------84:40----------
make enough money


---------84:41----------
and then they end up struggling and it


---------84:44----------
ends up


---------84:45----------
you know harming their family because


---------84:47----------
they can't pay their bills or whatever


---------84:49----------
and then


---------84:49----------
the parents mental health is low so then


---------84:52----------
they start getting more frustrated and


---------84:53----------
then they take it out on their kids


---------84:55----------
without really realizing it and stuff


---------84:57----------
and um


---------84:59----------
i think especially with being a parent


---------85:02----------
first and then going into streaming


---------85:04----------
you really need to not put your dreams


---------85:08----------
aside


---------85:08----------
not saying that because you can do all


---------85:10----------
the things you want to as a parent and


---------85:11----------
stuff too


---------85:12----------
uh but definitely keeping


---------85:15----------
the whole family in mind


---------85:18----------
you gotta have a plan yeah well yeah


---------85:21----------
when you have a backup plan we had a


---------85:22----------
backup plan


---------85:23----------
i mean when ben started and he jumped


---------85:26----------
from uh


---------85:26----------
working in his corporate job to working


---------85:29----------
in


---------85:29----------
in streaming only we had a backup plan


---------85:31----------
that if he


---------85:32----------
went below a certain number within the


---------85:34----------
first six months he was going to get a


---------85:36----------
part-time job somewhere to supplement it


---------85:38----------
when i jumped from my corporate studio


---------85:41----------
job to starting my own business we made


---------85:42----------
an agreement that i would have a


---------85:44----------
three-year part-time job


---------85:45----------
uh just to make sure that i could


---------85:47----------
supplement uh


---------85:48----------
with everything in the day i hit three


---------85:51----------
years at that part-time job i bounced


---------85:53----------
um and thankfully for ben it only went


---------85:55----------
up from there for him but


---------85:57----------
we we made a plan and we put a timeline


---------86:00----------
on it and it's not just uh


---------86:02----------
if we can't afford food then i'll do


---------86:04----------
this it's like


---------86:05----------
you know if you're gonna do this have


---------86:07----------
steps of where you


---------86:09----------
feel like you can be in what is


---------86:11----------
plausible and feasible for your family


---------86:14----------
yeah i beautifully put i mean i think


---------86:17----------
i'm really hearing you guys


---------86:18----------
sort of say like you know planning for


---------86:21----------
eventualities and planning contingencies


---------86:23----------
like


---------86:24----------
you know it's fine to chase your dreams


---------86:25----------
but do so in a practical manner


---------86:28----------
i think too often we kind of think about


---------86:30----------
oh like you know like i mean we do a lot


---------86:32----------
of work with parents and kids


---------86:33----------
um but these are kids that you know


---------86:36----------
maybe have a video game addiction


---------86:37----------
or i think really the primary problem is


---------86:39----------
communication but


---------86:41----------
and you know the kid will will come to


---------86:43----------
the parent will say like oh


---------86:44----------
you know i want to go pro and then like


---------86:47----------
they feel like their parent is not


---------86:48----------
supportive


---------86:50----------
and and and sometimes they're not


---------86:52----------
supportive but


---------86:54----------
i think there's just a very practical


---------86:55----------
you know you got to plan for it i know


---------86:57----------
we were the same way so when when i was


---------86:58----------
starting healthy gamer i sort of scaled


---------87:00----------
back on my day job but i would i would


---------87:02----------
literally work like nights and weekends


---------87:03----------
to like support the family


---------87:05----------
um and and you know that's just sort of


---------87:07----------
like what we had to do because we had to


---------87:09----------
make ends meet


---------87:10----------
um and and so you kind of got to do what


---------87:13----------
you got to do if it's working part-time


---------87:14----------
on the side for three years and then


---------87:16----------
bouncing and then like i still remember


---------87:18----------
like you know quitting from my nights


---------87:21----------
and weekends job because that was like


---------87:22----------
time away from my family that


---------87:24----------
that was a high price to pay but you


---------87:27----------
know we felt like


---------87:28----------
it was the right thing to do and it


---------87:30----------
feels good for us is


---------87:32----------
we always remember that everything is a


---------87:33----------
season


---------87:35----------
like with when ben was working


---------87:38----------
basically full-time at his corporate job


---------87:40----------
and full-time streaming on nights and


---------87:42----------
weekends


---------87:43----------
we knew that in order for it to be


---------87:45----------
possible


---------87:46----------
that's just what it needed to be and it


---------87:48----------
wasn't gonna be forever


---------87:50----------
because we were both gonna put our heads


---------87:51----------
down and work our asses off to make it


---------87:53----------
work


---------87:54----------
and and then it was and then it got to a


---------87:56----------
point where you know he was able to


---------87:58----------
to just do one thing and then he had


---------88:01----------
more time again so


---------88:03----------
awesome yeah i i


---------88:06----------
thank you guys so much for kind of


---------88:08----------
sharing some of your perspectives some


---------88:09----------
of your experience


---------88:10----------
um you know i know i've asked you for


---------88:12----------
permission a thousand times whether i


---------88:14----------
push too hard


---------88:15----------
i'm glad you guys um you know feel like


---------88:17----------
i didn't overstep i


---------88:18----------
i think it was you know i think it's an


---------88:21----------
important conversation to have


---------88:22----------
it's really fascinating to hear how you


---------88:26----------
guys have gotten to where you


---------88:27----------
are sounds like y'all are just uh maybe


---------88:30----------
not


---------88:30----------
just getting started but in the mid game


---------88:32----------
you know because you all have been


---------88:33----------
together now for 14 years


---------88:36----------
i'm saying that's still just getting


---------88:37----------
started no no


---------88:39----------
no no please say we're at least halfway


---------88:41----------
through the movie right yeah no i think


---------88:43----------
i think it's squarely in the mid game


---------88:44----------
like most people that we interview on


---------88:46----------
stream or like in the early game you


---------88:47----------
guys sound like you're in the mid game


---------88:49----------
um you know where it's like y'all are


---------88:51----------
high level now you've got some decent


---------88:53----------
items you know you're like


---------88:54----------
you're level 45 or maybe like a 55


---------88:57----------
approaching end game content and


---------88:59----------
that's where you guys are you know


---------89:02----------

---------90:36----------
you know there's uh i started playing


---------90:38----------
gif one game that my five and a half


---------90:40----------
year old really likes which is loot


---------90:42----------
you guys heard of this i don't think i


---------90:44----------
have no so


---------90:45----------
so it's it's i i mean i think charlie


---------90:47----------
will be fine for it so i think it's


---------90:48----------
actually for like eight-year-olds or


---------90:49----------
ten-year-olds or whatever but you know


---------90:51----------
if you just playing connect four and


---------90:52----------
stuff


---------90:53----------
um it's a cool game and and


---------90:56----------
you know i'll send you guys like a link


---------90:57----------
or whatever but it's like you get you


---------90:59----------
know


---------91:00----------
i think you all will like it um


---------91:03----------
but yeah i think thank you guys very


---------91:05----------
much for coming on from my perspective i


---------91:06----------
i you know i i feel like we're at a kind


---------91:08----------
of decent stopping point


---------91:10----------
uh but i want to give you all a chance


---------91:12----------
to ask questions if you guys have


---------91:14----------
questions for me or or you know anything


---------91:16----------
that you feel like we should talk about


---------91:17----------
more


---------91:20----------
samantha kind of think


---------91:24----------
i don't think i have any other questions


---------91:27----------
i know i i think it's been


---------91:28----------
a long time since either of us had an


---------91:31----------
opportunity to just talk to somebody


---------91:33----------
about our relationship and being


---------91:35----------
especially being a parent which is crazy


---------91:37----------
to think that he's


---------91:38----------
literally almost six and i've never


---------91:40----------
really had a chance to sit down with


---------91:42----------
somebody


---------91:43----------
and say hey here's my thoughts on what


---------91:45----------
it's like being a parent so i


---------91:47----------
i guess i appreciate the opportunity to


---------91:49----------
talk about it because it is


---------91:50----------
it's kind of relieving especially like


---------91:52----------
talking about how smart he is and how


---------91:53----------
frustrating it can be


---------91:54----------
and and what it's like being a parent to


---------91:57----------
a kid that's that age that wants to


---------91:59----------
absorb


---------91:59----------
all the knowledge but also seems to just


---------92:02----------
not listen to you sometimes


---------92:04----------
flat out told us that he hears us every


---------92:07----------
time he just


---------92:08----------
chooses not to answer


---------92:11----------
it's such a little [ __ ] sometimes when


---------92:12----------
it comes to that but it's but like


---------92:14----------
that's just


---------92:14----------
i think it's part of rolling with those


---------92:16----------
punches and figuring out how to work


---------92:18----------
with that


---------92:19----------
without ripping all your hair out you


---------92:21----------
know


---------92:22----------
um you know ben one kind of quick


---------92:24----------
response to that as i feel like i


---------92:25----------
actually haven't given you the


---------92:27----------
opportunity to really have


---------92:28----------
that conversation in depth for which i


---------92:30----------
apologize because i think we've talked a


---------92:32----------
lot more about y'all's relationship


---------92:34----------
and if you know if there's some way that


---------92:35----------
i can be helpful to you down the road


---------92:38----------
um one thing that just as a random aside


---------92:41----------
like one thing that i've come to


---------92:42----------
appreciate is that


---------92:44----------
my kids have a different ayurvedic dosha


---------92:46----------
which i don't know if you guys have ever


---------92:48----------
heard about this but


---------92:49----------
in traditional indian medicine they do a


---------92:51----------
lot of like


---------92:52----------
cognitive fingerprinting would be the


---------92:54----------
best way that i would put it


---------92:56----------
so you know each person is different but


---------92:58----------
depending on their like cognitive nature


---------93:00----------
so for example


---------93:01----------
uh sam has a tendency to hold on to


---------93:04----------
things


---------93:05----------
right like it's neither good nor bad i


---------93:07----------
mean it's just she has the capacity to


---------93:09----------
hold on


---------93:09----------
so she holds on to things that will make


---------93:13----------
her more resilient


---------93:14----------
and she will hold on to negative


---------93:16----------
feelings the same way


---------93:18----------
um and and so there there are some


---------93:20----------
things that i've really found that are


---------93:21----------
like really have been helpful for


---------93:23----------
raising my kids once i sort of


---------93:24----------
understand what their cognitive


---------93:26----------
fingerprint is


---------93:27----------
like the your child is intelligent and


---------93:29----------
defiant


---------93:30----------
right he's gonna do things his way and


---------93:33----------
and like so how do you like sort of


---------93:36----------
recognizing that


---------93:37----------
there are certain attributes so like


---------93:39----------
like in in ayurveda it sounds like he


---------93:41----------
actually is a


---------93:42----------
vata peter which means that his primary


---------93:44----------
like cognitive elements are wind and


---------93:46----------
fire


---------93:47----------
so he picks things up quickly he gets


---------93:50----------
kind of focused on them


---------93:52----------
so he's kind of like fire like he'll


---------93:53----------
burn in a straight line if he needs to


---------93:55----------
but then he'll also kind of change


---------93:56----------
direction


---------93:58----------
i'm not getting the sense that he does


---------94:00----------
hold on to things


---------94:01----------
i would also say that like i know this


---------94:03----------
sounds weird because i've never seen


---------94:04----------
your kid before but i'd say that he has


---------94:07----------
ben's nose probably doesn't have the


---------94:11----------
roundness


---------94:12----------
of sam's face


---------94:16----------
um he's my cheeks he has these oh he


---------94:19----------
does have okay so yeah


---------94:21----------
he has ben's fate i gave him my eyes and


---------94:23----------
cheeks and that's it


---------94:26----------
yeah so there are a lot of interesting


---------94:27----------
things so it turns out the genetics


---------94:29----------
actually correlate between physical


---------94:31----------
characteristics so if you look at people


---------94:32----------
who have a wind type mind


---------94:34----------
that that if you take a thousand people


---------94:36----------
with wind type minds


---------94:38----------
and a thousand people with fire type


---------94:39----------
minds and you look at their genetic


---------94:41----------
alleles


---------94:41----------
that the thousand people with wind type


---------94:43----------
minds actually have


---------94:44----------
share common genes and that uh


---------94:48----------
fire type mines share common genes as


---------94:50----------
well because it sounds like


---------94:51----------
uh charlie is a lot like my younger


---------94:53----------
daughter um


---------94:54----------
in terms of just temperament and how


---------94:56----------
quickly she picks up


---------94:57----------
how quickly he picks up things and stuff


---------94:59----------
like that and so i'm just


---------95:01----------
i'm kind of thinking you know we didn't


---------95:02----------
really get a chance to talk about it too


---------95:04----------
much and i'm not sure exactly what to do


---------95:06----------
about that at this point but


---------95:07----------
maybe you know if you guys have other


---------95:09----------
questions or whatever or


---------95:10----------
you'll ever want to come back on and


---------95:12----------
actually talk about charlie and what


---------95:13----------
it's


---------95:14----------
like you know because i kind of steered


---------95:15----------
things towards y'all as opposed to him


---------95:17----------
um just want to toss that out there i


---------95:21----------
i think i would be down for something


---------95:22----------
like that yeah because it is one of


---------95:24----------
those


---------95:24----------
i we we've gone along on this journey


---------95:27----------
kind of just the two of


---------95:28----------
us with the expertise we have in the


---------95:29----------
back end especially


---------95:31----------
samantha way more than myself with the


---------95:33----------
experience with kids because of her


---------95:35----------
previous jobs and her experience with


---------95:36----------
her brother


---------95:37----------
uh knows a lot more about what working


---------95:40----------
with kids is like compared to


---------95:42----------
my experience is basically just boy and


---------95:44----------
that's it um


---------95:46----------
but it's it's definitely an experience


---------95:49----------
that i think


---------95:51----------
has been it's been 99


---------95:54----------
positive and there's also that that


---------95:56----------
portion that small bit that's like


---------95:58----------
man i just want to rip my damn hair out


---------96:01----------
sometimes because it's like


---------96:02----------
it like she said uh he he openly admits


---------96:06----------
that he hears us and sometimes just


---------96:08----------
ignores and you know that gift for the


---------96:09----------
guy talking to the brick wall


---------96:11----------
i've i feel that sometimes that's like


---------96:14----------
it's that feels like what it's like


---------96:17----------
yeah so so when dealing with


---------96:20----------
vata pit the children so like remember


---------96:23----------
that they're like water


---------96:26----------
the harder you come at them the more


---------96:27----------
they're gonna feel like concrete


---------96:29----------
yep right whereas like if you're kind of


---------96:32----------
smooth and gen i'm sure you guys have


---------96:33----------
figured this out already but like if


---------96:35----------
you're kind of smooth and gentle like


---------96:37----------
he'll listen but he may not respond to


---------96:41----------
commands and then there's a whole thing


---------96:42----------
about boundary setting and


---------96:43----------
you know it sounds like you guys do a


---------96:45----------
pretty good job of that but anyway


---------96:47----------
it's it sounds like he's a wonderful kid


---------96:48----------
but i do think that you know he's gonna


---------96:50----------
be challenging if he's not already


---------96:53----------
um but he's starting to show that


---------96:56----------
head-on yeah it's yeah


---------97:00----------
anyway so thank you guys for coming on


---------97:02----------
let me just think a little bit about


---------97:03----------
maybe like how to follow up with y'all


---------97:05----------
about you know potentially


---------97:06----------
you know follow up whether it's on


---------97:08----------
stream or whatever or maybe i can just


---------97:10----------
recommend a book if you guys are curious


---------97:11----------
or something


---------97:12----------
because i think especially about the fit


---------97:14----------
the children are like they're


---------97:15----------
they're challenging right because he's


---------97:17----------
flighty like he doesn't always pay


---------97:19----------
attention and sometimes when he does he


---------97:20----------
chooses not to listen


---------97:22----------
so part of it is attentional and then a


---------97:24----------
part of it is defiance it's just he's


---------97:26----------
just gonna do what he wants when he


---------97:27----------
wants to


---------97:29----------
and um and it's challenging because he's


---------97:32----------
like


---------97:32----------
you know when he when he points in the


---------97:34----------
right direction it's amazing


---------97:35----------
when you guys are all on the same page


---------97:37----------
it's great


---------97:38----------
right true


---------97:42----------
so thank you all so much for coming on


---------97:45----------
uh anything that we can do to help you


---------97:47----------
before we kind of wrap up for today


---------97:51----------
good benjamin i think i'm good baby all


---------97:54----------
right well


---------97:54----------
um do you guys want to learn to meditate


---------97:56----------
i mean it sounds like sam has some


---------97:58----------
experience


---------97:59----------
sometimes we'll teach people at the end


---------98:00----------
of stream if they're interested in


---------98:01----------
learning


---------98:03----------
it's up to you benjamin since i i


---------98:06----------
after this is done i'm going back to


---------98:08----------
apex for a couple more hours so i think


---------98:10----------
meditation


---------98:11----------
and a fast-paced br don't necessarily


---------98:13----------
line up yet


---------98:15----------
but i mean something like that


---------98:17----------
especially for me


---------98:18----------
we didn't get a whole lot into into my


---------98:21----------
side of things we talked about a lot


---------98:23----------
about samantha which is totally fine uh


---------98:24----------
her story is honestly way more elaborate


---------98:27----------
uh


---------98:28----------
and and interesting than mine my my life


---------98:31----------
as a kid growing up was


---------98:32----------
was so vanilla it would make your head


---------98:35----------
spin


---------98:36----------
um yes i think it's something that in


---------98:38----------
the future i'll be down to talk about


---------98:40----------
sure of course um well good luck with


---------98:42----------
apex thank you


---------98:44----------
and uh yeah thank you guys so much for


---------98:46----------
coming on


---------98:47----------
you know i really appreciate you all


---------98:48----------
sharing this part of your life um


---------98:50----------
you know i i i've heard uh ben you know


---------98:53----------
i know you


---------98:54----------
i get the impression at least from what


---------98:55----------
i hear on twitter and whatnot


---------98:57----------
that you do a pretty good job about


---------98:59----------
setting a boundary around your personal


---------99:01----------
life and your streamer life


---------99:02----------
right like there's ben and there's dr


---------99:04----------
lupo


---------99:06----------
yeah yeah so i'm i i particularly


---------99:08----------
appreciate that you're willing to kind


---------99:09----------
of cross that boundary for


---------99:10----------
our sake and to try to educate people um


---------99:13----------
so far we really haven't had


---------99:15----------
a single case of knock on wood


---------99:20----------
having bad fallout from coming on stream


---------99:22----------
but if something like that


---------99:24----------
does happen you know please let us know


---------99:26----------

---------99:28----------
