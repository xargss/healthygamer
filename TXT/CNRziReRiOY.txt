---------00:00----------
so what actually creates behavioral


---------00:02----------
change if we really look at our brain


---------00:03----------
our learning circuitry which is kind of


---------00:06----------
we can think about our hippocampus as a


---------00:07----------
part of our brain that sort of relates


---------00:09----------
to learning circuitry is very closely


---------00:11----------
connected to our emotional circuitry and


---------00:14----------
specifically our negative emotional


---------00:15----------
circuitry and so in order for us to


---------00:18----------
change our behavior the most powerful


---------00:20----------
thing that can change behavior is


---------00:22----------
actually the experience of negative


---------00:24----------
emotion so I'm working with someone


---------00:26----------
who's engaged and it turns out that he


---------00:27----------
recently found out that his wife I mean


---------00:29----------
his fiancee was unfaithful and so like


---------00:32----------
that caused him a lot of emotional hurt


---------00:34----------
and also like drastically changed his


---------00:36----------
behavior towards her right if we think


---------00:39----------
about like the way that you treat your


---------00:40----------
fiancee you treat them one way which is


---------00:43----------
like a very intensive behavior in a


---------00:45----------
positive direction you treat them with


---------00:47----------
love and respect earn and are available


---------00:50----------
for them and then after he discovered


---------00:52----------
that she was unfaithful his behavior


---------00:55----------
changes like 180 degrees it flips


---------00:58----------
completely and it's the most drastic


---------01:00----------
behavioral change that you can kind of


---------01:02----------
think of so his behavior changes


---------01:05----------
drastically and one way to think about


---------01:07----------
that is like if we think about how he


---------01:08----------
has changed he's learned not to trust


---------01:12----------
his wife so if we think about


---------01:14----------
behavioural change and learning like


---------01:16----------
those two things are very closely tied


---------01:18----------
and if we think about what's the most


---------01:21----------
rapid way that our behavior changes it's


---------01:23----------
actually negative emotions let's say


---------01:25----------
that you go to school one day and you


---------01:27----------
get bullied for like wearing a


---------01:29----------
particular shirt that negative emotion


---------01:32----------
is gonna hit your brain so hard that you


---------01:34----------
will never wear that shirt at school


---------01:36----------
again it is going to completely alter


---------01:38----------
your behavior very drastically


---------01:41----------
and so even if we stop and accept that


---------01:43----------
for a moment if we say that okay fine so


---------01:46----------
getting burned is how we learn things


---------01:48----------
and it's the most drastic way to change


---------01:49----------
our behavior what does this have to do


---------01:51----------
with gaming so this is where we start to


---------01:54----------
look at something called fMRI studies


---------01:56----------
which are brain scan studies so fMRI is


---------01:59----------
a kind of study where we take an MRI


---------02:02----------
which is like a scan of your brain


---------02:04----------
trem our eye research sort of supports


---------02:06----------
this is that it actually suppresses your


---------02:08----------
negative emotions right if I'm having a


---------02:10----------
bad day at work or I just got into a


---------02:12----------
fight with like my significant other or


---------02:14----------
my parents are on my case what do you do


---------02:17----------
to forget your problems you go to a


---------02:19----------
video game right because while you're


---------02:20----------
playing a video game you forget what's


---------02:22----------
going on in life and so if we look at


---------02:25----------
fMRI studies what what video games


---------02:27----------
actually do is they shut off our


---------02:29----------
negative emotional circuitry but now


---------02:32----------
let's pause and think for a second


---------02:34----------
escapism exactly so if I shut off my


---------02:37----------
negative emotional circuitry what


---------02:39----------
happens to my capacity to learn exactly


---------02:42----------
it gets stunted right because our


---------02:45----------
emotional circuitry our negative


---------02:46----------
emotional circuitry exactly you learn


---------02:49----------
from failure so our negative emotional


---------02:51----------
circuitry is a key way in which we learn


---------02:56----------
because when we get burned by something


---------02:58----------
like let's just talk about actually


---------02:59----------
getting burned if I touch a hot pan or I


---------03:02----------
touch a hot stove and I get burned


---------03:04----------
I'm never gonna touch a hot stove again


---------03:06----------
remember that learning circuitry is get


---------03:08----------
tied to your negative emotional


---------03:09----------
circuitry so when people suppress the


---------03:12----------
parts of their brain that experience


---------03:14----------
negative emotions they don't learn from


---------03:16----------
their mistakes they don't learn from


---------03:18----------
their behaviors and they have trouble


---------03:20----------
getting unstuck so another prime example


---------03:23----------
and this is something that it shares


---------03:25----------
with alcohol is alcohol right so when I


---------03:27----------
drink and like I get into a fight with


---------03:30----------
someone or I'm not doing well at work


---------03:31----------
instead of sitting with those feelings


---------03:34----------
and letting those feelings motivate me


---------03:37----------
to do more and change and learn if I


---------03:41----------
drown my sorrows in alcohol nothing is


---------03:43----------
gonna happen because I'm literally


---------03:45----------
shutting off that painful which is


---------03:48----------
relief right and so that that creates


---------03:50----------
escapism and the problem with escapism


---------03:52----------
is that it doesn't help us change and so


---------03:55----------
then gamers end up feeling stuck right


---------03:58----------
because you guys wake up every day and


---------04:00----------
you know that there are things that you


---------04:01----------
need to be doing differently and you


---------04:03----------
know exactly what it is because y'all's


---------04:05----------
fluid IQs are 20% higher than average


---------04:08----------
and yet you can't bring yourself to do


---------04:10----------
it and you just can't bring yourself to


---------04:13----------
do it and you know and you know and you


---------04:15----------
know and you can't do it and you can't


---------04:16----------
do it and you can't do it and then you


---------04:18----------
come to a conclusion which is that I'm


---------04:20----------
lazy normally like negative emotions


---------04:22----------
cause us to change in in our life


---------04:26----------
because we direct those negative


---------04:27----------
emotions towards real life what happens


---------04:31----------
in gaming is that we start to like a lot


---------04:33----------
of like if you think about people who


---------04:34----------
rage in video games it's usually like


---------04:37----------
people who are like upset in the rest of


---------04:40----------
life right like if you think about a


---------04:41----------
hateful gamer like some guy who just


---------04:44----------
gets completely bent out of shape over


---------04:45----------
every little thing and overwatch chances


---------04:48----------
are that guy's not happy in the rest of


---------04:50----------
his life


---------04:50----------
so gaming has a very interesting impact


---------04:53----------
on how we experience emotions and one


---------04:59----------
thing that it does and I think this has


---------05:00----------
to do with gamers kind of getting stuck


---------05:02----------
is it suppresses their negative emotions


---------05:05----------
and by suppressing our experience of


---------05:08----------
negative emotions it actually disables


---------05:09----------
our learning circuitry and by disabling


---------05:12----------
our learning circuitry what that manages


---------05:14----------
to do is it keeps us feeling stuck


---------05:16----------
because our learning circuitry is what


---------05:18----------
leads to behavioral change


---------05:19----------
so you're basically turning off the part


---------05:22----------
of your brain that is the most powerful


---------05:24----------
thing that can cause you to change your


---------05:26----------
behavior and then the end result is that


---------05:29----------
you end up sort of living a life where


---------05:32----------
like you know what you need to do but


---------05:33----------
you feel incredibly frustrated because


---------05:35----------
nothing in your life is changing
