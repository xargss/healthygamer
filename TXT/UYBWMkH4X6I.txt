---------00:00----------
so how can i be kind to myself while


---------00:02----------
seeking progress in my goals


---------00:05----------
i've noticed the reason why i never get


---------00:06----------
the things done


---------00:08----------
are i'm incredibly harsh on myself when


---------00:10----------
i fail


---------00:11----------
and i am a perfectionist not now that i


---------00:14----------
found those issues i'm going to adopt a


---------00:16----------
mindset of progress over perfection


---------00:19----------
while still trying my best my best to


---------00:22----------
being as kind to myself as possible


---------00:24----------
how can i go about doing this


---------00:27----------
i want to make progress on my goals fast


---------00:29----------
while getting the job done good enough


---------00:31----------
and not be perfect


---------00:33----------
i also don't want to put a lot of


---------00:35----------
pressure on myself and treat myself


---------00:38----------
and others with as much compassion and


---------00:40----------
empathy as possible so i don't take


---------00:42----------
make my mental health worse and i don't


---------00:43----------
lose track of my goals


---------00:45----------
how can i be kind to myself while making


---------00:47----------
progress on my goals


---------00:48----------
so this is a great question that is a


---------00:52----------
sneaky sneaky


---------00:53----------
question because what this person is


---------00:55----------
trying to do


---------00:58----------
is be perfect see this is perfection


---------01:02----------
this is being perfectionistic this is


---------01:04----------
perf this is perfection


---------01:06----------
you see this this is perfection person


---------01:08----------
is still chasing perfection you're going


---------01:10----------
to wind up exactly where you started you


---------01:11----------
all see that


---------01:13----------
oh yeah i'm not doing


---------01:16----------
a good job i need to be less


---------01:19----------
perfectionistic and more


---------01:20----------
self-compassionate


---------01:22----------
let me be more perfect by being less


---------01:24----------
perfect and more self-compassionate


---------01:29----------
see that tricky tricky tricky because


---------01:31----------
they're saying oh


---------01:33----------
i'm gonna be like achieve my goals fast


---------01:37----------
with self-compassion that's so op


---------01:41----------
let's go for op why would we want to


---------01:44----------
achieve our goals slow


---------01:45----------
let's achieve them fast with


---------01:47----------
self-compassion


---------01:48----------
and forgive ourselves when we don't


---------01:50----------
achieve it fast enough


---------01:52----------
but we still want to do it fast is that


---------01:54----------
is that


---------01:55----------
you guys get that same thing


---------01:58----------
same thing so what i would ask this


---------02:00----------
person is


---------02:02----------
why can't you achieve your goals slow


---------02:05----------
and then when i ask that question


---------02:06----------
it's gonna come out oh my god i can't do


---------02:09----------
that man like i need to do it


---------02:11----------
fast time is running out everyone else


---------02:13----------
is doing it fast oh my god


---------02:16----------
do it slow and be careful


---------02:20----------
because your mind will be like is there


---------02:21----------
a perfect level of slow


---------02:24----------
how do i do it slow perfectly


---------02:27----------
it's like it's a never-ending cycle


---------02:30----------
because this is how the mind works


---------02:32----------
your solution is coming from a


---------02:34----------
perfectionistic mindset


---------02:37----------
you're like how do i be more perfect


---------02:39----------
what's the perfect amount of


---------02:40----------
imperfection


---------02:41----------
how do i get that let's find the perfect


---------02:45----------
amount of imperfection


---------02:47----------
so this is where like you know i know


---------02:49----------
it's kind of weird now that i have found


---------02:51----------
the issues i'm going to adopt a mindset


---------02:54----------
of progress over perfection


---------02:55----------
because that's the perfect mindset


---------02:58----------
progress over perfection that's the


---------03:01----------
perfection i need to chase


---------03:02----------
it's tricky right it's tricky it's a


---------03:06----------
great question


---------03:08----------
and it's it's one that so many people


---------03:09----------
have because like i'm not trying to make


---------03:11----------
this person feel stupid


---------03:12----------
i i really hope i'm not but it occurs to


---------03:14----------
me that maybe i am


---------03:16----------
i'm i'm happy because like it's such a


---------03:18----------
beautiful question


---------03:19----------
and this is what people struggle with


---------03:22----------
because


---------03:22----------
the solutions that your mind generates


---------03:26----------
are coming out of the same ai that's


---------03:28----------
causing the problem


---------03:29----------
and so it's tricky so then the person is


---------03:31----------
like wait but what do i what do i do


---------03:34----------
what direction do i move in how do i


---------03:36----------
move towards it


---------03:39----------
and it's like you don't so if you want


---------03:41----------
to shatter this


---------03:42----------
completely take a zen approach you guys


---------03:44----------
want a mindfulness approach you're going


---------03:45----------
to zen approach


---------03:46----------
don't progress but


---------03:50----------
then what exactly


---------03:54----------
but then what answer that question


---------03:57----------
that's the zen approach the zen approach


---------03:59----------
is like taking a gigantic


---------04:01----------
mallet to your cognitive thought process


---------04:03----------
and shattering it


---------04:06----------
that's the zen approach it's tough it's


---------04:08----------
like requires a lot of


---------04:10----------
you know fortitude let me see if i can


---------04:12----------
come up with something


---------04:14----------
okay okay here it is


---------04:17----------
okay so how can i be kind to myself


---------04:20----------
while making progress on my goals


---------04:23----------
the real question can be how can i be


---------04:25----------
kind to myself


---------04:27----------
while not making progress on my goals


---------04:30----------
you see this this is a devastating


---------04:32----------
question


---------04:33----------
you guys can y'all tell what is in the


---------04:36----------
mind of that person


---------04:37----------
it's relentless man


---------04:41----------
relentless right like be kind to


---------04:44----------
yourself whether you progress or not


---------04:47----------
kindness isn't tied to progression


---------04:51----------
kindness is only tied to progression


---------04:53----------
when you're shooting for perfectionism


---------04:55----------
i know it's tough it's going to be


---------04:56----------
really tough


---------04:58----------
do you deserve kindness if you don't


---------05:00----------
progress that's the question you should


---------05:02----------
ask yourself


---------05:03----------
and the answer is going to be probably


---------05:05----------
in your head no


---------05:10----------
so that's tough right so as long as like


---------05:12----------
if you don't deserve


---------05:14----------
kindness if you don't make progress then


---------05:16----------
like


---------05:18----------
i can't so then i mean that's the issue


---------05:20----------
we've got to work on right


---------05:21----------
i'm not saying practically like just


---------05:24----------
just suffer


---------05:25----------
so we talk a lot about self-forgiveness


---------05:27----------
and self-compassion but i want you guys


---------05:29----------
to notice that like


---------05:30----------
i'm not going to play the game that the


---------05:32----------
question sets up because the game is


---------05:34----------
rigged


---------05:35----------
the real question is why can't you be


---------05:37----------
kind to your why do you need to only be


---------05:39----------
kind yourself like and progress like why


---------05:41----------
can't you accept


---------05:43----------
that it's okay to like not progress


---------05:47----------
i'm not saying don't progress what i'm


---------05:50----------
saying is


---------05:50----------
accept yourself if you make a mistake be


---------05:53----------
kind to yourself


---------05:54----------
if it doesn't work out and keep trying


---------05:56----------
i'm not saying don't try i'm not saying


---------05:57----------
give up


---------05:58----------
right subtle careful but you deserve


---------06:01----------
your kindness


---------06:02----------
either way you deserve your compassion


---------06:04----------
either way right like


---------06:06----------
when i kind of think about myself at 21


---------06:08----------
years old like i'm a bumbling idiot


---------06:10----------
right just because i'm


---------06:11----------
a bumbling idiot doesn't mean that like


---------06:14----------
i don't deserve a pat on the back and


---------06:15----------
like a good try and like let's get up


---------06:17----------
and try again


---------06:18----------
right that's what coaching is about


---------06:20----------
there's a reason we call them coaches


---------06:22----------
like they're not


---------06:23----------
you know teachers and they're not


---------06:25----------
therapists but they're like your coach


---------06:27----------
so it's like it's like the person that


---------06:28----------
when you you know


---------06:30----------
get knocked down or when you're knocking


---------06:32----------
yourself down they give you like a pat


---------06:34----------
on the back and they're like


---------06:35----------
hey why don't you get up and try again


---------06:37----------
when you're ready and i'm gonna be here


---------06:39----------
for you


---------06:40----------
and like how can we understand like and


---------06:42----------
they're gonna point out some things in


---------06:44----------
your thought process like this they'll


---------06:45----------
make observations


---------06:46----------
they'll help you understand why are you


---------06:48----------
feeling this way like what's going on


---------06:50----------
but the goal of coaching is not to treat


---------06:52----------
a clinical diagnosis


---------06:53----------
it's to get you back into the field at


---------06:55----------
halftime when you're down by 20 points


---------06:58----------
and like give it your best
