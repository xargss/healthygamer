---------00:00----------
zach this may sound kind of weird but


---------00:02----------
like


---------00:03----------
i'm kind of hearing that you're not


---------00:04----------
really afraid of


---------00:07----------
i know it sounds weird yeah yeah go on


---------00:09----------
you're not really afraid of death


---------00:11----------
i i think what what bothers you it


---------00:13----------
sounds to me is actually your inability


---------00:16----------
to deal with death


---------00:24----------
awesome okay yeah things have been uh


---------00:27----------
they've been a little bit up and down


---------00:28----------
but uh it's been i guess all right i


---------00:30----------
mean


---------00:31----------
the new games are getting released that


---------00:32----------
i'm excited to play so that's at least


---------00:34----------
one positive right


---------00:36----------
yeah what what are you looking forward


---------00:37----------
to playing uh burning crusade uh


---------00:40----------
unfortunately it's getting released a


---------00:41----------
bit earlier than i would have


---------00:43----------
hoped for and a few other games ashes of


---------00:46----------
creation


---------00:46----------
new world other mmos basically


---------00:50----------
yeah new world is um amazon games as mmo


---------00:54----------
yeah


---------00:55----------
yeah it is coming out


---------00:58----------
uh i actually don't know i think it's


---------01:00----------
august


---------01:01----------
okay is there like a beta or yeah there


---------01:04----------
was we played it for a while


---------01:06----------
and um the game was fun for like three


---------01:08----------
days and it sucked


---------01:09----------
and so i'm hoping that when the game


---------01:11----------
actually comes out it'll be fun for at


---------01:12----------
least five


---------01:13----------
pretty much yeah


---------01:17----------
it's it's gaming in 2021 what can i say


---------01:20----------
what is gaming in 2021 uh whenever they


---------01:23----------
try to milk you out of all the money


---------01:24----------
possible while simultaneously putting in


---------01:27----------
the littlest amount of effort possible


---------01:30----------
yeah i was pretty excited about magic


---------01:32----------
legends i don't know if you tried


---------01:35----------
i i didn't play it but i played match


---------01:36----------
with the gathering a lot whenever i was


---------01:38----------
younger so uh


---------01:39----------
i heard about it um what did you hear


---------01:42----------
uh i i just heard it was an arpg and i


---------01:45----------
didn't hear any good or bad things about


---------01:46----------
it i just heard


---------01:47----------
people said it came out and then i never


---------01:49----------
heard about it again so you can kind of


---------01:51----------
put two and two together there and uh


---------01:53----------
yeah yeah i thought it was super cool


---------01:55----------
like the the yeah the conceptual


---------01:57----------
design behind the game i was super


---------01:58----------
excited about like the idea is that


---------02:00----------
you've got like a deck right so it's


---------02:01----------
sort of like a deck builder


---------02:03----------
but it's like an arpg format so you can


---------02:05----------
have like four skills


---------02:07----------
at any given time but once you use a


---------02:09----------
card you like


---------02:10----------
lose the spell and it goes back into


---------02:12----------
your and then you have to like reshuffle


---------02:13----------
and stuff


---------02:14----------
so there's like a lot of deck building


---------02:16----------
and stuff


---------02:17----------
seems like a super cool arpg um


---------02:21----------
i was uh i was always hoping that like i


---------02:24----------
mean i


---------02:24----------
paid a lot of attention to magic like


---------02:26----------
for many years whenever i played it i


---------02:28----------
was in like high school and in the


---------02:29----------
college


---------02:30----------
so like any time that something cool


---------02:32----------
like that happens i'll kind of be


---------02:33----------
interested in it but i just kind of


---------02:35----------
expected to hear more about it later and


---------02:36----------
i just never did


---------02:37----------
so you know that's usually the way it


---------02:39----------
goes yeah i heard


---------02:41----------
that um you know i think what may have


---------02:44----------
happened is


---------02:45----------
there was like a there's like there were


---------02:47----------
four classes and there's a fifth class


---------02:49----------
that you can unlock


---------02:51----------
um but the the class is only unlockable


---------02:54----------
through microtransactions


---------02:55----------
and then on top of that the micro


---------02:57----------
transactions are rng so the class is a


---------03:00----------
drop from a loot box


---------03:02----------
so people were people were spending like


---------03:05----------
500


---------03:06----------
and still like


---------03:09----------
not getting the class see that's


---------03:13----------
uh like i remember apex legend said


---------03:16----------
something like that


---------03:17----------
and it was just like you you got a


---------03:19----------
little dagger for


---------03:20----------
one of the characters but like this is a


---------03:22----------
whole class and it's 500


---------03:24----------
that's exactly the [ __ ] that i'm talking


---------03:25----------
about man like i i said that uh


---------03:28----------
i said a game should make you want to


---------03:30----------
waste your time and not just waste your


---------03:32----------
time


---------03:33----------
and i feel like all the games now they


---------03:35----------
don't just waste your time they waste


---------03:36----------
your time and your money


---------03:38----------
it's just it's sad yeah man


---------03:41----------
yeah i feel like the uh i don't know


---------03:43----------
like maybe maybe it's like i'm getting


---------03:45----------
older or something


---------03:46----------
but like the the allure to it and the


---------03:49----------
smoke and mirrors behind the ways that


---------03:52----------
they keep you playing the game


---------03:53----------
are pretty much just mirrors now you can


---------03:56----------
just see right it's just right there


---------03:59----------
yeah yeah


---------04:02----------
um so you said you're you're excited


---------04:04----------
about burning crusade


---------04:06----------
yeah yeah wow classic burn include


---------04:08----------
crusade right right


---------04:09----------
yeah yeah that's right and then you


---------04:11----------
you've been playing a lot of shadow


---------04:12----------
lands recently or


---------04:14----------
yeah yeah how do you feel about


---------04:15----------
shadowlands not good


---------04:18----------
uh i feel like uh you know i've played a


---------04:21----------
game for 15 years


---------04:22----------
and uh the people that are running the


---------04:24----------
game are ruining it


---------04:26----------
and i feel like i'm wasting my time


---------04:28----------
playing it for the first time


---------04:30----------
in like 15 years it's sad


---------04:33----------
how are they ruining it uh by just not


---------04:37----------
knowing


---------04:37----------
i i don't think they're doing what i


---------04:39----------
what i would do i think they're just not


---------04:41----------
really putting


---------04:42----------
in the effort that they need to i think


---------04:43----------
they're just trying to


---------04:45----------
kind of compel people to play the game


---------04:46----------
longer rather than enjoy the game


---------04:49----------
if that makes sense yeah i love your way


---------04:52----------
with language like


---------04:53----------
compel versus enjoy


---------04:56----------
yes yes and then you said also that


---------04:59----------
a game should make you want to waste


---------05:01----------
your time not yet


---------05:03----------
yeah it shouldn't just waste your yeah


---------05:04----------
yeah you want to spend all day playing


---------05:06----------
the game not you have to


---------05:08----------
yeah and that's the way it used to be


---------05:10----------
and like i always wonder right it's like


---------05:12----------
is this because i'm older


---------05:13----------
is it because the game is worse and it's


---------05:16----------
like you can never really dissect the


---------05:18----------
two


---------05:18----------
because you can't you know experience


---------05:20----------
them in like some sort of controlled


---------05:21----------
environment


---------05:22----------
but it does feel a lot different than it


---------05:26----------
does that it did


---------05:29----------
you can't experience them in a


---------05:30----------
controlled environment


---------05:34----------
can you say a little bit more about that


---------05:36----------
well yeah yeah so like for example


---------05:38----------
if i go and i i play a game


---------05:42----------
that i used to play whenever i was a kid


---------05:44----------
i i can't really go back and experience


---------05:46----------
that for the first time


---------05:47----------
it's like the you can never step in the


---------05:49----------
same river twice right and


---------05:51----------
it's kind of the same paradigm where if


---------05:54----------
i go back


---------05:55----------
and i play super mario world for the


---------05:57----------
800th time


---------05:58----------
it's not gonna be the same experience as


---------06:00----------
i had whenever i was five years old


---------06:02----------
playing it and getting upset and mad


---------06:03----------
because i couldn't beat the game


---------06:05----------
so it's like is it because is the


---------06:08----------
attachment to the games and the drive to


---------06:11----------
play them


---------06:12----------
diminishing because of the quality of


---------06:14----------
the games or is it diminishing because


---------06:16----------
of a different point in my life you see


---------06:19----------
what i mean


---------06:20----------
yeah i'm wondering if you're turning


---------06:22----------
into a boomer


---------06:24----------
me too right me too


---------06:27----------
yeah right back in the day


---------06:30----------
back in my day we didn't have any micro


---------06:32----------
transactions it was


---------06:34----------
just the good times you bought the game


---------06:36----------
from blockbuster and you took it home


---------06:38----------
and you played it for three days


---------06:39----------
that's that's how it was for me too let


---------06:41----------
me tell you what what happened is you'd


---------06:43----------
go to a game and you'd purchase it


---------06:46----------
imagine that the game was yours you


---------06:49----------
didn't need none internet


---------06:51----------
no to play it it was it was great


---------06:55----------
it really was yeah i didn't need to be


---------06:58----------
a single-player game didn't need to be


---------07:00----------
connected to their multiplayer server i


---------07:02----------
could just play it by myself


---------07:04----------
when my cow stepped on my ethernet cable


---------07:08----------
i could just keep playing what the


---------07:10----------
hell's a battle pass


---------07:12----------
i never heard of that yeah i know i know


---------07:14----------
all too damn well it's sad


---------07:16----------
i don't know where it's gonna go yeah


---------07:19----------
man but yeah


---------07:20----------
might be it might just be being a boomer


---------07:22----------
i i don't know i think that's a that's a


---------07:24----------
big part of it at least


---------07:26----------
yeah so i i i kind of feel that way too


---------07:29----------
like i wonder if it's the boomer within


---------07:30----------
me but i i do feel like um


---------07:32----------
what's happening kind of like what you i


---------07:34----------
think you captured it well that


---------07:36----------
a lot of game designers are trying to


---------07:38----------
make a game that's com like you know


---------07:39----------
that you're compelled to play as opposed


---------07:41----------
to enjoyable


---------07:43----------
um can i just share like a bizarre


---------07:45----------
experience i had like about a year ago


---------07:47----------
absolutely so i was at um


---------07:51----------
like uh so i i used to be in boston and


---------07:54----------
and sometimes i would go to like


---------07:55----------
business networking events


---------07:57----------
ooh and and so sometimes like at these


---------08:00----------
business networking events like


---------08:02----------
um you know you'd meet people who are


---------08:04----------
like you know in different industries


---------08:06----------
and so like i met like this mba


---------08:08----------
who was interested in the gaming


---------08:10----------
industry he was like yeah like i'm


---------08:11----------
you know i'm i'm like i i work in the


---------08:13----------
gaming industry and i was like awesome


---------08:15----------
what games do you like and he was like


---------08:16----------
oh i don't like games i don't play them


---------08:19----------
i was like what interests you and you


---------08:20----------
think he was like oh like you know i


---------08:22----------
think that the monetization


---------08:23----------
opportunities are like really fantastic


---------08:26----------
i was like no yeah yeah he works at


---------08:29----------
activision now i i


---------08:30----------
i know who that is yeah i was like i was


---------08:33----------
like this is they actually exist


---------08:35----------
like people are and you know what it


---------08:37----------
reminds me of actually is


---------08:39----------
is can i tell you another random story i


---------08:41----------
guess i'm the one telling stories today


---------08:43----------
so when i was uh training to become a


---------08:45----------
psychiatrist i i had this eye-opening


---------08:48----------
lecture from this


---------08:49----------
absolutely um brilliant guy


---------08:52----------
and his name is dr freuden reich and so


---------08:56----------
we were we were talking about you know


---------08:58----------
medicine and the practice of medicine


---------09:00----------
within like


---------09:01----------
medicine and healthcare so you know i'm


---------09:03----------
a doctor i practice medicine


---------09:05----------
but in my job it's like healthcare


---------09:07----------
there's like a hospital there's


---------09:08----------
insurance there's billing there's


---------09:10----------
administration


---------09:11----------
you know all this kind of stuff and he's


---------09:12----------
like you know if you don't like


---------09:15----------
your job and you don't like healthcare


---------09:17----------
the problem


---------09:18----------
is that you know 20 years ago a hospital


---------09:21----------
system had something called the forms


---------09:23----------
committee


---------09:24----------
can you imagine what the forms committee


---------09:25----------
does


---------09:27----------
uh they probably process forms


---------09:30----------
yes absolutely that's literally it yeah


---------09:33----------
so they


---------09:34----------
process forms and and the committee


---------09:36----------
actually makes the forms


---------09:38----------
so there's a group of people who decides


---------09:41----------
what are the forms that people need to


---------09:42----------
fill out


---------09:44----------
and when when the forms committee was


---------09:46----------
launched they asked doctors to be a part


---------09:48----------
of it


---------09:48----------
and can you imagine what the doctors


---------09:50----------
said no


---------09:52----------
please no absolutely we hate we hate


---------09:55----------
paperwork we hate it i don't want to i


---------09:58----------
didn't go to medical school


---------09:59----------
and train for seven years to become a


---------10:01----------
neurosurgeon


---------10:03----------
and devote over a decade of my life so i


---------10:05----------
could figure out


---------10:06----------
what forms need to be filled out i did


---------10:08----------
it to do neurosurgery on people with


---------10:10----------
brain cancer


---------10:12----------
and so there were no doctors on the


---------10:13----------
forms committee


---------10:15----------
and then then what happened is all these


---------10:17----------
people decided


---------10:19----------
which forms the neurosurgeon has to fill


---------10:21----------
out


---------10:22----------
and then we lost the battle and this is


---------10:26----------
what's happening in the gaming industry


---------10:27----------
now is that like you know we're


---------10:29----------
you know we've got people who aren't


---------10:31----------
gamers who are designing video games


---------10:34----------
that's just about right uh it's p


---------10:38----------
and and they just necessitate a need for


---------10:40----------
themselves because like


---------10:41----------
if they they'll always come out with new


---------10:43----------
forms or new things that you have to do


---------10:46----------
because they don't want to you know show


---------10:48----------
how useless they are


---------10:51----------
i think that happens a lot too it's like


---------10:53----------
they're kind of creating


---------10:54----------
is creating a problem and then


---------10:57----------
presenting themselves as a solution for


---------10:59----------
it and i think that happens with a lot


---------11:01----------
of games too


---------11:02----------
can you share a little bit more about


---------11:04----------
that how do you how do you know that


---------11:06----------
uh i mean like it's a lot of things i


---------11:09----------
think that


---------11:10----------
really like one example of this is like


---------11:13----------
in the game i play a lot


---------11:14----------
world of warcraft like they will release


---------11:16----------
like some sort of


---------11:18----------
you know like let's say it's a way to


---------11:19----------
get really good armor or to like make


---------11:22----------
your legendary weapons or something like


---------11:24----------
that


---------11:24----------
and you will have to repeat a process


---------11:28----------
over and over and over in a way that is


---------11:31----------
transparently


---------11:32----------
just a method of extending your play


---------11:35----------
time


---------11:35----------
rather than making you enjoy the content


---------11:38----------
so


---------11:39----------
you do this over and over and over and


---------11:41----------
then later on like maybe a year later


---------11:44----------
they will make it easier in the way that


---------11:46----------
people initially wanted it to be


---------11:48----------
one year ago and it's just


---------11:52----------
it's just crazy like it and and like it


---------11:55----------
it


---------11:56----------
as i said it kind of lifts the it it


---------11:58----------
pulls the curtain away and you can just


---------12:00----------
see all the machinery in the back


---------12:02----------
it's like that the wizard of oz right


---------12:04----------
you just see him in the in the little


---------12:06----------
room broadcasting


---------12:07----------
and it's no longer this like experience


---------12:09----------
that you have


---------12:11----------
the willing suspension of disbelief is


---------12:13----------
removed


---------12:14----------
and you're just stuck there like a rat


---------12:17----------
in a maze


---------12:19----------
it sucks it sounds terrifying


---------12:23----------
i mean you know i i feel like i gotta


---------12:25----------
share this i'm hopeful though


---------12:27----------
so i i think like at the end of the day


---------12:29----------
like did you play hades


---------12:32----------
i played it for maybe 20 minutes


---------12:35----------
i had fun for those 20 minutes though so


---------12:38----------
i i think hades is a great example like


---------12:40----------
i absolutely love the game and i think


---------12:41----------
it's like


---------12:42----------
an example what i'm terrified of is um


---------12:45----------
the aaa clones of hades oh


---------12:48----------
yeah because they're coming oh no doubt


---------12:52----------
i mean absolutely and like the game it's


---------12:53----------
not like i stopped playing it because i


---------12:55----------
didn't want to i just


---------12:56----------
stopped playing because i had to go back


---------12:58----------
to streaming and that that's why


---------12:59----------
and i haven't really had time to play it


---------13:01----------
but yeah it was a really fun game i


---------13:02----------
enjoyed it it was


---------13:03----------
it was very clean it was very well


---------13:05----------
designed and


---------13:07----------
there's some things that are just kind


---------13:08----------
of missing did you play valheim i kind


---------13:10----------
of got the same experience with that


---------13:11----------
i love valenheim yeah yeah and that's


---------13:14----------
something made by five people right and


---------13:16----------
yeah


---------13:16----------
it just feels like uh you know these big


---------13:19----------
game companies


---------13:20----------
i told people that they're uh instead of


---------13:22----------
too big to fail it's too big to


---------13:23----------
to succeed that's really the way i feel


---------13:26----------
it's like they're


---------13:27----------
it takes them forever to do anything


---------13:28----------
it's like over produced and they have


---------13:30----------
like this fixation


---------13:32----------
on you know the lighting on a


---------13:34----------
character's nose


---------13:35----------
rather than the gameplay that everybody


---------13:37----------
goes with


---------13:39----------
yeah i remember hearing about dragon age


---------13:42----------
origins


---------13:42----------
three yeah so i don't know if you played


---------13:45----------
the original dragon age but the


---------13:46----------
uh uh original dragon age oh


---------13:50----------
we just got a thousand dollar donation


---------13:52----------
holy [ __ ]


---------13:54----------
and it seems like um as someone who


---------13:57----------
struggles with mental health what you're


---------13:59----------
doing is invaluable thank you


---------14:04----------
i don't know so the funny thing now is


---------14:06----------
like i


---------14:07----------
i don't know if that person is talking


---------14:09----------
about what we're talking about now


---------14:12----------
yeah it's just like a general statement


---------14:14----------
yeah it so now i'm genuinely confused


---------14:16----------
whether


---------14:17----------
you know talking about how depressing


---------14:20----------
and predatory the video game landscape


---------14:21----------
now


---------14:22----------
is is is like with the public good that


---------14:24----------
we're doing or is it when we talk about


---------14:26----------
like


---------14:26----------
depression and anxiety and and learning


---------14:28----------
to love yourself


---------14:30----------
it's probably just it's like somebody is


---------14:32----------
saying it besides them


---------14:34----------
and it's like okay you know there's a


---------14:36----------
guy that graduated from harvard who


---------14:38----------
thinks the same damn thing that i did


---------14:39----------
i'm not crazy you know i think that's


---------14:42----------
really what it is i


---------14:44----------
i remember every time that i hear


---------14:45----------
somebody else saying what you're saying


---------14:47----------
it always is a little bit validating for


---------14:48----------
me too


---------14:50----------
yeah okay well thank you very much for


---------14:52----------
the support folks


---------14:54----------
um so you know just a couple other


---------14:56----------
things like i i think that like


---------14:58----------
you know i hear what you're saying in


---------14:59----------
terms of activision being predatory and


---------15:01----------
whatnot but like


---------15:02----------
part of the thing though uh asman is i i


---------15:04----------
still think that like these


---------15:05----------
these triple a game companies like


---------15:07----------
actually make really amazing games


---------15:09----------
like i loved warcraft 3 loved starcraft


---------15:11----------
sc2 was like okay


---------15:14----------
yeah and like you know wow was amazing i


---------15:16----------
think overwatch is like genuinely like a


---------15:18----------
very good game


---------15:19----------
um you know people may disagree but like


---------15:22----------
i think a lot of the you know the big


---------15:24----------
evil people actually do make really


---------15:27----------
amazing games


---------15:29----------
i i agree but i think that it's a very


---------15:31----------
sad state of affairs that most of the


---------15:32----------
examples that you gave were over 10


---------15:34----------
years ago


---------15:37----------
but we'll say that i'm sure we'll say


---------15:38----------
that about diablo immortal right


---------15:40----------
won't we add that to the list um


---------15:44----------
i i think that diablo yeah that's a


---------15:47----------
that's a tough one isn't it that's a


---------15:50----------
very tough one


---------15:52----------
and like that's one of the things i just


---------15:53----------
wish they made a a pc port for it i'd


---------15:56----------
play it if it was on the pc just see


---------15:57----------
what it's like but um


---------15:59----------
they don't even do that for some reason


---------16:00----------
i have no idea why


---------16:02----------
yeah yeah so are we just talking about


---------16:05----------
are we like


---------16:06----------
reminiscing well it's a metaphor right


---------16:10----------
because


---------16:11----------
the games are like it's what i spend my


---------16:13----------
time doing


---------16:14----------
and it's like i've played games all my


---------16:16----------
life


---------16:17----------
and i enjoy them and i don't really


---------16:19----------
enjoy them as much now and


---------16:21----------
it's like why is that is it because i'm


---------16:23----------
older is it because the games are worse


---------16:25----------
it's


---------16:26----------
and that's what i'm in it's like hard to


---------16:27----------
decide it's like kind of


---------16:29----------
like i'm 30 now and i i tell my i say


---------16:33----------
that all the time


---------16:34----------
because i still can't even come to terms


---------16:37----------
with it it's scary


---------16:38----------
and i'm i've done this for


---------16:42----------
like basically i've streamed and sat in


---------16:45----------
my room all day every day and played


---------16:47----------
video games for


---------16:49----------
pretty much my whole adult life and


---------16:52----------
i've loved it the whole time it's it's


---------16:54----------
been absolutely amazing


---------16:56----------
but it feels like it's coming to an end


---------16:59----------
it feels like it's


---------17:00----------
it's like ending in a way i don't know


---------17:03----------
how i can really describe it


---------17:05----------
it's sad


---------17:10----------
can i just sit with that for a second


---------17:18----------
you know when you say that what comes to


---------17:21----------
mind have you played dark souls


---------17:23----------
many times so you know like the story


---------17:26----------
behind dark souls which is that the


---------17:28----------
flame is going out


---------17:30----------
yeah that's sort of like the image that


---------17:33----------
i get


---------17:35----------
uh yeah i mean i hope i don't end up


---------17:38----------
like king gwen


---------17:39----------
but yeah i could see that uh absolutely


---------17:43----------
yeah it's uh and i think it's just also


---------17:46----------
like i've kind of


---------17:47----------
done and i look like quinn


---------17:51----------
look if i get a lot if my hair is


---------17:53----------
getting longer and i've gotten a few


---------17:54----------
gray hairs


---------17:56----------
yeah man it's getting there


---------18:03----------
yeah that's right i oh my god that's


---------18:06----------
scary to think


---------18:07----------
and i did actually choose that ending


---------18:09----------
too oh no


---------18:11----------
so yeah i mean it's it's definitely


---------18:14----------
scary because like i feel like i've done


---------18:16----------
pretty much everything that i


---------18:18----------
wanted to do and i've accomplished a lot


---------18:20----------
of things i've wanted to do


---------18:21----------
and it's like kind of i'm aimless in a


---------18:24----------
way because


---------18:25----------
i don't have the same motivation to


---------18:28----------
really do anything like i i do


---------18:31----------
you know i go through the same motions


---------18:34----------
and i do the same stuff but it's not


---------18:35----------
with the same level


---------18:37----------
of enthusiastic uh


---------18:40----------
deterministic it's like determinism that


---------18:42----------
i used to have


---------18:43----------
it's just kind of i'm doing it because


---------18:45----------
it's what i like doing


---------18:47----------
and it's what i do it's not even really


---------18:49----------
what i like doing it's what i do


---------18:50----------
and it's weird for me to think back


---------18:53----------
and think that it's been 10 years that


---------18:55----------
i've been doing this


---------18:57----------
and i don't i i don't ever


---------19:01----------
want it to end but it is


---------19:04----------
it's like i can't stop getting older i


---------19:06----------
can't stop


---------19:08----------
uh that this happening and i feel like


---------19:11----------
also


---------19:11----------
like i'm i'll be honest i'm sure you


---------19:13----------
probably have had the same feeling like


---------19:15----------
you ever play a game that you were


---------19:16----------
really good at whenever you were a kid


---------19:17----------
and now you suck at it


---------19:20----------
yes yeah so i've also done the opposite


---------19:23----------
where there were games that i used to


---------19:24----------
think were really hard and i go back and


---------19:26----------
play them now and i was like i don't


---------19:27----------
understand


---------19:28----------
how i ever you know


---------19:32----------
had difficulty with this game i i


---------19:34----------
understand that a lot yeah there's a


---------19:36----------
little bit of those too especially some


---------19:37----------
super nintendo games


---------19:38----------
yeah i was a dumb ass kid i had ny deal


---------19:43----------
and and uh yeah it's interesting i think


---------19:46----------
the game that comes to mind the most


---------19:48----------
is um dota so i've been playing dota for


---------19:51----------
over a decade


---------19:52----------
and like i was bad at dota and then for


---------19:54----------
a while i was like pretty good at dota


---------19:56----------
like i was probably like


---------19:57----------
you know somewhere in the top 10 or 20


---------20:00----------
of the player base


---------20:01----------
yeah and then you know like respectable


---------20:03----------
like nowhere near pro


---------20:05----------
but like respectable and now i'm in like


---------20:07----------
the bottom


---------20:09----------
50 percent and and that yeah


---------20:12----------
and i've been one of these guys that


---------20:13----------
like no matter what game like you know


---------20:15----------
how they're like some people are just


---------20:16----------
good at games right and like you can


---------20:17----------
play


---------20:18----------
you pick up any game and within you know


---------20:21----------
month of playing it you'll be like


---------20:23----------
in the top twenty percent of the player


---------20:24----------
base yeah


---------20:26----------
and yeah there were always the noobs


---------20:28----------
that you would prey on


---------20:30----------
the game after game after game


---------20:32----------
absolutely you play the player those


---------20:34----------
people for six months they're gonna just


---------20:35----------
they're never gonna get better yep and i


---------20:38----------
feel like


---------20:38----------
i'm transitioning into that noob stage


---------20:41----------
yeah that's that's what i see


---------20:42----------
it's happening yeah it's uh


---------20:47----------
yeah good no go go for it


---------20:51----------
um well that's kind of the way that i


---------20:53----------
feel right is that


---------20:54----------
it's like i feel like i'm losing that


---------20:57----------
thing that i was i was good at


---------20:59----------
and i'm not good at it really that much


---------21:01----------
anymore


---------21:02----------
and it's just kind of like for a lot of


---------21:05----------
people


---------21:06----------
it's not like it wouldn't really matter


---------21:08----------
you know what i mean because it's just


---------21:09----------
it's just a video game


---------21:10----------
but i think what really hits me hard


---------21:12----------
with it is like thinking that


---------21:14----------
it's like something as like a greater


---------21:16----------
thing like if i'm just not good at the


---------21:18----------
game anymore it's whatever


---------21:19----------
but if i'm not good at the game anymore


---------21:21----------
because i'm getting older that's scary


---------21:23----------
what's scary about that because whenever


---------21:25----------
you get older you die


---------21:28----------
is that what you feel like you're doing


---------21:31----------
well i mean everybody is you're doing it


---------21:33----------
all the time


---------21:33----------
i mean like of course to an extent yeah


---------21:36----------
it just feels like uh


---------21:39----------
uh it feels like i


---------21:42----------
like there aren't really as many good


---------21:44----------
things to look forward to anymore


---------21:46----------
if that makes sense how long have you


---------21:48----------
felt that way


---------21:50----------
i don't know maybe three years two years


---------21:53----------
and so it sounds to me like you're kind


---------21:55----------
of living your life on autopilot


---------21:58----------
i mean in a way yeah or it's like kind


---------22:01----------
of


---------22:01----------
you're waiting for the next thing to go


---------22:03----------
wrong


---------22:05----------
that's


---------22:08----------
that caught me off guard that's not what


---------22:10----------
i was expecting you to say


---------22:12----------
what do you mean you're waiting has a


---------22:14----------
lot gone wrong


---------22:16----------
yeah i mean well it's not it's not


---------22:18----------
something that just happens overnight


---------22:20----------
uh it's just something that kind of it's


---------22:22----------
either like a slow deterioration


---------22:25----------
or it could be something that just kind


---------22:27----------
of happens right of course


---------22:29----------
and it's one of those things where it's


---------22:32----------
kind of hard to pinpoint when it happens


---------22:35----------
but if you go back and you look two


---------22:37----------
years like before


---------22:39----------
like in in the past you'd see that


---------22:41----------
things are clearly better


---------22:42----------
and there was no real day where things


---------22:44----------
changed but


---------22:45----------
it was just like a slow decay


---------22:50----------
yeah that sounds bleak how are things


---------22:53----------
for you


---------22:53----------
how how were things for you three years


---------22:55----------
ago


---------22:56----------
uh probably uh a little bit better


---------23:00----------
right i mean i had a classic wild look


---------23:02----------
forward to uh that was cool


---------23:03----------
and um then uh i mean


---------23:07----------
it's like a lot of little things right


---------23:09----------
because back then i was like really


---------23:10----------
excited about


---------23:12----------
uh doing my stream and and being very


---------23:15----------
successful with my stream and i still


---------23:17----------
care about that a lot but like


---------23:19----------
at that time i didn't i never had the


---------23:21----------
success that i have now


---------23:23----------
so it wasn't like i still had that to


---------23:26----------
work towards


---------23:27----------
if that makes sense mm-hmm so yeah


---------23:30----------
you had a goal yeah i had to go i have


---------23:32----------
no goals


---------23:33----------
um like i have like i guess i mean to an


---------23:36----------
extent i do


---------23:37----------
but the goals that i used to always have


---------23:39----------
like this might sound insane okay


---------23:41----------
but i used to honestly wake up in the


---------23:43----------
morning and feel


---------23:44----------
completely like fulfilled and satisfied


---------23:47----------
with the idea that i'm going to play


---------23:49----------
world of warcraft today


---------23:50----------
and i'm going to farm for some item that


---------23:52----------
i want and i'm going to feel great about


---------23:55----------
it and i'm going to go to bed that night


---------23:56----------
and i'm going to feel like a winner


---------23:58----------
and i used to really feel that way it


---------24:00----------
was great and


---------24:02----------
now it's just not the same


---------24:06----------
how do you feel now like i wasted my


---------24:09----------
damn time


---------24:14----------
like that's that's the way i feel it's


---------24:16----------
always my i feel like i don't know what


---------24:17----------
to what to do


---------24:19----------
i i don't know if i like what what it is


---------24:23----------
and i've tried to find like other things


---------24:25----------
i made an org


---------24:27----------
company with people friends of mine and


---------24:29----------
that's going really well it's gone


---------24:31----------
actually


---------24:32----------
surprisingly well and uh that's been


---------24:34----------
great


---------24:35----------
but there needs to be something for me


---------24:37----------
personally


---------24:38----------
that i have to work towards can you tell


---------24:40----------
me about the org


---------24:42----------
yeah uh basically i i made an


---------24:44----------
organization called uh


---------24:46----------
otk one true king with uh myself uh s


---------24:48----------
fan you know s fend ms kiff


---------24:50----------
uh tips out and my other friend wrench


---------24:53----------
we brought on nick pollam


---------24:55----------
nmp as well and uh we have people that


---------24:58----------
we obviously hire


---------24:59----------
and we put on different events and we


---------25:02----------
just kind of make content together


---------25:04----------
oh interesting it stands for one tree


---------25:06----------
king one


---------25:07----------
king yeah i just i thought it was one


---------25:09----------
turn kill


---------25:11----------
um so we actually uh the funny thing


---------25:14----------
about that


---------25:14----------
is uh we actually found out it also


---------25:16----------
stands for over the knee which is a


---------25:18----------
sexual fetish


---------25:19----------
we didn't know that until after we


---------25:21----------
announced the org okay


---------25:23----------
little fun uh fun little what is it rule


---------25:26----------
42


---------25:27----------
i think anything can be 32 32 anything


---------25:30----------
can be a sexual fetish right


---------25:32----------
um yeah we actually thought about as a


---------25:35----------
joke selling paddles


---------25:36----------
[Laughter]


---------25:38----------
so we'll see but yeah it's uh i i think


---------25:42----------
that was like that's kind of like a next


---------25:43----------
step thing for me too right is to kind


---------25:45----------
of have that thing that you can kind of


---------25:47----------
work on


---------25:48----------
beyond just playing video games and


---------25:50----------
beyond that something that's kind of


---------25:51----------
bigger than yourself and


---------25:53----------
uh that that has been it's been very


---------25:55----------
stressful for me to have to do that


---------25:57----------
and um especially as somebody who is uh


---------26:01----------
pretty much a hermit i like being alone


---------26:03----------
all the time and now i have to


---------26:05----------
talk to people all the time for those


---------26:06----------
different things and it's it's good but


---------26:08----------
it's also exhausting for a person who


---------26:10----------
likes to be alone


---------26:13----------
you want me to call you asman gold asman


---------26:15----------
or or what


---------26:17----------
we just do zach it's fine okay zach can


---------26:20----------
i have a second to think


---------26:21----------
yeah sure


---------26:40----------
um do you mind if i ask you us i'm just


---------26:43----------
debating this because there's something


---------26:44----------
that my mind is curious about um


---------26:48----------
but i'm wondering if maybe like asking


---------26:49----------
this question is embarrassing uh i was


---------26:52----------
debating maybe asking it to you


---------26:54----------
in private but it's something that you


---------26:56----------
had publicly spoken about


---------26:57----------
on stream before and i find myself kind


---------26:59----------
of wondering


---------27:01----------
yeah did you ever go see that dentist


---------27:04----------
and get your teeth taken care of


---------27:06----------
yeah uh i did i still need to get more


---------27:09----------
of them taken care of absolutely uh it


---------27:11----------
takes me uh


---------27:12----------
like my teeth are [ __ ] up right and so


---------27:15----------
there's a lot of work that i need to


---------27:16----------
have done


---------27:17----------
and uh with covet and everything i have


---------27:19----------
been a little bit slower on doing it but


---------27:21----------
yes i've had a number of my teeth uh


---------27:23----------
fixed and taken care of


---------27:25----------
now i have to do i think probably two or


---------27:28----------
three more visits


---------27:31----------
i don't like you about that uh well


---------27:34----------
there's a funny thing about that


---------27:36----------
so whenever i was younger i used to


---------27:37----------
always eat my food really fast and then


---------27:40----------
it would make me


---------27:40----------
sick to my stomach because i ate my food


---------27:42----------
so fast and then all my teeth fell out


---------27:44----------
and i couldn't do it anymore and i


---------27:46----------
stopped getting sick after eating my


---------27:47----------
food


---------27:48----------
and now that i got my teeth back i'm


---------27:49----------
eating my food again and i'm getting


---------27:51----------
sick again


---------27:52----------
so uh yeah that's basically where we're


---------27:56----------
at


---------27:57----------
and uh i i there's i don't know there i


---------28:01----------
don't know if there's really


---------28:02----------
a moral to that story or anything like


---------28:03----------
that but it's basically uh


---------28:06----------
it's basically what it is and it's not


---------28:08----------
like i it's not like an eating disorder


---------28:09----------
i just eat food very fast right i just


---------28:11----------
want to eat the food like


---------28:12----------
eating food is like a it's like a daily


---------28:16----------
quest in a video game where like i just


---------28:17----------
want to get it out of the way as fast as


---------28:19----------
i can so i can move on to


---------28:21----------
actually playing daily quests in video


---------28:22----------
games


---------28:24----------
that's basically yeah yeah get my get my


---------28:28----------
rl daily quests out of the way so that


---------28:29----------
you can do my virtual dailies


---------28:31----------
yeah a min max and uh you know sometimes


---------28:34----------
it


---------28:35----------
it doesn't turn out very well but yeah i


---------28:37----------
mean i uh


---------28:38----------
i i do i i do i'm glad that i've


---------28:42----------
i've gotten them fixed more and uh it's


---------28:45----------
kind of


---------28:46----------
it was really bad like there were a few


---------28:47----------
times where i stopped streaming because


---------28:49----------
one of my teeth


---------28:50----------
broke or fell out or something like that


---------28:53----------
uh and


---------28:53----------
you could tell whenever i was streaming


---------28:55----------
and it just kind of


---------28:56----------
there are a lot of things that i have no


---------28:59----------
problem with people


---------29:00----------
looking at me and seeing but that was


---------29:02----------
one of them that was just a little bit


---------29:03----------
too much


---------29:05----------
okay so i'm gonna just kind of think out


---------29:09----------
loud for a second because i'm noticing


---------29:13----------
you know potentially a direction of this


---------29:15----------
conversation that's a little bit


---------29:16----------
aligned with what we usually do so i


---------29:19----------
know we started talking about about like


---------29:20----------
you know gaming and


---------29:21----------
and being you know boomers and back in


---------29:23----------
the day like


---------29:24----------
you know you had back in the day like


---------29:26----------
you didn't have a server that gave you


---------29:28----------
matchmaking you had to go out and find


---------29:30----------
your match yourself


---------29:31----------
but you had to make it you had to make


---------29:33----------
friends yeah and it was great


---------29:35----------
it was you had to create a custom lobby


---------29:37----------
and you never knew


---------29:38----------
who would show up and whether they would


---------29:40----------
be a hacker and there was no


---------29:42----------
there's no reporting system for hackers


---------29:46----------
xbox live didn't give a [ __ ] yeah yeah


---------29:49----------
i remember all too well so we kind of


---------29:51----------
started out there and i'm noticing that


---------29:53----------
you're someone who's quite


---------29:55----------
driven and that you used to look forward


---------29:57----------
to the day


---------29:58----------
like you'd wake up and you'd play wow


---------30:00----------
and you'd really enjoy it and it was


---------30:01----------
like it was an exciting and fulfilling


---------30:03----------
life


---------30:04----------
you were also somewhat you know skilled


---------30:06----------
or lucky and became like


---------30:08----------
you know successful through that um yeah


---------30:12----------
and and then like and then just like in


---------30:14----------
in the world of dark souls like you know


---------30:17----------
there's only a limited amount of fuel


---------30:20----------
yeah


---------30:20----------
and the flame starts to dim and then


---------30:24----------
like now what i'm kind of hearing from


---------30:25----------
you is like


---------30:27----------
you don't have goals like you don't have


---------30:28----------
that zest that used to drive you


---------30:32----------
well there's yeah i was gonna say


---------30:35----------
there's nothing really to look forward


---------30:37----------
to


---------30:37----------
in the same way that they used to be so


---------30:41----------
um great point i'll i'll kind of


---------30:44----------
get to that in a second um so so


---------30:47----------
and then like you even tried stuff right


---------30:49----------
like you've heard from the others


---------30:52----------
that oh if you're like tired of getting


---------30:54----------
gaming like make an


---------30:55----------
org like do something else like set like


---------30:57----------
come up with a new goal for yourself


---------30:59----------
and you're like cool let's do this and


---------31:01----------
then the interesting thing is that


---------31:03----------
what i'm hearing you say is that it


---------31:04----------
actually checked a lot of the boxes


---------31:07----------
yeah it gave you something to work


---------31:09----------
towards working towards success it


---------31:11----------
sounds like it's actually fun


---------31:13----------
but there's still something like missing


---------31:16----------
it's sort of like


---------31:17----------
you know it's it's kind of like a puff


---------31:19----------
pastry that's kind of good but like


---------31:21----------
empty on the inside


---------31:24----------
yeah it's like it's like an eclair and


---------31:26----------
there's no cream in the middle


---------31:27----------
yeah right and and so and so this is


---------31:31----------
where i


---------31:32----------
think like maybe what we need to uh oh


---------31:34----------
we're getting donations sorry


---------31:36----------
um i think what we want to talk about


---------31:38----------
today is like


---------31:39----------
goals and the nature of fulfillment yeah


---------31:42----------
and


---------31:43----------
and i'm also curious are you afraid of


---------31:45----------
dying


---------31:47----------
yes yes very much so


---------31:50----------
very very much so it's uh it's the same


---------31:53----------
as like the uh


---------31:55----------
the the gray hairs or you know i go get


---------31:57----------
gray hairs it's like the memento mori of


---------31:59----------
it and it


---------32:00----------
i i have to i pull them out of my beard


---------32:03----------
i cut them out of my beard because it


---------32:04----------
just freaks me out


---------32:05----------
it totally freaks me out and like i i'm


---------32:08----------
so scared of it


---------32:09----------
okay absolutely so i i think we can


---------32:14----------
we can this is something i can work with


---------32:18----------
yeah uh so zack i'm i'm


---------32:21----------
i'm actually like i feel pretty good


---------32:23----------
that that this is something that


---------32:25----------
you can overcome like


---------32:29----------
i know i know the best way that i've


---------32:32----------
i've


---------32:33----------
been able to overcome it is by reminding


---------32:35----------
myself


---------32:36----------
that i'm just a very intelligent monkey


---------32:39----------
and i have no idea how the world


---------32:40----------
and the [ __ ] the inner workings of


---------32:42----------
the universe really exist


---------32:43----------
right like i have no idea what i'm


---------32:45----------
talking about just sit back


---------32:47----------
shut up and enjoy the ride like that's


---------32:49----------
been the best way


---------32:50----------
that i've learned to cope with it


---------32:54----------
yeah so what that sounds like a good


---------32:57----------
coping mechanism


---------32:58----------
but it sounds like a coping mechanism


---------33:01----------
not a fix


---------33:02----------
okay so there's a part of me that says


---------33:05----------
like


---------33:07----------
why not just learn how the universe


---------33:08----------
works


---------33:10----------
because you i i don't think you can


---------33:12----------
pierce the veil i don't i don't think


---------33:14----------
people can


---------33:15----------
i i don't think it's possible it's the


---------33:17----------
same as like i don't think a uh


---------33:19----------
you know how like an ant couldn't learn


---------33:20----------
physics i don't think people can do it


---------33:23----------
and i think that's a completely


---------33:25----------
reasonable


---------33:26----------
experience i mean a completely


---------33:29----------
reasonable view


---------33:31----------
and i think that you know you're not


---------33:33----------
going to understand


---------33:34----------
that people can pierce the veil until


---------33:36----------
you pierce the veil


---------33:38----------
yeah um i mean i guess that's a good way


---------33:41----------
to say it i mean people didn't know


---------33:42----------
there was fire until they made fire they


---------33:44----------
didn't know there was electricity until


---------33:46----------
that happened


---------33:47----------
yeah and so this is where i i think the


---------33:49----------
interesting thing is historically so i


---------33:50----------
think the problem is that where you are


---------33:54----------
yeah many people have been historically


---------33:56----------
and this is where my confidence comes


---------33:58----------
from is because i think that like


---------33:59----------
you know you have a lot of the features


---------34:02----------
that i'm gonna out


---------34:03----------
outline in a second that i think are you


---------34:06----------
know


---------34:07----------
you're really falling into a pattern


---------34:08----------
here can i just keep talking


---------34:10----------
yes so the first is that a lot of times


---------34:13----------
excitement and motivation come from


---------34:16----------
goals


---------34:16----------
especially for young people right like


---------34:19----------
so i i


---------34:20----------
like i i set a goal for myself i want to


---------34:22----------
be something i want to accomplish


---------34:23----------
something


---------34:24----------
and so you climb to the top of the


---------34:26----------
mountain and it's it's the


---------34:28----------
image of the view at the top of the


---------34:29----------
mountain


---------34:31----------
which motivates you to climb yeah


---------34:34----------
and so this is the most natural form of


---------34:37----------
like motivation and like goal setting


---------34:38----------
and excitement like you were building


---------34:40----------
something you were growing


---------34:41----------
you were playing games you were loving


---------34:43----------
it yeah and then you reached to the


---------34:45----------
the top of the mountain and even then


---------34:47----------
the view at the top of the mountain is


---------34:48----------
glorious


---------34:50----------
but now what right


---------34:54----------
and so this is where yeah it's like


---------34:57----------
you're slowly sliding down the side of


---------34:59----------
the mountain


---------34:59----------
and every once in a while you stop


---------35:02----------
sliding


---------35:03----------
and you sh you you trick yourself and


---------35:06----------
tell yourself that it's a win


---------35:07----------
but the fact is is that you're just


---------35:09----------
losing slower


---------35:12----------
yeah man so like i don't know how to say


---------35:15----------
this to you but as long as


---------35:17----------
that image and that experience is there


---------35:21----------
i think it's going to be very hard to


---------35:23----------
find excitement


---------35:24----------
yeah i i would say so right so here's


---------35:27----------
what i'm hearing


---------35:28----------
i think sliding down the mountain is a


---------35:30----------
good you seem like you wanted to say


---------35:31----------
something go for it


---------35:32----------
well i i think that it's more that it's


---------35:35----------
not just a metaphor for gaming it's like


---------35:37----------
i think whenever you're younger right


---------35:39----------
you look forward to


---------35:41----------
um you look forward to maybe getting


---------35:43----------
your first girlfriend


---------35:44----------
uh you know getting a car learning how


---------35:47----------
to drive


---------35:48----------
going to college you know like moving


---------35:50----------
out or


---------35:51----------
you know a bunch of these different


---------35:52----------
firsts and i feel like all the fun


---------35:55----------
firsts that i've


---------35:56----------
that i have are pretty much over with


---------35:59----------
and


---------35:59----------
i'm just kind of uh i i'm i'm waiting


---------36:02----------
for the bad first to happen


---------36:04----------
and it's like i really only have bad


---------36:06----------
things to look forward to for the rest


---------36:07----------
of my life in a way


---------36:09----------
i it sounds really bleak but that's


---------36:11----------
really how i feel yeah


---------36:13----------
i'm glad you're sharing that because i


---------36:14----------
think it's bleak and also it's


---------36:16----------
reasonable


---------36:17----------
and here's the reason it's reasonable


---------36:19----------
because


---------36:21----------
so far fulfillment from you has come


---------36:24----------
from cresting the mountain


---------36:27----------
right and so like here's what i'm


---------36:29----------
hearing is like there's an


---------36:30----------
uphill part and once we get to the top


---------36:34----------
it doesn't matter whether you're facing


---------36:36----------
north south east or west


---------36:37----------
there's only one way to go it sure is


---------36:40----------
yeah right and and so what i'm hearing


---------36:43----------
from you is this sort of like the fire


---------36:44----------
is going out


---------36:45----------
a fear of of mortality if you actually


---------36:48----------
study like psychoanalysis what you'll


---------36:50----------
find is that


---------36:51----------
dreams around dental problems are


---------36:54----------
associated with the fear of death


---------36:57----------
i don't blame them i don't blame them at


---------37:00----------
all


---------37:00----------
i think it's more about like it's not


---------37:02----------
about it's how to transcend the mountain


---------37:04----------
entirely


---------37:05----------
because like i don't yeah you can't the


---------37:08----------
thing is i know that you can't live your


---------37:10----------
life


---------37:11----------
it's like you have to you can't be uh i


---------37:14----------
guess like goal


---------37:15----------
like outcome uh driven right you have to


---------37:18----------
just be able to do something because you


---------37:20----------
enjoy doing it


---------37:21----------
yeah that's all yeah so so that's where


---------37:24----------
when you say transcend them out the


---------37:26----------
reason that i'm actually optimistic is i


---------37:27----------
think there are a couple of different


---------37:28----------
things going on one is that


---------37:30----------
i see this a lot because i work with


---------37:31----------
some very successful people


---------37:33----------
and success drives them to the top but


---------37:35----------
then they shrug their


---------37:36----------
they're like now what right and what


---------37:39----------
they usually end up doing is much like


---------37:41----------
yourself


---------37:42----------
they're like oh it's climbing to the top


---------37:44----------
of a mountain which


---------37:45----------
gives me a sense of fulfillment so let


---------37:48----------
me go find another mountain and then


---------37:49----------
they climb that one and they get like a


---------37:51----------
diminishing return from it


---------37:53----------
it checks some of the boxes and they're


---------37:55----------
like oh i've accomplished stuff


---------37:56----------
i can i feel pride but i still feel


---------37:59----------
unfulfilled


---------38:00----------
it's not the same and so they'll find


---------38:02----------
mountain after mountain after mountain


---------38:04----------
and they'll feel


---------38:05----------
unfulfilled despite being successful


---------38:07----------
successful successful


---------38:10----------
yep and so the reason that i'm


---------38:12----------
optimistic though is because like the


---------38:14----------
best known case


---------38:15----------
of someone solving this problem is


---------38:18----------
buddha


---------38:20----------
so okay yeah


---------38:23----------
like if you and i talked about them no


---------38:26----------
no i i know


---------38:27----------
a bit but not can you share with us what


---------38:29----------
you know about buddha


---------38:31----------
uh basically i think that he was some


---------38:34----------
sort


---------38:34----------
of a like some sort of workman and then


---------38:37----------
he kind of just sat


---------38:38----------
under a tree and pretty much all of the


---------38:41----------
a lot of the revelation that he had i


---------38:43----------
i believe was just kind of internal


---------38:46----------
and i think that the i remember there


---------38:48----------
was i think some sort of a


---------38:50----------
a phrase where the true enlightenment


---------38:54----------
is not you know understanding the


---------38:56----------
complexities of the universe it's


---------38:57----------
understanding the nothingness of the


---------38:59----------
universe or something like that i think


---------39:00----------
it's like a one of the


---------39:02----------
things about that now i could be getting


---------39:03----------
this completely wrong and this is like


---------39:05----------
10 years ago or 15 years ago but it's


---------39:08----------
that's what i remember


---------39:09----------
yeah that's actually it you hit all the


---------39:11----------
important parts but a couple of details


---------39:13----------
i think we're gonna have to reshift


---------39:15----------
so like i think uh the key thing is that


---------39:18----------
what buddha did was


---------39:19----------
as you put it pierce the veil yeah okay


---------39:22----------
so


---------39:22----------
right so like i think that's what his


---------39:24----------
discovery was is that like you can climb


---------39:26----------
mountains


---------39:27----------
until the end of time but that external


---------39:30----------
fulfillment


---------39:32----------
is gonna come with diminishing returns


---------39:34----------
and you can keep on chasing new things


---------39:36----------
you can like okay i'm gonna start a


---------39:37----------
company


---------39:38----------
i'm gonna become a streamer i'm gonna


---------39:39----------
have kids you can you can find


---------39:42----------
all these mountains to climb but that if


---------39:44----------
we kind of think about it fundamentally


---------39:46----------
like


---------39:46----------
if you're unsatisfied at the top of a


---------39:48----------
mountain like


---------39:50----------
that's a temporary satisfaction and


---------39:52----------
climbing mountains


---------39:53----------
is will always lead to temporary


---------39:55----------
satisfactions and so what would the


---------39:57----------
discovered


---------39:58----------
is like through a lot of internal work


---------39:59----------
which is exactly correct i mean i think


---------40:01----------
you hit a lot of the key points


---------40:03----------
which is that you can climb mountains


---------40:04----------
until you're out of breath but never


---------40:06----------
will that bring you peace


---------40:08----------
that peace is piercing the veil is not


---------40:10----------
about looking at a telescope


---------40:12----------
it's about looking at a mirror yeah


---------40:15----------
and so i think the journey that you have


---------40:17----------
to walk is is


---------40:18----------
this one and we can kind of talk so i


---------40:21----------
think that's like the fundamental of


---------40:23----------
where you are and then i think there's


---------40:24----------
also kind of a psychological component


---------40:25----------
fear of death thing like that that needs


---------40:27----------
to be processed


---------40:28----------
but there are a couple of um different


---------40:30----------
uh


---------40:31----------
key points that i want to share the


---------40:32----------
first is that buddha wasn't a workman


---------40:35----------
he was focused and so what happened is


---------40:38----------
materialistically he climbed to the top


---------40:41----------
of the highest mountain


---------40:43----------
so people told him like hey like as a


---------40:45----------
you know as a prince like


---------40:46----------
these are the things that you should


---------40:48----------
accomplish and he went and he did those


---------40:51----------
and then like you know he got married he


---------40:53----------
had a healthy son he was revered


---------40:55----------
he was wealthy he was powerful he was


---------40:57----------
respected


---------40:58----------
he was loved he had a bright future and


---------41:01----------
one day he woke up


---------41:03----------
and even though he was the envy of the


---------41:05----------
world he was unhappy


---------41:08----------
and so then he was like actually screwed


---------41:11----------
because there's a there's a subtle thing


---------41:12----------
uh zach which makes things both


---------41:15----------
beautiful


---------41:16----------
you're you're blessed and cursed because


---------41:18----------
when someone who is not


---------41:20----------
successful wakes up and feels unhappy


---------41:23----------
what do they think will lead them to


---------41:24----------
happiness well they think the success


---------41:27----------
will


---------41:27----------
uh yeah absolutely yeah they know what


---------41:30----------
the problem is and


---------41:31----------
they have a thing that they can displace


---------41:33----------
their


---------41:34----------
uh unhappiness onto but whenever you


---------41:37----------
have what you want


---------41:38----------
and then you still don't feel the way


---------41:40----------
you want it's harder to


---------41:42----------
deal with that absolutely so at some


---------41:45----------
point


---------41:46----------
you reach the end of the road right the


---------41:49----------
worse my life


---------41:50----------
is the further i can go like repairing


---------41:52----------
things repairing things repairing things


---------41:54----------
you know like playing games fixing your


---------41:56----------
teeth launching an


---------41:58----------
organization you kind of tried your hand


---------42:00----------
at a couple things you're taking care of


---------42:02----------
business


---------42:02----------
you're continuing to be successful and


---------42:05----------
yet


---------42:05----------
once we get to kind of the top then we


---------42:07----------
begin to realize we're like faced with


---------42:09----------
this


---------42:10----------
problem which is like where does


---------42:12----------
happiness come from


---------42:13----------
and this is the really really crazy


---------42:15----------
thing if you look at the the hindu and


---------42:17----------
buddhist traditions


---------42:18----------
i don't know if you're familiar with


---------42:19----------
this i'm going to go into a little bit


---------42:20----------
of history lesson is that okay


---------42:22----------
oh yeah i mean actually there's a story


---------42:25----------
that i


---------42:25----------
i remember i i heard and it was a a guy


---------42:29----------
that kind of ascended


---------42:30----------
to some degree of uh you know pseudo


---------42:33----------
heaven


---------42:33----------
and he was assigned an architect and


---------42:36----------
this is i think part of hindu mythology


---------42:38----------
and the architect uh you know he kept


---------42:40----------
wanting to bake bigger and builder


---------42:42----------
like bigger and bigger castles and


---------42:45----------
finally like the architect was so tired


---------42:47----------
of it


---------42:47----------
that he went and he asked i think it was


---------42:49----------
brahma or vishnu i forgot which one


---------42:51----------
and he's like how can i get this guy to


---------42:54----------
stop


---------42:55----------
wanting bigger and bigger castles and


---------42:58----------
then the the god told him


---------43:00----------
he's like i'll this is no problem i'll


---------43:02----------
solve it


---------43:03----------
and then the guy had the castle built


---------43:06----------
and then


---------43:06----------
a bunch of ants marched in to the castle


---------43:10----------
and each one of the different ants was


---------43:13----------
a former version of himself and it put


---------43:16----------
in perspective


---------43:18----------
how actually meaningless and and how how


---------43:20----------
little


---------43:21----------
it really mattered and i forgot i forgot


---------43:24----------
what his name was


---------43:27----------
yeah yeah that's not a particular story


---------43:30----------
i'm i'm


---------43:31----------
that familiar with so i i don't remember


---------43:33----------
his name but


---------43:34----------
um i think there's kind of an


---------43:36----------
interesting principle which is like if


---------43:38----------
you look at all the people


---------43:40----------
so you're i don't know if you're


---------43:41----------
familiar with this because it sounds


---------43:42----------
like you've studied


---------43:43----------
you know hindu mythology or something or


---------43:45----------
you're just well read maybe


---------43:46----------
or a bit i it's just well it's a story


---------43:49----------
that i think it


---------43:50----------
it made an impact on me and because it


---------43:53----------
just


---------43:54----------
it kind of puts into perspective that


---------43:55----------
like it's the whole idea of you know


---------43:57----------
ozymandias or anything like that where


---------44:00----------
any accomplishment that you have is


---------44:01----------
always fleeting absolutely


---------44:04----------
so so here's an interesting um


---------44:08----------
thing so you know like in india there


---------44:10----------
were four


---------44:11----------
castes there was a caste system yes and


---------44:13----------
the highest caste were the brahmins the


---------44:15----------
priests


---------44:16----------
these were the teachers of meditation


---------44:18----------
the closest to god et cetera et cetera


---------44:20----------
you know they were like they were like


---------44:22----------
they were the you know they taught


---------44:23----------
meditation


---------44:24----------
below them were the chatrias or the


---------44:28----------
nobility


---------44:29----------
these were kings lords etc below them


---------44:33----------
were the vaisnavas


---------44:34----------
uh who were avaishas sorry who were


---------44:38----------
the merchant class and below them were


---------44:41----------
the shudras or the laborer cast


---------44:43----------
and so let me ask you a question which


---------44:46----------
cast


---------44:46----------
do you think produces the most


---------44:48----------
enlightened people


---------44:51----------
um


---------44:52----------
[Music]


---------44:55----------
probably it's kind of hard to say i mean


---------44:59----------
it depends on like what you mean by


---------45:00----------
enlightenment i mean


---------45:02----------
obviously you would have the brahmins


---------45:04----------
and they're the ones that spend all of


---------45:05----------
their time


---------45:06----------
uh working towards enlightenment so


---------45:08----------
that's what would would make


---------45:10----------
a lot of sense but is that really what's


---------45:13----------
what's true


---------45:13----------
because usually i mean isn't that just


---------45:15----------
kind of hereditary what cast you end up


---------45:17----------
in sure


---------45:18----------
but they're also trained formally in the


---------45:20----------
in the skills of meditation right


---------45:22----------
they're the ones that are the teachers


---------45:23----------
and the experts


---------45:25----------
i don't know so it turns out that it's


---------45:27----------
the chatrias


---------45:29----------
okay so consistently like if you think


---------45:31----------
about the incarnations of vishnu which


---------45:33----------
if you want to think about it like not


---------45:34----------
from a religious standpoint


---------45:36----------
but a historical or anthropological


---------45:38----------
standpoint


---------45:39----------
yeah i think what you can safely assume


---------45:41----------
is that sometimes there have been


---------45:42----------
historical human beings


---------45:45----------
that have been like different to the


---------45:46----------
point where like they leave a legacy


---------45:49----------
that people assign divinity to


---------45:52----------
like rasputin like i mean that's a


---------45:56----------
that's a borderline one isn't it yeah


---------45:57----------
yeah yeah so so i i think it's it's a


---------46:00----------
good it's a funny example but possibly


---------46:02----------
yeah so what i'm thinking about is like


---------46:04----------
if you look at all the enlightened


---------46:05----------
beings from the indian subcontinent


---------46:07----------
they're all kind


---------46:08----------
of yeah things like that and and the


---------46:10----------
question is like why is that if you have


---------46:12----------
the experts in meditation you have the


---------46:14----------
teachers in meditation


---------46:16----------
and they what the the brahman does is


---------46:18----------
goes to the king's palace every day


---------46:20----------
teaches the king how to meditate and


---------46:22----------
then goes home


---------46:23----------
why is it that the king gets enlightened


---------46:26----------
before the brahman does


---------46:27----------
inconsistently so and the really


---------46:30----------
interesting answer is because like


---------46:31----------
you know i think it comes back to


---------46:33----------
climbing to the top of the hill


---------46:35----------
because at the end of the day what the


---------46:36----------
brahmin is taught is that like


---------46:38----------
don't climb to the top of the mountain


---------46:39----------
because that's not your job


---------46:41----------
the top of the mountain will never give


---------46:43----------
you fulfillment so the brahmin never


---------46:45----------
climbs to the top


---------46:47----------
but at the end of the day they travel to


---------46:49----------
the king's palace every single day


---------46:51----------
and they see a bigger house and


---------46:54----------
you know the king has a prettier wife


---------46:57----------
and


---------46:58----------
you know like the you know there's all


---------47:00----------
these like like the king eats finer food


---------47:02----------
and has finer clothing


---------47:04----------
and the king is the one who actually


---------47:06----------
winds up at the top of the mountain the


---------47:07----------
king is the one who wakes up one day


---------47:09----------
and finds like this desperation of


---------47:12----------
unhappiness


---------47:14----------
because remember like we talked about


---------47:15----------
when your life is not perfect you chase


---------47:17----------
an external goal


---------47:18----------
so for the brahmins there's the seed of


---------47:20----------
desire that is never fulfilled


---------47:22----------
and as long as that seed of desire is


---------47:24----------
never fulfilled they can never


---------47:26----------
truly seek enlightenment because the


---------47:28----------
search the road for enlightenment people


---------47:30----------
people make it sound like it's like a


---------47:32----------
positive thing


---------47:33----------
that's like if you look at instagram


---------47:34----------
accounts about like people who are


---------47:36----------
deeply spiritual it's all like


---------47:38----------
you know like being in touch with the


---------47:39----------
universe and like oh my god i'm so like


---------47:41----------
in love


---------47:41----------
like learn to love man i love myself in


---------47:45----------
a new way


---------47:46----------
those guys don't get it the road to


---------47:49----------
enlightenment starts


---------47:50----------
with what you feel every single day


---------47:54----------
is that like a no matter what you do


---------47:57----------
like things are decaying


---------47:59----------
and no matter like what you accomplish


---------48:01----------
like it that excitement can never be


---------48:04----------
reproduced


---------48:05----------
yeah that that's kind of what's so


---------48:08----------
it's very bittersweet in a way because


---------48:11----------
like you can appreciate it


---------48:12----------
and you can also resent it or dislike it


---------48:16----------
or be afraid of it


---------48:18----------
and you kind of have the the duality


---------48:20----------
that happens all the time


---------48:24----------
yeah so that's actually that


---------48:25----------
understanding is one of the key things


---------48:27----------
to transcend duality


---------48:29----------
you have to sit within duality


---------48:31----------
constantly to ultimately recognize that


---------48:34----------
things are neither bitter nor


---------48:35----------
sweet right so when you kind of talked


---------48:38----------
about you said something about like


---------48:40----------
nothingness


---------48:41----------
when you were talking about your


---------48:42----------
understanding of buddha's


---------48:44----------
enlightenment and i think one of the key


---------48:47----------
discoveries


---------48:48----------
is that like there is no such thing as


---------48:50----------
growth and there is no such thing as


---------48:52----------
decay


---------48:54----------
and once you recognize that once you


---------48:56----------
realize that you'll be free from your


---------48:58----------
sense of decay


---------49:00----------
i feel like uh like yeah it's like the


---------49:03----------
most enlightened version of it is what


---------49:04----------
it is


---------49:05----------
i i i get it i understand it but i i


---------49:09----------
how is that real if people die like a


---------49:11----------
tree a tree dies


---------49:13----------
it burns up trees gone how's that not


---------49:15----------
decay


---------49:17----------
yeah so so i could give you a logical


---------49:21----------
answer


---------49:22----------
that yeah it isn't decay um i i i i


---------49:27----------
could i could do that


---------49:28----------
but i think that will be a discussion of


---------49:30----------
logic and that's not actually going to


---------49:32----------
like let you transcend the mountain


---------49:35----------
so i you know the the answer that i


---------49:36----------
would give you is is all kinds of things


---------49:39----------
one is like you know that matter energy


---------49:42----------
and consciousness they're just


---------49:43----------
transformed right so like


---------49:46----------
like it is is a st is a chunk of


---------49:49----------
limestone


---------49:51----------
better or worse than like a brick in a


---------49:54----------
house


---------49:56----------
i think it's like the uh the impact that


---------49:58----------
it has on you right so like


---------50:00----------
of course obviously it's all the same in


---------50:03----------
the grand scheme of things right in the


---------50:04----------
grand order of the


---------50:05----------
of the universe but you know to a person


---------50:08----------
and to like what your experiences are


---------50:10----------
there are of course things that


---------50:12----------
have more importance to you than other


---------50:14----------
things it's like a


---------50:15----------
you know family member is more important


---------50:17----------
than a rock even


---------50:19----------
now we get to the crux of it right so


---------50:22----------
well said


---------50:23----------
the impact on you


---------50:26----------
so this is what the yogis discovered is


---------50:28----------
that like you said it's


---------50:29----------
internal so like the battle that you


---------50:31----------
need to fight has


---------50:32----------
nothing to do with climbing mountains it


---------50:35----------
has everything to do with


---------50:36----------
understanding how to essentially


---------50:40----------
control or be free of


---------50:43----------
things impacting you to be able to join


---------50:47----------
a micro transaction cesspit


---------50:50----------
the same amount is your first like


---------50:52----------
enjoyment of wow


---------50:54----------
to understand that like living in life


---------50:56----------
is like it's all about


---------50:58----------
impact in the sunscript word for


---------51:01----------
de-impaction essentially training


---------51:04----------
yourself to be free from the impact of


---------51:06----------
things


---------51:07----------
is vairagya to be free of like


---------51:11----------
its detachment is the the best kind of


---------51:14----------
uh definition of it um and so like this


---------51:17----------
is a process that like you can undergo


---------51:20----------
to where you know like you can like


---------51:22----------
literally


---------51:23----------
learn how to transcend the mountain that


---------51:25----------
the


---------51:26----------
going up the mountain and going down the


---------51:28----------
mountain is not actually like any


---------51:30----------
different


---------51:34----------
i know yeah i don't know it it


---------51:37----------
feels a lot different i'll say that yep


---------51:39----------
it feels a whole lot different


---------51:41----------
so but but that's the key thing right is


---------51:43----------
like like


---------51:44----------
the difference arises of feeling


---------51:48----------
it arises to your attachment or your


---------51:50----------
valuing


---------51:52----------
of the climb over the descent


---------51:56----------
yeah but how how could you possibly


---------51:58----------
equate the two that's what i i don't


---------52:00----------
understand is like


---------52:01----------
it it's like i i try to rationalize it


---------52:05----------
in my own mind a lot where it's like you


---------52:07----------
just go on it's like first


---------52:09----------
like for streaming for example right you


---------52:10----------
go on you have a great stream


---------52:13----------
you go on you have another stream and


---------52:15----------
it's not good


---------52:16----------
like how can you make both of those feel


---------52:19----------
as good to you personally and


---------52:21----------
like i think the answer that i always


---------52:23----------
tell myself is that well you have to


---------52:24----------
enjoy them both and you have to just


---------52:26----------
kind of get the same thing out of them


---------52:28----------
but it feels like that doesn't really


---------52:29----------
happen for me okay so i'm gonna give you


---------52:33----------
one last logical answer and then we're


---------52:34----------
gonna get into it


---------52:36----------
okay yeah all right so here's the thing


---------52:38----------
so so


---------52:41----------
i think you learn this in medicine so


---------52:44----------
like sometimes you work with a patient


---------52:46----------
and they live and sometimes you work


---------52:49----------
with a patient


---------52:50----------
and they die right


---------52:53----------
so like clearly one is better than the


---------52:56----------
other


---------52:57----------
there's like no objective argument that


---------52:59----------
can be made


---------53:02----------
and yet do you imagine that it's


---------53:04----------
possible


---------53:05----------
for a doctor to go to work every day and


---------53:08----------
actually


---------53:09----------
like be just as


---------53:12----------
satisfied with their life whether the


---------53:15----------
patient lives or dies


---------53:17----------
uh i don't think so i think that there


---------53:20----------
are a lot of doctors that probably if


---------53:21----------
they have a patient die they'll feel


---------53:22----------
terrible about it i would expect so yeah


---------53:26----------
yeah so so here's where what my


---------53:28----------
experience has been


---------53:30----------
is that ultimately i can't control


---------53:33----------
whether a patient lives or dies and it's


---------53:35----------
been really bizarre i'm thinking of one


---------53:36----------
particular patient in residency that had


---------53:38----------
like


---------53:39----------
younger guy um you know maybe in his


---------53:42----------
like or


---------53:43----------
early to mid 50s um had liver cancer but


---------53:47----------
like one of the


---------53:48----------
sort of genetic or other variants like


---------53:49----------
it's not like he was drinking alcohol


---------53:51----------
and did something


---------53:52----------
that was responsible for the cancer uh


---------53:55----------
you know so so he was a he was a um a


---------53:58----------
chinese gentleman and and so i was kind


---------54:00----------
of assigned to him because i speak a


---------54:01----------
little bit of mandarin and like we


---------54:02----------
didn't have mandarin translators


---------54:04----------
and so like i was assigned to him


---------54:05----------
because like i could at least ask him


---------54:08----------
like if he had pain that day


---------54:10----------
and so you know working with his family


---------54:12----------
was really interesting he had like a 17


---------54:13----------
year old son


---------54:15----------
and um you know it was really like


---------54:17----------
eye-opening because like it's clear that


---------54:19----------
the dude is gonna die


---------54:20----------
and and yet like like it's so hard to


---------54:23----------
describe i think this is where you have


---------54:25----------
to really experience it but


---------54:27----------
sort of like coming to terms with the


---------54:29----------
fact that as a human being like i can't


---------54:31----------
i can't cure him of his cancer like i


---------54:33----------
can't do that as a doctor you can't


---------54:34----------
actually save someone's life


---------54:36----------
all you can do is like try


---------54:39----------
right yeah and there comes a point where


---------54:40----------
like you can


---------54:42----------
a patient can survive and you can have


---------54:44----------
done a shitty job as a doctor


---------54:47----------
and a patient can have died and you


---------54:50----------
could have done an amazing job


---------54:52----------
as a doctor and that ultimately like


---------54:55----------
what where my piece comes from is like


---------54:58----------
is devoting myself to like the action


---------55:01----------
that i take


---------55:02----------
as opposed to like what happens to the


---------55:04----------
patient because there's no question


---------55:06----------
that you know life is better than death


---------55:08----------
at least in a medical setting right


---------55:10----------
it's just it's sort of like you know


---------55:12----------
what i where i find my peace and i know


---------55:13----------
this may sound strange to you zach and


---------55:15----------
we'll we'll get you there


---------55:18----------
you know because i think i have the


---------55:19----------
benefit of some of these experiences


---------55:21----------
where you like grapple with like people


---------55:22----------
dying of cancer and you figure out


---------55:24----------
how can i go on how can i you know can i


---------55:27----------
be proud of what i did and there are


---------55:28----------
times where like when i think about


---------55:30----------
that that patient and my work with that


---------55:32----------
patient that is i think like the height


---------55:35----------
of what i've been capable of yeah being


---------55:38----------
attached to an outcome


---------55:40----------
and being detached being detached from


---------55:42----------
yeah yeah that that's


---------55:44----------
you know that's yeah being attached is


---------55:45----------
the problem and being detached is the


---------55:47----------
goal


---------55:48----------
yeah and and so like like can you see


---------55:50----------
how objectively like there's no question


---------55:52----------
that life is better than death but


---------55:54----------
even like to this day the family is


---------55:56----------
incredibly grateful


---------55:57----------
that i was this person's doctor i'm


---------55:59----------
incredibly grateful for having the


---------56:01----------
experience


---------56:03----------
even though the dude died and it was sad


---------56:05----------
that there's an axis of suffering and


---------56:08----------
contentment that is actually


---------56:09----------
independent of happiness and sadness


---------56:14----------
okay okay i can see that yeah right


---------56:17----------
and i think you may understand that part


---------56:20----------
pretty well because


---------56:21----------
i think that there are a lot of reasons


---------56:23----------
that you there's a lot of


---------56:24----------
joy enjoyment and potential happiness in


---------56:27----------
your day to day


---------56:28----------
there's accomplishment there's hopefully


---------56:30----------
laughter


---------56:31----------
you know there's working with your one


---------56:33----------
true king folks and there's something


---------56:35----------
that's like


---------56:36----------
missing on the inside despite everything


---------56:39----------
going so well


---------56:41----------
yeah exactly so that axis


---------56:45----------
is like the path that you have to walk


---------56:47----------
through spirituality


---------56:48----------
because you've figured out how to like


---------56:50----------
become successful


---------56:51----------
that's the first axis and what happens


---------56:53----------
the reason we get stuck is because we


---------56:55----------
think that the axis of success


---------56:56----------
and the axis of contentment are linked


---------56:59----------
because


---------57:00----------
early on in life as we climb that


---------57:02----------
mountain we think that these two things


---------57:03----------
are linked because they grow together


---------57:06----------
and then you you kind of like you're


---------57:08----------
going up together and then what happens


---------57:10----------
you get to the top of the mountain


---------57:11----------
and then some people realize that the


---------57:13----------
axes are truly perpendicular


---------57:16----------
and when you understand that a hundred


---------57:17----------
percent is when you attain enlightenment


---------57:20----------
yeah i've tried so hard and like i i've


---------57:23----------
just


---------57:24----------
i i in a way like it's something that


---------57:27----------
you can clearly know


---------57:28----------
but knowing it isn't the same as living


---------57:31----------
it i with you 100


---------57:32----------
yeah yeah it's like i you you want to do


---------57:34----------
that and you want to


---------57:36----------
transcend being outcome like like


---------57:39----------
outcome driven or outcome determined or


---------57:42----------
whatever right


---------57:44----------
but you just can't get out of it


---------57:47----------
like i it's like i'll play a game and


---------57:49----------
i'll be like oh even if i don't beat the


---------57:50----------
boss you're gonna don't assume


---------57:52----------
it's fine and then i play it and i don't


---------57:54----------
beat the boss i'm i'm maulding


---------57:56----------
yep so so now so enough of theory


---------58:00----------
yes i think there's something holding


---------58:01----------
you back


---------58:03----------
okay yeah and so this is where i think


---------58:05----------
that like there's that general principle


---------58:07----------
but i think there's one big thing


---------58:08----------
getting in the way which is your fear of


---------58:10----------
death


---------58:10----------
so this i think think is actually like


---------58:12----------
psychological in nature


---------58:14----------
it's of the mind okay and and so as long


---------58:18----------
as you


---------58:18----------
we have to get to and probably process


---------58:22----------
or dissolve this sense of decay


---------58:26----------
that like plagues you


---------58:29----------
right so that like what i'm sort of


---------58:30----------
getting the sense of is like you have


---------58:32----------
this


---------58:32----------
shadow that goes like that accompanies


---------58:35----------
you through all of your things


---------58:37----------
and the shadow is like this feeling that


---------58:39----------
like we're on the decline that there's a


---------58:41----------
sense of decay


---------58:42----------
that joy like the only firsts that i


---------58:44----------
have left


---------58:46----------
are bad ones yeah you know exactly


---------58:49----------
and and so that comes from somewhere


---------58:52----------
that has nothing to do with the axis of


---------58:53----------
contentment or suffering


---------58:55----------
what that has to do with is like a


---------58:57----------
psychological like because


---------58:59----------
and this is where we can lean on


---------59:00----------
neuroscience a little bit just think


---------59:02----------
about this for a second zach like you


---------59:03----------
literally have


---------59:04----------
neurons that have been wired


---------59:08----------
to produce those thoughts


---------59:11----------
yeah right so then the question becomes


---------59:15----------
how did those neurons get wired that way


---------59:17----------
and how can we change your neuronal


---------59:19----------
wiring


---------59:20----------
so this is now taking a step we'll leave


---------59:23----------
spirituality behind


---------59:24----------
forget about spirituality forget about


---------59:26----------
enlightenment forget about the top of


---------59:27----------
the mountain


---------59:28----------
and what we really have to do for you is


---------59:30----------
do some psychological work and rewire


---------59:32----------
some of your neurons because once that


---------59:34----------
happens


---------59:34----------
then you can walk that other axis of


---------59:37----------
contentment and suffering


---------59:39----------
so let me ask you this does that make


---------59:41----------
sense


---------59:42----------
yeah no it definitely makes sense it's


---------59:44----------
basically it's programmed in the wrong


---------59:46----------
way like


---------59:46----------
you're programmed to think one thing and


---------59:48----------
and it's a bad thing to think yeah i


---------59:50----------
totally understand


---------59:51----------
sort of so the tricky thing is that it's


---------59:54----------
programmed


---------59:56----------
it was programmed in the right way and


---------59:58----------
now


---------59:59----------
it's maladaptive yeah so it's not a


---------60:02----------
mistake it's actually


---------60:04----------
and so let me ask you this how long have


---------60:07----------
you been


---------60:07----------
afraid of death since i found out about


---------60:11----------
it


---------60:12----------
can you tell me about that how you found


---------60:14----------
out about death oh


---------60:15----------
i don't really remember honestly uh i


---------60:17----------
was


---------60:18----------
i think the earliest memory i have is i


---------60:21----------
was like i'm like four or five or six


---------60:23----------
right


---------60:24----------
i got uh you know i was raised roman


---------60:26----------
catholic and so


---------60:27----------
i had a lot of experience just kind of


---------60:29----------
talking about


---------60:31----------
the whole idea of afterlife and


---------60:32----------
everything like that and even whenever i


---------60:34----------
was like five years old


---------60:36----------
i i read some of the stories i heard


---------60:38----------
some of the stories in the bible i was


---------60:39----------
like man i never heard of anybody that


---------60:40----------
lived in a fish i don't even know if


---------60:42----------
this is true


---------60:43----------
and it made me wonder it's like what is


---------60:46----------
the


---------60:47----------
uh what's really going on and what's


---------60:50----------
really gonna happen because like yeah i


---------60:52----------
understand people die


---------60:53----------
and i was scared of it i remember uh you


---------60:55----------
know it's like you can run from it hide


---------60:58----------
from it


---------60:58----------
uh destiny comes all the same and um


---------61:02----------
it it's scary it is and i remember


---------61:04----------
thinking that when i was a little kid


---------61:06----------
and there have been times where i've


---------61:09----------
been able to


---------61:10----------
kind of forget about that and i think


---------61:11----------
that's really kind of always been my


---------61:14----------
goal is to just not think about it


---------61:16----------
and i think that sometimes whenever i i


---------61:18----------
don't this sounds like really stupid


---------61:20----------
because


---------61:20----------
i i think it in a way i feel stupid for


---------61:23----------
thinking


---------61:24----------
this way and um like i will i will do


---------61:26----------
badly in a game sometimes and it will


---------61:28----------
remind me that i'm getting older


---------61:29----------
and i'm gonna die because i'm not as


---------61:32----------
good as i feel like i used to be


---------61:34----------
and it's like this weird like kind of


---------61:36----------
domino effect where like playing a game


---------61:38----------
like that will make him feel this way


---------61:40----------
and it's just so like to me


---------61:43----------
i i i find it embarrassing it's it's


---------61:46----------
weird


---------61:47----------
because i i think it's a um


---------61:50----------
it's like a illogical conclusion in a


---------61:53----------
way


---------61:54----------
but in another way it's not yeah


---------61:58----------
so well said so so i think when you say


---------62:01----------
it's an illogical conclusion here's what


---------62:03----------
i'm


---------62:04----------
i'm gonna rephrase that a little bit or


---------62:06----------
transform it okay


---------62:08----------
what i'm what i'm gonna the way i'm


---------62:09----------
gonna interpret that is that


---------62:12----------
if you look at the variables that lead


---------62:14----------
you to playing a


---------62:15----------
crappy game of whatever there are tons


---------62:18----------
of them right


---------62:19----------
yeah if you're a moba player the number


---------62:21----------
one variable is that your team sucks


---------62:24----------
absolutely it's always their fault yep


---------62:26----------
and and so


---------62:27----------
like if we think about it there are a


---------62:28----------
thousand reasons why you know


---------62:31----------
you're you have poor performance in the


---------62:33----------
game yeah but what your mind


---------62:35----------
jumps to is ah see this is a sign of


---------62:38----------
the decay we knew it was there


---------62:41----------
we know it's coming as you said you


---------62:43----------
can't escape it it's destiny here it is


---------62:47----------
and so this is this is the very nature


---------62:49----------
of a cognitive bias is that like it's a


---------62:51----------
filter


---------62:52----------
through which an independent experience


---------62:56----------
become like transforms into something


---------62:58----------
else


---------63:00----------
yeah it's like uh if the only tool you


---------63:02----------
have is a hammer every problem looks


---------63:03----------
like a nail


---------63:04----------
absolutely you find it yeah i get it so


---------63:07----------
so so now we go back to i mean you say


---------63:09----------
you don't have


---------63:09----------
many memories about it but like like i


---------63:11----------
think that we have to figure out how to


---------63:13----------
deconstruct the filter


---------63:14----------
and that that starts with like


---------63:16----------
understanding how the filter was built


---------63:18----------
and so when you were four years old and


---------63:20----------
you were like raised roman catholic and


---------63:22----------
when you say


---------63:23----------
can you tell us more about that well i


---------63:26----------
went to church every sunday got


---------63:28----------
communion


---------63:30----------
i never liked going to church couldn't


---------63:32----------
play game boy in church


---------63:33----------
and i didn't really ever believe in a


---------63:36----------
lot of this stuff


---------63:37----------
i thought it was kind of i i


---------63:40----------
in a way there's like the parallel


---------63:42----------
realities of


---------63:44----------
is it more like i think i even said this


---------63:47----------
last time i was on here is it more


---------63:49----------
terrifying


---------63:50----------
to know that you are created just for


---------63:53----------
this endless cycle


---------63:55----------
of servitude towards some deity that you


---------63:58----------
don't really fully comprehend


---------64:00----------
or is it more terrifying that you're


---------64:02----------
just a


---------64:03----------
hyper-intelligent ape with no purpose in


---------64:06----------
life who's going to die and


---------64:07----------
cease to exist in a period of time


---------64:10----------
that's


---------64:11----------
nothing in the grand scheme of things


---------64:12----------
it's like which one of these realities


---------64:14----------
is more terrifying and


---------64:15----------
you know i think they're both pretty bad


---------64:18----------
yeah so that sounds like philosophy to


---------64:20----------
me


---------64:21----------
yeah yeah i mean a lot of the religion


---------64:24----------
in a lot of ways


---------64:25----------
is philosophy and so what yep so


---------64:28----------
i'm gonna steer away from that go ahead


---------64:31----------
so why did you have to go to church well


---------64:35----------
my mom wanted me to it was sunday


---------64:38----------
and can you help me understand what


---------64:41----------
did you did you ever try to tell your


---------64:43----------
mom that you didn't want to go to church


---------64:45----------
yes i i made her aware of the way that i


---------64:47----------
felt about it yes many times


---------64:49----------
can you tell us about that i was like


---------64:51----------
mom i don't want to go she's like it's


---------64:53----------
too bad you're going to go


---------64:54----------
and i was like well i don't want to go


---------64:56----------
and then finally sometimes i would uh


---------64:59----------
try to make myself feel better and think


---------65:01----------
like maybe she'll take me to burger king


---------65:02----------
after church


---------65:04----------
that was that honestly sometimes that


---------65:06----------
helped but


---------65:07----------
um overall like yeah like she would


---------65:09----------
always make me want to go or make me go


---------65:12----------
and i didn't really like nowadays the


---------65:15----------
weird thing about it is nowadays i


---------65:16----------
i you know i offer every time that it's


---------65:19----------
like a holiday like right now you know


---------65:20----------
kovitz so like i'm not doing it


---------65:22----------
but like any other time besides and i


---------65:24----------
always tell her like listen mom if you


---------65:26----------
want if you want me to take you to


---------65:27----------
church i will


---------65:28----------
not even stream like i will make sure


---------65:29----------
that you get to go to church right


---------65:30----------
because


---------65:31----------
i knew how much it meant to her back


---------65:32----------
then but whenever i was a kid i didn't


---------65:35----------
have that same


---------65:36----------
perspective right and so back then i


---------65:38----------
just uh


---------65:40----------
you know i didn't want to go i hated


---------65:41----------
going and it was just


---------65:43----------
it's like i could be at home playing


---------65:45----------
with my friends i could be playing video


---------65:46----------
games i could be doing something i want


---------65:48----------
to do


---------65:48----------
and instead i'm doing this thing that i


---------65:50----------
don't want to do that i don't even think


---------65:51----------
is real


---------65:57----------
okay and what would she say when you


---------66:01----------
told her that you didn't want to go


---------66:04----------
uh i mean i think there's a lot of


---------66:06----------
different things she'd say but um


---------66:08----------
like i i don't the thing is it's it's


---------66:11----------
odd because i don't even really remember


---------66:13----------
like the only thing i really remember is


---------66:15----------
that it didn't matter


---------66:17----------
yep yeah i could rationalize it all i


---------66:19----------
wanted but uh


---------66:20----------
i was still still driving to church yep


---------66:24----------
so inevitable


---------66:28----------
it's inevitable nothing you can do to


---------66:31----------
escape it


---------66:32----------
well i could like fake sick sometimes to


---------66:34----------
fix it there's a few times i did that


---------66:36----------
but uh other than that yeah it's pretty


---------66:39----------
much inevitable


---------66:41----------
now we talking about going to church or


---------66:42----------
dying definitely church i feel like the


---------66:46----------
i i definitely feel like it's two kind


---------66:48----------
of different things


---------66:49----------
because church like i was like i knew


---------66:52----------
that at some point i wouldn't have to


---------66:54----------
always do this


---------66:55----------
and like i could get away from it to an


---------66:57----------
extent because it's like okay well i'm


---------66:59----------
clearly not going to be nine years old


---------67:02----------
forever


---------67:03----------
so eventually i won't have to deal with


---------67:04----------
this but


---------67:06----------
um with dying you can't really get away


---------67:08----------
from it in the same way


---------67:09----------
so it's not yet ask you a question okay


---------67:12----------
so yeah


---------67:13----------
i understand that you don't remember


---------67:14----------
exactly what the conversations were


---------67:16----------
but you remember the feeling


---------67:20----------
right of being dragged to church


---------67:24----------
yeah so like like there's a certain


---------67:27----------
sense of like


---------67:28----------
powerlessness and inevitability to the


---------67:30----------
story that you're telling


---------67:32----------
no i mean i think every kid has like


---------67:34----------
many stories like that where you just


---------67:35----------
have to do something it's like going to


---------67:37----------
school


---------67:37----------
it's the center we're not okay if it's


---------67:40----------
the same thing for you but let's not


---------67:41----------
worry about what


---------67:42----------
what many kids have okay so here's my


---------67:45----------
question i know it's gonna sound kind of


---------67:46----------
weird


---------67:47----------
yeah when you have those thoughts of


---------67:50----------
decay


---------67:52----------
is the quality flavor or color of


---------67:55----------
emotion


---------67:56----------
that you experience at all similar to


---------67:59----------
how you felt when you got dragged to


---------68:01----------
church


---------68:03----------
not really i mean i think the church


---------68:05----------
thing was just a more


---------68:06----------
or less a you know a one and a half hour


---------68:08----------
inconvenience


---------68:10----------
whereas dying is like a very much it's a


---------68:12----------
much longer inconvenience


---------68:14----------
and so can you tell me a little bit


---------68:16----------
about when you started to fear


---------68:18----------
death yeah like i was a kid i mean as i


---------68:21----------
said as soon as i figured out


---------68:23----------
that it was going to happen like how did


---------68:26----------
you figure out that it was going to


---------68:27----------
happen


---------68:28----------
well that's the thing is like i must


---------68:30----------
have been like four or five years old so


---------68:31----------
i can't really remember


---------68:33----------
i it's hard for me to like to really get


---------68:36----------
it


---------68:36----------
to really remember what it was or how it


---------68:40----------
felt


---------68:40----------
because it was just so long ago and so


---------68:43----------
i'm hearing you've carried this feeling


---------68:45----------
with you for a long time


---------68:47----------
yeah can you do you remember like


---------68:50----------
times that maybe you were a little bit


---------68:53----------
older that you were like


---------68:55----------
worried about it like do you have any


---------68:57----------
memories of being slightly older where


---------69:01----------
yeah i remember um uh well it's like not


---------69:04----------
just for me right i worry obviously


---------69:06----------
about my parents dying that's scary


---------69:09----------
and uh there's one time my mom she uh


---------69:13----------
i don't know we don't know really what


---------69:14----------
it was i took her to the doctor


---------69:16----------
a while afterwards but she like kind of


---------69:19----------
had some sort of like


---------69:20----------
a it wasn't really like a heart attack


---------69:23----------
but it was some sort of like a thing it


---------69:24----------
was like a couple of steps below that


---------69:27----------
and i remember like i woke up and i


---------69:29----------
thought that and i was like oh my god


---------69:31----------
that was a pretty bad point in my life


---------69:32----------
because she didn't want me to call that


---------69:34----------
the ambulance right because we were


---------69:36----------
really poor we couldn't afford it


---------69:38----------
and like having to deal with that and


---------69:40----------
like the helplessness not only


---------69:42----------
of you know of the the greater


---------69:46----------
existential situation but also just like


---------69:49----------
the day-to-day


---------69:50----------
like you know we don't have money we


---------69:51----------
can't take care of ourselves


---------69:53----------
and that was brutal


---------69:57----------
what was brutal about it well i mean


---------70:00----------
like having to


---------70:01----------
like feeling like you're gonna lose one


---------70:03----------
of your parents and then


---------70:05----------
thinking to yourself like this is all


---------70:07----------
i've ever known


---------70:08----------
and i like to know that it's not gonna


---------70:10----------
last


---------70:12----------
and like that that's what was scary and


---------70:15----------
to to be helpless even inside of the


---------70:18----------
context of society


---------70:19----------
right because you don't have the money


---------70:21----------
to take care of it and


---------70:23----------
uh the funny thing about that is that i


---------70:25----------
actually


---------70:26----------
um like yeah i had i remember because i


---------70:28----------
woke up and she was like


---------70:30----------
like it's just like screaming or like


---------70:31----------
crying and so like i had to wake up


---------70:33----------
like i used to have like ptsd and i


---------70:36----------
guess it's ptsd i don't know i just kind


---------70:38----------
of read about it later on


---------70:39----------
i would wake up and i would hear it in


---------70:41----------
my head and i would have to get up and


---------70:43----------
check on her


---------70:44----------
and this would happen like once every


---------70:45----------
like two hours or something like that


---------70:48----------
and uh this went on for maybe uh like


---------70:50----------
six months a year something like that


---------70:52----------
and and then you know i kind of got i i


---------70:55----------
that stopped happening


---------70:56----------
i wouldn't say i got over it but it


---------70:57----------
stopped happening and um


---------71:00----------
then a funny thing about that is that's


---------71:03----------
actually what


---------71:03----------
drove me to uh to make my youtube


---------71:05----------
channel and to start making videos


---------71:08----------
that's kind of the reason can you help


---------71:10----------
me understand that how does that relate


---------71:12----------
to a youtube channel


---------71:13----------
well because i didn't have the uh i


---------71:16----------
couldn't really


---------71:17----------
have a job at that point because i felt


---------71:19----------
like i had to be around to take care of


---------71:21----------
her


---------71:22----------
and i wanted to be able to work from


---------71:23----------
home and do something like that and so i


---------71:25----------
didn't want to spend all day at work in


---------71:26----------
case she had something happen that she


---------71:28----------
needed me there for


---------71:30----------
and that's why i started doing youtube


---------71:32----------
videos because i thought that well maybe


---------71:33----------
i can do this and


---------71:34----------
you know see where it goes


---------71:40----------
that's interesting yeah


---------71:45----------
so are you saying that if your mom had


---------71:46----------
never had something like a heart attack


---------71:48----------
you wouldn't


---------71:49----------
you wouldn't have had a career in


---------71:52----------
streaming


---------71:54----------
uh you know i uh i've always felt that


---------71:58----------
yeah i mean that's why i say i never


---------71:59----------
have any regrets in my life in a way


---------72:01----------
and um it's like uh you know


---------72:05----------
uh you need a hot fire to forge a sword


---------72:08----------
and


---------72:09----------
that's kind of the way that i i've


---------72:10----------
looked at it yeah it's true


---------72:14----------
but it sucks


---------72:22----------
so zach this may sound kind of weird but


---------72:26----------
like


---------72:30----------
i'm kind of hearing that you're not


---------72:32----------
really afraid of


---------72:34----------
i know it sounds weird yeah yeah go on


---------72:37----------
you're not really afraid of death


---------72:38----------
i think what what bothers you it sounds


---------72:41----------
to me is actually your


---------72:44----------
inability to deal with death


---------72:49----------
well control over it yeah yeah i mean


---------72:51----------
it'd be nice if i could control it


---------72:52----------
that'd be great


---------72:54----------
i i know it sounds weird and and yeah


---------72:56----------
this may seem like a


---------72:57----------
a useless distinction but to me it


---------72:59----------
actually feels pretty significant


---------73:01----------
because


---------73:02----------
what i'm what i'm hearing themes of


---------73:05----------
is is not actually death it's like it's


---------73:07----------
like you being


---------73:08----------
like and and i'm i'm stretching here


---------73:10----------
okay so i'm trying to draw connections


---------73:12----------
but


---------73:13----------
um and so you know we feel free to bat


---------73:15----------
them down if they don't


---------73:16----------
sit with you it's hypothesis testing


---------73:20----------
um you know what i'm really hearing is


---------73:22----------
that like


---------73:23----------
you've been on the receiving end of


---------73:25----------
being powerless before


---------73:27----------
and like what i'm hearing is that death


---------73:30----------
is like


---------73:32----------
the guaranteed powerlessness it's the


---------73:35----------
one thing


---------73:36----------
that you know that no matter how hard


---------73:39----------
you try


---------73:40----------
you can fix everything else you can have


---------73:43----------
money


---------73:43----------
you can have medical care you can have


---------73:45----------
friends you can have


---------73:46----------
love and you can gain power over every


---------73:49----------
dimension


---------73:50----------
in your life but the one thing that you


---------73:52----------
can never gain power over is death


---------73:56----------
yeah the interesting thing though is


---------73:59----------
that


---------73:59----------
i'm not because it's it's bizarre


---------74:01----------
because most people who


---------74:03----------
fear death are concerned about regret


---------74:06----------
they're concerned about lost


---------74:08----------
opportunities


---------74:09----------
they're concerned about all the things


---------74:10----------
that they didn't get to do


---------74:12----------
i'm not hearing really much of that at


---------74:14----------
all from you if i could sit in my room


---------74:16----------
and play video games eating cheetos and


---------74:18----------
drinking soda for another thousand years


---------74:20----------
i would do it


---------74:23----------
so so it's interesting because i know it


---------74:25----------
sounds weird


---------74:26----------
but for a lot of people the fear of


---------74:28----------
death is about missed things


---------74:31----------
i'm not hearing that from you what i'm


---------74:32----------
really hearing from you is that death is


---------74:34----------
about


---------74:35----------
the inevitability of powerlessness


---------74:38----------
yeah like that is like entropy is like a


---------74:42----------
force that no matter


---------74:43----------
how hard you fight against you can never


---------74:45----------
overcome


---------74:46----------
yeah you can't do anything about it yeah


---------74:48----------
it's it's the ozymandias analogy again


---------74:50----------
yeah


---------74:51----------
exactly and so this is where like i


---------74:53----------
think if you want to be free of that


---------74:56----------
the work that we need to do is about


---------74:58----------
experiences of powerlessness in your


---------75:01----------
life


---------75:02----------
right because that's yeah i've thought


---------75:05----------
about doing that for myself


---------75:07----------
too it's like i remember um


---------75:10----------
uh there's like sometimes whenever i


---------75:14----------
will take


---------75:14----------
risks in a way and this sounds really


---------75:17----------
bad


---------75:17----------
i'll take risks in a way that could


---------75:21----------
really hurt me and i don't care about


---------75:24----------
them because it's like kind of an


---------75:27----------
exercise in letting go of


---------75:31----------
worrying about your your well-being no


---------75:33----------
it's not


---------75:34----------
it's an exercise in exerting power


---------75:39----------
how do you feel how do you feel like


---------75:41----------
that because like


---------75:43----------
like you're taking the risk right so


---------75:44----------
like you're you're manning up against it


---------75:47----------
like like what so this is exactly what


---------75:50----------
i'm saying


---------75:50----------
for most people risk to their well-being


---------75:53----------
is is enough of a deterrent


---------75:55----------
but for you you have like a you have a


---------75:57----------
far


---------75:58----------
more important flame within you


---------76:01----------
which is like irrespective of the the


---------76:03----------
like


---------76:04----------
the impact to my well-being like i'm


---------76:06----------
going to choose i'm going to be in


---------76:08----------
control


---------76:08----------
i'm going to jump into the lake of fire


---------76:10----------
because i'm the one that's doing it


---------76:12----------
and while a thousand people will say to


---------76:14----------
you you're a dumb ass for jumping into a


---------76:15----------
lake of fire


---------76:16----------
they don't understand that like what you


---------76:18----------
need from that what you're getting out


---------76:19----------
of that is that you're the one who's


---------76:21----------
doing the jumping


---------76:23----------
for me like what i try to get out of it


---------76:25----------
is that


---------76:27----------
i can let go and just let it happen


---------76:31----------
if it is wrong we're saying the same


---------76:34----------
thing


---------76:34----------
yeah right because what you're trying to


---------76:36----------
do is train yourself to be powerless


---------76:39----------
powerless exactly yeah which in a weird


---------76:42----------
way


---------76:42----------
is actually taking control


---------76:46----------
uh i i i guess yeah i mean if you well


---------76:49----------
how could


---------76:50----------
well yeah but it's like it's how do you


---------76:52----------
how can you it's like a paradox right


---------76:54----------
because how do you take control of not


---------76:57----------
having control


---------76:59----------
how do you not take control that's why


---------77:02----------
it doesn't work


---------77:05----------
okay because you've tried it right yeah


---------77:09----------
and you still fear death and you still


---------77:12----------
fear powerlessness


---------77:14----------
and you've like like do you see like i


---------77:15----------
think we're saying the same thing like i


---------77:17----------
think


---------77:17----------
now i feel like we're on to something


---------77:19----------
because it's like


---------77:20----------
you do this thing to train yourself


---------77:24----------
to endure yourself to build build some


---------77:26----------
damage like you want some


---------77:28----------
fear of death resistance so what you're


---------77:30----------
gonna do is jump into a lake of fire and


---------77:32----------
a thousand other people are gonna say


---------77:33----------
like don't do that that's dumb


---------77:35----------
and you're like you guys don't


---------77:36----------
understand for me it's like


---------77:38----------
i have to learn how to like


---------77:41----------
let go or whatever like i have to learn


---------77:44----------
how to face these things and like


---------77:46----------
do something that's high risk because


---------77:48----------
it's like you trying to grapple with


---------77:50----------
this thing


---------77:51----------
yeah well it's also just like small


---------77:55----------
things i remember i uh


---------77:58----------
i i was walking up the street this was


---------78:00----------
like a years ago


---------78:01----------
right or quite a while and a few years


---------78:03----------
ago it was quite a while ago


---------78:04----------
and um i had like a weird i don't know


---------78:07----------
if this was like a panic attack or


---------78:08----------
something like that where


---------78:10----------
i was walking down to the street and i


---------78:12----------
or to the store i was walking down the


---------78:13----------
street to the store


---------78:14----------
and i had like a weird thing happen with


---------78:16----------
like my chest


---------78:18----------
and i don't know if it was a panic


---------78:20----------
attack if it was some sort of like


---------78:22----------
you know weird thing with my heart i


---------78:23----------
don't know what it was this happened


---------78:25----------
a few years ago and i it was the first


---------78:28----------
time that i ever really


---------78:29----------
felt i think that almost many people


---------78:31----------
have this experience right where they


---------78:33----------
they have the the first feeling of


---------78:34----------
mortality and that was that for me


---------78:37----------
right and i remember a year or so later


---------78:40----------
i had


---------78:41----------
not that same feeling but something that


---------78:43----------
reminded me of it like walking up the


---------78:45----------
street and i thought to myself


---------78:47----------
if that's the case and if i die right


---------78:50----------
now


---------78:52----------
there couldn't be a better time for it


---------78:53----------
to go i'm walking down the street


---------78:55----------
i'm happy i'm with my friends i'm in my


---------78:58----------
neighborhood


---------78:59----------
and everything is as good as it's ever


---------79:01----------
going to be


---------79:02----------
and that's been the closest that i've


---------79:06----------
been


---------79:07----------
to


---------79:21----------
i don't know like like think about that


---------79:23----------
for a second like


---------79:25----------
so so you're afraid of death right


---------79:28----------
yeah in that second time when you were


---------79:31----------
walking don't read twitch at


---------79:34----------
okay all right so when you're when


---------79:37----------
you're


---------79:37----------
walking up the street and you start to


---------79:41----------
feel that sensation


---------79:42----------
did you think you were dying uh


---------79:45----------
there's a two percent chance one percent


---------79:48----------
chance yeah


---------79:48----------
it made me aware it made me aware sure


---------79:52----------
and so as like so can we just sort of


---------79:54----------
i'm gonna put


---------79:55----------
some i'm gonna interpret okay so you're


---------79:58----------
welcome to push back against


---------79:59----------
interpretation


---------80:00----------
so in that moment you were actually like


---------80:03----------
some of the


---------80:04----------
that's the closest to death that you've


---------80:06----------
actually ever been


---------80:08----------
closest to death that i've been without


---------80:10----------
i mean like there have been some other


---------80:11----------
times where i've been pretty close to it


---------80:13----------
aware aware of your proximity to death


---------80:16----------
let's put it that way uh


---------80:18----------
i remember there was one time


---------80:21----------
i was driving that my friend was driving


---------80:23----------
down the street he was drunk and high


---------80:25----------
and i was in the passenger seat and the


---------80:27----------
seat belt didn't work


---------80:29----------
and i thought to myself man i'm never


---------80:31----------
going to have to worry about that test


---------80:32----------
that i have to do next week


---------80:34----------
how did you feel when you were close to


---------80:37----------
death


---------80:39----------
uh in the first case uh the the one in


---------80:43----------
the car


---------80:44----------
i felt uh it's like it there's like the


---------80:47----------
it's it's it's terrifying but at the


---------80:50----------
same time it's also grounding


---------80:54----------
and when you're walking up the street


---------80:56----------
and you think to yourself maybe there's


---------80:57----------
a two percent chance this is a heart


---------80:58----------
attack how do you feel


---------81:01----------
oh that died just i felt good feel fine


---------81:04----------
so


---------81:04----------
like this makes no sense


---------81:09----------
because here you are afraid of death on


---------81:11----------
a daily basis


---------81:13----------
and when it comes knocking on your door


---------81:15----------
the words that you describe


---------81:17----------
are not abject terror sure there's


---------81:20----------
terror but there's also grounding


---------81:22----------
and there's also a sense of like peace


---------81:23----------
and acceptance


---------81:26----------
yeah yeah uh it's it's a weird


---------81:30----------
it's like kind of you have moments of uh


---------81:33----------
moments of peace and moments of being


---------81:36----------
able to deal with things


---------81:37----------
and then also moments where you can't


---------81:41----------
no it's like it's not an even i'm gonna


---------81:44----------
disagree


---------81:45----------
okay because i think actually i know it


---------81:47----------
sounds weird


---------81:48----------
what you say is logically makes a ton of


---------81:50----------
sense but here's


---------81:51----------
here's what i'd like to put out to you


---------81:53----------
is that when


---------81:54----------
actually faced with death you're okay


---------81:57----------
with it


---------81:58----------
it's the feeling of decay the feeling of


---------82:01----------
inevitability the feeling of


---------82:02----------
powerlessness


---------82:03----------
about that future thing that you can


---------82:05----------
never prevent


---------82:06----------
that's where you're terrified


---------82:10----------
yeah do you see the difference like


---------82:12----------
because when you actually face death


---------82:14----------
you're like so be it and anticipation


---------82:18----------
is the uh is the stressful thing and you


---------82:20----------
know going back to the the thing with


---------82:22----------
the dentist right i mean


---------82:23----------
sitting in the waiting room is way more


---------82:24----------
stressful than actually having the teeth


---------82:26----------
uh


---------82:26----------
you know fixed or whatever so now we get


---------82:29----------
to like i think the problem is that


---------82:30----------
you've misdiagnosed yourself and not


---------82:32----------
that we diagnose you here on stream i'm


---------82:34----------
not gonna diagnose


---------82:35----------
just use that term loosely okay because


---------82:38----------
you you call it the fear of


---------82:40----------
death but i don't think it's the fear of


---------82:42----------
death i think it's the fear of


---------82:44----------
powerlessness


---------82:45----------
because when you actually face death


---------82:46----------
you're kind of like if i go


---------82:48----------
so be it that's vairagya


---------82:52----------
yeah i mean it's it's scary in a way


---------82:56----------
yeah i think the the the more i have to


---------82:58----------
think about it


---------83:00----------
it's like kind of it it's like i try not


---------83:03----------
to think about it


---------83:04----------
let me just say that yeah so we'll get


---------83:05----------
to your whole coping


---------83:07----------
structure in a second but like and i


---------83:09----------
think this is where


---------83:10----------
you know i i sort of barked up the tree


---------83:12----------
of like roman catholicism fear of death


---------83:14----------
and things like that


---------83:15----------
and that tree didn't there's nothing in


---------83:17----------
the tree right


---------83:19----------
i asked you that stuff and it kind of


---------83:20----------
felt like it wasn't


---------83:22----------
you're kind of like yeah that's not the


---------83:24----------
same feeling you basically told me


---------83:25----------
so and i think that makes sense because


---------83:27----------
i think what the feeling really is it


---------83:29----------
really has to do with like we've got to


---------83:30----------
talk about times in your life where you


---------83:32----------
felt powerless


---------83:32----------
like this whole thing with your mom i


---------83:34----------
think is like a far better


---------83:36----------
like i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------83:38----------
like you know when you think about your


---------83:40----------
decay when you do poorly in a video game


---------83:43----------
okay yeah this is gonna sound like a


---------83:45----------
bizarre question feel free to swat this


---------83:47----------
down too if it doesn't


---------83:48----------
feel right okay when you do poorly in a


---------83:51----------
video game


---------83:52----------
is the color flavor and texture of how


---------83:55----------
you feel in that moment forget about


---------83:57----------
your thoughts forget about your


---------83:58----------
rationalizations


---------83:59----------
similar to how you felt when your mom


---------84:02----------
told you


---------84:02----------
don't call the ambulance uh yeah i mean


---------84:05----------
to an extent yeah


---------84:06----------
uh sure and i i think that's basically


---------84:08----------
it it's like feeling


---------84:09----------
yeah feeling like you don't have the


---------84:11----------
control over it and


---------84:13----------
like you just can't you know what you


---------84:16----------
know what needs to happen and you can't


---------84:17----------
do it


---------84:21----------
yeah so that's so the the interesting


---------84:23----------
thing as


---------84:24----------
zach is that i think if you want to be


---------84:28----------
happy okay yeah there's a two-step


---------84:31----------
process and and we can dig into this a


---------84:33----------
little bit more if you want to today but


---------84:35----------
like here's what i'm seeing


---------84:36----------
the first thing that you've got to do


---------84:38----------
because you said this beautifully you


---------84:39----------
said


---------84:41----------
i didn't get over it but it stopped


---------84:43----------
happening


---------84:45----------
with your with your i think that's a lot


---------84:48----------
of ptsd and things like that


---------84:50----------
right i mean you have like the initial


---------84:52----------
shock it's the same as like a wound


---------84:53----------
right i mean you the wound eventually


---------84:56----------
heals


---------84:57----------
but you still remember it being there in


---------84:59----------
a way yeah so here's what i'm gonna say


---------85:02----------
is that it just changed the shape


---------85:05----------
in which it manifests and that it's the


---------85:08----------
same thing this is the hypothesis


---------85:10----------
the the fear of decay that you have is


---------85:13----------
what it turned into


---------85:18----------
when did your mom have this event 2012.


---------85:22----------
okay i think it's just somewhere around


---------85:24----------
them i'm meant 2013 i think it was


---------85:27----------
november 2012 if i remember right and


---------85:29----------
how long


---------85:30----------
did it did you have the the ptsd waking


---------85:34----------
up things like that


---------85:35----------
until about uh i don't know like 2014


---------85:39----------
2000 middle of 2014 somewhere around


---------85:41----------
there


---------85:42----------
okay i mean like obviously these are


---------85:44----------
very rough like


---------85:45----------
guesses but yeah and and how long have


---------85:48----------
you felt


---------85:49----------
not excited how long have you been


---------85:53----------
worried about the decay of your career


---------85:55----------
and that you're getting older


---------85:56----------
uh probably last two years uh two or


---------85:58----------
three years


---------85:59----------
that probably saved you three three


---------86:01----------
issues so it looks like there's like so


---------86:03----------
let's say like


---------86:04----------
there's a pretty significant gap between


---------86:06----------
2014 and 2018


---------86:08----------
and and i think that there's like to to


---------86:11----------
me though i feel like i've got a pretty


---------86:13----------
good


---------86:13----------
sense that if you want to be free of


---------86:16----------
this thing


---------86:17----------
you've actually go to gotta go back and


---------86:19----------
explore like times in your life where


---------86:21----------
you felt powerless


---------86:23----------
like the sense of inevitability and like


---------86:26----------
powerlessness


---------86:26----------
and we can kind of talk about that more


---------86:28----------
i mean i know we've been at it for


---------86:30----------
you know a while now um


---------86:33----------
and so i'll kind of leave it up to you


---------86:34----------
whether you want to talk a little bit


---------86:36----------
about like coping


---------86:38----------
like your your uh you know your tendency


---------86:40----------
to like cope and


---------86:42----------
well what do you mean by exploring it


---------86:44----------
like that's i'm curious


---------86:45----------
like how do you explore a moment of


---------86:47----------
powerlessness


---------86:48----------
when it yeah great question so like i i


---------86:50----------
think i know it sounds weird but


---------86:52----------
when when i asked you about your mom


---------86:55----------
what did you feel in that moment as you


---------86:58----------
were


---------86:58----------
retelling the story what sucked


---------87:02----------
i mean like the thing is if i i've told


---------87:05----------
the story before on my stream


---------87:06----------
so like kind of the visceral like


---------87:08----------
emotional feeling is not really there as


---------87:10----------
much because i'm used to telling it


---------87:12----------
but um it's it it sucks i mean i think


---------87:16----------
yeah


---------87:16----------
it just it feels bad i think that's what


---------87:19----------
i what in


---------87:19----------
what way does it feel bad


---------87:22----------
i don't know i mean like it it feels bad


---------87:25----------
that it happened it feels bad that


---------87:28----------
i i i guess yeah it just feels bad that


---------87:31----------
it happened i i'm not really sure


---------87:32----------
exactly how to describe it


---------87:34----------
so let me ask you this do you experience


---------87:37----------
an echo


---------87:38----------
of what you experienced back then when


---------87:40----------
you tell the story


---------87:42----------
no that's why i can tell it okay


---------87:45----------
so that's what we have to change so


---------87:48----------
here's how it works


---------87:50----------
okay so from like and this is a slightly


---------87:53----------
more yogic perspective but if we look at


---------87:54----------
principles of psychotherapy i think


---------87:56----------
we're kind of let's all


---------87:57----------
so i'll kind of explain to you what


---------87:58----------
happens so when we have negative


---------88:01----------
experiences


---------88:02----------
there's a certain emotional energy that


---------88:04----------
we experience in that moment


---------88:07----------
and yeah that that energy can do one of


---------88:09----------
two things it can either be digested


---------88:11----------
or buried generally speaking as we get


---------88:14----------
older we get


---------88:15----------
better at digesting negative experiences


---------88:19----------
so if we think about like you know um


---------88:24----------
so for example you know being


---------88:28----------
emotionally abused by your boss at the


---------88:30----------
age of 27


---------88:32----------
for six months is far less


---------88:35----------
damaging than being emotionally abused


---------88:38----------
by a teacher for six months at the age


---------88:40----------
of five


---------88:42----------
yes right so like if we think about why


---------88:44----------
is that it's because our pr


---------88:46----------
our our brain's capacity to process and


---------88:48----------
digest at


---------88:49----------
older ages is improved


---------88:52----------
yeah you have more context around it


---------88:54----------
absolutely more con


---------88:57----------
yeah so it what you say is context is


---------88:59----------
your brain's ability to attach context


---------89:01----------
around it


---------89:02----------
yeah right so the five-year-old doesn't


---------89:04----------
understand how to do that


---------89:06----------
you're precisely right but i'm just sort


---------89:08----------
of reshaping it as like a faculty


---------89:10----------
of the mind so if we look at like


---------89:12----------
psychotherapy and like psychiatry like


---------89:14----------
why do we dig into the past it's because


---------89:15----------
like most of the dormant emotional


---------89:18----------
energy


---------89:18----------
forms in the past because we tend to do


---------89:20----------
pretty good like you can have a


---------89:21----------
traumatic breakup you can lose a parent


---------89:23----------
things like that


---------89:24----------
but like losing a parent at the age of


---------89:26----------
seven has


---------89:27----------
and i've seen this lifelong impacts


---------89:31----------
losing a parent at the age of 42 has


---------89:34----------
also affects you for the rest of your


---------89:36----------
life but it doesn't like


---------89:38----------
damage you for the rest of your life


---------89:40----------
yeah it doesn't change the course yeah i


---------89:42----------
see


---------89:42----------
so here's what happens i know it sounds


---------89:44----------
kind of weird but that energy lies


---------89:46----------
dormant and then resurfaces so the


---------89:48----------
example that i'm going to use is like


---------89:49----------
the the standard one i use on stream is


---------89:52----------
let's say i'm walking down the street


---------89:53----------
with my kid


---------89:54----------
and my kid sees a dog kid goes to pet


---------89:56----------
the dog


---------89:57----------
kid dog kind of nips at my kid the kid


---------90:00----------
gets terrified


---------90:01----------
starts crying yells terrified pick me up


---------90:04----------
daddy feels a ton of fear and emotion


---------90:07----------
ten minutes later i get her an ice cream


---------90:08----------
she's licking the ice cream we don't


---------90:10----------
have to go to the emergency room or


---------90:11----------
anything the


---------90:11----------
dog was actually just sniffing her


---------90:12----------
didn't even bite her but for her it was


---------90:14----------
traumatic


---------90:15----------
and ten minutes later she's like a kid


---------90:17----------
she's resilient so she's like licking


---------90:19----------
her ice cream telling me about


---------90:20----------
you know what she's what she's doing in


---------90:22----------
school everything's fine


---------90:24----------
until the next day when she sees another


---------90:27----------
dog


---------90:28----------
and she freaks out daddy picked me up oh


---------90:30----------
my god so like where did that


---------90:33----------
you know she's like across the street


---------90:34----------
it's like what's happening


---------90:37----------
so what's happened is her neurons have


---------90:39----------
wired


---------90:40----------
to recognize this dog as a dangerous


---------90:42----------
stimulus


---------90:44----------
yeah people like the human brain is good


---------90:46----------
at uh


---------90:47----------
recognizing patterns and making patterns


---------90:49----------
absolutely right so that


---------90:51----------
dormant emotional energy so that's the


---------90:52----------
neuroscientific perspective


---------90:54----------
let's think about it from like an


---------90:55----------
emotional energy perspective a ton of


---------90:57----------
emotion


---------90:58----------
disappears in 10 minutes it doesn't


---------91:00----------
actually disappear


---------91:02----------
right it goes dormant yeah yeah and then


---------91:05----------
reactivates


---------91:07----------
so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------91:10----------
like


---------91:10----------
this emotional energy reactivates


---------91:14----------
as signs of decay oh you see the decay


---------91:16----------
there you see the decay there


---------91:18----------
it's inevitable i'm powerless there's


---------91:20----------
nothing i can do


---------91:22----------
and so then the question becomes like


---------91:23----------
okay if that emotional energy is like


---------91:25----------
manifesting because this is where we


---------91:26----------
kind of get to coping you i mean you say


---------91:27----------
it beautifully


---------91:28----------
zack you're kind of like i didn't really


---------91:31----------
get over it but it sort of went away and


---------91:33----------
what it's doing is it's like seeping in


---------91:35----------
through the cracks now


---------91:36----------
it shapes the way that your mind looks


---------91:38----------
at things it shapes the way that you


---------91:40----------
look at life because


---------91:41----------
there's this like part of your brain


---------91:43----------
that is telling you zach that no matter


---------91:45----------
what you do


---------91:47----------
you are powerless and so what is your


---------91:50----------
brain then what happens is your brain


---------91:52----------
takes that feeling


---------91:53----------
and it actually tries to construct a


---------91:55----------
logic around it


---------91:56----------
so this sounds kind of weird but this is


---------91:57----------
how like kind of psychosis works we're


---------91:59----------
like paranoia


---------92:00----------
where the person has the paranoia it's


---------92:03----------
actually an


---------92:03----------
emotion that's at the root of it and


---------92:06----------
then their their


---------92:07----------
mind constructs an explanation


---------92:10----------
to corroborate the emotion why do people


---------92:13----------
feel like they're being followed by the


---------92:14----------
fbi


---------92:15----------
as opposed to someone else it's because


---------92:18----------
they have a


---------92:18----------
feeling of being followed feeling


---------92:21----------
feeling observed


---------92:22----------
and then the mind constructs and asks


---------92:24----------
itself in a logical way


---------92:26----------
what organizations have the resources to


---------92:28----------
constantly follow me which is why you


---------92:30----------
see these recurrent themes of like fbi


---------92:32----------
mob whatever


---------92:35----------
yeah i can see that so they're just


---------92:37----------
looking for a outlet


---------92:39----------
to rationalize their feelings absolutely


---------92:41----------
but at the root of it


---------92:42----------
is a feeling and in your case i think


---------92:45----------
what your mind has done is like


---------92:47----------
latched on to this fear of death because


---------92:49----------
i don't think it's actually a fear of


---------92:50----------
death i know it sounds weird


---------92:51----------
i know you're afraid of death but i


---------92:52----------
think what you're really afraid of is


---------92:54----------
powerlessness at the time of death


---------92:55----------
because if we really look at it


---------92:57----------
scientifically when you face death


---------93:00----------
you're not like freaking the [ __ ] out


---------93:02----------
you're actually like


---------93:03----------
if i have to go now so be it which is


---------93:05----------
not what you would expect


---------93:07----------
from someone who's facing death no it's


---------93:09----------
not


---------93:10----------
and so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------93:12----------
but so now when we get to when you say


---------93:14----------
like


---------93:15----------
exploring it what does that mean what


---------93:16----------
this means is that actually all of that


---------93:19----------
dormant emotion


---------93:20----------
as we talk about it and as we bring the


---------93:23----------
emotion up


---------93:24----------
you will feel it in the moment


---------93:27----------
and you will feel powerless in the


---------93:29----------
moment but the cool thing is that each


---------93:31----------
time you


---------93:32----------
feel powerless let's say like in a


---------93:35----------
therapy session


---------93:36----------
it actually reduces the dormant


---------93:38----------
emotional energy


---------93:39----------
and as the dormant emotional energy


---------93:42----------
starts to wane


---------93:43----------
your fear of decay will go with it


---------93:48----------
so i actually have an interesting way


---------93:50----------
that i actually i


---------93:52----------
i agree with you and i think that's kind


---------93:54----------
of one of the reasons why i talked about


---------93:56----------
it on my stream too


---------93:57----------
is because the exact same thing happened


---------94:00----------
with a lot of other problems that i had


---------94:02----------
whenever i was younger so


---------94:04----------
if you ever go back and watch one of my


---------94:06----------
highlight videos of 2016 or something


---------94:09----------
like that


---------94:11----------
i was very afraid to even show my arms


---------94:15----------
because i'm i'm extremely skinny


---------94:16----------
i'm very very very skinny and


---------94:19----------
i was even more so then and on top of


---------94:23----------
that i


---------94:23----------
i would always cover my mouth whenever i


---------94:25----------
would smile because i didn't want people


---------94:27----------
to see that i had


---------94:28----------
things wrong with my teeth i would


---------94:31----------
wear a beanie sometimes if i felt a


---------94:33----------
little bit more bald than usual that day


---------94:36----------
and uh i had a lot of insecurities and


---------94:38----------
um


---------94:40----------
having to eventually deal with those


---------94:42----------
insecurities on camera


---------94:44----------
and i remember recently i took a shower


---------94:46----------
on stream where i took my shirt off on


---------94:48----------
stream


---------94:49----------
and imagine doing that uh four years ago


---------94:52----------
for me is just completely


---------94:53----------
like i just could never imagine doing


---------94:55----------
that at all


---------94:56----------
and i think that the reason that i was


---------94:59----------
able to do that is kind of just


---------95:01----------
consistently dealing with those problems


---------95:03----------
and being faced with that


---------95:05----------
constantly and then slowly just kind of


---------95:08----------
learning to accept that this is who i am


---------95:11----------
rather than this is uh you know


---------95:14----------
something i have to be


---------95:14----------
afraid of or ashamed of that i i can't


---------95:17----------
let anybody know about me


---------95:18----------
and i think that was that was helpful


---------95:21----------
for me because it helped me


---------95:22----------
become more of more accepting of myself


---------95:26----------
yeah so so perfect example


---------95:29----------
i'm going to reinterpret it using a


---------95:32----------
different kind of language


---------95:34----------
so i think the problem when we hear your


---------95:36----------
story is people


---------95:37----------
if people are struggling with the same


---------95:38----------
thing they're like i'm insecure about my


---------95:40----------
appearance


---------95:40----------
there and you say i learned to accept it


---------95:43----------
everyone listening at home is like


---------95:45----------
how do i learn to accept it right


---------95:47----------
because acceptance comes


---------95:49----------
at the end whereas like i'm gonna try to


---------95:51----------
reinterpret this using


---------95:52----------
the model that i shared with you is i


---------95:54----------
don't think i think the learning to


---------95:56----------
accept it


---------95:57----------
is sort of like happens towards the end


---------95:59----------
the interesting thing is that if you


---------96:01----------
think about


---------96:02----------
each of those moments okay so you have


---------96:04----------
the the dormant energy of insecurity


---------96:07----------
and every time you put on the beanie


---------96:10----------
that energy is not being digested


---------96:12----------
but every time you take off the beanie i


---------96:15----------
know this sounds kind of weird but


---------96:16----------
that insecure emotion comes up and is


---------96:19----------
present


---------96:20----------
alive and on in your mind yeah and if


---------96:23----------
it's not i'll read read it and somebody


---------96:25----------
will make a comment about it again


---------96:27----------
and so then it brings it up and it


---------96:29----------
brings it up


---------96:30----------
and it brings it up so all of the


---------96:32----------
dormant energy of the insecurity


---------96:35----------
activates in the present and if we think


---------96:37----------
about even something like exposure


---------96:39----------
therapy from a phobia or we think about


---------96:40----------
my kid


---------96:41----------
how do i get her to trust dogs again how


---------96:45----------
do i get her to like dogs


---------96:46----------
i have to bring up that emotion right


---------96:48----------
it's like oh we're gonna see oh that


---------96:50----------
dog's across the street


---------96:51----------
we're not gonna touch it okay daddy's


---------96:52----------
gonna go over and touch it


---------96:54----------
and that raises her anxiety a little bit


---------96:57----------
yeah and it's like


---------96:58----------
you know do you want to touch it now and


---------96:59----------
she's like no and then it's like okay


---------97:01----------
and then we're gonna try again tomorrow


---------97:02----------
we're gonna try again tomorrow


---------97:04----------
so it's the activation of that dormant


---------97:06----------
energy in the present


---------97:07----------
that when done with awareness and this


---------97:09----------
is a key part


---------97:11----------
which i think you are like grappling


---------97:12----------
with yourself in those moments right


---------97:14----------
and so that's like the awareness


---------97:15----------
component


---------97:17----------
i'm sure i mean in a way at the


---------97:20----------
beginning and i think also like to a


---------97:22----------
certain extent it's like i tried to


---------97:24----------
be somebody that i wasn't i tried to


---------97:27----------
pretend


---------97:28----------
like i was this different person and i


---------97:30----------
think that


---------97:31----------
in a way it's kind of like a negative


---------97:33----------
emotion


---------97:34----------
telling people that you're actually a


---------97:37----------
degenerate with their teeth falling out


---------97:39----------
like that's that's a negative emotion


---------97:41----------
but


---------97:43----------
it's still you it's still better to be


---------97:46----------
you


---------97:46----------
than pretend to be somebody else but it


---------97:49----------
is it's definitely not like i i don't


---------97:51----------
have like a better self-image


---------97:53----------
because of it i if anything i have a


---------97:55----------
worse self-image


---------97:56----------
but it it is what it is


---------97:59----------
it's not a it's a facade that is


---------98:02----------
precisely so now now we're going to kind


---------98:04----------
of things full circle


---------98:06----------
because that statement that you just


---------98:08----------
made is moving


---------98:10----------
in on that other axis that i'm talking


---------98:12----------
about


---------98:13----------
because oddly enough like if we think


---------98:14----------
about okay my self-image is poor


---------98:16----------
let me fix my teeth that's the axis of


---------98:19----------
like


---------98:19----------
climbing mountains doing something


---------98:22----------
external becoming something that you're


---------98:23----------
not


---------98:24----------
and what you're what i'm hearing you say


---------98:26----------
is that like i actually


---------98:28----------
accept that i kind of look like a


---------98:30----------
degenerate


---------98:31----------
and that actually brings me peace


---------98:34----------
well that's what's bad about it though


---------98:36----------
is because i'm


---------98:37----------
okay with with just living like an


---------98:41----------
animal


---------98:42----------
like i'm i've said before no mere mortal


---------98:45----------
can live with asthma gold


---------98:47----------
like i i live like an absolute animal


---------98:50----------
and i don't care yeah so


---------98:53----------
now we get to subtle things yeah there's


---------98:56----------
another one


---------98:57----------
so this idea that you were an animal


---------99:01----------
that's a whole other complex


---------99:04----------
that also has its origins which like


---------99:07----------
when you were growing up poor


---------99:09----------
just hypothesizing for a second right we


---------99:11----------
could do this all day


---------99:13----------
but when you were growing up poor like


---------99:15----------
tell me about what it was like to


---------99:16----------
go to school oh it would suck right i


---------99:19----------
mean like uh sometimes it would


---------99:22----------
especially if everybody else had x or y


---------99:24----------
thing and i didn't have it


---------99:26----------
uh luckily and you know my mom did you


---------99:28----------
know it's not like we were


---------99:29----------
we weren't like the we we didn't live in


---------99:32----------
the projects right but we were one of


---------99:34----------
the poorer families


---------99:35----------
in a working-class neighborhood i would


---------99:37----------
say somewhere around there like lower


---------99:39----------
working class neighborhood


---------99:40----------
and so um you know there would be many


---------99:42----------
times whenever i wouldn't have something


---------99:43----------
that it felt like everybody else would


---------99:45----------
have or


---------99:46----------
i wouldn't be able to do something that


---------99:47----------
everybody else could do or i couldn't


---------99:49----------
look forward to something that everybody


---------99:51----------
else could look forward to


---------99:52----------
and it did feel bad to be like that one


---------99:54----------
person that didn't have it


---------99:56----------
or that one person that couldn't do it


---------99:58----------
or whatever and


---------99:59----------
i still think about that sometimes it


---------100:01----------
does it's disappointing but


---------100:03----------
i guess like to me now i just i always


---------100:06----------
have like the uh


---------100:07----------
the perspective that as i said i don't


---------100:09----------
really have any regrets


---------100:10----------
and i like in a way i would there be


---------100:13----------
like small things i would go back and i


---------100:14----------
would want to change in my life


---------100:16----------
but i wouldn't really want to do a whole


---------100:18----------
lot of that because every


---------100:19----------
moment in my life has brought me to the


---------100:21----------
point to where i'm at now and i think


---------100:23----------
that i'm at a


---------100:24----------
relatively good spot now it's just that


---------100:27----------
internally i'm not


---------100:28----------
does that make sense yeah it makes a lot


---------100:30----------
of sense yeah so this is where you know


---------100:32----------
i could hypothesize further


---------100:34----------
i'm getting what you're saying but but i


---------100:35----------
i think this sentiment


---------100:37----------
of no mere mortal can live with asthma


---------100:39----------
and gold is i think a sentiment


---------100:42----------
that was born but i'm just taught you


---------100:45----------
know just in the interest of time i'm


---------100:46----------
going to just toss stuff out


---------100:47----------
it's like that sentiment was born when


---------100:49----------
you thought about inviting kids over to


---------100:51----------
your house after you went with their


---------100:52----------
house


---------100:54----------
actually was born after i had a


---------100:55----------
girlfriend live with me


---------100:57----------
okay but uh yeah


---------101:00----------
um well the thing is like a lot of my


---------101:02----------
friends like and the thing


---------101:04----------
is that back then uh we were


---------101:07----------
complete animals like we all were but


---------101:09----------
the the thing is that they got older and


---------101:11----------
they stopped being animals


---------101:13----------
but i'm just the [ __ ] same


---------101:17----------
and like i still feel like i'm 16. the


---------101:19----------
only time i don't feel like i'm 16 or 13


---------101:21----------
anymore is if i talk to a 16 year old


---------101:23----------
then i realize oh [ __ ] okay


---------101:25----------
actually never mind i'm 30. but outside


---------101:27----------
of that i feel the same pretty much


---------101:30----------
and i feel good it's just that every


---------101:33----------
the whole world around me changed i


---------101:35----------
didn't


---------101:38----------
i think there's a lot there yeah like


---------101:42----------
it's a really interesting combination of


---------101:44----------
acceptance and coping


---------101:46----------
yeah it's weird isn't it yeah i think


---------101:49----------
it's tough because i think what you've


---------101:50----------
managed to do


---------101:51----------
is like survive and so a lot of what i'm


---------101:54----------
hearing is like


---------101:56----------
you've accepted yourself for who you are


---------101:58----------
because


---------101:59----------
rejecting yourself is too painful but in


---------102:02----------
in accepting yourself for who you are


---------102:04----------
you're also propagating things that i


---------102:06----------
think you


---------102:07----------
know aren't good for you which you're


---------102:09----------
also working on


---------102:12----------
no yeah that that's what the problem is


---------102:14----------
right is like i should not be okay


---------102:16----------
with a number of things like i know that


---------102:19----------
like


---------102:20----------
internally you know my my head's [ __ ]


---------102:22----------
up in that way


---------102:23----------
yeah so to explain how you overcome that


---------102:27----------
you actually it's kind of weird you have


---------102:29----------
to go back to bringing up that negative


---------102:31----------
emotion


---------102:32----------
because as long as you say to yourself


---------102:34----------
no mere mortal can live with asthma and


---------102:36----------
gold


---------102:37----------
you're kind of laughing off the


---------102:38----------
shamefulness of your situation


---------102:41----------
but i don't feel any shame exactly


---------102:43----------
that's the problem


---------102:44----------
and until you feel that shame


---------102:47----------
right so so so like since you don't feel


---------102:50----------
that shame


---------102:51----------
you're propagating the life because this


---------102:53----------
is the way that you ignore the shame


---------102:57----------
yeah but it's like i just never had it


---------102:59----------
it never bothered me at all


---------103:01----------
and yeah i i it's just it's so weird to


---------103:04----------
me because like other people they will


---------103:06----------
latch on and care so much about having


---------103:09----------
this thing or having


---------103:10----------
uh you know x or y uh like object or


---------103:14----------
something like that


---------103:15----------
and for me i just don't care about any


---------103:18----------
of it it doesn't matter to me like it


---------103:19----------
doesn't matter if i have a nice car it


---------103:21----------
doesn't matter to me if i have a nice


---------103:22----------
house


---------103:23----------
i don't need nice clothes i wear the


---------103:25----------
same clothes i wore in high school


---------103:27----------
um and that none of these things matter


---------103:29----------
to me at all


---------103:31----------
yeah i just i don't care about the same


---------103:32----------
things other people care about i'm not


---------103:34----------
sure


---------103:34----------
how much of this is it acceptance and


---------103:37----------
attachment and how much of it is a


---------103:38----------
coping mechanism


---------103:40----------
blown out of proportion


---------103:43----------
if i want it i just don't care i i


---------103:45----------
understand that


---------103:46----------
so so so you know there are many reasons


---------103:49----------
that people cannot care about something


---------103:51----------
yeah right they can learn to not care


---------103:54----------
about it


---------103:55----------
or they can be detached from it


---------103:59----------
well so here it's kind of well i think


---------104:01----------
that there's a there's another


---------104:03----------
experience that kind of might shed some


---------104:06----------
insight onto this


---------104:07----------
uh whenever i was young i uh i did care


---------104:10----------
about these things a lot


---------104:11----------
these they were very very meaningful to


---------104:13----------
me like what i was saying before about


---------104:14----------
having everything like


---------104:16----------
you know i wanted to have like nice


---------104:17----------
clothes and they ran clothes things like


---------104:19----------
that


---------104:20----------
and you know many times my mom and i


---------104:21----------
would go to a thrift store and you know


---------104:22----------
i wouldn't be able to have like those


---------104:24----------
same kinds of brand new clothes that


---------104:26----------
uh my other my other friends would have


---------104:28----------
now many times i did also have


---------104:30----------
nice clothes as well but it just wasn't


---------104:32----------
really to the same degree especially


---------104:34----------
with other things that cost more money


---------104:36----------
and i went to a school in high school


---------104:38----------
initially where


---------104:39----------
it was much more of like an upscale


---------104:40----------
school many more people had you know


---------104:42----------
that kind of stuff and


---------104:44----------
i i kind of i didn't really fit in there


---------104:47----------
and i realized that the people that were


---------104:50----------
in that


---------104:50----------
in that society that cared about those


---------104:52----------
things were not like me


---------104:54----------
and uh that kind of got me to


---------104:58----------
not care about those things as much as i


---------105:00----------
did then


---------105:02----------
because i saw people that you know kind


---------105:04----------
of attached themselves to those things


---------105:06----------
and cared about those things a lot


---------105:08----------
and i looked at myself and i'm like this


---------105:10----------
is not who i am


---------105:12----------
that sounds to me like acceptance and


---------105:14----------
growth


---------105:16----------
uh i would say so i mean i would hope so


---------105:18----------
at least yeah


---------105:20----------
so so i'm not i'm not detecting that


---------105:21----------
this is some weird coping mechanism in


---------105:23----------
terms of like being not materialistic


---------105:26----------
ironically if we look at your karmic


---------105:28----------
temperament


---------105:32----------
it's interesting because i think being


---------105:34----------
born so so what you just described


---------105:36----------
asthma gold so


---------105:38----------
is actually would be interpreted by some


---------105:40----------
of my teachers as a sign of


---------105:42----------
past spiritual work so that there's a


---------105:46----------
certain so it's interesting because like


---------105:47----------
in


---------105:48----------
in the hindu gaming system or buddhist


---------105:51----------
uh the lesser of the buddhists but more


---------105:52----------
more in the hindu um


---------105:54----------
that essentially like you don't carry


---------105:58----------
over your gear


---------105:59----------
you don't carry over your stats but you


---------106:01----------
carry over your xp


---------106:02----------
between incarnations and what you're


---------106:05----------
describing to me


---------106:06----------
is is a generally non-materialistic


---------106:09----------
sentiment


---------106:10----------
which would be interpreted by some of my


---------106:12----------
teachers as a sign of past spiritual


---------106:14----------
work


---------106:16----------
which oddly enough is oftentimes


---------106:19----------
coupled with a lot of material success


---------106:23----------
and is sort of the formula this is why


---------106:25----------
like buddha was sort of the same way too


---------106:28----------
and he was born as a prince so his karma


---------106:31----------
was like


---------106:32----------
spawn like picking a spawn point where


---------106:34----------
you can continue to grow spiritually


---------106:36----------
and you carry some of your xp with you


---------106:39----------
so this is something that i've just seen


---------106:40----------
time and again i don't know if this is


---------106:41----------
like a bias on my part where i'm looking


---------106:43----------
for it so therefore i find it


---------106:45----------
but i oftentimes find that people who


---------106:48----------
are not very materialistic


---------106:50----------
and are quite materialistically


---------106:52----------
successful and unhappy


---------106:54----------
despite their materialistic success wind


---------106:57----------
up


---------106:57----------
in conversations with me


---------107:01----------
yeah i mean i think so i mean i think


---------107:02----------
that's the reason why


---------107:05----------
yeah i i of course that makes sense


---------107:10----------
now just to kind of i'm going to try to


---------107:12----------
close the loop and maybe wrap things up


---------107:14----------
and give you a direction to go does that


---------107:15----------
sound okay to you or


---------107:16----------
would you like to kind of okay um so i


---------107:19----------
think going forward


---------107:20----------
zach if i had to make one recommendation


---------107:23----------
for you


---------107:24----------
it would be to really explore this theme


---------107:26----------
of powerlessness in your life


---------107:29----------
and so like have there been times or


---------107:31----------
moments where you


---------107:32----------
felt that inevitability of decay


---------107:36----------
and i i recognize that it manifests in


---------107:38----------
gaming in your life but i i really think


---------107:41----------
about these moments like


---------107:42----------
when you couldn't call an ambulance like


---------107:44----------
that's perfect that's exactly what we're


---------107:46----------
talking about right


---------107:47----------
there's a sense of like there is no


---------107:49----------
matter how hard you try


---------107:51----------
and what you do


---------107:54----------
they're like you know there's nothing no


---------107:57----------
amount of your effort will succeed


---------107:59----------
and as you track back and discover those


---------108:01----------
moments in your life i know you've tried


---------108:03----------
to jump in for twice now


---------108:04----------
um as you track back and try to find


---------108:06----------
those moments in your life and as you


---------108:08----------
actually


---------108:09----------
if you can evoke that feeling of


---------108:10----------
powerlessness in the present


---------108:13----------
my hypothesis is that your fear of decay


---------108:16----------
will go with it so


---------108:21----------
how do how do i evoke a moment of


---------108:22----------
powerlessness without having


---------108:24----------
control over the powerlessness making


---------108:26----------
the paradox


---------108:28----------
making me mean mean it's irrelevant


---------108:31----------
because like if you yeah that that's


---------108:33----------
what's confusing to me like


---------108:34----------
how do you memory yeah


---------108:38----------
so so so the way you evoke the feeling


---------108:40----------
is because the the dorm


---------108:41----------
the emotion is going to be dormant so


---------108:43----------
the problem is that like


---------108:45----------
like you bro have you ever worked with a


---------108:47----------
therapist by the way never


---------108:49----------
so i think if you wanted to see a


---------108:50----------
therapist i think this is what you could


---------108:52----------
work on with someone so like you're


---------108:53----------
gonna go in week after week after week


---------108:56----------
and you're gonna talk about these


---------108:58----------
experiences and if you find a decent


---------109:00----------
therapist


---------109:01----------
they're going to find ways


---------109:04----------
to ask you questions that are going to


---------109:08----------
evoke emotion


---------109:09----------
because i don't know if you can tell but


---------109:10----------
over the course of this entire


---------109:12----------
conversation


---------109:13----------
we keep on moving away from emotion by


---------109:15----------
talking intellectually and


---------109:16----------
philosophically


---------109:19----------
well how do you talk in terms of emotion


---------109:23----------
because like for me i i just the


---------109:25----------
emotions are there


---------109:27----------
yeah i mean it made me feel bad i don't


---------109:29----------
really know exactly how much more i can


---------109:30----------
describe


---------109:31----------
about it


---------109:34----------
i'm not yeah you think about whether so


---------109:38----------
i can't tell you the answer to that


---------109:39----------
question i have to show you


---------109:42----------
okay because telling you the answer to


---------109:44----------
the question is operating on an


---------109:45----------
intellectual level and moving in the


---------109:47----------
opposite direction that we need to


---------109:49----------
yeah it's like even yeah talking about


---------109:51----------
it


---------109:52----------
makes it irrelevant in a way yeah so i


---------109:54----------
think it's like


---------109:55----------
it's like slow conversations where


---------109:58----------
you know sometimes when i interview


---------110:00----------
people like emotions come out


---------110:02----------
i think you have a interesting natural


---------110:06----------
damage resistance from being on the road


---------110:08----------
to enlightenment


---------110:10----------
and then you have an additional coping


---------110:11----------
mechanism which sort of like suppresses


---------110:13----------
and buries some of those emotions


---------110:15----------
the third thing that could be going on


---------110:17----------
is that these circuits of your brain


---------110:19----------
are suppressed by playing video games


---------110:22----------
yeah i mean there's there's part of that


---------110:24----------
i mean i i think that it's also


---------110:25----------
like i i don't want to let go


---------110:29----------
of things that i i had i think that's


---------110:31----------
definitely what it is i'm very attached


---------110:33----------
to things that i had and


---------110:34----------
you know i remember i saw a friend of


---------110:37----------
mine i'd never


---------110:38----------
seen this guy i haven't seen this guy


---------110:39----------
since like high school and


---------110:41----------
it was the day before i came back to


---------110:43----------
streaming like last year i think


---------110:46----------
and i remember i talked to him and this


---------110:47----------
is going to sound


---------110:49----------
absolutely degenerate and that's because


---------110:51----------
it is but i always tell the story of a


---------110:52----------
friend of mine


---------110:54----------
who drew a female dragon masturbating


---------110:57----------
on a chalkboard on the first day of


---------110:59----------
school and he was the guy that did that


---------111:02----------
and i mentioned it to him and he


---------111:04----------
remembered it and that meant so much to


---------111:06----------
me because nobody else in the whole


---------111:08----------
world


---------111:08----------
thought that [ __ ] was thought that


---------111:09----------
[ __ ] was true nobody else thought that


---------111:12----------
was true and i remember seeing him


---------111:13----------
and like i drove home and i cried in the


---------111:16----------
car


---------111:16----------
because i got a chance to


---------111:20----------
to remember that it was real


---------111:27----------
you know this sounds weird zach but like


---------111:31----------
i don't know exactly where that story


---------111:34----------
comes from but what i'm hearing from you


---------111:37----------
is the way to do what i'm telling you to


---------111:39----------
do


---------111:40----------
and it wasn't just like that moment that


---------111:42----------
moment was just like one thing right but


---------111:43----------
it was like everything about that you


---------111:45----------
know the life that we lived


---------111:46----------
uh just everything it was great


---------111:52----------
i i give anything to go back there i


---------111:55----------
would


---------111:56----------
what are you feeling now


---------112:00----------
i was half my life ago i feel like it


---------112:04----------
wasn't


---------112:04----------
like it feels like it was the the i mean


---------112:07----------
obviously


---------112:08----------
this feels a while ago now unfortunately


---------112:10----------
but um


---------112:11----------
it felt uh it just sucks man


---------112:15----------
you can never go back


---------112:23----------
so i i could see emotion coming up yeah


---------112:28----------
and you got to watch out for for twitch


---------112:29----------
chat because they're going to bury it


---------112:32----------
right so oh yeah so so like like


---------112:34----------
something came up there


---------112:36----------
you shared a story yeah and then you


---------112:38----------
felt emotion


---------112:40----------
yeah i do buried it's gone now


---------112:44----------
you see that yeah i mean i've never


---------112:47----------
really been a particularly emotional


---------112:49----------
person


---------112:50----------
i feel like any time that i show my


---------112:52----------
emotions it's not good


---------112:55----------
they're mostly bad mostly bad emotions


---------112:58----------
yeah so i think we've gotta teach you


---------113:01----------
how to let that stuff out


---------113:03----------
and i i when i said i i wasn't


---------113:05----------
optimistic but i think you just did it


---------113:07----------
yeah right and it's weird but like as


---------113:09----------
you told that story like


---------113:11----------
we were just talking about something you


---------113:12----------
tell the story about


---------113:15----------
you know a friend of yours who drew


---------113:18----------
a picture of i i want to really


---------113:22----------
emphasize because it sounds [ __ ]


---------113:24----------
weird


---------113:24----------
that it was not really about the moment


---------113:26----------
itself it's what the moment represented


---------113:30----------
and all the justifications in the world


---------113:31----------
are going to move away from the emotion


---------113:34----------
yeah you don't have to justify anything


---------113:35----------
this is just like i don't know why but


---------113:37----------
you just did it


---------113:38----------
when you asked me how do i do it i don't


---------113:40----------
know you just did


---------113:42----------
and this is what i it's weird it's just


---------113:44----------
you have to go back to the memory


---------113:46----------
and like something about sharing that


---------113:48----------
with him in that moment


---------113:51----------
for things that you had started to doubt


---------113:53----------
and push away


---------113:55----------
and buried came up and it's painful but


---------113:58----------
it's cathartic


---------114:00----------
yeah yeah it is i never thought i'd see


---------114:03----------
him again


---------114:06----------
yeah i never thought it would happen


---------114:12----------
so there are all kinds of


---------114:12----------
interpretations we can make there like


---------114:15----------
so for example the power of that moment


---------114:17----------
is something that you thought


---------114:18----------
was inevitable became not inevitable


---------114:22----------
exactly you would never get closure and


---------114:24----------
so we can see how that's powerful for


---------114:26----------
you because like what's your problem


---------114:28----------
it's that the inevitable is inevitable


---------114:29----------
and here's a here's a chance here's a


---------114:31----------
moment


---------114:32----------
where that doesn't have to be the case


---------114:35----------
and it's it's like painful but it's also


---------114:37----------
hopeful


---------114:41----------
okay i can see that i i don't know i


---------114:44----------
mean that's an interpretation but that


---------114:45----------
also is like


---------114:46----------
me going intellectually i don't know if


---------114:48----------
that's actually [ __ ] true or not the


---------114:50----------
point though is i don't know what you


---------114:52----------
just did but you need to do more of it


---------114:56----------
yeah maybe i mean i don't know it just


---------114:58----------
sucks like it it's sad because like


---------115:01----------
i used to i used to be like really happy


---------115:05----------
about that kind of [ __ ]


---------115:07----------
and now i don't really have that same


---------115:09----------
experience anymore


---------115:11----------
and i don't know like and i feel like i


---------115:13----------
can never have that back because it was


---------115:14----------
uh


---------115:15----------
the context of my life you know it's


---------115:18----------
like


---------115:18----------
my parents were healthy i didn't have to


---------115:20----------
worry about a job


---------115:21----------
i didn't have to worry about a bunch of


---------115:23----------
other weird [ __ ] it was just me and


---------115:25----------
the boys hanging out all the time


---------115:28----------
drawing dragons on a chalkboard and you


---------115:31----------
know riding the bus home together


---------115:33----------
singing along to rap songs and that was


---------115:36----------
good


---------115:37----------
it really was good


---------115:41----------
how are your parents zach


---------115:45----------
could be better could be worse


---------115:50----------
they're all right


---------115:54----------
it doesn't sound like they're all right


---------115:56----------
uh well


---------115:57----------
the thing is there's a degree of all


---------116:00----------
right it's kind of like uh


---------116:03----------
so you're getting away you're going down


---------116:04----------
the wrong side of the mountain


---------116:06----------
well let me let me explain what i'm


---------116:07----------
saying right it's like uh


---------116:09----------
i was saying before about how like


---------116:10----------
things get worse so slowly that you


---------116:13----------
don't realize that they're happening and


---------116:14----------
then you slowly just accept how bad that


---------116:16----------
they are


---------116:17----------
yeah there's a day that my mom started


---------116:19----------
using a cane to walk around


---------116:21----------
that was really painful for me to see


---------116:23----------
and it really hurt me a lot


---------116:25----------
but because it's happened for like now


---------116:28----------
for a while


---------116:29----------
i don't feel the same level of


---------116:32----------
in like visceral reaction whenever i see


---------116:35----------
her doing it now


---------116:36----------
because i like to see your mom walk with


---------116:38----------
a cane for the first time


---------116:42----------
i it is terrible it's horrible


---------116:45----------
what was terrible about it uh


---------116:49----------
it's like it's one step down


---------116:52----------
down that mountain you know


---------116:55----------
are a number of steps


---------117:01----------
and it wasn't like it wasn't like a


---------117:03----------
really emotional feeling i guess


---------117:05----------
it was just like kind of uh [ __ ]


---------117:08----------
i got it it was just i don't know i


---------117:11----------
can't really even describe it


---------117:23----------
so i i think zach this is going to take


---------117:25----------
some work


---------117:27----------
right so i think um but i i do


---------117:30----------
still feel optimistic that like


---------117:34----------
there are too many things here that seem


---------117:36----------
quite familiar to me


---------117:38----------
that i've seen end in a good place


---------117:42----------
well that's good that that's that's a


---------117:44----------
relief


---------117:46----------
right so so i think part of the issue


---------117:47----------
here is that as you


---------117:49----------
as you say i can't describe it so like


---------117:52----------
yeah


---------117:54----------
like yeah that's the problem is like


---------117:56----------
it's it's not about thinking about it


---------117:58----------
like i don't know


---------117:58----------
because it because thinking about it


---------118:00----------
isn't the right thing i'm gonna go back


---------118:01----------
to the you know the


---------118:02----------
the dragon on the chalkboard as an


---------118:03----------
example yeah there are certain ways


---------118:06----------
they're like shortcuts level skips


---------118:10----------
and like something about that story was


---------118:12----------
like


---------118:13----------
the secret tunnel at the end of the


---------118:15----------
mario brothers level that warps you to


---------118:17----------
work


---------118:17----------
world four and it's not a logical chain


---------118:20----------
and you can logically chain it out as


---------118:22----------
much as you want to and that's not going


---------118:23----------
to be that effective the real thing is


---------118:25----------
digging around for those level skips and


---------118:27----------
when you had that level skip the emotion


---------118:29----------
came right up like it was like


---------118:31----------
i mean i think everyone saw it like


---------118:33----------
you're at the verge of tears


---------118:35----------
and yeah because i got you you can just


---------118:38----------
for a moment


---------118:41----------
go back you can just for a moment go


---------118:43----------
back and realize how good it used to be


---------118:47----------
so i'm also hearing themes of not just


---------118:49----------
power and


---------118:50----------
uh powerlessness and inevitability but


---------118:52----------
of loss


---------118:55----------
right yeah yeah i would say so and and


---------118:58----------
so that's also worth digging into i


---------119:00----------
think


---------119:01----------
you know zach of all the people that


---------119:02----------
we've talked to on stream i i would


---------119:04----------
strongly recommend that you


---------119:06----------
really think about finding someone to do


---------119:08----------
this kind of work


---------119:09----------
yeah maybe i mean i i try to uh


---------119:14----------
i try not to think about it as much as i


---------119:16----------
can


---------119:19----------
and maybe maybe i should try to think


---------119:21----------
about it more


---------119:23----------
yeah so maybe thinking about it isn't


---------119:26----------
the right move


---------119:28----------
working on it


---------119:31----------
but by all means think about it i think


---------119:33----------
it's it's your


---------119:34----------
you know i don't know if you play d but


---------119:35----------
you've got an 18 on int


---------119:38----------
thanks but this is where this is where


---------119:41----------
like i don't know what your wisdom is


---------119:42----------
right like there's some other dimension


---------119:45----------
of your being which i think you


---------119:47----------
over rationalize intellectualize and


---------119:49----------
philosophize to get away from your


---------119:51----------
kind of like emotional stuff but i you


---------119:54----------
know if you want to think about it by


---------119:55----------
all means go for it


---------119:57----------
well yeah like it's like you spend time


---------120:00----------
with yourself


---------120:00----------
processing it it's like you'll lay in


---------120:02----------
bed like a lot of times i'll lay in bed


---------120:04----------
without even


---------120:05----------
no music not on my phone and i'll just


---------120:08----------
kind of experience


---------120:10----------
myself you know it's like a form of


---------120:13----------
i guess like uh uh uncultured medita


---------120:17----------
meditation


---------120:22----------
yeah uncultured yeah i think it's


---------120:26----------
it's um it's interesting to see


---------120:32----------
yeah um


---------120:35----------
how unrefined do you think you are


---------120:39----------
uh yeah i mean it's i mean there are a


---------120:42----------
lot of techniques and things like that


---------120:43----------
you can deal with


---------120:44----------
but it's hard to it's


---------120:50----------
sorry i was just thinking i was thinking


---------120:51----------
of something um


---------120:53----------
i uh there are a lot of techniques that


---------120:56----------
you can use


---------120:56----------
and it's hard to really know what works


---------120:59----------
and what doesn't


---------121:00----------
of course yep


---------121:04----------
and that's why i would encourage you to


---------121:07----------
seek guidance from someone who's maybe a


---------121:09----------
little bit more experienced


---------121:11----------
and who can show you what the right


---------121:13----------
technique is


---------121:14----------
yeah maybe i mean i've thought about


---------121:16----------
like i i try to


---------121:18----------
like a lot of times i would try to


---------121:22----------
like watch videos about video games and


---------121:24----------
stuff like that


---------121:25----------
and this is kind of not really the same


---------121:27----------
thing but it's kind of the same type of


---------121:29----------
idea


---------121:30----------
of like bettering yourself and nowadays


---------121:32----------
i will always try to watch videos and


---------121:34----------
do things and and uh read about things


---------121:37----------
that kind of matter


---------121:38----------
i guess to an extent like history and


---------121:41----------
you know


---------121:41----------
mathematics and stuff like that and i've


---------121:43----------
tried to


---------121:45----------
learn more and and be a better version


---------121:46----------
of myself


---------121:49----------
just so i can i can process things


---------121:51----------
better and and think and


---------121:53----------
have the ability to have that that


---------121:56----------
knowledge


---------121:57----------
uh like for me i i i'm lucky in a way


---------122:01----------
that i have a very good memory


---------122:03----------
but i waste that memory on remembering


---------122:06----------
video games


---------122:11----------
yeah i'm getting all kinds of weird


---------122:12----------
signals from you i know


---------122:15----------
um i i don't mean that to be judgmental


---------122:18----------
but it's just it feels like we're


---------122:20----------
opening up


---------122:21----------
new and new avenues of conversation


---------122:23----------
because now i have questions like are


---------122:24----------
you proud of yourself


---------122:26----------
or other people proud of you other


---------122:28----------
people are


---------122:31----------
are you proud of yourself i've done some


---------122:34----------
good things


---------122:35----------
it's all right could be better it always


---------122:38----------
can be better


---------122:41----------
so that's a no


---------122:47----------
um i i think that


---------122:52----------
it's like i'd say it's like it's let me


---------122:54----------
tell you what that is


---------122:55----------
that's a no cloaked and coping and


---------122:58----------
positivity


---------123:00----------
well it's like i mean no it it's a no


---------123:01----------
it's inter it's an intellectualized note


---------123:03----------
because like i've i've succeeded in a


---------123:05----------
number of things on a very


---------123:08----------
uh on a very real level right like i


---------123:11----------
i've


---------123:12----------
i've done this i've done that i've


---------123:13----------
succeeded at this i've succeeded at that


---------123:16----------
like all these things are things that


---------123:17----------
i'm proud of but at the same time i feel


---------123:19----------
like i could do more


---------123:21----------
or i i'm not living up to what potential


---------123:24----------
that i have in my own mind


---------123:25----------
the question isn't whether you've done


---------123:27----------
things that you


---------123:28----------
can be proud of the question is are you


---------123:31----------
proud of yourself


---------123:34----------
um


---------123:41----------
i don't know it's an interesting


---------123:44----------
question i i don't know


---------123:46----------
like i i would obviously like the first


---------123:47----------
thing that i would say is is no end yes


---------123:50----------
because i've been very happy you know in


---------123:52----------
a lot of ways like hanging out with my


---------123:54----------
friends like doing what i want to do et


---------123:55----------
cetera


---------123:56----------
but is that something to be proud of do


---------124:00----------
you do you have to be proud of yourself


---------124:02----------
to be fulfilled


---------124:05----------
yeah so because like a lot of the sense


---------124:08----------
of pride


---------124:08----------
it's like pride in general like oh in


---------124:11----------
this case


---------124:12----------
to some degree is like a construct that


---------124:14----------
exists


---------124:15----------
in context of society so like


---------124:18----------
do i am i proud of you know these


---------124:21----------
accomplishments that i've had in real


---------124:23----------
life


---------124:24----------
well yes to an extent but these


---------124:26----------
accomplishments that i have


---------124:28----------
in real life are these are constructs


---------124:31----------
that exist


---------124:32----------
in society these are not things that are


---------124:34----------
internal these are not


---------124:36----------
uh it doesn't really matter


---------124:44----------
yeah so when i ask you a question about


---------124:46----------
whether you have pride in yourself


---------124:49----------
yeah how do you answer


---------124:52----------
well that the answer is is very simple i


---------124:54----------
don't know


---------124:56----------
and like i'm proud of some things i'm


---------124:57----------
not of others i think that's probably


---------125:00----------
and it's a [ __ ] answer 100 it's a [ __ ]


---------125:02----------
answer but like there it is


---------125:04----------
yeah so i i think we're


---------125:08----------
i'm sort of feeling like i don't know


---------125:10----------
that we're gonna get to somewhere very


---------125:11----------
productive


---------125:12----------
from this conversation i think that


---------125:14----------
these are all important conversations


---------125:16----------
i'm sort of taxed at this point um i


---------125:19----------
feel like i'm oom


---------125:21----------
yeah i'm probably go way down afterwards


---------125:24----------
uh


---------125:24----------
and so what i would say to you zach is


---------125:26----------
that like when i ask you a question


---------125:28----------
about your feelings your answer appears


---------125:30----------
to be philosophical or intellectual in


---------125:32----------
nature you start talking about


---------125:33----------
constructs in society where is what i'm


---------125:35----------
at like


---------125:36----------
pride is an emotion


---------125:42----------
uh i mean aren't they the same thing


---------125:45----------
what


---------125:50----------
i think so like i mean in a way right


---------125:52----------
because you have like shame


---------125:54----------
and like so if you're ashamed of um not


---------125:57----------
having a nice car


---------125:58----------
or something like that that's completely


---------126:00----------
a society construct that's some that's


---------126:02----------
not something that really


---------126:03----------
means a whole lot in the grand scheme of


---------126:06----------
things doesn't really mean a lot as a


---------126:08----------
person doesn't make you


---------126:09----------
grow as a person this just exists as


---------126:12----------
a thing that you do to make society want


---------126:16----------
to to care about you


---------126:19----------
no okay so shame


---------126:22----------
is a subjective experience can shame be


---------126:26----------
caused by certain societal things


---------126:28----------
absolutely


---------126:29----------
but shame is within


---------126:32----------
right so like for example depending on


---------126:35----------
the societal construct


---------126:37----------
i can be ashamed of my skin color or my


---------126:41----------
grades


---------126:42----------
or the clothes that i wear completely


---------126:44----------
agree but the experience of shame for


---------126:46----------
those


---------126:47----------
five people depending on the societal


---------126:48----------
constructs is still subjective


---------126:51----------
it's an experience of emotion


---------126:55----------
is it triggered by societal constructs


---------126:57----------
do societal constructs


---------126:58----------
have something to do with it absolutely


---------127:01----------
but at the end of the day like anger or


---------127:04----------
emotion is not a societal construct


---------127:06----------
emotion can be triggered by a societal


---------127:08----------
construct sure


---------127:11----------
do are certain people's neurons wired to


---------127:14----------
elicit particular emotions


---------127:16----------
based on certain societal constructs


---------127:18----------
absolutely


---------127:20----------
yeah but fundamentally i think what i'm


---------127:22----------
hearing from you


---------127:23----------
is that when we go towards emotion


---------127:27----------
your mind interprets intellectualizes


---------127:32----------
rationalizes and if we think about the


---------127:34----------
story of the chalkboard


---------127:37----------
there's no interpretation there it's


---------127:39----------
just raw emotion


---------127:43----------
yeah i mean i i think there's a lot of


---------127:45----------
context behind it


---------127:46----------
of course i mean like yeah yeah i mean


---------127:49----------
there's a lot of like actual


---------127:50----------
things that happened yeah but like like


---------127:53----------
concepts in the mind are of


---------127:55----------
fundamentally different


---------127:56----------
stuff than emotions in the mind


---------128:01----------
it's like woodworking and like


---------128:04----------
you know alchemy like it's different


---------128:07----------
stuff


---------128:08----------
different mats yeah


---------128:11----------
and what i find is that you tend to


---------128:13----------
always go towards the


---------128:15----------
intellectualization the philosophization


---------128:17----------
which i think is absolutely one of your


---------128:18----------
strengths


---------128:19----------
one of your coping mechanisms and one of


---------128:21----------
the ways that your neurons is wired


---------128:24----------
and that i think that you're going to


---------128:25----------
gain a lot like i don't think you're


---------128:26----------
going to be able to logic your way


---------128:28----------
out of the fear of decay


---------128:31----------
which is really what i'd call it it's


---------128:33----------
not death it's like the powerlessness


---------128:35----------
and inevitability or maybe you can


---------128:36----------
actually you can


---------128:38----------
but i think that you're going to get far


---------128:39----------
better results


---------128:41----------
by learning like picking up a different


---------128:44----------
secondary skill on your wow character


---------128:46----------
because


---------128:47----------
you know you can try to you can chug


---------128:49----------
potions to increase all your stats but


---------128:51----------
at some point it's just more efficient


---------128:53----------
to craft yourself some armor and put


---------128:55----------
that [ __ ] on


---------128:57----------
and what i'm hearing is that you're a


---------128:58----------
grandmaster potion maker who's trying to


---------129:00----------
make potions instead of wearing armor


---------129:04----------
yeah i mean i i could see that sure i


---------129:07----------
i i i think for me like there have been


---------129:11----------
emotions like shame and things like that


---------129:13----------
that i've had to overcome


---------129:15----------
and like you know i said about going to


---------129:17----------
that school and then feeling ashamed of


---------129:19----------
myself and so


---------129:21----------
i've gotten through some of those things


---------129:23----------
for sure


---------129:24----------
but uh some other ones not as much yeah


---------129:27----------
so i think it's just a new skill that


---------129:29----------
you can learn


---------129:30----------
yeah and um you know i think if you have


---------129:33----------
questions or more you know if you want


---------129:35----------
more detailed information about that


---------129:37----------
like i i feel kind of spent at the


---------129:40----------
moment so


---------129:41----------
i don't know but but i'd say that you


---------129:43----------
know feel free to like sleep on it or i


---------129:45----------
need to sleep on it and if you're kind


---------129:47----------
of


---------129:47----------
curious about that or want to learn more


---------129:49----------
just you know


---------129:51----------
ping us i think generally speaking when


---------129:53----------
people come on stream i think we'll send


---------129:54----------
you like a packet of information about


---------129:56----------
potentially like put options for


---------129:59----------
follow-up and how to find a therapist


---------130:01----------
and things like that if you're curious


---------130:02----------
about that but


---------130:03----------
um overall i i think


---------130:07----------
you know i i really can


---------130:10----------
i feel like i understand a lot of what


---------130:12----------
you're going through and i don't


---------130:14----------
think it is quite as inevitable


---------130:17----------
and i think it's i i think it's solvable


---------130:20----------
i think you're walking a difficult road


---------130:22----------
but it's a road that many people have


---------130:24----------
walked before and you seem to have


---------130:26----------
a lot of the karmic signs that other


---------130:29----------
people who have walked to this road have


---------130:30----------
walked


---------130:32----------
okay our tendency for not being


---------130:35----------
materialistic


---------130:36----------
a lot of worldly success early in life


---------130:40----------
in a sense of dissatisfaction that's the


---------130:43----------
spiritual road and laying on top of that


---------130:45----------
that i think you're going to have to


---------130:46----------
process


---------130:47----------
is more of like a neuronal psychological


---------130:50----------
like fear of decay and inevitability and


---------130:52----------
and


---------130:53----------
being powerless in the face of certain


---------130:55----------
things which if we really think about it


---------130:57----------
sounds like the fear of death but the


---------130:59----------
more that we tunnel into it


---------131:00----------
we actually discover that when faced


---------131:02----------
with death you're a chad


---------131:04----------
you know and and and so like as


---------131:06----------
terrifying as that is like you actually


---------131:08----------
know how to accept you know how to


---------131:10----------
accept parts of yourself you know how to


---------131:11----------
face


---------131:12----------
death actually um with some degree of


---------131:15----------
terror


---------131:16----------
and grounding yeah there were a number


---------131:19----------
of times when i was younger i would do


---------131:20----------
things that would


---------131:21----------
get me pretty close to it or


---------131:24----------
pretty close to at least a lot of


---------131:26----------
material harm yeah


---------131:29----------
that yeah is another thing that i find


---------131:32----------
myself being curious about but don't


---------131:34----------
think i have the mana for the encounter


---------131:36----------
oh don't worry if you did i wouldn't


---------131:38----------
cast a spell


---------131:42----------
um zach are you


---------131:45----------
okay with our conversation today yeah


---------131:48----------
i'm great i really appreciate you


---------131:49----------
bringing me on and talking about it i i


---------131:52----------
hope that you know i talk about these


---------131:54----------
things and the reason why i come on is i


---------131:55----------
think that the idea of this is that


---------131:58----------
i i think it's important to have people


---------132:01----------
put themselves out there and and show


---------132:03----------
that this kind of stuff like mental


---------132:05----------
health and


---------132:06----------
just to a greater extent being able to


---------132:08----------
talk about your problems and


---------132:10----------
i think people will watch what i say and


---------132:12----------
then they will


---------132:14----------
relate to it and that will help them so


---------132:16----------
even if it might make me look weird or


---------132:18----------
look bad


---------132:19----------
the greater good for it is worth it does


---------132:22----------
that make sense


---------132:23----------
yeah of course yeah um do you think you


---------132:26----------
look bad


---------132:27----------
i think so i think any time that a


---------132:29----------
person reveals their emotions at all


---------132:31----------
uh there are a lot of people that um


---------132:34----------
that resent that


---------132:38----------
do you think you look bad no


---------132:41----------
okay i don't think you look bad at all


---------132:45----------
thank you i think you're quite handsome


---------132:50----------
well at least that's one of us right


---------132:52----------
[Laughter]


---------132:55----------

---------133:14----------

---------133:16----------

---------133:18----------

---------133:19----------
