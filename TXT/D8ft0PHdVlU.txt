---------00:00----------
you have it like it is a thing and then


---------00:01----------
you were like everyone loves having sex


---------00:03----------
sex is fantastic we also think that it's


---------00:05----------
great every single time like man i got


---------00:07----------
laid it was so awesome dude like oh my


---------00:10----------
god like oh man getting laid like oh my


---------00:12----------
god laid laid


---------00:15----------
so


---------00:16----------
i am a former incel 32m


---------00:19----------
okay


---------00:23----------
who had sex for the first time today and


---------00:24----------
was grossed out


---------00:26----------
after a two-year self-improvement


---------00:28----------
journey i was able to get a woman to


---------00:30----------
sleep with me on our fifth date


---------00:33----------
prior to sex she said she might even


---------00:35----------
become my girlfriend if we continue to


---------00:37----------
get along and bond with each other later


---------00:39----------
that evening we hooked up


---------00:40----------
i'm not sure what i was expecting to


---------00:42----------
feel but my eggplant felt really weird


---------00:45----------
inside i didn't bother to finish because


---------00:47----------
i lost my boner got a little queasy and


---------00:49----------
just said i wasn't ready after all


---------00:52----------
she knew my situation so she was


---------00:54----------
supportive and hugged me i have big


---------00:55----------
fingers and i play guitar so i was able


---------00:57----------
to get her off using my hands perhaps


---------00:59----------
that's why we're meeting again this


---------01:01----------
tuesday she said she still might become


---------01:03----------
my girlfriend am i actually some sort of


---------01:06----------
asexual have i damaged my eggplant from


---------01:08----------
18 years of jerking off


---------01:10----------
i can easily uh jerk off thinking of


---------01:13----------
this girl so i know the plumbing works


---------01:15----------
by the way i successfully completed no


---------01:17----------
november in an attempt to escape porn


---------01:19----------
addiction and be interested in real sex


---------01:22----------
so i am sad that i didn't succeed when


---------01:24----------
the time came


---------01:30----------
or the time didn't come


---------01:32----------
edit during my lonely years i developed


---------01:34----------
some disturbing porn fetishes that got


---------01:37----------
really bad after a knee surgery that


---------01:39----------
left me laid up in bed for for weeks


---------01:42----------
hitchhiking to squirt city three times a


---------01:44----------
day that's one of the reasons why i did


---------01:46----------
no nut november i worry that the porn


---------01:48----------
preferences might be corrupting my


---------01:50----------
normal sexual appetite


---------01:52----------
okay


---------01:53----------
so uh apologies for the the trolling


---------01:55----------
comment um so i i think this is a really


---------01:57----------
excellent post because i think it


---------01:59----------
highlights a couple of things the first


---------02:01----------
is that


---------02:03----------
you know in cells believe


---------02:06----------
just like we were saying they have this


---------02:07----------
like fantasy of what sex is like right


---------02:10----------
and they think like oh if i can just get


---------02:11----------
a woman to sleep with me i will no


---------02:13----------
longer be an incel and everything will


---------02:15----------
be amazing right so they they sort of


---------02:17----------
have this idea that


---------02:18----------
if you are if you have sex a single time


---------02:21----------
then you are like no longer the incel


---------02:22----------
and everything for you is like golden


---------02:24----------
after that you become you become one


---------02:26----------
with the chads like you graduate from


---------02:28----------
incel to chad and once you graduate from


---------02:30----------
intel to chad then like you're totally


---------02:32----------
fine and everything is super easy for


---------02:34----------
you and i think this is the unfortunate


---------02:35----------
thing is they're they're wronged about


---------02:37----------
that and you can be happy as an incel


---------02:39----------
sort of


---------02:40----------
or let me put it this way


---------02:42----------
our society places a bizarre value on


---------02:46----------
sex right and we think that once you


---------02:48----------
have sex you've crossed some sort of


---------02:50----------
threshold to where there's like you're


---------02:52----------
in the promised land where everything


---------02:54----------
you're confident and rich and powerful


---------02:57----------
and all these other things


---------02:59----------
and but that's just not how it is right


---------03:02----------
so and i think this is a really great


---------03:03----------
post because it illustrates the simple


---------03:06----------
truth of like how


---------03:09----------
um


---------03:10----------
how complicated sex is and how just


---------03:12----------
getting laid is not gonna fix all your


---------03:14----------
problems okay


---------03:15----------
so let's talk about this for a second


---------03:19----------
so this is going to be a little bit more


---------03:21----------
graphic but i think it's really really


---------03:22----------
important to understand um


---------03:25----------
you know like


---------03:28----------
sex


---------03:29----------
and and what it means to people and how


---------03:31----------
to get out of the situation this is uh


---------03:33----------
uh unfortunately a situation or


---------03:36----------
fortunately depending on how you look at


---------03:37----------
it i've worked with a fair number of


---------03:39----------
people who are sort of in this situation


---------03:41----------
and i've also helped them get out of the


---------03:43----------
situation so we're going to kind of talk


---------03:45----------
a little bit about


---------03:46----------
how to deal with this


---------03:49----------
so let's start off by sort of thinking


---------03:50----------
through like the key points of this this


---------03:53----------
person's post so the first is that they


---------03:55----------
are a former in-cell so the first is


---------03:56----------
they identified with being an incel


---------03:59----------
second thing is they have worked on


---------04:01----------
themselves for two years completed no


---------04:03----------
not november went like chad mode sigma


---------04:05----------
mail right and then like managed to


---------04:08----------
start dating and and were able to engage


---------04:10----------
in a sexual relationship with a a


---------04:13----------
partner i think it's a woman right


---------04:16----------
same girlfriend so let's assume woman


---------04:19----------
the other thing that i want to tell this


---------04:20----------
person is like


---------04:22----------
this woman is worth her weight in gold


---------04:25----------
right so like this is just something i


---------04:26----------
want to say like the ability to


---------04:27----------
understand where you're coming from be


---------04:29----------
emotionally available for you and sort


---------04:31----------
of like be patient with you


---------04:34----------
as you're going through this journey is


---------04:35----------
like amazing


---------04:37----------
you really got lucky because there are


---------04:39----------
many people out there who may not be as


---------04:42----------
willing to like hold your hand through


---------04:44----------
this journey which is exactly what it's


---------04:46----------
going to be it's going to be a journey


---------04:48----------
so everyone so now what we're going to


---------04:49----------
do is talk a little bit about sex and


---------04:51----------
how we envision sex so we envision sex


---------04:54----------
as like some sort of like milestone


---------04:56----------
where it's like once you have it like it


---------04:58----------
is a thing and then you are like


---------05:00----------
everyone loves having sex sex is


---------05:01----------
fantastic we also think that it's great


---------05:04----------
every single time like man i got laid it


---------05:05----------
was so awesome dude like oh my god like


---------05:08----------
oh man getting laid like oh my god laid


---------05:10----------
laid laid


---------05:12----------
so we definitely romanticize the idea of


---------05:15----------
sex we also romanticize the idea of both


---------05:18----------
being a virgin and no longer being a


---------05:19----------
virgin right we attach all kinds of


---------05:22----------
different like myths


---------05:24----------
and and other kinds of


---------05:26----------
like


---------05:28----------
things to sex


---------05:30----------
so let's just kind of quickly talk about


---------05:33----------
the myths of sex


---------05:36----------
let me see if i yeah okay


---------05:38----------
it's funny i was i was actually


---------05:41----------
talking about this earlier so let's talk


---------05:42----------
about


---------05:43----------
the way that we romanticize and


---------05:45----------
mythologize sex okay


---------05:49----------
all right so myth number one


---------05:56----------
the first time you do it


---------06:03----------
it's gonna be amazing


---------06:07----------
oftentimes not true i think especially


---------06:09----------
uh i think women have this experience


---------06:11----------
more often than men oh wait we're not


---------06:13----------
you guys can see okay


---------06:15----------
the myths of sex so the first time you


---------06:17----------
do it it's gonna be amazing


---------06:20----------
myth number two


---------06:22----------
every time you do it


---------06:27----------
it's gonna be amazing


---------06:30----------
also not true


---------06:31----------
okay


---------06:32----------
so the truth is that is that sex is just


---------06:35----------
like anything else so i'd say it's like


---------06:36----------
almost like cooking


---------06:38----------
where you know you can cook an amazing


---------06:40----------
meal and it can be super super delicious


---------06:43----------
but the first time you cook something


---------06:45----------
it's probably not gonna be like that


---------06:47----------
great right and i think especially i've


---------06:49----------
had this experience more with women that


---------06:51----------
i've worked with where oftentimes the


---------06:53----------
first time they have sex it's like


---------06:55----------
painful somewhat pleasurable oftentimes


---------06:58----------
the first time that women have sex


---------07:00----------
especially if it's if it's like


---------07:02----------
teenagers for example


---------07:03----------
um you know the person they're having


---------07:05----------
sex with may not know exactly how to


---------07:07----------
bring them to orgasm because it's like


---------07:09----------
not quite as intuitive for women as it


---------07:11----------
is with men


---------07:13----------
um


---------07:14----------
so you know there's


---------07:15----------
this idea that the first time you have


---------07:17----------
sex it's supposed to be like this


---------07:18----------
amazing thing right so also like in in


---------07:20----------
cultures like the in-cell culture like


---------07:22----------
they they will


---------07:23----------
mythologize and and kind of fantasize


---------07:27----------
about what this first sexual experience


---------07:28----------
is whereas the truth of the matter is


---------07:30----------
for many people


---------07:31----------
the first sexual experience is like


---------07:34----------
awkward and unfulfilling


---------07:37----------
and this is exacerbated by the fact that


---------07:40----------
there are so many like mythologies or


---------07:42----------
fantasies about it right like we have


---------07:44----------
all these movies that condition us like


---------07:46----------
oh like there are two people they're


---------07:47----------
kissing by the moon and then like


---------07:50----------
the music starts playing and then like


---------07:52----------
it's like the next morning and it's like


---------07:53----------
everyone's like smiling at each other


---------07:56----------
and they're like oh my god that was


---------07:57----------
amazing


---------07:59----------
that's just not how it works right sex


---------08:01----------
just like anything else in life is gonna


---------08:03----------
be like awkward and unfulfilling until


---------08:06----------
you get the hang of it


---------08:08----------
and so this is the first thing to


---------08:09----------
understand okay


---------08:11----------
next thing to understand is that there


---------08:13----------
are a lot of different things that


---------08:15----------
can


---------08:16----------
make sex difficult so this person


---------08:19----------
is dealing with like you know common


---------08:22----------
difficulties


---------08:25----------
okay


---------08:27----------
so the first is death grip syndrome


---------08:33----------
so this is just a very physical


---------08:36----------
conditioning thing so our body gets like


---------08:40----------
conditioned based on particular things


---------08:42----------
it's almost like a pavlovian response so


---------08:45----------
this i see a lot in men who have sex


---------08:48----------
like later in life right so we're not


---------08:49----------
maybe like not the first few years but


---------08:52----------
you know if you've been masturbating for


---------08:53----------
18 years


---------08:56----------
what's gonna happen is that your body


---------08:59----------
is going to require a certain kind of


---------09:01----------
stimulation to achieve climax because


---------09:04----------
you've trained it right like you've


---------09:06----------
essentially like


---------09:07----------
trained your penis like a dog and i'm


---------09:09----------
not saying that to be bemish i'm saying


---------09:11----------
like there's like pavlovian conditioning


---------09:12----------
going on so there's a certain amount of


---------09:14----------
grip strength


---------09:16----------
there's a certain lack of lubrication


---------09:22----------
there's like a certain thing that like


---------09:23----------
you've just


---------09:25----------
trained your body to respond to okay


---------09:28----------
and so this is where it can be kind of


---------09:30----------
interesting but then when people


---------09:31----------
actually engage in in sexual intercourse


---------09:34----------
like vaginal intercourse what they tend


---------09:36----------
to find is that vaginal intercourse does


---------09:38----------
not work


---------09:41----------
and it doesn't get them to orgasm and


---------09:43----------
then this creates like a psychological


---------09:45----------
problem which then this person sort of


---------09:47----------
gets into right and they're kind of like


---------09:48----------
wait wait like this is kind of like


---------09:50----------
gross and queasy so there are kind of


---------09:52----------
different psychological problems like am


---------09:53----------
i messed up


---------09:57----------
um i think this is am i asexual right so


---------10:00----------
this person has this concern


---------10:02----------
and then these psychological problems


---------10:04----------
will then in turn lead to


---------10:07----------
you know flacidity


---------10:09----------
which then in turn will lead to shame


---------10:12----------
which then will kind of lead to more


---------10:14----------
psychological problems and then they've


---------10:16----------
kind of like giged out right it becomes


---------10:18----------
a cycle


---------10:20----------
so the truth of the matter is that


---------10:22----------
you're not messed up you've just


---------10:23----------
conditioned your body in a certain way


---------10:25----------
and the good news is that you can like


---------10:26----------
decondition it as well


---------10:28----------
so this is where um and okay does that


---------10:31----------
make sense do i need to explain that


---------10:32----------
more


---------10:33----------
are you all good with that okay


---------10:35----------
so this is where you know if you've got


---------10:37----------
death grip syndrome there are things


---------10:38----------
that you can do so if we kind of think


---------10:40----------
about


---------10:41----------
you know the vagina


---------10:43----------
and we've got darth vader over here


---------10:47----------
right like what are the different


---------10:48----------
features that you need to like kind of


---------10:50----------
get from so one is a lot of times people


---------10:53----------
who are in this situation use no lube


---------10:56----------
so what you want to start doing is and


---------10:58----------
this is highly lubricated


---------11:02----------
right so what you want to start doing is


---------11:03----------
like start using lotion


---------11:06----------
second thing is that you know


---------11:09----------
i don't know how to say i'm trying to


---------11:11----------
say this without being meamish but you


---------11:13----------
you know the the psi the pounds per


---------11:16----------
square inch


---------11:17----------
that your hand is able to exert is going


---------11:19----------
to be like greater than


---------11:21----------
you know


---------11:22----------
the psi for the vag is going to be like


---------11:25----------
a little bit lower right so what you


---------11:26----------
want to do is looser grip


---------11:30----------
so these are the two biggest things that


---------11:31----------
you can do for death grip syndrome okay


---------11:34----------
and if you do these you'll


---------11:35----------
physiologically re-entrain yourself it's


---------11:38----------
going to feel very unsatisfying because


---------11:40----------
like you're going to want to squeeze


---------11:41----------
harder and you're going to want to use


---------11:42----------
less lotion because this is what you


---------11:44----------
need


---------11:46----------
to climax right


---------11:49----------
and so the next thing that we can do so


---------11:51----------
in terms of a sexual relationship like


---------11:53----------
you know i'm not saying you should go


---------11:54----------
monk mode for the next two months and


---------11:57----------
and just masturbate using these things


---------11:59----------
so thankfully it sounds like you've got


---------12:00----------
a pretty supportive partner so now we're


---------12:03----------
gonna


---------12:04----------
okay so we've got a man and we've got a


---------12:07----------
woman


---------12:08----------
okay so let's just add some hair here


---------12:11----------
and then if we kind of think about


---------12:13----------
we've got hands


---------12:15----------
we've got genitals


---------12:18----------
we've got breasts


---------12:20----------
okay this is the kind of thing where if


---------12:22----------
you just like label the erogenous zones


---------12:24----------
like your partner can get involved right


---------12:26----------
so this is going to get a little bit


---------12:27----------
graphic but like you know you've got raj


---------12:29----------
in the zone number ways of delivering


---------12:32----------
and receiving pleasure


---------12:33----------
one two


---------12:35----------
three


---------12:36----------
four okay we're gonna steer clear of


---------12:39----------
stuff like maybe there's a five over


---------12:42----------
here if you wanna


---------12:44----------
consider buttholes or scrotums or


---------12:45----------
whatever


---------12:46----------
i don't know if you guys can even see


---------12:47----------
those numbers


---------12:50----------
yeah sure let's let's be complete so


---------12:52----------
let's five and six are down there okay


---------12:54----------
if you want to get really crazy um you


---------12:56----------
know feet can be erogenous zones so


---------12:59----------
there's evidence for example


---------13:01----------
that there are uh non-insulated


---------13:04----------
neurons um


---------13:07----------
in the feet of especially this is maybe


---------13:10----------
even gender specific more gender


---------13:11----------
specific so this is going to sound kind


---------13:13----------
of weird so you have a spinal cord right


---------13:15----------
and so if we think about the human body


---------13:17----------
like here's your your shoulders


---------13:21----------
right and then here's like let's say


---------13:23----------
uh you know your chest


---------13:25----------
and then down here we've got


---------13:27----------
genital nerves


---------13:30----------
and then like over here we've got foot


---------13:32----------
nerves that kind of come in over here


---------13:35----------
and it's really interesting because


---------13:36----------
there's even a there's a cool hypothesis


---------13:38----------
that i was looking at that if you look


---------13:39----------
at the anatomy


---------13:41----------
there are non-insulated nerves that


---------13:45----------
from the feet and genitals that run next


---------13:47----------
to each other so there may be actually


---------13:49----------
an electrical impulse that can travel


---------13:51----------
from a foot nerve to the genital nerves


---------13:54----------
especially in women i don't know how


---------13:56----------
really true this is to be honest


---------13:59----------
but there's some evidence to this which


---------14:01----------
suggests that


---------14:02----------
you know part of the reason that women


---------14:04----------
may be able to get some degree of sexual


---------14:06----------
arousal from feet is through even like


---------14:10----------
anatomical or maybe anatomical


---------14:11----------
correlations here so it's not just


---------14:13----------
psychological


---------14:14----------
and then if we kind of think about your


---------14:15----------
partner right so let's start from the


---------14:17----------
top one


---------14:18----------
two


---------14:19----------
three


---------14:20----------
four


---------14:22----------
five


---------14:23----------
six


---------14:24----------
seven


---------14:26----------
eight


---------14:27----------
right so this is where like if you're


---------14:28----------
just thinking about you know if you're


---------14:30----------
in this situation how do you have sex


---------14:32----------
with a partner there are a lot of


---------14:34----------
options is the short answer right


---------14:37----------
so like even if you are and what i


---------14:40----------
recommend is that you like naturally get


---------14:43----------
you you sort of start combine bridging


---------14:45----------
the two right so it doesn't have to be


---------14:47----------
three plus six


---------14:48----------
right it can be like over here you can


---------14:51----------
do one plus three


---------14:53----------
and then you know engaging with your


---------14:54----------
partner like four plus one or four plus


---------14:58----------
six


---------15:00----------
um you know or four plus two


---------15:03----------
you know or


---------15:04----------
your two with their six


---------15:06----------
and i'm trying to keep this as as


---------15:09----------
professional as possible


---------15:11----------
right and i'm gonna try not to be like


---------15:12----------
oh yeah you could like squeeze in a


---------15:14----------
little bit of like three plus two you


---------15:16----------
know and add a little bit of four plus


---------15:18----------
eight if you know what i mean


---------15:20----------
and and you know there's a lot of stuff


---------15:22----------
that you could do my point is that you


---------15:23----------
can kind of get creative


---------15:25----------
and much like cooking


---------15:27----------
it's about like balancing flavors and


---------15:29----------
like trying different kinds of stuff


---------15:32----------
right


---------15:33----------
and and so i i know this is i know when


---------15:36----------
it comes to sex people are like


---------15:38----------
automatically like oh my god like ah


---------15:40----------
but the truth is that there's a lot of


---------15:42----------
science here like this is an important


---------15:43----------
part of health it's an important part of


---------15:45----------
psychology and so over time what you can


---------15:48----------
gradually do is like you can basically


---------15:49----------
like if your hand is what you need


---------15:51----------
maybe like you're using your hand or


---------15:53----------
maybe she can use her hand right like if


---------15:56----------
what you need is


---------15:58----------
uh you know minimal lube and and a tight


---------16:01----------
grip like you can kind of show her how


---------16:03----------
and so that she can still be involved in


---------16:05----------
the process like you can be involved in


---------16:07----------
the process and then over time


---------16:10----------
um you know you can you can do like


---------16:12----------
different things and you can even like


---------16:16----------
you know there are different combos that


---------16:17----------
you can do i'm not going to go into a


---------16:18----------
lot of detail but i mean you can get


---------16:20----------
quite detailed so in terms of some of


---------16:22----------
the sex therapy that i've done like it


---------16:23----------
gets like super super detailed with like


---------16:26----------
even transition points and stuff like


---------16:27----------
that it's like you can get 90 of the way


---------16:29----------
there using one thing and when you're


---------16:31----------
super super close you transition to


---------16:34----------
something else which will in a sense


---------16:35----------
kill it


---------16:36----------
but if you're close enough you'll kind


---------16:38----------
of still make it the rest of the way


---------16:40----------
there and it may not be perfectly


---------16:42----------
satisfying but then your body will have


---------16:44----------
entrained itself a little bit to you


---------16:46----------
know finish up in a place where it


---------16:48----------
didn't start you guys get what i'm


---------16:50----------
saying


---------16:52----------
does that make sense


---------16:55----------
right so i don't really feel like this


---------16:56----------
is appropriate to go into too much


---------16:57----------
detail on stream


---------16:59----------
yeah like wombo combo right


---------17:03----------
and and so does that does that make


---------17:05----------
sense like the truth is you can do a lot


---------17:07----------
here


---------17:08----------
okay


---------17:12----------
um


---------17:13----------
so does that so questions so let me just


---------17:16----------
kind of summarize so like if you're you


---------17:18----------
know if you have this myth that like


---------17:20----------
having sex is just gonna be amazing the


---------17:22----------
first time around


---------17:24----------
and especially if you've been


---------17:25----------
masturbating you know for years and


---------17:26----------
years and years


---------17:28----------
sex is not gonna be just amazing the


---------17:30----------
first time you do it right it's like


---------17:31----------
it's a practice like it's something that


---------17:33----------
you do with your body and your mind


---------17:35----------
that sure there's a lot of like


---------17:37----------
biological drivers which are like sort


---------17:39----------
of telling you what to do but if you've


---------17:41----------
conditioned your body for 18 years to


---------17:43----------
respond to something else you have to


---------17:45----------
like start the process of like


---------17:46----------
conditioning it towards where you want


---------17:48----------
to go and you can absolutely do that so


---------17:50----------
the way that i'd sort of describe this


---------17:52----------
is almost like eating spicy food


---------17:54----------
like spicy food can be absolutely


---------17:56----------
amazing i absolutely love it and the


---------17:58----------
first time you have it like if you go


---------18:00----------
too far you may


---------18:01----------
go way too fat like you know maybe like


---------18:03----------
a terrible experience for you and then


---------18:05----------
what happens is we have so much


---------18:07----------
discussion i i genuinely think this is a


---------18:08----------
problem we have so much discussion about


---------18:10----------
variable sexuality that someone will


---------18:12----------
have


---------18:13----------
a


---------18:15----------
negative sexual experience and start to


---------18:17----------
wonder oh am i asexual they'll go down


---------18:19----------
the echo chamber of asexual content


---------18:22----------
conclude that they are asexual


---------18:24----------
which could be true but the the simple


---------18:26----------
truth of the matter is that you may just


---------18:28----------
have had a bad sexual experience and


---------18:30----------
like you're not really asexual you just


---------18:31----------
need to recondition your body you can be


---------18:33----------
like a you know


---------18:35----------
normative sexual behavior


---------18:38----------
it doesn't mean you're asexual like you


---------18:40----------
can actually transition from here to


---------18:41----------
here


---------18:43----------
and if you sort of adopt that label


---------18:46----------
right from the get-go


---------18:48----------
then you may actually be missing out on


---------18:50----------
a lot of things so when i'm supporting


---------18:51----------
people through their own journeys of


---------18:53----------
discovering their sexuality like this is


---------18:55----------
a really important point right that it


---------18:57----------
takes some time and some experimentation


---------18:59----------
to figure things out just because you


---------19:01----------
have a negative experience and there are


---------19:03----------
a lot of people out there who will say


---------19:04----------
like if you post this on a forum for


---------19:06----------
asexual people


---------19:09----------
since the asexual people are trying to


---------19:10----------
be supportive of each other what they


---------19:12----------
may say is they're like yeah you're


---------19:13----------
asexual like that was my experience as


---------19:15----------
well this was my journey it's okay to be


---------19:17----------
asexual you're asexual you know they may


---------19:20----------
say things like that in an effort to be


---------19:21----------
supportive and that could actually like


---------19:23----------
be you know


---------19:25----------
have a negative impact on that person


---------19:31----------
i can feel the shakti leaving my body


---------19:33----------
during this convo well


---------19:35----------
we'll try to get your shakti back later


---------19:37----------
okay


---------19:40----------
okay so


---------19:42----------
you know for this person don't give up


---------19:44----------
yet


---------19:46----------
uh you really lucked out in terms of who


---------19:48----------
you ended up


---------19:50----------
dating


---------19:52----------
um you know give yourself some time give


---------19:54----------
yourself some patience


---------19:56----------
and uh


---------19:58----------
yeah


---------20:01----------
be patient with yourself i think that's


---------20:02----------
the most important thing


---------20:07----------
okay


---------20:09----------
all right so we've got kind of a


---------20:10----------
different one now


---------20:12----------
oh chat


---------20:14----------
okay different one okay


---------20:26----------
okay


---------20:27----------
so next up we've got a post from a


---------20:28----------
parent


---------20:31----------
um


---------20:33----------
also


---------20:35----------
oh


---------20:38----------
also


---------20:39----------
just one other myth that i want to try


---------20:41----------
to spell for a second


---------20:43----------
so i see this posted on the internet a


---------20:45----------
lot where like people


---------20:46----------
will post and they'll say that


---------20:48----------
they'll talk about the number of vagina


---------20:51----------
the number of penises that


---------20:56----------
how can i say this delicately


---------21:00----------
so people will say that like if you've


---------21:03----------
been


---------21:04----------
if a woman has had sex with a lot of


---------21:06----------
different men that her vagina will be


---------21:07----------
loose


---------21:09----------
and for some reason they think that


---------21:11----------
having sex with the same penis over and


---------21:13----------
over again does not make it loose


---------21:15----------
so i don't know how else to say this but


---------21:17----------
like just because you take big bites of


---------21:19----------
a subway sandwich doesn't mean that your


---------21:21----------
mouth is like hanging open


---------21:24----------
all the time


---------21:26----------
does that make sense


---------21:27----------
chat


---------21:29----------
oh god


---------21:30----------
why is this not focusing


---------21:33----------
focus


---------21:34----------
auto focus


---------21:37----------
right just just because you eat a lot of


---------21:39----------
the subway doesn't mean your mouth is


---------21:40----------
like


---------21:41----------
this all the time right your the body is


---------21:44----------
elastic


---------21:45----------
like opening your mouth really big and


---------21:47----------
taking big bites does not give you like


---------21:49----------
a very loose mouth


---------21:51----------
and in the same way having sex with one


---------21:53----------
penis or lots of penises does not alter


---------21:56----------
the elasticity of your vagina it's just


---------21:58----------
not physiologic like i don't know where


---------21:59----------
people get this idea like just because


---------22:02----------
you poop out huge turds does not give


---------22:04----------
you like a loose [ __ ]


---------22:06----------
it just


---------22:08----------
you know


---------22:09----------
like it's just not how it works


---------22:12----------
like i'm sure that's gonna get clipped


---------22:14----------
out of context or whatever but just


---------22:15----------
saying chat like you need to understand


---------22:17----------
that right do we are we all on the same


---------22:19----------
page there


---------22:23----------
it's just


---------22:24----------
physiologically it's like no amount of


---------22:26----------
sticking your finger in your nose is


---------22:27----------
going to give you like a gigantic


---------22:29----------
nostril like it's just not how it works


---------22:34----------
got it


---------22:35----------
okay


---------22:43----------
someone was like i just tuned in yeah


---------22:46----------
sorry about that


---------22:47----------
i don't know like so i struggle with


---------22:48----------
saying things like that on stream


---------22:50----------
because i recognize that people are


---------22:52----------
gonna think it's like meemish but it's


---------22:53----------
also like people are out there saying


---------22:55----------
this right people believe this


---------22:56----------
like i don't know where they get this


---------22:58----------
idea


---------22:59----------
um so


---------23:01----------
you know


---------23:03----------
anyway


---------23:05----------
like seriously like i think that's part


---------23:06----------
of our mission here and we can't we


---------23:08----------
can't avoid or maybe we should so i'm


---------23:11----------
open to feedback if if people think that


---------23:12----------
this was a mistake on stream maybe my


---------23:14----------
team will tell me like don't say things


---------23:15----------
like this but if y'all think this is


---------23:17----------
good on stream like please let us know


---------23:18----------
if you guys think that it's not good on


---------23:20----------
stream and you think that it does


---------23:21----------
deplete your shakthi and we shouldn't be


---------23:22----------
talking about this stuff please let us


---------23:24----------
know


---------23:26----------
um because i think once again we have so


---------23:28----------
many like romantic or mythologized


---------23:30----------
notions about sexuality that like people


---------23:33----------
will think that oh if i have sex with


---------23:34----------
lots of men like i will have a loose


---------23:36----------
vagina like women will think that too


---------23:38----------
right like men will like start dating


---------23:40----------
someone and you really like someone but


---------23:41----------
you have this myth that if they've had


---------23:43----------
more partners than you have then


---------23:46----------
then you break up with them and it's


---------23:48----------
like you're missing out on something


---------23:49----------
you're judging that person like


---------23:51----------
arguably unfairly maybe you're judging


---------23:53----------
them fairly you're allowed to make


---------23:54----------
whatever judgments you want to


---------23:56----------
um so i i i it's hard because there's a


---------23:58----------
lot of stuff out there that is meme


---------24:00----------
friendly but is also like really


---------24:01----------
important psas
