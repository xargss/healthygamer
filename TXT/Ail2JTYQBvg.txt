---------00:16----------
for our next neuroscience topic I want


---------00:19----------
to tell you guys about something called


---------00:21----------
the triumph circuit now the triumph


---------00:24----------
circuit isn't quite like the dopamine


---------00:26----------
circuit or some of the emotional


---------00:28----------
circuits we talk about in the sense that


---------00:30----------
those circuits are very easily mapped


---------00:33----------
onto the brain like there's a part of


---------00:35----------
your brain called the nucleus accumbens


---------00:37----------
accumbens that secretes dopamine and


---------00:40----------
gives you a sense of pleasure there's a


---------00:42----------
part of your brain called the amygdala


---------00:44----------
that anytime you feel fear or negative


---------00:47----------
emotion is active the triumph circuit is


---------00:51----------
a little bit different it's something


---------00:52----------
that doesn't localize to one part of the


---------00:55----------
brain but it's just a general pattern of


---------00:57----------
kind of psychology and cognition that is


---------01:00----------
important to human beings


---------01:02----------
in short the triumph circuit is the part


---------01:05----------
of our brain that makes us feel good


---------01:08----------
when we overcome a challenge and to


---------01:11----------
start to understand the triumph circuit


---------01:12----------
we have to track back to why human


---------01:15----------
beings have this in the first place


---------01:18----------
and if you stop and think about what


---------01:20----------
makes a game so addictive there's a


---------01:23----------
sense of a challenge followed by an


---------01:26----------
achievement like if you're playing a


---------01:27----------
game like Dark Souls and you've died six


---------01:30----------
times on a boss and then you beat that


---------01:32----------
boss afterward you feel amazing it gives


---------01:35----------
you this rush so where does that rush


---------01:37----------
come from why do human beings relish


---------01:41----------
something that is a challenge followed


---------01:44----------
by a success where does that feeling of


---------01:48----------
triumph come from and what we need to do


---------01:51----------
is actually track back and look at kind


---------01:53----------
of evolutionary biology to understand


---------01:56----------
where the triumph circuit comes from so


---------01:59----------
like millions of years ago when human


---------02:02----------
beings were hunter-gatherers there would


---------02:03----------
be like a range that they would sort of


---------02:05----------
hunt and forage in and you would sort of


---------02:07----------
have a like a territory and people would


---------02:10----------
go out and they'd kind of like look for


---------02:12----------
berries or look for animals and


---------02:14----------
sometimes you know that area was kind of


---------02:16----------
it was safe it was a little bit


---------02:18----------
conservative people knew where the


---------02:19----------
Predators were they knew where like the


---------02:21----------
berry bushes were and so it was kind of


---------02:23----------
like a safe place to be and then what


---------02:26----------
happened is some human beings


---------02:29----------
had the desire to kind of go beyond that


---------02:31----------
safe place and to venture a little bit


---------02:34----------
into dangerous parts of the jungle and


---------02:37----------
for the ones who ventured into the


---------02:39----------
dangerous parts there's a greater chance


---------02:41----------
that they would find food because it


---------02:44----------
hasn't been picked clean because it's


---------02:45----------
not the safe part and so the ones that


---------02:49----------
ventured out past the safe zone and


---------02:51----------
expose themselves to more predators had


---------02:54----------
a greater chance of finding more food


---------02:56----------
and so when they ventured into the


---------02:58----------
dangerous territory everyone was kind of


---------03:00----------
scared right they're like oh my god


---------03:01----------
don't go into the forbidden area of the


---------03:03----------
jungle because you may be eaten by a


---------03:05----------
tiger but when they came back with more


---------03:08----------
food they were awarded because they went


---------03:11----------
into the dangerous territory and


---------03:13----------
succeeded in bringing something back so


---------03:16----------
if you look at evolutionary biology


---------03:18----------
there's a strong story about venturing


---------03:22----------
into the unknown and finding something


---------03:25----------
overcoming some kind of challenge and


---------03:27----------
then bringing it back to society and if


---------03:30----------
you look at how that's shaped social


---------03:33----------
psychology we as human beings value


---------03:36----------
people who overcome odds why is it that


---------03:40----------
society cares that someone survived


---------03:42----------
cancer like why is that a thing like why


---------03:44----------
do we value that it's because cancer


---------03:47----------
survivors speak to that triumph circuit


---------03:50----------
there's something about the danger of


---------03:52----------
cancer and the the capability that


---------03:54----------
cancer is absolutely going to destroy


---------03:56----------
you that when you survive it it becomes


---------03:58----------
something that is universally esteemed


---------04:00----------
if you get if you face any kind of


---------04:04----------
challenge like let's say that you know


---------04:06----------
you're you're in a war zone and you have


---------04:08----------
to like travel through a war zone and


---------04:09----------
then you make it out alive you're gonna


---------04:11----------
feel a great sense of exhilaration and


---------04:13----------
you're gonna feel a sense of triumph so


---------04:16----------
human beings have a very fundamental


---------04:18----------
circuit in their brain that correlates


---------04:21----------
the amount of challenge they face with


---------04:23----------
the amount of triumph that they feel and


---------04:26----------
if you think about video games video


---------04:28----------
games have done a very good job at


---------04:31----------
striking that balance let's think a


---------04:34----------
little bit about games that are too easy


---------04:36----------
why aren't they fun it's because they're


---------04:39----------
too easy and other games that aren't fun


---------04:41----------
or games that are too


---------04:42----------
hard right like if you just think about


---------04:44----------
it like if there's a game and you turn


---------04:46----------
on god mode and then you run through the


---------04:47----------
game it's not nearly as fun as if you


---------04:49----------
play it normally so there's something


---------04:51----------
about games that they game designers


---------04:53----------
work really hard to strike this balance


---------04:55----------
of making it challenging enough to feel


---------04:58----------
like you accomplished something when you


---------05:01----------
overcome that challenge but in order to


---------05:04----------
get that feeling of accomplishment you


---------05:06----------
have to have a feeling of a challenge


---------05:08----------
and what that's doing is accessing the


---------05:11----------
triumph circuit of our brain the really


---------05:15----------
dangerous thing about the triumph


---------05:16----------
circuit and video games is that the


---------05:19----------
triumph circuit was originally designed


---------05:20----------
to help human beings achieve something


---------05:23----------
in life so if you think about who do we


---------05:26----------
respect we respect people like doctors


---------05:28----------
and lawyers because the path that


---------05:31----------
they've walked tends to be viewed as


---------05:33----------
harder like studying really hard for


---------05:35----------
seven years to becoming a neurosurgeon


---------05:37----------
is something that we respect because


---------05:39----------
it's hard to do we respect people who do


---------05:42----------
hard things and that's been kind of a


---------05:45----------
good thing from an evolutionary


---------05:46----------
perspective because when we face a


---------05:49----------
challenge and we overcome it that yields


---------05:51----------
good rewards I mean that's correlated


---------05:53----------
with actual improvement in your personal


---------05:56----------
life if we think about you know jobs and


---------06:00----------
adversity society compensates doctors


---------06:03----------
higher and neurosurgeons at a high rate


---------06:05----------
because what they do is very difficult


---------06:07----------
so we fundamentally respect people who


---------06:09----------
can overcome challenges what happens in


---------06:12----------
a video game is that they sort of


---------06:14----------
artificially hijack that triumph circuit


---------06:16----------
and so they give gamers the feeling of


---------06:19----------
achieving something are being triumphant


---------06:22----------
by activating that circuitry in your


---------06:23----------
brain the problem is that that


---------06:26----------
achievement doesn't actually come with a


---------06:28----------
real-world reward and so what happens is


---------06:31----------
that that triumph circuit for nor most


---------06:34----------
people causes them to strive to achieve


---------06:37----------
something and improve their lives but


---------06:39----------
when that that same part of your brain


---------06:41----------
when the triumph circuit gets activated


---------06:43----------
by the game then suddenly you get the


---------06:45----------
same neurological benefit but without


---------06:48----------
any of the real-world consequences and


---------06:50----------
that's what makes it so incredibly


---------06:52----------
dangerous and so one of the things you


---------06:55----------
have to understand is again


---------06:57----------
is when you achieve something in the


---------06:59----------
game the degree of achievement that you


---------07:02----------
feel from a neurologic perspective can


---------07:05----------
be really similar to what you feel when


---------07:08----------
you achieve something in the real world


---------07:09----------
because the game is just accessing that


---------07:12----------
circuitry and so you have to be careful


---------07:14----------
because when you look at yourself and


---------07:17----------
you look at you know why do I play the


---------07:19----------
game and what do I like about playing


---------07:20----------
this game how does the game make me feel


---------07:22----------
recognize that part of that is a feeling


---------07:25----------
of triumph and once you understand that


---------07:27----------
that feeling of triumph is there you


---------07:30----------
will start to be a little bit better at


---------07:32----------
navigating some of the challenges that


---------07:34----------
you face in the real world but at the


---------07:36----------
end of the day I think the main point of


---------07:38----------
explaining the triumph circuit is just


---------07:40----------
to equip you guys with knowledge take a


---------07:42----------
look at yourself and ask yourself why do


---------07:45----------
I play this game when is it that I feel


---------07:48----------
the best in the game what's so exciting


---------07:51----------
about downing a raid boss in World of


---------07:53----------
Warcraft or ff14 like why does that feel


---------07:56----------
so good to us it's because it's


---------07:58----------
hijacking this thing called the triumph


---------08:00----------
circuit and you feel like you've really


---------08:02----------
accomplished something


---------08:03----------
gamers feel like they've really done


---------08:05----------
something worthwhile when they down this


---------08:07----------
raid boss but the really dangerous thing


---------08:10----------
about that is that that raid boss was


---------08:12----------
designed to be defeated games are


---------08:15----------
designed to be beaten and what game


---------08:17----------
designers do is they want to make it


---------08:19----------
hard and make it feel like an


---------08:20----------
achievement but if you really stop and


---------08:22----------
look at it all games are designed to be


---------08:24----------
beaten by most people otherwise they


---------08:26----------
wouldn't sell and so it's all this


---------08:28----------
artificial hijacking of this circuitry


---------08:31----------
which can be really dangerous because


---------08:33----------
that's the same circuitry that causes us


---------08:36----------
to actually work really hard in life and


---------08:38----------
if we're activating it without working


---------08:41----------
hard then it becomes really hard to


---------08:43----------
activate it by working hard because why


---------08:45----------
would your brain want to work hard and


---------08:46----------
activate it when you can just get the


---------08:48----------
shortcut and activate it through a game


---------08:49----------
and so understand that when you play the


---------08:52----------
game it's actually tampering with your


---------08:54----------
brain in a way that is especially


---------08:55----------
challenging to deal with the reason that


---------08:58----------
you can't stop gaming is not because


---------09:00----------
you're lazy or not because you don't


---------09:01----------
have willpower it's because there are


---------09:04----------
fundamental parts of your brain that


---------09:05----------
drive behavior that are driving your


---------09:08----------
gaming because the triumph circuit


---------09:10----------
drives your behavior and so you have


---------09:13----------
this fundamental piece of yourself that


---------09:15----------
is forcing you to gain and you have to


---------09:17----------
understand that about yourself you


---------09:19----------
really have to understand that piece of


---------09:21----------
yourself if you want to have any chance


---------09:23----------
of getting control of your gaming
