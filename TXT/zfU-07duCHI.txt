---------00:00----------
hello everyone i'm basically a modern


---------00:02----------
slave


---------00:04----------
um i wanted to tell you guys a little


---------00:05----------
bit about my current work situation i am


---------00:07----------
working as a pizza delivery driver i


---------00:09----------
work 13 to 15 hours a day four to five


---------00:12----------
days per week making approximately


---------00:14----------
3.60 that's euro right per hour plus


---------00:18----------
tips


---------00:19----------
um


---------00:21----------
then they were


---------00:23----------
when when they were hiring they said


---------00:25----------
i'll need to work 11 hour shifts plus


---------00:27----------
taking co-workers home after work


---------00:29----------
apparently those few hours cleaning


---------00:31----------
pizza place after the shift driving my


---------00:33----------
co-workers home is not paid


---------00:35----------
this week i worked for six days per week


---------00:38----------
the boss called me in other words


---------00:39----------
begging me to help them by working but


---------00:41----------
only this week because two other people


---------00:43----------
left after the new year and one got


---------00:45----------
kovid i asked if i have a choice the


---------00:47----------
boss said basically no


---------00:50----------
i agreed because i thought it's only


---------00:51----------
that one week today i find out that next


---------00:53----------
week i'm working six days as well that


---------00:55----------
made me quite furious


---------00:58----------
this last week i felt


---------00:59----------
i feel like i'm not even living life i


---------01:01----------
wake up go to work get absolutely tired


---------01:04----------
get back home sleep because at that


---------01:06----------
moment you don't want to do anything


---------01:07----------
else and repeat i just want to quit so


---------01:09----------
bad


---------01:10----------
anyways just needed a space to a place


---------01:12----------
to vent i thought about quitting


---------01:13----------
tomorrow my shift starts in five minutes


---------01:15----------
it's gonna be a long day


---------01:17----------
stay strong folks and i'll try to do the


---------01:18----------
same


---------01:21----------
okay


---------01:23----------
um so the first thing is that i'm


---------01:24----------
noticing that a lot of people in chat


---------01:26----------
are kind of saying like


---------01:27----------
this has to be this location oh this


---------01:29----------
sounds like portugal this sounds like


---------01:31----------
france


---------01:32----------
um you know this sounds like this part


---------01:34----------
and i think the truth is that this is


---------01:35----------
happening everywhere right


---------01:37----------
so what i'd like to talk to you all


---------01:38----------
about today is like how do people become


---------01:40----------
modern slaves right so what are what are


---------01:43----------
the circumstances that


---------01:46----------
lead to this kind of situation where


---------01:48----------
you know they're they're hired


---------01:51----------
under these conditions and even told at


---------01:52----------
the very beginning that like it's going


---------01:54----------
to be 11 hour shifts and they're gonna


---------01:56----------
have to take


---------01:57----------
home co-workers in some ways this is


---------01:59----------
even like better than usual because a


---------02:01----------
lot of times


---------02:02----------
during the hiring process people will


---------02:04----------
say one thing and then they'll force you


---------02:06----------
to do something else and it's really


---------02:08----------
tough because in these situations you


---------02:11----------
know we may look at this and people on


---------02:13----------
the internet will say just quit


---------02:16----------
just to go find another job


---------02:18----------
right but the truth is that if you're in


---------02:20----------
this situation of modern slavery it's


---------02:22----------
not that simple there's a reason why you


---------02:24----------
wound up here in the first place and


---------02:25----------
it's not like that this person is like


---------02:27----------
foolish or anything like that it's not


---------02:29----------
that this person is lazy or foolish or


---------02:31----------
you know doesn't know any better or


---------02:32----------
things like that there are very real


---------02:34----------
circumstances both externally and


---------02:36----------
internally that lead people into the


---------02:38----------
situation and until we have an


---------02:40----------
appreciation for like how someone gets


---------02:43----------
here and what goes into this situation


---------02:46----------
then


---------02:47----------
then only can we start to really come up


---------02:49----------
with solutions to help people get out of


---------02:51----------
the situation


---------02:53----------
and so what i'm going to talk a little


---------02:54----------
bit about today is like um you know


---------02:57----------
modern slavery


---------02:58----------
and how do people get into this


---------02:59----------
situation and more importantly like what


---------03:02----------
are the key dynamics at play


---------03:05----------
uh so for example what are the power


---------03:06----------
dynamics at play what kind of like


---------03:09----------
modeling has this person had early in


---------03:11----------
their life


---------03:12----------
um how do they determine what is


---------03:14----------
acceptable or unacceptable and then


---------03:15----------
other kinds of stuff as well


---------03:17----------
so


---------03:18----------
you know some of this stuff is like you


---------03:20----------
know for example this person is saying


---------03:22----------
those few hours are not paid and it's


---------03:25----------
like


---------03:26----------
you know a lot of people will be like


---------03:27----------
wait what like then why are you doing it


---------03:29----------
how is that legal that can't be legal it


---------03:31----------
may not be legal


---------03:33----------
the other thing is that you know we see


---------03:34----------
other things that happen a lot in


---------03:36----------
working situations the boss called me


---------03:39----------
begging me to help them work


---------03:41----------
right so when a boss begs you


---------03:43----------
what is going on psychologically when


---------03:45----------
begging is happening


---------03:48----------
the next thing that happens i asked if i


---------03:49----------
have a choice and the boss said


---------03:51----------
basically no


---------03:53----------
does basically no mean no


---------03:56----------
or is it almost no


---------03:58----------
so if something is almost no or


---------04:00----------
basically no


---------04:01----------
does that what does that actually mean


---------04:03----------
right so this is the kind of thing where


---------04:05----------
like oftentimes in work situations


---------04:08----------
because of power dynamics and and you


---------04:10----------
know boundary setting issues


---------04:13----------
people will use certain kinds of


---------04:14----------
language and then like we won't really


---------04:17----------
clarify what that means


---------04:20----------
and then what we end up doing


---------04:22----------
because like i want you all to


---------04:23----------
understand this for a second when you


---------04:25----------
know you ask if you have a choice and


---------04:26----------
your boss says basically no


---------04:29----------
in their mind are they thinking that you


---------04:31----------
have a choice actually kinda yes


---------04:33----------
right because they sort of like you're


---------04:35----------
asking if you have a chess and they're


---------04:36----------
like oh they agreed to it so a boss can


---------04:39----------
walk out of this interaction believing


---------04:42----------
that


---------04:43----------
the the worker agreed to this


---------04:46----------
right so so this is the kind of thing


---------04:48----------
that like you know there's a lot


---------04:50----------
actually going on here that we can learn


---------04:51----------
from about setting health healthy


---------04:53----------
boundaries especially in power dynamic


---------04:55----------
situations that is like really really


---------04:57----------
important


---------04:58----------
the last thing is today i found out i'm


---------05:00----------
working six days as well right so like


---------05:02----------
in this situation do you have the power


---------05:05----------
to say no


---------05:08----------
and then the last thing is that made me


---------05:11----------
quite furious so when you're at work and


---------05:13----------
you feel something right so when your


---------05:15----------
boss is begging me what do you feel


---------05:17----------
and when you start to feel quite furious


---------05:19----------
you feel a certain way like what do you


---------05:20----------
do with those feelings


---------05:22----------
right how do those feelings interact


---------05:24----------
with your boss how do they interact with


---------05:26----------
your uh work environment essentially


---------05:29----------
what are the emotional drives


---------05:31----------
that happen within us that create


---------05:33----------
situations like this


---------05:35----------
and in my overwhelming experience


---------05:37----------
understanding the emotional drives


---------05:40----------
and understanding the power dynamics and


---------05:42----------
how to set healthy boundaries has been


---------05:43----------
very very helpful to people to like


---------05:46----------
create like good work environments and


---------05:48----------
this is the kind of thing where when i


---------05:49----------
say create good and work work


---------05:50----------
environments i don't mean just for the


---------05:52----------
employees so this may sound kind of


---------05:53----------
weird because i know at least the


---------05:55----------
anti-work subreddit is like very like


---------05:56----------
anti-employer


---------05:58----------
but like


---------05:59----------
i want you all to think about this work


---------06:01----------
situation like do you think the employer


---------06:03----------
is happy here they've had two people


---------06:05----------
quit


---------06:07----------
they've had one person get sick with


---------06:08----------
kovid maybe because they've had coveted


---------06:10----------
policies that aren't really great right


---------06:13----------
and then like this person is on the


---------06:14----------
verge of quitting like this is not a


---------06:16----------
good place even from an employer's


---------06:17----------
perspective so


---------06:19----------
some people may think a lot about okay


---------06:20----------
like you know this this this is a


---------06:22----------
predatory workplace and it absolutely is


---------06:25----------
but people sort of assume that a


---------06:26----------
predatory workplace is good for the


---------06:28----------
employer which in my overwhelming


---------06:30----------
experience is not the case


---------06:32----------
and so this is where understanding some


---------06:33----------
of these things because like this person


---------06:36----------
that this employer is basically by


---------06:38----------
virtue of


---------06:39----------
crapping on their employees so much


---------06:41----------
driving their employees away and like


---------06:44----------
pulling pushing themselves out of


---------06:45----------
business like that's what they're doing


---------06:47----------
and so the interesting thing is that


---------06:49----------
acknowledging healthy boundaries and


---------06:50----------
sort of like acknowledging emotions at


---------06:53----------
work you know being very clear about


---------06:54----------
communication and not taking advantage


---------06:56----------
of your employees is actually good for


---------06:58----------
the employer too there's sort of this


---------07:00----------
idea that like you know work like that


---------07:03----------
if you're a predator predatory employer


---------07:05----------
that you're winning when in my


---------07:06----------
experience overwhelmingly and i've done


---------07:08----------
consulting at a lot of different


---------07:10----------
companies


---------07:11----------
the companies that do the best are the


---------07:13----------
ones that have happy employees and like


---------07:15----------
respectful employers like when there's


---------07:17----------
respect on both sides when there's


---------07:19----------
fairness on both sides that's actually


---------07:20----------
when things end up the best so let's


---------07:22----------
talk a little bit about modern slavery


---------07:23----------
and how we get here so i'd say that the


---------07:25----------
biggest thing that leads to modern


---------07:27----------
slavery is unhealthy boundaries


---------07:32----------
so a lot of times at work we'll have


---------07:34----------
these situations where bosses will beg


---------07:36----------
us right they'll like ask us for favors


---------07:40----------
and so there'll be like all like so this


---------07:42----------
job for example has unhealthy boundaries


---------07:44----------
at the get-go so like for example if you


---------07:46----------
were to ask this person


---------07:48----------
when do you start work


---------07:51----------
and then the person will say like i


---------07:52----------
start work at this time and when does


---------07:54----------
work end well


---------07:55----------
work sort of ends like when i'm done


---------07:57----------
with my shift but then i have to clean


---------07:59----------
after i have to drop people off oh okay


---------08:01----------
so is that like a part of your job and


---------08:03----------
they're like well sort of do you get


---------08:04----------
paid for it well not really


---------08:07----------
then is it a part i'm confused this is


---------08:08----------
like a favor is it part of your job like


---------08:10----------
what is that extra uncompensated time so


---------08:13----------
work you know starts here and goes here


---------08:16----------
and you get compensated here or euro


---------08:19----------
right did i do the euro symbol right or


---------08:20----------
is that backwards


---------08:22----------
it's lagging whatever


---------08:24----------
and then um


---------08:26----------
and then there's like this extra time


---------08:28----------
over here which is like uncompensated


---------08:31----------
so is that a part of your job or is that


---------08:33----------
not a part of your job so in the united


---------08:35----------
states if you require someone to do


---------08:36----------
something generally speaking you have to


---------08:38----------
pay them for it there are some


---------08:40----------
exceptions to that but generally


---------08:41----------
speaking that's kind of the case


---------08:44----------
and so


---------08:45----------
um


---------08:45----------
[Music]


---------08:47----------
uh this is lagging again okay whatever


---------08:50----------
so


---------08:51----------
if that's the case then what is this is


---------08:53----------
this part of your job or is this not


---------08:54----------
part of your job so the first thing that


---------08:56----------
we kind of realize from this scenario is


---------08:57----------
that there are unhealthy boundaries so


---------08:59----------
if you're in a situation where it's like


---------09:01----------
a little bit unclear what's a part of


---------09:03----------
your job or what isn't a part of your


---------09:04----------
job like that's the


---------09:06----------
the start of unhealthy boundaries


---------09:08----------
so what tends to happen if you have


---------09:10----------
unhealthy boundaries is this results in


---------09:12----------
something called job creep


---------09:14----------
right so we see this like especially in


---------09:16----------
programming and stuff where there's like


---------09:17----------
scope creep where if you've got like a


---------09:19----------
project and then like


---------09:21----------
you're


---------09:23----------
you know then someone else wants this


---------09:24----------
feature and then you want this feature


---------09:26----------
and then suddenly like the project that


---------09:28----------
was this big


---------09:29----------
over time becomes this big and then over


---------09:31----------
time becomes this big but


---------09:34----------
early on like you were budgeted for this


---------09:38----------
and then people get confused when they


---------09:40----------
ask for like you know this and then they


---------09:42----------
ask for this and then you end up paying


---------09:44----------
more euro and then like they're super


---------09:47----------
confused they're like but


---------09:48----------
but this was the budget that you gave me


---------09:51----------
so we see this a lot in terms of like


---------09:53----------
when you have developers working with


---------09:54----------
like executives right they're like this


---------09:56----------
is on you see this a lot even in the


---------09:58----------
gaming industry but it's like we want to


---------10:00----------
have customized armor and it's like


---------10:02----------
that's going to cost you something right


---------10:05----------
and then we end up with all kinds of


---------10:06----------
problems like games being released too


---------10:07----------
early and things like that


---------10:09----------
so in the same way in a job oftentimes


---------10:11----------
what we'll see is that there's like


---------10:13----------
there's going to be some kind of like


---------10:14----------
boundary


---------10:15----------
that is


---------10:16----------
unhealthy or muddy in some way and then


---------10:19----------
like as that boundary is nice and loose


---------10:21----------
like unhealthy employers will cause you


---------10:24----------
to like little cram stuff into there


---------10:25----------
right so the biggest example that we see


---------10:28----------
which we definitely saw today


---------10:30----------
was


---------10:31----------
you know


---------10:32----------
um


---------10:35----------
where is this work


---------10:36----------
uh yeah so like


---------10:39----------
because two people left after the new


---------10:41----------
year and one got covered so like what's


---------10:43----------
happening to this work so there used to


---------10:45----------
be three additional people at work


---------10:48----------
and like


---------10:49----------
where is that work going it's going into


---------10:51----------
this person right so the person who


---------10:52----------
stays the one who's like getting all


---------10:54----------
that work


---------10:55----------
and so what tends to happen with


---------10:57----------
employers actually is like this is a


---------10:59----------
common thing that i see is that


---------11:01----------
if you have unhealthy if you have loose


---------11:04----------
boundaries if there are two people at


---------11:05----------
work


---------11:06----------
one of them has loose boundaries and one


---------11:08----------
of them has firm boundaries the one with


---------11:10----------
the loose boundaries is the one that


---------11:11----------
keeps on getting more work right you're


---------11:13----------
going to keep on getting more and more


---------11:15----------
work packed into your unhealthy boundary


---------11:17----------
because you're the person like at the


---------11:19----------
very beginning and we see this with this


---------11:20----------
person so the person even when they got


---------11:22----------
hired did not set a firm boundary where


---------11:25----------
like they were told like at the


---------11:26----------
beginning of work that hey you're gonna


---------11:28----------
have to do a bunch of work that we're


---------11:29----------
not gonna pay you for and the person was


---------11:31----------
like


---------11:32----------
okay


---------11:33----------
and so in doing so they've established


---------11:38----------
a fluid boundary


---------11:43----------
right and once they they've established


---------11:44----------
a fluid boundary then we're like you


---------11:46----------
know it's kind of like open season like


---------11:48----------
oh people quit


---------11:49----------
yeah you're gonna need to do this and


---------11:51----------
then what what's gonna happen is


---------11:52----------
employers and this isn't just employers


---------11:54----------
this is humans okay so employees will do


---------11:56----------
this with employers as well by the way


---------11:58----------
so it's not like one way


---------12:01----------
so then what's what's gonna happen is by


---------12:03----------
the way


---------12:04----------
you gotta


---------12:05----------
pick people up


---------12:10----------
right so these are bad working


---------12:12----------
conditions and then we have like these


---------12:14----------
two people over here


---------12:16----------
who have fern boundaries and they quit


---------12:19----------
right because they were like this is


---------12:20----------
ridiculous i'm like i'm not getting paid


---------12:21----------
for this the other one person that stays


---------12:24----------
so they stay


---------12:26----------
and then this work goes over here and


---------12:28----------
then suddenly this person is working


---------12:30----------
six days a week


---------12:34----------
because of begging and we'll get to that


---------12:36----------
in a second


---------12:38----------
and then just this week


---------12:43----------
but what do we know about this person's


---------12:44----------
boundaries


---------12:46----------
what are they gonna do if we push them


---------12:49----------
they're gonna be like okay and then into


---------12:51----------
next week


---------12:54----------
and then they're gonna experience


---------12:55----------
frustration


---------12:58----------
right but what do they do with their


---------13:00----------
frustration they post on the internet


---------13:02----------
they don't go have a conversation with


---------13:03----------
their boss or their employer and say hey


---------13:05----------
this is ridiculous i'm on the verge of


---------13:07----------
quitting and then what's going to happen


---------13:09----------
is they're going to be get fed up


---------13:13----------
and then they're going to quit


---------13:15----------
and you may say like so the anti-work


---------13:16----------
subreddit i think is going to be like


---------13:18----------
cheering if this person quits right


---------13:20----------
they're going to be like yay like this


---------13:21----------
person quit like screw capitalism screw


---------13:23----------
stick it to the man which is totally


---------13:25----------
fine i mean i i have nothing against you


---------13:27----------
know quitting and leaving a a


---------13:29----------
unfair employer to figure out their own


---------13:31----------
mess


---------13:32----------
but i'm concerned about this person


---------13:34----------
because what do you think is going to


---------13:35----------
happen


---------13:36----------
the next time they get a job


---------13:38----------
right are these are all these boundary


---------13:40----------
issues magically going to be fixed i


---------13:42----------
don't think so


---------13:44----------
right


---------13:44----------
next time what's going to happen is


---------13:46----------
maybe they'll find another job where


---------13:47----------
someone's like gonna start off because


---------13:49----------
you you'll see that like


---------13:50----------
this scenario is actually designed to


---------13:54----------
like not end well


---------13:56----------
and it's all because of unhealthy


---------13:57----------
boundaries so then the question is like


---------13:59----------
you know what's going on here and and


---------14:01----------
what what contributes to this so we


---------14:03----------
start with unhealthy boundaries


---------14:05----------
and what are like how do we like where


---------14:07----------
does this come from there are a couple


---------14:08----------
of other things here so one


---------14:10----------
is there's conflict avoidance


---------14:14----------
this is a huge thing so if we want to


---------14:16----------
understand how to correct this behavior


---------14:18----------
we have to understand conflict avoidance


---------14:20----------
so this person had multiple options to


---------14:23----------
like set a boundary right so why don't


---------14:25----------
we set good boundaries that's kind of


---------14:27----------
the next point like okay dr k you're


---------14:28----------
saying second good boundaries why don't


---------14:29----------
we because we're conflict avoidant so at


---------14:32----------
the job interview when they're told from


---------14:33----------
the get-go by the way you're gonna need


---------14:35----------
to work 11-hour days and you have to


---------14:37----------
drop people off


---------14:39----------
and then like what do you say at that


---------14:41----------
point right like why don't you say


---------14:43----------
anything you're like oh okay


---------14:45----------
and then you ask these these questions


---------14:47----------
like do i have a choice


---------14:49----------
and then the person says basically no


---------14:51----------
and then it's like what's going on there


---------14:54----------
that's all conflict avoidance so this


---------14:56----------
person is not saying has never said to


---------14:58----------
their boss


---------15:00----------
i don't think that this is fair


---------15:02----------
right they've never set a boundary


---------15:03----------
they've said i'm happy to work i'm happy


---------15:05----------
to do whatever you want to but if this


---------15:07----------
is a job i expect to be compensated like


---------15:10----------
i'm confused are you asking me to


---------15:11----------
volunteer my time


---------15:13----------
or is this like paid work does this need


---------15:15----------
to be done


---------15:16----------
and if you're hiring me like why is it


---------15:17----------
my responsibility to arrange for


---------15:19----------
transport i'm confused i thought my job


---------15:21----------
was to make pizza so is this a part of


---------15:24----------
my job description or is this not a part


---------15:25----------
of my job description


---------15:27----------
now i'm not saying that like


---------15:29----------
you shouldn't and this is one of the


---------15:30----------
worst things that i think has happened


---------15:31----------
is that the you know employers have


---------15:33----------
taken the aspect of team player and


---------15:36----------
abused it so much that it like terrifies


---------15:38----------
me as someone who has both worked in


---------15:40----------
good team player environments and now


---------15:42----------
like someone who employs people like so


---------15:45----------
we love team players but somewhere along


---------15:47----------
the way


---------15:48----------
team player started to mean


---------15:50----------
like


---------15:51----------
we're gonna ask you to do a bunch of


---------15:53----------
work and we're not gonna compensate for


---------15:55----------
you for it like that's not what a team


---------15:56----------
player is like i don't know if you all


---------15:58----------
have ever done this but i've worked in


---------16:00----------
environments where people are team


---------16:01----------
players and those are awesome


---------16:03----------
environments like what does a team


---------16:04----------
player mean i still remember to this day


---------16:07----------
in the summer of 2014


---------16:10----------
i was i was in residency for two months


---------16:13----------
and i was just so overwhelmed and so


---------16:15----------
overworked and my like colleagues right


---------16:18----------
next to me were equally overwhelmed and


---------16:20----------
equally overworked


---------16:22----------
and the doctor that was sitting next to


---------16:23----------
me also in residency for two months


---------16:25----------
we've been doing it just as long


---------16:27----------
i have to do something called a prior


---------16:28----------
authorization which is i have to make a


---------16:29----------
phone call to an insurance company to


---------16:31----------
try to get them to pay for a medication


---------16:33----------
that one of my patients needs and


---------16:35----------
usually this is like a 30 minute like


---------16:36----------
process where you sit on hold for like


---------16:38----------
20 minutes i was just exhausted and the


---------16:40----------
doctor next to me turns to me and says


---------16:42----------
you want me to take care of that prior


---------16:43----------
off for you


---------16:44----------
and i was like dude you have too much to


---------16:46----------
do like i can't like i can't ask you


---------16:48----------
this and like seriously don't worry


---------16:49----------
about it like i'll take care of it for


---------16:50----------
you and she took care of it for me and


---------16:52----------
it was like the nicest thing in the


---------16:54----------
world like even now seven years later i


---------16:57----------
remember that moment because


---------16:59----------
like it's not like she had a less work


---------17:01----------
than i did we both had a ton of work


---------17:03----------
we're both overworked but she was a team


---------17:05----------
player in that moment and so to this day


---------17:08----------
i've tried my best to repay her but i


---------17:10----------
don't think like i've never repaid that


---------17:12----------
debt despite my best efforts so you can


---------17:14----------
absolutely like be a team player like i


---------17:16----------
think being a team player is good like


---------17:17----------
the whole point of a corporation at


---------17:19----------
least in my mind and maybe it's profit


---------17:21----------
and stuff like that but


---------17:23----------
you know i think the point is that like


---------17:25----------
if you guys have ever worked in


---------17:26----------
environments where you're just all by


---------17:28----------
yourself like that's not fun it's not


---------17:30----------
engaging the whole point if we think


---------17:31----------
about like aoe healing in this community


---------17:33----------
the whole point is that we can do stuff


---------17:36----------
together that we can't do on our own but


---------17:39----------
what's happened in the like the


---------17:40----------
capitalistic corporate world is team


---------17:43----------
player has been hijacked culturally


---------17:45----------
appropriated to be like a veil over


---------17:49----------
abusive work practices


---------17:51----------
and that's ridiculous so now like people


---------17:53----------
are like oh we don't want team players


---------17:54----------
it's like i don't want to work in any


---------17:56----------
environment where they're team players


---------17:57----------
like what do you want you want to work


---------17:59----------
in a cubicle where you're like a peon


---------18:01----------
like sitting at a computer doing like


---------18:02----------
that's terrible


---------18:04----------
right so i'm not blaming those people


---------18:06----------
for avoiding the term team player what


---------18:07----------
i'm blaming is that companies are like


---------18:09----------
starting to use team player as you know


---------18:11----------
some license to be predatory and put


---------18:14----------
people into like a slavery-like


---------18:15----------
situation that's ridiculous


---------18:18----------
but we want to work in teams like that's


---------18:19----------
fun like it's good to be a team player


---------18:22----------
anyway


---------18:23----------
so if we kind of look at this


---------18:25----------
what we see here is a thread of conflict


---------18:27----------
avoidance and if we want to understand


---------18:28----------
you know why are we conflict avoidant


---------18:33----------
then what happens


---------18:35----------
is we need to look at


---------18:37----------
emotional drivers


---------18:39----------
so this in turn results in emotional


---------18:41----------
drivers


---------18:43----------
or not results in is due to emotional


---------18:45----------
drivers


---------18:46----------
so if we kind of look at this post we


---------18:48----------
see a lot of emotions threaded out


---------18:50----------
through here right


---------18:51----------
so like when they were hiring they said


---------18:53----------
i'll need to work 11 hour shifts plus


---------18:55----------
taking


---------18:56----------
co-workers home after work apparently


---------19:00----------
those few hours is not paid so like what


---------19:02----------
do you imagine this person was feeling


---------19:03----------
in that moment


---------19:04----------
what do you think that was going through


---------19:06----------
their head


---------19:07----------
and then now it's like when their boss


---------19:09----------
calls and begs them


---------19:13----------
like they're begging and forcing this is


---------19:15----------
really confusing so the boss called me


---------19:16----------
in other words begging me to help them


---------19:18----------
because two people left i asked if i


---------19:20----------
have a choice and the boss said no so


---------19:21----------
what's happening here is the boss


---------19:23----------
forcing them or begging them because in


---------19:26----------
one situation the power dynamic is that


---------19:28----------
if i'm begging you you have all the


---------19:30----------
power in the other situation if i'm


---------19:31----------
forcing you you have none of the power


---------19:33----------
so there's a weird power dynamics crap


---------19:34----------
going on there's weird emotional drivers


---------19:36----------
going on and then you feel furious and


---------19:39----------
what do you do with that period do you


---------19:40----------
talk to your boss about it no


---------19:43----------
you just either take it


---------19:45----------
you just keep taking it right


---------19:48----------
or what you do is you just like reach


---------19:50----------
your limit and you quit which is what


---------19:51----------
this person has managed to like this is


---------19:53----------
the work environment they managed to


---------19:54----------
create they've not created a work


---------19:56----------
environment where people feel


---------19:58----------
comfortable


---------19:59----------
coming to their boss and sharing with


---------20:01----------
them like what their concerns are which


---------20:03----------
is crucial it's critical right so all of


---------20:05----------
the good environments that i've worked


---------20:07----------
in have systems of feedback where like


---------20:09----------
people can go to the you know their


---------20:12----------
superiors and they can say hey i'm


---------20:13----------
unhappy with this and it's not like the


---------20:15----------
superior listens to you 100 they're not


---------20:17----------
going to like make changes like for


---------20:18----------
example you know residents in the united


---------20:20----------
states are like criminally underpaid but


---------20:23----------
we have no negotiating power and even my


---------20:25----------
boss doesn't really have much


---------20:26----------
negotiating power there


---------20:28----------
because they have to answer to like a


---------20:30----------
whole like systemic


---------20:32----------
industry of predatory work and for


---------20:35----------
medical residents but that's neither


---------20:36----------
here nor there so right so like that's


---------20:38----------
not my boss's fault like they're going


---------20:40----------
to advocate and do what they can and


---------20:41----------
they're like they honestly are trying to


---------20:43----------
make things better they're happy to work


---------20:45----------
there they want to be a team player they


---------20:46----------
want to support us we want to support


---------20:48----------
them and it's awesome like i still that


---------20:50----------
to this day


---------20:51----------
literally this morning i texted my


---------20:53----------
former boss because they're an awesome


---------20:55----------
person and i have like really good


---------20:56----------
relationship with them


---------20:58----------
um


---------20:59----------
and so what are these emotional drivers


---------21:00----------
okay so let's like start to look at a


---------21:02----------
couple of common emotional drivers so


---------21:05----------
i'll give you guys an example of how


---------21:06----------
emotional drivers


---------21:08----------
result in


---------21:10----------
um


---------21:12----------
poor boundaries okay so let's use an


---------21:14----------
example first


---------21:17----------
so


---------21:18----------
let's say i'm afraid of loneliness


---------21:24----------
and then i start hanging out with some


---------21:26----------
friends


---------21:32----------
and then one of them


---------21:36----------
makes fun of me


---------21:39----------
what do i do


---------21:43----------
right i'm afraid of loneliness what do i


---------21:45----------
do


---------21:49----------
what do y'all think


---------21:53----------
you laugh it off right


---------21:57----------
you're so funny when you call me an


---------21:59----------
idiot


---------22:03----------
ignore it


---------22:05----------
right


---------22:06----------
so then what does that what kind of


---------22:08----------
behavior does that


---------22:11----------
reinforce


---------22:12----------
so then someone else a different friend


---------22:14----------
friend


---------22:15----------
number two


---------22:18----------
makes fun of you the next day


---------22:23----------
right and then what do you do well like


---------22:24----------
no


---------22:25----------
kind of weird


---------22:27----------
right


---------22:29----------
and then you kind of like


---------22:34----------
laugh it off


---------22:36----------
walls


---------22:37----------
yeah you're right i'm so insignificant


---------22:40----------
of a human being


---------22:44----------
and now since you're afraid of


---------22:45----------
loneliness like you kind of tolerate


---------22:47----------
this behavior and then the group sort of


---------22:48----------
learns they're like oh cool so this


---------22:50----------
person is the butt of the jokes


---------22:54----------
great


---------22:56----------
we needed someone to beat up on when


---------22:58----------
we're feeling bad about ourselves


---------23:00----------
fantastic and so you become the butt of


---------23:03----------
the jokes


---------23:04----------
and now you know you're the butt of the


---------23:06----------
jokes like it's become a thing like the


---------23:07----------
whole group is like this is the person


---------23:10----------
like you know and it starts off as like


---------23:12----------
oh wow this person is awesome they can


---------23:13----------
take a joke but like over time it grows


---------23:16----------
and they push that boundary and they


---------23:17----------
start making fun of you and then like


---------23:19----------
you end up in these situations where


---------23:20----------
your friends like actually actively


---------23:22----------
bully you


---------23:23----------
but then why do you stay because you're


---------23:24----------
afraid of loneliness


---------23:27----------
because if i tell them hey that's not


---------23:29----------
funny


---------23:30----------
this person will dislike me


---------23:32----------
if they dislike me they will not invite


---------23:34----------
me to their house if they don't invite


---------23:37----------
me to their house and they invite all of


---------23:38----------
my other friends


---------23:40----------
i will be alone


---------23:41----------
so it's like i have a choice either i


---------23:43----------
can hang out with these people have some


---------23:44----------
fun and be the butt of the jokes or i


---------23:46----------
can be a loser like i can be a loser at


---------23:49----------
home on my own or i can be a loser with


---------23:51----------
them but still have friends and not be


---------23:53----------
like as much of a loser


---------23:55----------
right so this is just an example of how


---------23:58----------
an emotional


---------23:59----------
drive actually leads to unhealthy


---------24:01----------
boundaries so does this happen at work


---------24:05----------
and


---------24:06----------
absolutely right so like let's think


---------24:07----------
about a couple of different things that


---------24:08----------
happen


---------24:10----------
so people


---------24:12----------
are reluctant to ask for stuff


---------24:18----------
why are we reluctant to ask for stuff


---------24:20----------
because we don't want to be perceived as


---------24:22----------
greedy


---------24:25----------
right so who's greedy


---------24:28----------
the corporation or the employee like we


---------24:30----------
don't want to be like them like we


---------24:31----------
demonize greed like even right now


---------24:33----------
within the anti-work subreddit we are


---------24:35----------
demonizing greed


---------24:37----------
and what are we doing by demonizing


---------24:39----------
greed we're saying oh these corporations


---------24:41----------
are so evil and greedy


---------24:43----------
and like in a bizarre way we're actually


---------24:45----------
like


---------24:46----------
we're labeling this thing as green which


---------24:48----------
i'm with but then what what's gonna


---------24:50----------
happen is like subconsciously we're


---------24:52----------
actually like at the same time


---------24:54----------
making employees feel greedy for doing


---------24:56----------
things like asking for raises or just


---------24:58----------
compensation or things like that so this


---------25:00----------
is a huge thing i don't want my boss to


---------25:01----------
think i'm greedy


---------25:03----------
okay


---------25:04----------
huge emotional driver


---------25:06----------
it's emotional driver number one


---------25:09----------
um emotional driver number two so when


---------25:11----------
people when it comes to time for like


---------25:13----------
promotion and things like that


---------25:15----------
people have difficulty advocating for


---------25:17----------
themselves in a work environment right


---------25:19----------
so they have like difficulty advocating


---------25:21----------
for what they're worth


---------25:22----------
and why is that it's because i don't


---------25:23----------
want to be perceived


---------25:26----------
as a show-off


---------25:30----------
right so like if you crush let's say


---------25:31----------
you've got some kind of contract and you


---------25:33----------
do a really good job


---------25:34----------
and then like you don't want to be


---------25:35----------
perceived as a show-off so you don't


---------25:36----------
like really advocate for yourself you


---------25:38----------
don't really let your boss know you


---------25:39----------
don't let other people know because


---------25:40----------
there's someone else at work who's


---------25:42----------
always talking about how awesome they


---------25:43----------
are and you don't want to be like that


---------25:44----------
person so you don't want to be perceived


---------25:46----------
as a show-off so you don't share your


---------25:48----------
accomplishments


---------25:56----------
right and then what happens


---------25:59----------
then


---------26:00----------
your colleague


---------26:03----------
gets promoted


---------26:06----------
and then what do you do


---------26:08----------
you mauled


---------26:10----------
right


---------26:11----------
and then you start talking about


---------26:13----------
how biased


---------26:16----------
and evil


---------26:18----------
your boss is


---------26:19----------
oh my god they're so biased


---------26:21----------
see this all the


---------26:22----------
time which may be true right so we're


---------26:25----------
not saying and this is the problem with


---------26:26----------
echo chambers on the internet is that


---------26:28----------
like


---------26:29----------
someone will post this but like no one


---------26:31----------
will ever say like do you advocate for


---------26:33----------
yourself


---------26:35----------
right i'm not saying that that these


---------26:37----------
predatory workplaces don't exist i'm not


---------26:39----------
saying that these employers are behaving


---------26:41----------
properly but what i'm saying is that


---------26:43----------
like in this scenario and what we tend


---------26:45----------
to focus on is you so what are the


---------26:47----------
emotional drivers at play


---------26:51----------
that force you into situations


---------26:53----------
that are unhealthy for you and actually


---------26:55----------
happen to be unhealthy for the employer


---------26:57----------
generally speaking i believe maybe i'm


---------26:58----------
wrong there i'm not an expert in


---------26:59----------
business


---------27:01----------
okay so you don't want to be perceived


---------27:02----------
as a show-off


---------27:04----------
now there's other kinds of weird things


---------27:05----------
as well right so like you get guilt


---------27:07----------
trips so like you want to be a team


---------27:08----------
player


---------27:13----------
like and so this is where the guilt


---------27:15----------
tripping comes in


---------27:18----------
this isn't just employers right this is


---------27:20----------
like you have to be careful about the


---------27:22----------
emotional driver of not feeling like an



---------27:26----------
because that's a really powerful driver


---------27:27----------
because you don't think of yourself as


---------27:29----------
the right the boss is the


---------27:30----------
 the corporation is the


---------27:32----------
i'm not the


---------27:33----------
therefore if your boss comes to you and


---------27:35----------
begs you and by the way we see this


---------27:37----------
one-two punch all the way and all the


---------27:39----------
time in unhealthy environments that


---------27:40----------
one-two punch is guilt plus forcing and


---------27:43----------
it's not just unhealthy work


---------27:44----------
environments it's also like abusive


---------27:46----------
relationships so if you have like a


---------27:48----------
narcissistic parent or family member or


---------27:50----------
things like that they will both force


---------27:52----------
you and guilt you like at the same time


---------27:55----------
so i've seen parents that will do things


---------27:57----------
like guilt their kid into coming home


---------27:59----------
for the holidays and then like there's


---------28:01----------
the cat there's the it's not even the


---------28:02----------
carrot it's like one kind of stick and


---------28:04----------
another kind of stick and by the way if


---------28:06----------
you don't come home for the holidays i'm


---------28:07----------
not gonna pay for your college anymore



---------28:10----------
and then you're like and i'm so lonely


---------28:12----------
like i've done so much for you i'm


---------28:14----------
paying for your college


---------28:15----------
and if you're not gonna like come home


---------28:17----------
for the holidays like i can't believe i


---------28:18----------
do so much for you like i can't believe


---------28:20----------
that you wouldn't even come home like


---------28:21----------
don't you realize how like alone i am


---------28:23----------
like i've done everything for you i've


---------28:25----------
sacrificed for you and how dare you try


---------28:27----------
to have a life outside of me and by the


---------28:30----------
way if you're not gonna like you know


---------28:32----------
sacrifice for me like if your friends


---------28:34----------
are more important to


---------28:35----------
you than i am then maybe i have other


---------28:38----------
things that are more important to me


---------28:39----------
than you are


---------28:42----------
right it's like there's this weird


---------28:44----------
one-two punch of begging you to take


---------28:46----------
these extra shifts and forcing you to do


---------28:48----------
so


---------28:50----------
so watch out for the emotional driver of


---------28:52----------
guilt trip right and like you're not


---------28:54----------
being an


---------28:55----------
by setting a limit to someone it


---------28:57----------
certainly feels that way


---------28:59----------
but be aware of that emotional driver


---------29:02----------
okay


---------29:03----------
next thing


---------29:06----------
so


---------29:08----------
the


---------29:09----------
hidden


---------29:11----------
tracking i don't know what to call this


---------29:14----------
of


---------29:15----------
rays versus fire


---------29:18----------
so internally we have this weird little


---------29:22----------
complex


---------29:23----------
that is always trying to figure out are


---------29:25----------
we going to get raised are we going to


---------29:27----------
get raised are we going to get promoted


---------29:29----------
are we going to get fired because no one


---------29:30----------
ever like keeps score right like the


---------29:32----------
score is not kept really above board


---------29:34----------
like you don't know when you have


---------29:35----------
strikes you don't know when you have


---------29:37----------
check marks so let's say let you know


---------29:39----------
there's three check marks


---------29:42----------
in order to get a raise we need three


---------29:43----------
check marks


---------29:45----------
right


---------29:47----------
and then in order to get fire we need


---------29:49----------
three x's


---------29:50----------
but no one ever tells you like which of


---------29:52----------
these you have and which of these you


---------29:53----------
don't have so there's just this guessing


---------29:55----------
game going on so this is all like behind


---------29:58----------
you know


---------29:59----------
you can't see what's going on here


---------30:01----------
so a lot of times in these particular


---------30:03----------
situations like if we go back to this


---------30:05----------
this example where the person is saying


---------30:07----------
they're told in the interview by the way


---------30:09----------
you have to work 11 hour days and


---------30:10----------
there's a bunch of unpaid work after


---------30:12----------
that you have to do


---------30:13----------
what this person is thinking is this is


---------30:15----------
like a subtle test right there's a check


---------30:17----------
mark at play like if i set a boundary or


---------30:20----------
even ask a question this person is going


---------30:23----------
to think oh my god i'm not a team player


---------30:25----------
and then i will be one step closer to


---------30:27----------
not being hired or being fired or not


---------30:30----------
getting promoted right because we all


---------30:32----------
want approval


---------30:34----------
and then similarly for each of these


---------30:36----------
different things that this person is


---------30:38----------
being asked to do drive people home


---------30:40----------
you know come in six days a week what


---------30:42----------
they're thinking in their mind is like


---------30:43----------
is this going to move me towards


---------30:44----------
promotion


---------30:46----------
and what's really devastating for people


---------30:47----------
is that they will do all kinds of stuff


---------30:50----------
gunning for promotion


---------30:52----------
right but since it's all opaque they


---------30:54----------
actually don't know they're like i'm


---------30:56----------
gonna make this sacrifice


---------30:58----------
sacrifice one


---------31:00----------
and then sacrifice two and then


---------31:02----------
sacrifice three but like since i don't


---------31:06----------
want to be perceived as a show-off i'm


---------31:08----------
sort of quietly making these sacrifices


---------31:10----------
and not really like advertising it


---------31:12----------
because i don't want to seem greedy and


---------31:14----------
then when promotion time


---------31:16----------
promotion time comes around someone else


---------31:18----------
gets promoted and then you feel


---------31:19----------
resentful


---------31:23----------
or frustrated


---------31:25----------
and this is where the the journey ends


---------31:28----------
so now what do you do with this


---------31:29----------
resentment or frustration you tend to


---------31:31----------
quit


---------31:32----------
or swallow it


---------31:35----------
and keep going


---------31:39----------
what people don't do is like share some


---------31:41----------
kind of feedback with their boss right


---------31:43----------
we don't go up to our boss and we don't


---------31:45----------
say hey by the way i've been working


---------31:46----------
really hard and i've been actually going


---------31:48----------
the extra mile and being a team player


---------31:50----------
and i'm like i don't understand why this


---------31:52----------
person was promoted because based on my


---------31:54----------
experience i actually work way more than


---------31:56----------
they do


---------31:58----------
right so we don't say things like that


---------31:59----------
we don't air things out to our boss now


---------32:01----------
that doesn't mean that maybe that person


---------32:03----------
is doing all kinds of stuff so that


---------32:05----------
you're not aware of that is the reason


---------32:08----------
that they got promoted but it's i think


---------32:09----------
it's completely reasonable to share that


---------32:11----------
kind of stuff with your boss


---------32:13----------
the key thing here though is that you


---------32:14----------
know until you start acknowledging


---------32:17----------
these emotional drivers


---------32:20----------
that drive these unhealthy boundaries


---------32:22----------
and put you in situations that are


---------32:24----------
predatory this kind of thing is going to


---------32:25----------
keep happening


---------32:27----------
you can keep job hunting and should you


---------32:28----------
quit this kind of job like absolutely


---------32:30----------
right so there's like i think you should


---------32:32----------
quit and try to go find another job by


---------32:33----------
all means


---------32:34----------
but be careful because the next time


---------32:36----------
around when you're in one of these jobs


---------32:38----------
and someone tries to push a boundary


---------32:39----------
like it's okay to do things outside of


---------32:41----------
your role like even now today i do


---------32:43----------
things that are outside of my role


---------32:45----------
you know we have like that's actually


---------32:46----------
pretty normal for like a pretty healthy


---------32:48----------
functioning workplace


---------32:51----------
but over time what you want is like some


---------32:53----------
amount of compensation for that


---------32:55----------
acknowledgement of that or like you know


---------32:57----------
how we can do things that hg is like


---------32:59----------
someone does something outside of their


---------33:00----------
role and they do it for a while and


---------33:01----------
they're like you know this is actually


---------33:03----------
really frustrating like okay so it


---------33:04----------
sounds like we really need to hire a


---------33:06----------
person to take that off your plate so


---------33:07----------
that you can focus on your job that's


---------33:09----------
how it should go


---------33:10----------
at a company


---------33:12----------
right


---------33:14----------
and so this kind of thing is happening


---------33:15----------
all the time


---------33:17----------
um


---------33:18----------
and


---------33:20----------
if we don't want to fall into this trap


---------33:22----------
of modern slavery it really comes with


---------33:24----------
setting healthy boundaries


---------33:26----------
setting healthy boundaries in turn


---------33:28----------
has to do with understanding why we


---------33:30----------
don't set healthy boundaries so there


---------33:32----------
may be some degree of of power dynamics


---------33:35----------
at play but a big part of it tends to be


---------33:37----------
conflict avoidance


---------33:38----------
and especially the the conflict


---------33:40----------
avoidance that you're concerned about


---------33:41----------
has to do with emotional drivers


---------33:43----------
and those being you know


---------33:45----------
wanting to be perceived as a certain way


---------33:47----------
you don't want to be perceived as greedy


---------33:49----------
you don't want to be a show-off you want


---------33:51----------
to be a team player you don't want to


---------33:53----------
like feel guilty right so the avoidance


---------33:55----------
of that feeling of guilt results in you


---------33:58----------
making a sacrifice and if you're in an


---------34:00----------
unhealthy work environment your employer


---------34:02----------
is not going to recognize that and it


---------34:04----------
not acknowledge it or you know won't


---------34:06----------
promote you or something i mean


---------34:07----------
hopefully at least there's an


---------34:09----------
acknowledgment of some kind


---------34:12----------
you know and sometimes the


---------34:13----------
acknowledgment is like ridiculous


---------34:15----------
so like i remember hearing during the


---------34:16----------
pandemic you know some ceo of a hospital


---------34:19----------
system got a 16 million dollar bonus


---------34:22----------
and all of the residents in that same


---------34:24----------
hospital system got a thank you cap


---------34:27----------
they got a hat


---------34:28----------
and it's like one guy's making 16


---------34:30----------
million dollars in the residents who are


---------34:31----------
like on the front lines taking care of


---------34:33----------
patients or getting caps


---------34:37----------
this is ridiculous


---------34:39----------
right


---------34:41----------
so


---------34:42----------
um


---------34:44----------
and then a couple of other things to


---------34:45----------
keep in mind are that


---------34:47----------
in your mind be aware of what if you're


---------34:50----------
keeping this hidden tracker


---------34:52----------
of am i on track for a promotion or am i


---------34:55----------
on track to get fired


---------34:56----------
and like how much does that fear


---------34:59----------
of not getting promoted or striving to


---------35:01----------
be promoted


---------35:02----------
or you know


---------35:03----------
not getting fired how much does that


---------35:05----------
influence whether you let other people


---------35:08----------
like


---------35:08----------
cross your boundaries


---------35:10----------
and then lastly as you start to


---------35:12----------
build up negative emotions from the


---------35:14----------
result of numbers one through four


---------35:17----------
you're going to end up with resentment


---------35:19----------
and frustration how do you manage that


---------35:21----------
resentment and frustration do you just


---------35:22----------
let it build up and quit do you offer


---------35:24----------
feedback to your boss and say hey this


---------35:26----------
is not really working for me or i'm very


---------35:27----------
unhappy here


---------35:29----------
what do you think is going to happen


---------35:32----------
or do you swallow it and keep going


---------35:33----------
because generally speaking the two


---------35:34----------
things that people do is this and this


---------35:36----------
whereas what they should be doing is


---------35:37----------
have a conversation


---------35:42----------
this is where you may say but if i have


---------35:43----------
a conversation like nothing is going to


---------35:45----------
change and that's what like now hold on


---------35:47----------
a second i i think you got to be careful


---------35:48----------
there because it's possible that nothing


---------35:50----------
may change you may be at a work


---------35:52----------
environment where people are completely


---------35:54----------
unresponsive to your feedback and they


---------35:56----------
don't care what you think and in that


---------35:58----------
case you should absolutely quit and


---------36:00----------
people may say okay if i quit how do i


---------36:02----------
find a different job this is what you


---------36:03----------
say when you go into your next job you


---------36:05----------
all ready for it you guys want to get a


---------36:06----------
good job out of this situation how you


---------36:08----------
turn this situation into a good job here


---------36:10----------
it is


---------36:11----------
hi


---------36:12----------
my name is


---------36:14----------
mad for money


---------36:17----------
i'm a dedicated hard worker and i'm a


---------36:18----------
team player why did i leave my last job


---------36:21----------
so i started out working 11 hour days


---------36:24----------
and then i found out that you know


---------36:26----------
people need to transport two and four


---------36:28----------
from work so i actually went ahead and


---------36:30----------
did that


---------36:31----------
and then a couple people quit and my


---------36:33----------
boss asked me to like lift more and i


---------36:35----------
was actually happy to do that so for one


---------36:37----------
week i started working six days a week


---------36:39----------
11 hour shifts i'm a dedicated worker


---------36:41----------
i'm a team player


---------36:43----------
and the boss started making that regular


---------36:45----------
and i wasn't comfortable with that so


---------36:47----------
i'm happy to be a team player i'm happy


---------36:49----------
to be a hard worker i'm happy to go the


---------36:50----------
extra mile but i'm looking for a place


---------36:52----------
that will reward


---------36:54----------
that kind of behavior


---------36:56----------
instead of take advantage of it and


---------36:58----------
that's why i left my last employer


---------37:01----------
and then you can ask them set boundaries


---------37:03----------
then and there


---------37:05----------
how do you treat employees who go the


---------37:07----------
extra mile do they get compensated more


---------37:09----------
do they get promoted more do they get


---------37:11----------
raises


---------37:13----------
or do they get treated the same


---------37:15----------
you can ask them and then like this is


---------37:16----------
an interview right it's not just one way


---------37:19----------
because when you come into that office


---------37:21----------
like that you are an employee that


---------37:23----------
people want


---------37:24----------
right like


---------37:26----------
you are someone that they want like you


---------37:27----------
want someone who's gonna go the extra


---------37:28----------
mile and so you're interviewing them too


---------37:32----------
and so you can say like like if i go the


---------37:34----------
extra mile like how have you rewarded


---------37:36----------
employees in the past and this is when


---------37:38----------
the employer starts themselves


---------37:41----------
because if they haven't done that


---------37:42----------
they're well like we've done this and


---------37:44----------
this okay


---------37:45----------
right but i can guarantee you this like


---------37:47----------
i guess i can't guarantee it but they're


---------37:50----------
not going to walk out of that interview


---------37:52----------
thinking you're under qualified in a


---------37:53----------
pushover


---------37:55----------
does that make sense like


---------37:58----------
they may think you're an they


---------37:59----------
may think you're hard to work with


---------38:02----------
but you've demonstrated you can say like


---------38:03----------
look i'm a hard worker i just want to be


---------38:05----------
fairly compensated like that's all


---------38:07----------
you know and i'm happy to go the extra


---------38:09----------
mile but like i expect you know like i


---------38:11----------
don't want to be in a place where people


---------38:12----------
are going to take advantage of that i


---------38:13----------
want to be in a place where people


---------38:14----------
reward that kind of behavior


---------38:17----------
so that that's like you have to be


---------38:18----------
careful about your phrasing right so you


---------38:20----------
don't want to like go too far down the


---------38:22----------
every every extra minute that i work i


---------38:25----------
want one cent extra


---------38:27----------
so that kind of thing i don't think is


---------38:28----------
generally speaking what employers want


---------38:31----------
but


---------38:32----------
absolutely sort of pointing out that


---------38:34----------
you're someone who's looking to be like


---------38:36----------
rewarded for going the extra mile is


---------38:38----------
like fantastic


---------38:42----------
right so yeah and this is where people


---------38:44----------
are like kind of commenting oh like


---------38:46----------
no one wants to work like no people


---------38:48----------
actually want to work do you guys get


---------38:49----------
that this is the biggest


---------38:51----------
this is the biggest problem right now is


---------38:53----------
that people are like getting confused


---------38:54----------
employers are getting confused people


---------38:56----------
want to work people want to do things


---------38:58----------
with meaning


---------38:59----------
right they like want to be productive


---------39:00----------
like humans like being productive


---------39:03----------
they just don't want to be taken


---------39:04----------
advantage of for working


---------39:06----------
that's all


---------39:08----------
right there's not a labor shortage


---------39:10----------
there's a wage shortage like you're


---------39:11----------
working you're getting three dollars a


---------39:13----------
three euro and sixty


---------39:15----------
three point six euro per hour of work


---------39:17----------
plus tips and you're doing all this


---------39:18----------
extra work and like this is what's gonna


---------39:20----------
happen you're gonna burn through all of


---------39:22----------
your good employers employees if you're


---------39:24----------
an employer like that


---------39:26----------
and there are good places to work like


---------39:27----------
those places exist


---------39:30----------
last time i checked actually google was


---------39:31----------
one of those places


---------39:33----------
you know you don't hear like here's like


---------39:34----------
the two of opposite ends of the spectrum


---------39:37----------
right some places you have like this


---------39:39----------
where people are working a lot google's


---------39:40----------
like we're going to keep our office open


---------39:42----------
24 hours a day you can commute if you


---------39:44----------
want to you cannot come if you don't


---------39:45----------
want to by the way we want you in the


---------39:47----------
office because we've noticed that like


---------39:49----------
maybe it's good if you're in the office


---------39:50----------
so we're going to give you a bunch of


---------39:51----------
free good food there's going to be a


---------39:53----------
chef


---------39:54----------
that you can you know they'll fix you


---------39:56----------
what you want here's our menu like we're


---------39:58----------
gonna try to make your work and there's


---------40:00----------
a gym here so we want you to like take


---------40:02----------
care of yourself and we're actually


---------40:03----------
willing to put our money where our mouth


---------40:05----------
is so instead of saying yeah like we're


---------40:07----------
a company that values employee wellness


---------40:11----------
right google's like we'll give you a gym


---------40:12----------
and a chef


---------40:14----------
you know it's


---------40:17----------
so you know i think that this is the


---------40:18----------
kind of situation where like i think


---------40:20----------
this is good like i think it's healthy


---------40:22----------
because all these sort of


---------40:24----------
basically unsustainable


---------40:27----------
non-survival of the fittest


---------40:30----------
kind of like employers are gonna go bust


---------40:35----------
right and like


---------40:36----------
they're not they're not entitled to


---------40:38----------
exist like


---------40:40----------
we're talking about a free market system


---------40:42----------
like


---------40:43----------
employers that can't con enough people


---------40:45----------
are so bad


---------40:47----------
at conning people into jobs like and


---------40:49----------
people start quitting like they should


---------40:50----------
quit


---------41:06----------
you
