---------00:01----------
yes so welcome and so people refer to


---------00:05----------

---------00:07----------
Michael Reese um it's it's really


---------00:09----------
whatever the flavor of what you're


---------00:11----------
feeling is you what do you what are you


---------00:13----------
because people that like you know it's


---------00:15----------
interesting because I just look at you


---------00:16----------
know who we're talking to today and I


---------00:18----------
wanna see like your name with first name


---------00:20----------
and last name yeah I've noticed that I


---------00:23----------
not intentionally I've done that


---------00:26----------
Michaels fun okay some friends call me


---------00:29----------
Mike hmm okay what do you what do you


---------00:32----------
prefer


---------00:32----------
Micra Mike Michaels good okay cool so


---------00:37----------
tell me is there something in particular


---------00:39----------
you want to talk about today or not not


---------00:42----------
really I just kind of came into it


---------00:45----------
looking a talk of a conversation um


---------00:49----------
see what you can glean out of it cool um


---------00:52----------
there are a couple things that I think


---------00:54----------
are like maybe like stereotypically kind


---------00:58----------
of for a discussion like this sometimes


---------01:03----------
you know there's like you know the


---------01:05----------
classic like I get anxious a lot stuff


---------01:07----------
like that but you know I'm really just


---------01:10----------
looking at talk about whatever's and


---------01:12----------
when you say you get anxious a lot what


---------01:14----------
does that mean I've like I was thinking


---------01:18----------
of things to talk about for the session


---------01:20----------
it that's just like you know something


---------01:21----------
that came up I often am anxious about


---------01:26----------
many things so if that's someone you


---------01:30----------
want to explore or it's really whatever


---------01:33----------
you want to get into I mean so I'm so


---------01:37----------
Michael think of me as a resource mm-hmm


---------01:40----------
so I have a wide background of training


---------01:42----------
from like meditation and spirituality to


---------01:45----------
like neuroscience and psychiatry so is


---------01:47----------
there something in that span that you're


---------01:51----------
curious about or you think could be


---------01:53----------
helpful for a particular dimension of


---------01:56----------
your life I suppose is there like a


---------02:03----------
little like your psychology sprinkled in


---------02:05----------
there


---------02:05----------
sure awesome


---------02:09----------
helpful I I suppose yeah um I I do


---------02:14----------
struggle with anxiety sometimes so maybe


---------02:18----------
that's something yeah we can get sure


---------02:19----------
I'm noticing a theme yeah yeah you get


---------02:23----------
anxious a lot about a lot of things as


---------02:24----------
you said yes yeah let's talk about that


---------02:27----------
so what do you get anxious about um a


---------02:31----------
lot of a lot of things very day-to-day


---------02:34----------
things like like whatever I'm doing for


---------02:39----------
work getting started with anything any


---------02:42----------
kind of project lots of things coming on


---------02:46----------
a show on Twitch that's not that wasn't


---------02:49----------
too bad but is this a show on Twitch is


---------02:53----------
this a show on Twitch yeah is that we


---------02:58----------
are we a show is this a show I suppose


---------03:03----------
it as a show okay I'm okay


---------03:08----------
I was just wanted to get this fell under


---------03:10----------
that umbrella but okay so you said


---------03:11----------
getting started on stuff sometimes doing


---------03:14----------
stuff on Twitch what else ah day-to-day


---------03:18----------
stuff you know the normal normal human


---------03:21----------
anxious things you know thinking about


---------03:23----------
the long general future of your life


---------03:26----------
[Music]


---------03:29----------
sure


---------03:30----------
long general future of your life what's


---------03:34----------
your background in neuroscience actually


---------03:36----------
so I did research for about I was a


---------03:40----------
research assistant in a neuroscience lab


---------03:43----------
for about 18 months to two years and


---------03:46----------
then you learn a lot of applied


---------03:48----------
neuroscience as in medical school and as


---------03:53----------
a psychiatrist so what is applied


---------03:56----------
neuroscience like how do you apply that


---------03:58----------
knowledge because I have no idea what


---------04:00----------
the field of neuroscience is like sure


---------04:02----------
so applied neuroscience is if you have


---------04:04----------
someone who is in a car accident and a


---------04:08----------
part of their brain is damaged then what


---------04:11----------
does that do to them and how do you work


---------04:13----------
with that so that's like applied


---------04:15----------
neuroscience another example of applied


---------04:17----------
neuroscience so I do a lot of mind-body


---------04:19----------
work


---------04:20----------
so for example how does the brain change


---------04:23----------
under prolonged periods of stress so


---------04:27----------
just here's an example of applied


---------04:30----------
neuroscience so let's say that someone


---------04:32----------
is under stress so stress releases a


---------04:35----------
hormone called releases a couple of


---------04:37----------
things so first thing it releases a is


---------04:40----------
adrenaline which burn or adrenaline


---------04:44----------
epinephrine a couple of these short


---------04:46----------
acting hormones those affect the brain


---------04:47----------
in certain ways so one thing that


---------04:50----------
adrenaline does is it collapses your


---------04:52----------
peripheral vision from about 180 degrees


---------04:54----------
to 30 degrees so that's an evolutionary


---------04:58----------
thing that kind of causes people to


---------04:59----------
focus in on like the center yeah


---------05:01----------
interestingly I think that it does that


---------05:04----------
psychologically too so generally


---------05:06----------
speaking when people are under periods


---------05:07----------
of stress they have trouble considering


---------05:10----------
things that are not right in front of


---------05:12----------
them the peripheral of you know your


---------05:14----------
mine exactly so they get they kind of


---------05:16----------
like tunnel down and just focus on one


---------05:18----------
thing over time so you also release a


---------05:22----------
hormone called cortisol which has a


---------05:24----------
slower duration of action so adrenaline


---------05:28----------
hits your body within seconds and lasts


---------05:30----------
four minutes cortisol starts to kick in


---------05:33----------
within the hour and will last for like


---------05:36----------
it has different kinds of physiological


---------05:38----------
and neurological effects for four to 24


---------05:40----------
hours one example is that it goes to


---------05:43----------
this little part in the back of your


---------05:45----------
brain called the reticular activating


---------05:47----------
formation which governs sleep and so the


---------05:51----------
reason that it does that is because when


---------05:53----------
we were when we were evolving and we


---------05:55----------
were like primates living in dangerous


---------05:57----------
situations if you add an adrenaline


---------06:00----------
response like if you saw a tiger in the


---------06:02----------
woods you want cortisol to keep your


---------06:06----------
reticular activating formation div and


---------06:08----------
make your sleep easily disturbing mm-hmm


---------06:12----------
right so like you want to wake up if you


---------06:14----------
hear something


---------06:15----------
yeah it's a evolutionary response


---------06:17----------
absolutely so the downside though is


---------06:19----------
that now when people are under mental


---------06:21----------
stress because we don't have Tigers


---------06:23----------
anymore but or etiology adapts to


---------06:25----------
current circumstances mm-hmm so when I'm


---------06:28----------
thinking about huh you can't


---------06:30----------
differentiate right you can't


---------06:31----------
differentiate your body uses what it has


---------06:33----------
and so then when I'm worried about


---------06:35----------
paying so today is July 8th so if I'm


---------06:38----------
thinking about paying rent at the end of


---------06:40----------
the month I'm gonna be in a prolonged


---------06:41----------
period of stress which is gonna make it


---------06:43----------
hard for me to sleep because every noise


---------06:45----------
that happens it's going to wake up wake


---------06:47----------
me up because my reticular activating


---------06:49----------
permission is like highly active that's


---------06:51----------
an example of what I would call applied


---------06:53----------
neuroscience awesome oh that's very cool


---------06:56----------
I was um I actually really considered


---------06:59----------
that's interesting I considered getting


---------07:00----------
into like psychology when I was in high


---------07:03----------
school I was like a crossroads before I


---------07:05----------
would choose


---------07:06----------
I was either choosing like computer


---------07:09----------
science video editing or psychology


---------07:12----------
I drew computer science how did you make


---------07:14----------
your decision oh I essentially just


---------07:17----------
flipped a coin really just just very


---------07:19----------
spur of the moment in which did you


---------07:21----------
choose one computer science yeah oh I'm


---------07:27----------
very happy I'm glad I didn't go in a


---------07:29----------
video editing that's for sure


---------07:30----------
so uh some thoughts about psychology but


---------07:33----------
pretty happy with what I chose when you


---------07:36----------
say you have some thoughts about


---------07:37----------
psychology what has happened okay well


---------07:39----------
you know I wonder what it would have


---------07:40----------
been like if I had actually ended up


---------07:42----------
pursuing psychology instead I was I was


---------07:44----------
really interested in it and in high


---------07:46----------
school but I'm quite glad with the


---------07:48----------
decision I made do you like to


---------07:50----------
understand how things work yes yes yeah


---------07:55----------
absolutely yeah like understanding the


---------07:57----------
inner workings of things I can see the


---------08:00----------
attraction to psychology for you that


---------08:03----------
yeah yeah looking at a phone you want to


---------08:07----------
know how the LCD screen is a little LED


---------08:08----------
screen works and I feel like I mean like


---------08:13----------
you're never gonna fully understand


---------08:15----------
maybe that's why I went with calm sigh


---------08:17----------
it was because in psychology there's


---------08:20----------
always more to do right you're never


---------08:21----------
gonna fully understand the human mind 40


---------08:24----------
second do you think he can actually


---------08:27----------
fully map out every inner working of the


---------08:29----------
human mind is that like


---------08:32----------
like a reasonable end goal psychology er


---------08:35----------
sure why not I don't know I feel like


---------08:40----------
like the minds and I don't know I'm not


---------08:45----------
sure you would be able to like have


---------08:47----------
reason for every thought that pops into


---------08:50----------
a head you know like be able to map each


---------08:53----------
and every little meme okay so let's


---------08:57----------
think about that so the first question


---------08:58----------
is are you talking about do you think


---------09:01----------
it's unreasonable to map out the origin


---------09:03----------
of every thought for every person are we


---------09:06----------
talking about mapping out the origin of


---------09:08----------
every thought for you other people I was


---------09:16----------
talking in a general sense about you


---------09:18----------
know any random you know X person on the


---------09:21----------
street sure I think that sounds


---------09:24----------
difficult what do you think about for


---------09:25----------
you I don't to what extent um I think


---------09:30----------
you probably get pretty deep in there


---------09:32----------
about why I think the things I do i've


---------09:34----------
degree mm-hmm I think that that's yeah I


---------09:39----------
mean I I think that it's hard to


---------09:41----------
understand other people completely but I


---------09:45----------
do hope that you could understand


---------09:47----------
yourself completely I think that's what


---------09:49----------
there's this term enlightenment or


---------09:52----------
workshop in Sanskrit which is like when


---------09:54----------
people meditate for a while they gain


---------09:57----------
enlightenment and apparently it's hard


---------10:00----------
and happens rarely but if we think about


---------10:02----------
just the the translation like it


---------10:04----------
suggests knowledge mmm-hmm and so it's


---------10:07----------
sort of a complete understanding of self


---------10:11----------
and so I don't know if that's possible


---------10:14----------
or not but I think that you can


---------10:16----------
certainly make I mean I think you can


---------10:18----------
understand most of yourself like I think


---------10:20----------
that the human mind ultimately is


---------10:23----------
reducible to scientific principles and


---------10:25----------
if it's reducible the scientific


---------10:27----------
principles as opposed to RNG then I


---------10:29----------
think you can understand it I agree with


---------10:33----------
that is that something you seek to do is


---------10:34----------
to understand the way other people think


---------10:38----------
or to help people understand themselves


---------10:40----------
I'd say more of the latter


---------10:42----------
okay so


---------10:45----------
we can kind of come back to the anxiety


---------10:48----------
over the long general future of your


---------10:50----------
life so what are you worried about in


---------10:54----------
terms of is it okay if I ask you talk


---------10:56----------
more in the third person we can do that


---------10:58----------
oh um dive in as far as you want I I've


---------11:01----------
just always kind of struggled with


---------11:03----------
anxiety that's just something that's


---------11:04----------
like been very prevalent and my life


---------11:07----------
since you know the early days I think of


---------11:08----------
high school so can we actually pause


---------11:11----------
there for a second when you say you


---------11:13----------
struggled with anxiety since high school


---------11:16----------
mm-hmm what can you tell me like show me


---------11:19----------
what that like help me understand what


---------11:20----------
does that mean like paint me a picture


---------11:21----------
sure it's a lot of it started a lot of


---------11:30----------
social anxiety so like not being able to


---------11:32----------
talk to people in high school then


---------11:35----------
getting you know I think I think I had a


---------11:38----------
long very worried idea of what my future


---------11:43----------
was gonna be in high school because I


---------11:44----------
didn't have any plans yeah originally I


---------11:47----------
had no plans for what I was gonna do


---------11:50----------
after high school I was just kind of


---------11:51----------
winging it yeah and so I think that was


---------11:55----------
a very yeah prevalent creeping anxiety


---------11:58----------
for you know what how am I going to


---------12:00----------
survive after this and it led to like


---------12:03----------
less planning because that meant you


---------12:06----------
know accepting the fact that you have to


---------12:07----------
do something after high school and yet


---------12:10----------
that's yeah I don't know it just I I


---------12:12----------
can't actually like pinpoint the exact


---------12:14----------
time then it started happening but it


---------12:17----------
started happening at some point where I


---------12:19----------
become anxious about many things you


---------12:21----------
know like I'm not able to sleep very


---------12:25----------
well like I had that started in high


---------12:28----------
school so where I'm up at night you know


---------12:30----------
worrying about things it's gotten better


---------12:32----------
I've you know gone through like sleeping


---------12:34----------
techniques meditation techniques which


---------12:36----------
are nice for free man yeah what do you


---------12:38----------
worry about at night you know it's the


---------12:41----------
weirdest thing it's less of like


---------12:44----------
specific things and it's more like a


---------12:47----------
nebulous just impending like not not


---------12:50----------
impending but no just a nebulous anxiety


---------12:54----------
about the current state of things even


---------12:56----------
if everything is is good you know even


---------12:58----------
if everything going on


---------12:59----------
so would you call it like a nebulous red


---------13:03----------
yes that's a very nice poetic term yeah


---------13:06----------
I like that yeah so Michael I'd like to


---------13:11----------
toss out a couple things and let's talk


---------13:13----------
as scientist to scientist okay so what


---------13:18----------
I'm hearing is that there aren't


---------13:19----------
particular thoughts but that there's a


---------13:22----------
feeling right so the first thing to


---------13:26----------
understand is that sometimes people are


---------13:27----------
anxious about something like they're


---------13:29----------
anxious about a particular outcome like


---------13:32----------
let's I think you may have experienced


---------13:34----------
that so when you said not being able to


---------13:36----------
talk to people


---------13:37----------
what made it art in high school for you


---------13:39----------
to talk to people I think it was just


---------13:42----------
worried what what what would become of


---------13:47----------
the conversation what I would say you


---------13:49----------
know focused on the mechanics less


---------13:52----------
unlike the actual interpersonal the


---------13:54----------
reality of the conversation yeah so so


---------13:57----------
in what were you worried would happen if


---------13:59----------
the conversation became assert oh


---------14:01----------
probably that I'd look like a jackass


---------14:03----------
like you know look stupid right so


---------14:05----------
probably feeling dumb high school mean


---------14:07----------
so if we look at it that's a particular


---------14:10----------
fear right it's a it's an anxiety that


---------14:13----------
has form or shape those thoughts have


---------14:15----------
like their thoughts like if I say this


---------14:18----------
or if I don't say this they're gonna


---------14:20----------
think I'm stupid


---------14:21----------
hmm what you're describing to me now


---------14:24----------
seems to be like a general sense of


---------14:26----------
dread that doesn't it's not that


---------14:29----------
thoughts result in dread mm-hmm whereas


---------14:32----------
I would almost say that your thoughts


---------14:34----------
sort of result in the feeling of anxiety


---------14:36----------
in high school mm-hmm does that make


---------14:39----------
sense like you have particular thoughts


---------14:41----------
and those thoughts lead to feelings yes


---------14:45----------
does the feeling come before the thought


---------14:47----------
or does the feeling come after the


---------14:48----------
thought it seems I I would say the the


---------14:51----------
feeling comes before the thought yes


---------14:55----------
okay almost as if it's stemming from


---------14:57----------
from the feeling okay so that's the


---------15:00----------
substitute so the interesting thing is


---------15:02----------
that then we can say that your feelings


---------15:04----------
can manifest as particular thoughts


---------15:07----------
mm-hmm but your sense of dread does not


---------15:12----------
manifest in any particular way it's just


---------15:14----------
like a raw sense of dread okay what


---------15:19----------
would you say to that I could agree it's


---------15:25----------
hard to know what is the symptom and


---------15:27----------
what is like like the cause it's hard to


---------15:30----------
know if like you know I'm you know the


---------15:32----------
chicken or the egg like if I'm worried


---------15:34----------
about something coming up and that's


---------15:36----------
creating the feeling or the feeling is


---------15:38----------
there and I'm just applying it to


---------15:40----------
something that's coming up great so I'd


---------15:43----------
say it's hard to say yes it is hard to


---------15:45----------
say so we can tunnel down into that so


---------15:47----------
what you're what I'm hearing you almost


---------15:49----------
suggests is that there's a possibility


---------15:51----------
that the feeling will latch on to or


---------15:54----------
hijack particular things in your life


---------15:58----------
okay um I could say that it's like like


---------16:03----------
I have latched on to as and I apply it


---------16:04----------
to things how exactly yeah that's what I


---------16:07----------
could agree with that yeah right so it's


---------16:08----------
kind of interesting because then that's


---------16:10----------
not actually like it's not that the


---------16:12----------
thing in your life is the source of


---------16:14----------
anxiety yeah exactly it's just something


---------16:16----------
that you conflate with each other yeah


---------16:18----------
so like I understand that you said


---------16:21----------
earlier that it's hard to understand


---------16:24----------
what's the chicken or what's the egg but


---------16:25----------
the interesting thing Michael is that I


---------16:27----------
think you actually have hypotheses baked


---------16:30----------
in to your description of things because


---------16:35----------
you I mean you said that like I don't


---------16:37----------
know if it like picks up something


---------16:40----------
that's happening in the future and kind


---------16:41----------
of applies itself to that does that make


---------16:44----------
sense yeah and if we think about how


---------16:46----------
does someone say that sentence it's


---------16:49----------
because they have noticed something that


---------16:52----------
could be true okay do you think I'm


---------16:55----------
already kind of have an idea for what's


---------16:57----------
going on absolutely because I'm not


---------16:59----------
actually telling you very much I'm


---------17:01----------
basically repeating back to you what you


---------17:03----------
said to me hmm


---------17:05----------
so it because if we really think about


---------17:08----------
it I mean you're the one who said it's


---------17:09----------
like nebulous right so it's not specific


---------17:11----------
to something but you've noticed


---------17:13----------
something within your mind that


---------17:14----------
sometimes this nebulous dread will like


---------17:17----------
apply itself to something in the future


---------17:20----------
yes yeah and and that's kind of weird


---------17:23----------
because it's like then where does that


---------17:24----------
come from because it does


---------17:26----------
come from the future no yeah yeah it's


---------17:30----------
just ever-present yeah so how does it


---------17:34----------
feel to have ever-present threat you


---------17:37----------
know it's not great obviously but I


---------17:42----------
think I've kind of you know I've watched


---------17:46----------
a lot of videos and read some things on


---------17:50----------
how to deal with this type of you know


---------17:53----------
anxiety and dread it's definitely better


---------17:56----------
now like I think one that helped a lot


---------17:59----------
was like it's it's not you're not


---------18:02----------
supposed to or one of the ways of


---------18:04----------
dealing with it is not like pushing it


---------18:06----------
away completely like pretending it


---------18:07----------
doesn't exist it's more like accepting


---------18:10----------
that it is you know a part of who you


---------18:12----------
are as a person and like learning to


---------18:14----------
live with that in everyday life and that


---------18:17----------
that is very helpful because then you


---------18:19----------
yeah it's a I think it's a healthier way


---------18:22----------
of dealing with it


---------18:23----------
that's one that helped me okay so


---------18:26----------
healthier way okay so Michael I think


---------18:29----------
this conversation is gonna be a little


---------18:31----------
bit different from many that we have on


---------18:33----------
stream okay is it okay if I tell you how


---------18:36----------
I think it's gonna be different and sort


---------18:38----------
of get your permission to let it be


---------18:40----------
different fairly lay it on me man so


---------18:44----------
sometimes we talk about things that are


---------18:47----------
like anxiety like so sometimes we talk


---------18:50----------
about feelings we talk about emotions we


---------18:52----------
talk about experiences when we may get


---------18:54----------
there for you but I don't know if it's


---------18:57----------
just the way I'm feeling today or the


---------18:58----------
way that you're talking today or the


---------19:00----------
background that you have or the way that


---------19:02----------
you speak but I would really like to


---------19:05----------
help you understand or maybe we can


---------19:07----------
explore together like what the [ __ ] is


---------19:09----------
going on here sure yeah what is it like


---------19:12----------
what is it like how does that work like


---------19:14----------
what is what is existential dread is it


---------19:16----------
like is it anxiety because or is it like


---------19:21----------
is you just born this way or like is


---------19:23----------
this like repressive like what is that


---------19:27----------
but your does the [ __ ] come from let's


---------19:29----------
figure it out right right so so okay so


---------19:33----------
in order to do that we're gonna have to


---------19:34----------
really tunnel down into a lot of what


---------19:36----------
you say because I think you have a lot


---------19:37----------
of brilliant answers that you that


---------19:40----------
Macross is sort of like unsure


---------19:41----------
observations uh-huh so when you said


---------19:44----------
okay we don't know what's the chicken


---------19:46----------
and the egg and then you said I've read


---------19:47----------
a lot about it awesome you know I've


---------19:50----------
thought a lot about it great and what I


---------19:52----------
have discovered or what seems to help is


---------19:55----------
there are certain ways of dealing with


---------19:57----------
it and then you said pushing pushing it


---------19:59----------
away is not the best way to deal with it


---------20:02----------
yeah sort of letting it be a part of you


---------20:04----------
accepting it is like a better way to


---------20:06----------
deal with it and it doesn't bother me as


---------20:09----------
much yeah so now let's tunnel down into


---------20:12----------
what you're saying okay so both of these


---------20:14----------
have to do with responses to the


---------20:16----------
existential threat


---------20:17----------
yes that's do you see that that's


---------20:19----------
completely different from the origin or


---------20:21----------
getting rid of it


---------20:21----------
mm-hmm and so I would agree with you


---------20:25----------
that pushing it away is not that healthy


---------20:28----------
is that something you've done before


---------20:30----------
yeah I think that's like your initial


---------20:33----------
reaction to any negative feeling right


---------20:35----------
as a person like get you know fire hot


---------20:38----------
back run is kind of the idea but I mean


---------20:43----------
not the you know not the general way not


---------20:47----------
the best way to apply to every negative


---------20:48----------
thing you know this so how did you push


---------20:51----------
it away I think just ignoring it and


---------20:54----------
then ignoring it you know makes it worse


---------20:56----------
so okay and how does one ignore it I try


---------21:03----------
to put your focus on other things you


---------21:04----------
know very good distraction or yeah a


---------21:07----------
distraction what else I can think of


---------21:12----------
none other than distraction okay so


---------21:15----------
that's probably lucky because some


---------21:17----------
people ignore it through things like


---------21:20----------
using substances losing themself in


---------21:23----------
gaming so that to sort a distraction


---------21:25----------
yeah so I'm not yeah so those I guess


---------21:30----------
those are the same let me just think


---------21:31----------
about why do I think about that


---------21:38----------
okay so let's just call that distract


---------21:40----------
you every time you have like like


---------21:42----------
dissonance in your mind do you try to go


---------21:44----------
in and like fix it like every time you


---------21:46----------
do you often do that what you just did


---------21:49----------
where you wonder why you had that


---------21:51----------
thought process and like go in and that


---------21:54----------
look like what you just did right were


---------21:56----------
you oh that's that's cool


---------21:58----------
yeah I do that a lot I I don't see a lot


---------22:02----------
of people doing it that's I don't see a


---------22:04----------
lot of people doing it either


---------22:05----------
you think it's important people go in


---------22:08----------
and fix dissonance in their mind yes I


---------22:11----------
think it's very important I think that's


---------22:13----------
half of what's wrong with the world


---------22:15----------
today yeah we got a mental health idea


---------22:18----------
Aaron like that interpersonal tenna not


---------22:20----------
even health or interpersonal I think


---------22:22----------
just like human beings don't question


---------22:25----------
the conclusions of their mind mmm


---------22:28----------
because I absolutely I agree I agree


---------22:31----------
yeah so I think we're not taught how to


---------22:34----------
do that


---------22:35----------
mm-hmm so I think it's a skill yeah I


---------22:37----------
think self checking is very important


---------22:39----------
yeah so it's interesting because if you


---------22:41----------
want to take take a quick tangent and


---------22:43----------
talk about like evolutionary


---------22:45----------
neuroscience our brains are not decided


---------22:48----------
to do that so if you think about it what


---------22:50----------
our brains are decided to do is create


---------22:53----------
certainty from uncertainty so like in a


---------22:57----------
very simple sense like back in the day


---------22:58----------
like you know let's say you wake up in


---------23:00----------
your hut and then you're like where


---------23:03----------
should I go look for food mm-hmm that is


---------23:07----------
a cop a problem that is so complicated


---------23:10----------
and you have so little information that


---------23:13----------
it's impossible to answer where should


---------23:15----------
you go look for food you have no [ __ ]


---------23:17----------
idea


---------23:17----------
north-south-east-west I don't know now


---------23:20----------
later how far how long should I go north


---------23:23----------
before I go east and so human females


---------23:26----------
huh that's a complex problem yeah


---------23:28----------
absolutely there's no way to answer so


---------23:30----------
what our brain is designed to do is to


---------23:32----------
take gigantic swathes of uncertainty and


---------23:35----------
give us answers and it says hey hey you


---------23:38----------
should go this way and you're like why


---------23:40----------
and then your brain is like I don't know


---------23:42----------
just do it we're gonna just assume that


---------23:43----------
this is the right way that's how most of


---------23:45----------
our brain works yeah yeah that's varies


---------23:49----------
and then you get reinforcement over time


---------23:51----------
as you


---------23:52----------
find like a berry by the somewhere by


---------23:54----------
the creek you go north you think sure


---------23:56----------
arts is for food yeah and then even if


---------23:58----------
you don't get reinforcements you still


---------24:00----------
don't think you're wrong you still don't


---------24:03----------
even if you don't get reinforcements you


---------24:05----------
still don't know really yep thank you if


---------24:10----------
I go like north for like five miles and


---------24:13----------
I don't find any berry bushes I'm gonna


---------24:15----------
be like pretty pissed right but I still


---------24:18----------
think I'm not wrong nope you won't think


---------24:20----------
you're wrong you'll be like let me go a


---------24:22----------
different way okay okay sorry


---------24:28----------
so there are modern manifestations of


---------24:30----------
this too so there have been studies done


---------24:32----------
on like you know like packaging and


---------24:35----------
placement of items within a store so


---------24:38----------
like if you place a prominent display of


---------24:41----------
cookies at the checkout and then people


---------24:43----------
by the the cookie and then you ask the


---------24:47----------
person as they leave the grocery store


---------24:48----------
why did you buy the cookie they'll give


---------24:50----------
you a reason they'll say like oh you


---------24:52----------
know Mike he really likes these cookies


---------24:54----------
but that's not actually the deciding


---------24:57----------
factor for why they bought it the reason


---------24:58----------
that they bought it is because of the


---------24:59----------
placement yeah and if it hadn't been


---------25:02----------
placed there


---------25:02----------
they wouldn't have purchased it so our


---------25:04----------
mind is actually designed to fabricate


---------25:07----------
logical reasons for illogical behavior


---------25:10----------
that's what it's made for it works like


---------25:13----------
backwards from the conclusion works


---------25:14----------
backwards from the conclusion is a


---------25:18----------
little weird


---------25:19----------
it's shocking and strange yeah why why


---------25:21----------
do you think it what does it do that


---------25:23----------
because that's the only way it works


---------25:25----------
because thousands of years ago millions


---------25:27----------
of years ago we had to manually just


---------25:29----------
think about out like an animal doesn't


---------25:32----------
understand how anything works but it has


---------25:33----------
to act with certainty uh-huh there's no


---------25:37----------
[ __ ] idea like we have no like you


---------25:40----------
actually don't know like if I stepped


---------25:41----------
outside today I could get hit by a


---------25:43----------
meteor that's a possibility like it's on


---------25:44----------
you there's so much uncertainty in the


---------25:46----------
world and we just assume like I assume


---------25:48----------
that like my family is behind me in the


---------25:50----------
house even though I don't know that oh I


---------25:53----------
know that huh Michael is


---------25:58----------
michael is quiet is that our urine thing


---------26:02----------
or I can also turn it I turned you up a


---------26:03----------
little bit okay great


---------26:06----------
so yeah we I mean our our brain operates


---------26:09----------
based primarily on assumptions that we


---------26:12----------
assume or facts like everyday if you get


---------26:14----------
up get in your car and you drive to work


---------26:15----------
you assume that your workplace is gonna


---------26:17----------
be there even though you don't know that


---------26:19----------
okay like it could've been like


---------26:21----------
swallowed by an earthquake okay all


---------26:24----------
right


---------26:27----------
is there like why do we do you think


---------26:31----------
animals have to have that reasoning as


---------26:33----------
well yes okay it's not just like food


---------26:36----------
here food good it's like there needs to


---------26:39----------
be a reasoning to forgetting that food


---------26:41----------
no no I mean so it's a food here food


---------26:44----------
good as that's real but like most of the


---------26:47----------
world is uncertain


---------26:48----------
like if you're a deer and I wake up in


---------26:51----------
the morning I'm like where where are the


---------26:52----------
Predators I have no idea but if I if I


---------26:55----------
get paralyzed by the lack of knowledge I


---------26:58----------
won't act so the reason that we act in


---------27:01----------
ignorance is because that's like that's


---------27:03----------
how most human beings function through


---------27:05----------
most of their life like four-year-olds


---------27:07----------
don't know what's gonna happen next and


---------27:08----------
the problem existential dread so now


---------27:12----------
we're gonna talk a little bit about


---------27:13----------
where things come from let's come from


---------27:14----------
the capacity to realize that you don't


---------27:17----------
know what's coming back so Michael your


---------27:20----------
problem in high school was not that was


---------27:24----------
actually one of knowledge not ignorance


---------27:26----------
okay it's like knowledge that I know


---------27:30----------
very little yeah like you don't know


---------27:33----------
what's gonna happen next which happens


---------27:34----------
to most people in high school but some


---------27:36----------
people tend to get worried about it and


---------27:38----------
some people don't and generally speaking


---------27:39----------
in my experience people who have more


---------27:42----------
calculating who have more RAM and more


---------27:45----------
computing power tend to have more excess


---------27:47----------
existential dread


---------27:48----------
what do you think about that um I don't


---------27:53----------
know I feel like many I feel like a lots


---------27:56----------
of people can experience existential


---------27:57----------
dread


---------27:57----------
I don't like sheerly based on like your


---------28:00----------
ability to compute information I do not


---------28:03----------
think it's really based on your ability


---------28:05----------
to compute information but you've


---------28:07----------
observed that I have observed that the


---------28:10----------
smarter you are the worse your anxiety


---------28:12----------
okay that's interesting so like if you


---------28:15----------
think about anxiety what is anxiety


---------28:17----------
anxiety is generally speaking worried


---------28:19----------
worrying about consequences of future I


---------28:22----------
mean worrying about future consequences


---------28:24----------
of actions taken today present actions


---------28:27----------
yeah right so if you can foresee more


---------28:30----------
problems mmm what do you think happens


---------28:34----------
to your anxiety no of course you have


---------28:37----------
more yep and now we get to something


---------28:41----------
really interesting which is if you have


---------28:42----------
a part of your mind which latches on to


---------28:46----------
things and sort of hijacks them mm-hmm


---------28:48----------
and you give it more food for things to


---------28:51----------
highjack on to what's gonna happen I


---------28:53----------
just breathes more anxiety of course


---------28:56----------
right absolutely right it's gonna find


---------28:58----------
something yeah yeah yeah it definitely


---------29:01----------
takes up a large amount of you know the


---------29:04----------
other mental mental juice as it were so


---------29:07----------
when you say it takes up a large part of


---------29:10----------
I would think about it as a large part


---------29:12----------
of your mental juices generating things


---------29:15----------
and the more mental juice so there are


---------29:18----------
different kinds of anxiety so there are


---------29:20----------
so there are people for example with


---------29:21----------
Down syndrome or other kinds of like


---------29:24----------
cerebral palsy who will experience


---------29:26----------
intense anxiety even though their


---------29:28----------
computing power is pretty low but in my


---------29:30----------
experience the flavor of that anxiety is


---------29:33----------
different okay how so it's more like


---------29:37----------
existential dread so we'll get to that


---------29:39----------
in a second but so so some of that is


---------29:43----------
more physiologic anxiety but it's not


---------29:46----------
like neurotic anxiety so like we think


---------29:49----------
about neurosis which is the tendency to


---------29:51----------
worry so there's like neurotic anxiety


---------29:53----------
which is kind of like you worry about


---------29:55----------
lots of stuff and then some people just


---------29:57----------
have feelings that they can't shape and


---------29:59----------
that feeling will latch on to anything


---------30:01----------
no matter how small it is okay so that


---------30:04----------
because anxiety is not just a mental


---------30:06----------
sensation as well right there's a


---------30:07----------
physiologic component yeah your heart


---------30:09----------
rate will elevate oh yeah I got that


---------30:11----------
reading problems and all oh yeah exactly


---------30:14----------
and so that to those physiologic changes


---------30:17----------
will affect the function of your mind


---------30:19----------
even though the root of it may not be


---------30:21----------
mind so what I mean by that is that if


---------30:25----------
you have


---------30:26----------
if your heart rate is elevated you're


---------30:28----------
gonna have a sympathetic nervous


---------30:29----------
response


---------30:30----------
you're gonna release adrenaline and what


---------30:32----------
adrenaline literally does to your brain


---------30:34----------
is starts to increase the speed of your


---------30:37----------
thoughts make thoughts black and white


---------30:40----------
and makes your thoughts that are


---------30:43----------
possibilities feel like realities okay


---------30:46----------
so it takes something that might be and


---------30:49----------
it turns it into something that's


---------30:50----------
definitely gonna happen certainty okay


---------30:52----------
and that too is evolutionary because


---------30:55----------
once upon a time there were two human


---------30:57----------
beings who each faced a tiger and one


---------31:00----------
human being saw the danger as a


---------31:02----------
possibility and one human being saw the


---------31:04----------
danger is a reality which human being is


---------31:07----------
more likely to survive Nona sees it as a


---------31:10----------
reality


---------31:11----------
absolutely so adrenaline makes


---------31:15----------
possibilities about the future feel real


---------31:18----------
and that's what our brain is [ __ ]


---------31:20----------
designed to do mm-hmm so anyway a


---------31:24----------
physiologic anxiety can sort of


---------31:26----------
reinforce certain thoughts but there's a


---------31:28----------
physiological component there's a


---------31:29----------
cognitive component there's sort of a


---------31:31----------
neurotic yeah I see what you're saying


---------31:32----------
yeah I don't think we've still got into


---------31:35----------
the source of your existential dread but


---------31:37----------
we're kind of mapping things out oh yeah


---------31:39----------
I understand it better okay any


---------31:41----------
questions so far


---------31:42----------
cool no no I'm enjoying the ride okay


---------31:45----------
now is this I never really thought about


---------31:46----------
the differences and like different types


---------31:49----------
of anxieties more nebulous or more


---------31:52----------
focused that's cool yeah so I think part


---------31:55----------
of the problem is that we use the word


---------31:56----------
anxiety to describe a lot of different


---------31:58----------
things yeah general kind of term so let


---------32:01----------
me ask you something Michael by the way


---------32:04----------
how you feeling right now I'm fine


---------32:06----------
I'm just having a good interesting very


---------32:08----------
interesting talk so you feel like this


---------32:10----------
is a good use of our time yeah for sure


---------32:12----------
okay so let me ask you something


---------32:15----------
qualitatively would you say that your


---------32:16----------
existential dread is like roughly the


---------32:20----------
same or roughly different as being


---------32:24----------
concerned that people are gonna think


---------32:26----------
you're gonna look stupid roughly I


---------32:29----------
couldn't repeat the question yeah like


---------32:31----------
would you say that that's the same thing


---------32:33----------
like existential dread and like the way


---------32:35----------
they used to feel in high school like


---------32:37----------
when you were concerned about inner


---------32:39----------
interactions and looking stupid do those


---------32:41----------
feel like different things to you or do


---------32:43----------
they feel like the same thing I think


---------32:48----------
it's a rat it's very close to the same


---------32:50----------
feeling that I have okay I don't know if


---------32:52----------
it is the same thing but it's it's close


---------32:55----------
to the same feeling can you help us


---------32:57----------
understand that feeling at all or is


---------32:59----------
that difficult it's no that's that's a


---------33:01----------
gut in the gut where it you know


---------33:03----------
wrenches up and yeah you know it's like


---------33:06----------
you're nervous you're very you're you're


---------33:08----------
anxious you're okay what if this happens


---------33:12----------
but so your existential dread also makes


---------33:15----------
you feel things like physically in your


---------33:17----------
in your stomach or your gut is it


---------33:20----------
sometimes you know you know if I'm like


---------33:22----------
really nervous about something if I'm


---------33:24----------
like I'm like oh man I would really like


---------33:26----------
to do this thing and then I like you


---------33:27----------
know spend the whole day you know like


---------33:29----------
being a jackass and playing Ballarat


---------33:30----------
then I'll be like oh [ __ ] I should have


---------33:32----------
done that thing then I'll you know I'll


---------33:34----------
be anxious you know I'll have a like I


---------33:39----------
should have been doing something else


---------33:40----------
it's like you know I could have done


---------33:41----------
this I could have done that yeah and


---------33:44----------
then that's that's the gut feeling


---------33:46----------
that's the like the neurotic anxiety


---------33:48----------
feeling okay so I'm gonna call what you


---------33:51----------
just said there self judgement I'm not


---------33:54----------
gonna call that anxiety okay


---------33:56----------
yeah lots of self judgment okay right so


---------34:00----------
does that sort of make sense like like


---------34:03----------
you're not worried so there's like so


---------34:05----------
let's just look at that for a second so


---------34:07----------
let's go back to Michael in high school


---------34:10----------
is afraid of talking to someone because


---------34:12----------
he thinks they're going to look stupid


---------34:13----------
okay yeah so that is Michael being in


---------34:16----------
the present and looking into the future


---------34:18----------
got it self judgment is different


---------34:21----------
because it's Michael beating himself up


---------34:23----------
for the past yes okay yeah now there


---------34:27----------
could be a future component to that too


---------34:29----------
so I think I think about anxiety is


---------34:31----------
something that's forward facing and I


---------34:33----------
think about regret is something that's


---------34:35----------
backward facing sometimes you can look


---------34:39----------
at the past day and think about the


---------34:42----------
consequences for tomorrow yeah


---------34:45----------
absolutely


---------34:46----------
do you do that yeah okay so then that I


---------34:49----------
would classify as anxiety but I think


---------34:51----------
self judgment is


---------34:52----------
right so like self-judgement is like


---------34:55----------
looking at yourself and saying I didn't


---------34:57----------
do a good job I'm not good enough


---------34:59----------
okay and you would say that's different


---------35:01----------
from anxiety yes I would describe


---------35:04----------
anxiety as worrying about the future


---------35:06----------
okay I I think III probably the self


---------35:09----------
judgement is probably a proponent to it


---------35:11----------
it's like oh I [ __ ] this up maybe you


---------35:13----------
know the future might change due due to


---------35:15----------
it you know so so agree so there's like


---------35:18----------
this whole cesspool of all of this


---------35:20----------
negativity in all of our minds and so I


---------35:24----------
think it's but the point I'm making is


---------35:26----------
that if you can stop the self judgement


---------35:29----------
then your anxiety has less fuel okay I


---------35:33----------
think a fundamental reason like I don't


---------35:36----------
is because I associate self judgment


---------35:39----------
with like being better as like a person


---------35:42----------
you know it's like it's like oh I'm


---------35:44----------
gonna do that the next time all you know


---------35:45----------
did you [ __ ] this X thing better yes


---------35:49----------
so now we get to another really


---------35:50----------
important thing which is just like


---------35:52----------
everything else that I've described self


---------35:54----------
judgement serves a very important part


---------35:57----------
so I think the tricky thing about being


---------36:00----------
a human is that a lot of what is good


---------36:02----------
for us makes us suffer okay


---------36:08----------
self judgement discipline kind of type


---------36:10----------
beats absolutely right so like when I


---------36:12----------
have people so I work with some people


---------36:14----------
who are like very professionally


---------36:17----------
academically or financially successful


---------36:19----------
and boy do they beat the [ __ ] out of


---------36:22----------
themselves and it's part of the reason


---------36:25----------
that they beat the [ __ ] up that's why


---------36:27----------
they're successful so the reason that


---------36:29----------
like if you look at medical students


---------36:30----------
medical students are super super anxious


---------36:32----------
and highly neurotic actually neurotic is


---------36:34----------
a better term and the reason for that is


---------36:37----------
because like the reason they got into


---------36:39----------
Medical School in the first place is


---------36:40----------
because when other people were out


---------36:42----------
partying on a Friday night they were


---------36:43----------
afraid of doing poorly on the test they


---------36:45----------
were at home studying


---------36:46----------
so most professional success is


---------36:50----------
correlated with - there's this thing


---------36:53----------
called the five factor model of you


---------36:55----------
heard of it before no I'm okay so it's a


---------36:57----------
it's a well validated personality


---------36:59----------
structure that way has been


---------37:01----------
scientifically like studied quite


---------37:03----------
extensively and basically what they


---------37:05----------
found is that there are two


---------37:06----------
factors one is conscientiousness and one


---------37:09----------
is a neuroticism


---------37:11----------
yeah the higher you are in neuroticism


---------37:13----------
and conscientiousness the more


---------37:15----------
professionally successful oh that's


---------37:18----------
that's interesting that makes sense


---------37:20----------
what are awful little so how do you deal


---------37:23----------
with that because that sounds like a


---------37:24----------
very like desolate piece of the human


---------37:27----------
condition where it's like the more


---------37:28----------
neurotic and self judging you are the


---------37:30----------
more successful you become isn't that


---------37:32----------
like kind of awful yes so I think


---------37:36----------
desolate is a beautiful term to describe


---------37:38----------
their lives so so it's that they they


---------37:42----------
have a lot of success but their life


---------37:44----------
feels empty it's actually a very good


---------37:45----------
way to describe their lives so it's so


---------37:48----------
good Michael that I wonder if you have


---------37:50----------
experienced that yet you know for sure


---------37:53----------
where it's like yeah I've uh I taught


---------37:57----------
myself to it might have been the reason


---------37:59----------
I I taught myself to code in high school


---------38:01----------
was um it was worried well the reason


---------38:03----------
was because I needed a job afterwards so


---------38:07----------
you know I mentioned that I picked


---------38:09----------
between like psych and video editing and


---------38:11----------
Comp Sci and so I chose Comp Sci and I


---------38:14----------
taught myself how to do it in high


---------38:16----------
school and there was definitely like


---------38:17----------
neuroticism behind that like I sat in my


---------38:20----------
room for just like many weeks and months


---------38:23----------
and just you know studied one thing and


---------38:25----------
that's surely where that comes from but


---------38:29----------
you know I've you know I've been through


---------38:32----------
like the the gross like nine-to-five and


---------38:35----------
all that and it's like like I've


---------38:37----------
realized that you know


---------38:40----------
just like working constantly is a very


---------38:42----------
big pitfall you can fall into it's like


---------38:45----------
it feels safe but if you just focus only


---------38:49----------
on one thing it's it's detrimental to


---------38:52----------
you is like a human being


---------38:53----------
mm-hm so yeah I can I can agree that


---------38:55----------
that's where some of it comes from I've


---------38:57----------
been trying to do things different


---------39:00----------
that's actually something I've liked I I


---------39:03----------
think that's on my mind a lot it's like


---------39:05----------
the balance between like doing a lot of


---------39:06----------
work and not doing a lot of work and


---------39:09----------
like being a human being you know mm-hmm


---------39:12----------
yeah it's tough and I think I you know


---------39:15----------
it's a beautiful word I I'd never really


---------39:16----------
thought of it that way but their lives


---------39:18----------
really are desolate and I think that


---------39:20----------
just goes to show that I think you


---------39:22----------
understand more about we're talking


---------39:24----------
about them maybe you know because I


---------39:26----------
think that that you know your ability to


---------39:28----------
conjure that word comes from


---------39:31----------
understanding like if you think about


---------39:33----------
like how do we know what words to use


---------39:35----------
mm-hmm so like tons from understanding


---------39:38----------
yeah it stems from usually from


---------39:41----------
experience hmm okay so let's just can I


---------39:44----------
try to recap for a second and keep us


---------39:45----------
focused yeah okay so the first thought


---------39:48----------
is that there's you know there's


---------39:49----------
different kinds of anxiety right so


---------39:51----------
there's like maybe this existential


---------39:52----------
dread I'm not even gonna call that


---------39:54----------
anxiety for a second there's the


---------39:56----------
physiologic components of anxiety and


---------39:59----------
sometimes there are mental there's like


---------40:02----------
a neurotic kind of anxiety which is


---------40:04----------
worrying about the future there is self


---------40:07----------
judgment which can sort of feed anxiety


---------40:10----------
but it's not exactly the same as anxiety


---------40:12----------
uh-huh so self judgment is kind of


---------40:14----------
beating yourself up and then sometimes


---------40:16----------
in that process of beating yourself up


---------40:18----------
you start to worry more about the future


---------40:20----------
because the more of a piece of [ __ ] you


---------40:21----------
are the more bleak the future becomes


---------40:23----------
right but interestingly enough so those


---------40:26----------
two like self judgment and anxiety get


---------40:29----------
together they tango and the whole is


---------40:31----------
greater than the sum of its parts


---------40:32----------
mm-hm so one thing you can do is focus


---------40:35----------
on self judgment another thing you can


---------40:37----------
do is focus on being in the present


---------40:39----------
because anxiety is always future


---------40:40----------
thinking so if you are thinking about


---------40:43----------
the now you cannot be anxious yeah


---------40:46----------
actually that's only true for neurotic


---------40:47----------
anxiety if you have physiologic anxiety


---------40:49----------
you can be in the now and it you can


---------40:51----------
still be anxious because it's a physical


---------40:52----------
sense


---------40:53----------
yeah there's then also we kind of talked


---------40:58----------
about that and then the other thing that


---------41:00----------
you mentioned is that there are ways to


---------41:01----------
deal with it so one way to deal with it


---------41:04----------
is you put it as pushing away or


---------41:05----------
distraction great and another way to


---------41:08----------
deal with it is to learn how to sit with


---------41:10----------
it let it be a part of you not push it


---------41:11----------
away


---------41:12----------
and that seems to help so mm-hmm yeah


---------41:15----------
sounds like a pretty good summary of


---------41:17----------
what we've covered no good recap okay so


---------41:20----------
now let's go back to the existential


---------41:22----------
dread first of all any questions no no


---------41:26----------
no okay


---------41:27----------
so let me ask you something how long


---------41:29----------
have you felt the existential dread I


---------41:34----------
attached the word existential to it


---------41:36----------
because that's yeah maybe since probably


---------41:39----------
like around the start maybe the middling


---------41:41----------
of high school okay I think it's it


---------41:44----------
might have started with like how am I


---------41:45----------
gonna like survive after high school


---------41:47----------
because I'm very like I seek to be


---------41:50----------
self-sufficient I don't like to seek


---------41:52----------
help a lot so like I didn't I very much


---------41:55----------
didn't want to like rely on anyone after


---------41:58----------
you know becoming an adult getting out


---------42:01----------
in the world I need good you know why


---------42:03----------
not then it's just a personality trait I


---------42:07----------
have a you know hard time asking for


---------42:09----------
help


---------42:09----------
okay good aspects and bad aspects to it


---------42:12----------
okay so let me ask you something how


---------42:14----------
long have you been self-reliant what do


---------42:18----------
we mean self-reliant so like you said


---------42:19----------
how long have you not wanted to depend


---------42:22----------
on other people very long very I'd it's


---------42:25----------
I've wanted to be self-reliance and for


---------42:28----------
a long time okay can you tell me when


---------42:32----------
you started to feel that way you know I


---------42:34----------
can't really pinpoint it but it's


---------42:36----------
definitely like when I look back like a


---------42:39----------
lot of the like conflicts I've had like


---------42:41----------
like with parents for example like even


---------42:44----------
before high school


---------42:44----------
weird stemmed from and want to be


---------42:47----------
self-reliant right okay


---------42:49----------
so surely further back than high school


---------42:52----------
like it's just kind of been like a


---------42:54----------
personality trait that I've you know


---------42:56----------
recognized you know in the in retrospect


---------42:59----------
can I think first


---------43:01----------
yeah go for it


---------43:11----------
you


---------43:13----------
you


---------43:22----------
would you say that your existential


---------43:24----------
dread kind of feels like worrying that


---------43:27----------
you won't be able to take care of


---------43:29----------
yourself um yeah yeah yeah that's a good


---------43:33----------
way to put it


---------43:39----------
you


---------43:42----------
okay can I have another second to think


---------43:44----------
yeah


---------43:48----------
you


---------43:51----------
you


---------44:02----------
you


---------44:09----------
I'm trying to figure out what direction


---------44:10----------
to go and I won I'm relying on my mind


---------44:14----------
to generate some idea of certainty from


---------44:16----------
uncertainty do you see multiple paths


---------44:19----------
through it again


---------44:20----------
I do see multiple paths it helps that


---------44:23----------
we've been able to define your


---------44:24----------
existential dread because that's half


---------44:26----------
the problem I didn't think we would get


---------44:27----------
there I think about it a lot now the


---------44:39----------
problem that I have is I feel like I


---------44:41----------
know the answer I just don't know the


---------44:42----------
question hey you want to lead me


---------44:45----------
somewhere yep right I have a hypothesis


---------44:50----------
I just don't know how to investigate it


---------44:53----------
okay so the first thing that I want to


---------44:56----------
say is that so we've talked about


---------44:59----------
different kinds of ways to deal with


---------45:03----------
this right so there's existential dread


---------45:05----------
self-judgement amplifies things right so


---------45:08----------
that's like a multiplying effect there


---------45:12----------
are coping mechanisms like distraction


---------45:14----------
there are other sort of coping


---------45:16----------
mechanisms like acceptance maybe that's


---------45:18----------
not quite coping unclear whether coping


---------45:20----------
is the right word there but there are


---------45:22----------
ways to deal with people through math of


---------45:24----------
it


---------45:24----------
mm-hmm there are things that amplify it


---------45:27----------
we still have not gotten to where it


---------45:31----------
comes from and there's another question


---------45:33----------
which is can we actually yank it out


---------45:36----------
root and stem can we find where this


---------45:39----------
feeling originates and if we find its


---------45:42----------
origin does that help us in some way


---------45:44----------
okay a lot of questions those like six


---------45:47----------
questions on that sentence yeah I don't


---------45:51----------
know does finding the source of


---------45:53----------
something mean that it helps I think


---------45:55----------
maybe in some way maybe an understanding


---------45:57----------
right sure but you know just cuz you I


---------46:02----------
don't know it's a good example just cuz


---------46:04----------
you know you're the you know the the


---------46:07----------
fact that you have a cold doesn't mean


---------46:09----------
you don't have a cold anymore you can


---------46:11----------
understand it right but you stopped a


---------46:12----------
cold yeah I think it helps for


---------46:16----------
understanding or for treatment right if


---------46:18----------
you know I've yet you have a cold you go


---------46:20----------
and get you know sudafed or whatever


---------46:22----------
yeah I would agree so so that's why we


---------46:26----------
asked the question because let's not


---------46:27----------
make the assumption that discovering the


---------46:30----------
origin will fix it yeah one is does it


---------46:34----------
help uh yeah I think it yes ah hard to


---------46:39----------
say right this is sure it's not a cold


---------46:41----------
it's something else I think it's if at


---------46:46----------
the very least it's worth trying to get


---------46:49----------
to yeah so so let's do that and let's


---------46:52----------
see let's be scientific so let's not


---------46:54----------
make assumptions that this is going to


---------46:55----------
be helpful maybe it'll help maybe we can


---------46:58----------
find maybe it doesn't have an origin


---------47:00----------
maybe it does we don't know right so you


---------47:05----------
kind of said that the existential dread


---------47:06----------
is like and this is like you said


---------47:09----------
something about an anxiety about the


---------47:10----------
long general future of your life it is


---------47:13----------
that also like generally speaking could


---------47:15----------
I describe that as worrying about


---------47:17----------
whether you're gonna be able to take


---------47:18----------
care of yourself um in some kind of way


---------47:22----------
I like logically I I think with like I


---------47:26----------
think I'll always be able to I even if


---------47:30----------
worse comes to worse like I lose I get


---------47:32----------
like everything I don't know I get like


---------47:35----------
you know my credits stolen or whatever I


---------47:38----------
think from the ground up I will be able


---------47:41----------
to like come back from just about


---------47:44----------
anything great so I think that's a


---------47:46----------
really important point because that


---------47:48----------
tells us that that sensation of not


---------47:51----------
being able or worrying about taking care


---------47:53----------
of yourself doesn't come from logic no


---------47:56----------
no it's a logical hundred I have


---------47:57----------
accepted this absolutely it's I'm at a


---------48:00----------
point where like I I know that I could


---------48:03----------
you know like get a job you know doing


---------48:06----------
computer science somewhere and it's like


---------48:08----------
it's not rooted in logic absolutely not


---------48:11----------
you're still there yep so then we can


---------48:14----------
also acknowledge another interesting


---------48:15----------
consequence of that which is that there


---------48:17----------
are parts of our mind that are not do


---------48:20----------
not originate in logic okay so let's go


---------48:26----------
back to this so you said that a lot of


---------48:27----------
your conflict with your parents had to


---------48:28----------
do with like your desire to be


---------48:30----------
independent well it's more like I I


---------48:32----------
recognize that I have that desire to be


---------48:34----------
independent and I can go back and see


---------48:36----------
oh this was you know the this was why we


---------48:40----------
had this conflict and I'm like oh it's


---------48:42----------
is because we it's because I wanted to


---------48:43----------
be you know more independent and I


---------48:45----------
didn't give us an example it's it's like


---------48:48----------
oh okay I'm sure I in high school very


---------48:59----------
much wanted I decided to do you know


---------49:03----------
computer science and so I instead of so


---------49:06----------
I stopped paying attention to classes in


---------49:08----------
high school just like kind of just you


---------49:11----------
know I showed up did my thing sometime I


---------49:13----------
have like my computer and I was just


---------49:16----------
like I'm gonna learn one thing it's it's


---------49:17----------
computer science right so that you know


---------49:21----------
cause problems cuz you know your parents


---------49:22----------
obviously want you have good grades so


---------49:25----------
that caused a large conflict learn you


---------49:27----------
know we get in touch with a counselor


---------49:28----------
everyone's like stop doing this you know


---------49:31----------
pay attention in school but that's you


---------49:34----------
know that's an example of how I how did


---------49:37----------
you feel when you got taken to the


---------49:39----------
counselor oh you know I was a little


---------49:41----------
pissed right cuz I'm like man I just


---------49:42----------
want a job after high school like my


---------49:45----------
English class isn't really helping me


---------49:47----------
for for job security in the future at


---------49:51----------
least I knew I wasn't gonna be you know


---------49:52----------
a writer or anything so you know a


---------49:56----------
little mad but you know I I just kind of


---------49:59----------
ignored it yeah a little pissed right


---------50:02----------
you know yeah little pisses on you I'm


---------50:03----------
trying to do this thing for job security


---------50:04----------
but I understand like my mom is a first


---------50:07----------
generation Filipino immigrant my dad is


---------50:10----------
he is very nice but sometimes he's weird


---------50:13----------
like as a person and so like there's not


---------50:17----------
always like a huge level of


---------50:20----------
Understanding between me and my parents


---------50:21----------
cuz I don't know we different


---------50:25----------
backgrounds obviously it's you know we


---------50:27----------
still you know love each other obviously


---------50:29----------
you know but I kind of you know learned


---------50:33----------
to accept that we're not always gonna


---------50:36----------
see eye-to-eye on something and I just


---------50:38----------
you know I kept going with what I was


---------50:40----------
doing I was you know [ __ ] you guys I'm


---------50:42----------
gonna keep doing


---------50:45----------
so now we get to an interesting and my


---------50:49----------
mind I have an interesting


---------50:50----------
chicken-or-egg question which is like


---------50:53----------
does the existential dread of worrying


---------50:57----------
about not being able to take care of


---------50:58----------
yourself come from your independence or


---------51:02----------
does your independence come from from


---------51:08----------
yeah I don't know how to I'm gonna stop


---------51:10----------
that I I kind of I kind of got what yeah


---------51:12----------
I'm picking up what you're putting down


---------51:13----------
I don't you mean yeah I know I I have


---------51:15----------
the thought that yeah okay


---------51:17----------
and what do you think tick you late


---------51:20----------
[ __ ] a long round it doesn't really


---------51:22----------
matter but hmm very hard to say I don't


---------51:31----------
know why they have to be like mutually


---------51:33----------
exclusive I think they're related I'm


---------51:36----------
just trying to figure out so let me just


---------51:37----------
ask a different question um you said


---------51:40----------
that your dad is kind of a weird guy and


---------51:42----------
y'all have trouble seeing eye on things


---------51:45----------
he's nice


---------51:47----------
it's it's like he's a nice guy he is


---------51:49----------
nice my dad's nice sure but it's like we


---------51:55----------
do not we're very different people


---------51:59----------
mm-hmm I don't know how I became in that


---------52:02----------
like in my family very like strange


---------52:05----------
person and like in my family III thought


---------52:09----------
yes yeah but it's just now long have you


---------52:14----------
been a strange person in your family uh


---------52:17----------
you know pretty is the beginning yeah


---------52:20----------
what when I say strange it's not like


---------52:22----------
it's more like we're just kind of


---------52:25----------
fundamentally different people me and


---------52:27----------
you know the other would you say that


---------52:29----------
they don't understand you like to what


---------52:35----------
level of understanding me as a person I


---------52:41----------
I have some level of understanding it's


---------52:44----------
mostly they they do care about me that's


---------52:46----------
it's that at least I know I'm not I I


---------52:48----------
don't doubt that they're nice that they


---------52:50----------
love you and they care about


---------52:51----------
you've never suggested anything


---------52:54----------
suggesting there's a lot of luck yes


---------52:56----------
well what I see I got to put that


---------52:58----------
there so I don't sound like an [ __ ]


---------53:00----------
yeah so so good and I'm sorry I don't


---------53:03----------
mean to no III know I'm just I'm just


---------53:06----------
[ __ ] uh saying I know what you're


---------53:08----------
asking


---------53:09----------
i I don't maybe not fundamentally no I


---------53:11----------
think that's the answer you're looking


---------53:12----------
for no yeah I mean it's it's my


---------53:14----------
hypothesis but don't just give me the


---------53:16----------
answer I'm looking for it give me the


---------53:17----------
answer that's true no that's the answer


---------53:18----------
that's true I think you got it you got


---------53:20----------
it


---------53:21----------
okay so let me ask you something what


---------53:24----------
happens to a child who is not understood


---------53:26----------
they they do their own mean they go in


---------53:29----------
their own kind of adventure yeah and


---------53:33----------
they do go on their own adventure and


---------53:36----------
what does that mean about reliance on


---------53:37----------
other people I think that leads to


---------53:40----------
independence absolutely what does that


---------53:43----------
mean about reliance on other people huh


---------53:49----------
so so a child who becomes independent


---------53:53----------
how do they feel about relying on other


---------53:56----------
people oh I suppose you don't like it


---------54:00----------
right just realize is that yeah I think


---------54:06----------
in a way yeah so when you're super


---------54:09----------
passionate about something and you're


---------54:11----------
concerned about something and then you


---------54:14----------
get taken to a school counselor and


---------54:17----------
you're told that you should stop doing


---------54:20----------
what you're doing


---------54:21----------
did you feel like they weren't taking


---------54:23----------
your concerns seriously um I don't know


---------54:28----------
if it may be on some you know deeper


---------54:31----------
level not consciously it was I like they


---------54:33----------
don't understand like what I'm going for


---------54:36----------
not consciously but maybe on you know


---------54:38----------
like a some kind of yeah so now we get


---------54:41----------
to a basic problem of what we're doing


---------54:43----------
so I don't know how much I'm leading you


---------54:45----------
or pushing you in a direction cuz it's


---------54:47----------
starting to feel that way and also I


---------54:51----------
think the whole reason that it's not


---------54:54----------
conscious like I agree that it's not


---------54:56----------
conscious and that's why it's this weird


---------54:58----------
[ __ ] feeling of existential dread


---------54:59----------
that you haven't done a conscious


---------55:00----------
understanding of where it comes from


---------55:02----------
well right so it's it's tricky because


---------55:06----------
now we're getting into the territory


---------55:08----------
where maybe I'm putting words in your


---------55:09----------
mouth because I'm really eating you in a


---------55:11----------
particular


---------55:11----------
you're like hitting the nail on the head


---------55:13----------
just right I feel like leading me in a


---------55:15----------
direction exactly


---------55:17----------
or if I'm sticking a nail in it it's


---------55:20----------
hard for us to tell scientifically right


---------55:22----------
yeah yeah absolutely and um but I feel


---------55:26----------
like you know where I'm going and yeah


---------55:29----------
where do you think I'm going what do you


---------55:31----------
understand about my line of questions I


---------55:34----------
hey well I think your line of


---------55:36----------
questioning is trying to get to the


---------55:39----------
conclusion of where the dread comes from


---------55:41----------
right yep do you have any sense of what


---------55:43----------
my hypothesis is yeah it's somewhere


---------55:48----------
along the lines is you know different as


---------55:50----------
a child must provide for themselves or


---------55:53----------
not provide but you know it seeks into


---------55:55----------
great independence from that


---------55:56----------
independence comes a sense of dread


---------55:59----------
because you're the only reliance right


---------56:00----------
yeah is that kind of where your thinking


---------56:03----------
is yes is that how you feel Michael I


---------56:06----------
don't know are you leading me with


---------56:08----------
questions no I'm asking no I don't know


---------56:10----------
anymore now ai ai ai ai ai think yes I


---------56:23----------
think okay so let me ask you something


---------56:26----------
Michael and I want you to be careful


---------56:29----------
about your logical mind mm-hmm and try


---------56:32----------
to tap into your emotional mind Michael


---------56:34----------
do you feel alone sometimes I mean


---------56:40----------
everyone does sometimes is that the


---------56:42----------
feeling that we're talking about do you


---------56:45----------
feel like a lot like does the future of


---------56:48----------
your life and I know logically it


---------56:51----------
doesn't include just you but does it


---------56:53----------
feel like it's just you like you're the


---------56:55----------
only person you can count on can count


---------56:58----------
on from a feelings perspective yes yeah


---------57:03----------
I can be honest about that yeah like


---------57:05----------
sheer feeling no logic it's like I I


---------57:09----------
know they're like this you know a great


---------57:11----------
support group around me logically but


---------57:13----------
feelings wise right now it's like I know


---------57:15----------
at least I can always count on me right


---------57:17----------
yeah so now let me ask you something


---------57:20----------
okay so


---------57:22----------
not gonna ask I'm just gonna say okay so


---------57:24----------
I'm gonna stop asking leading questions


---------57:25----------
because I think I don't know how much


---------57:28----------
I'm biasing you I don't think I am I


---------57:30----------
think you're pretty good yeah but let me


---------57:34----------
let me run you through my hypothesis and


---------57:36----------
we can look at it as scientists so first


---------57:38----------
thing is like who worries about not


---------57:40----------
being able to take care of themselves


---------57:42----------
oddly enough you may think that it's


---------57:45----------
people who lack faith in themselves but


---------57:46----------
it's funny because that's not where that


---------57:48----------
comes from okay


---------57:50----------
the worry about not being able to take


---------57:53----------
care of yourself is built on an


---------57:56----------
assumption that other people are not


---------57:58----------
gonna be around as well okay yeah I know


---------58:01----------
I follow you


---------58:02----------
does that make sense yeah that's


---------58:04----------
actually where this comes from because


---------58:06----------
why do you live in a world where you are


---------58:08----------
the only person that you can rely on and


---------58:11----------
we see we see threads of that like in


---------58:15----------
your independence uh-huh like we see


---------58:18----------
that like this is part like I think the


---------58:20----------
reason that this existential dread is so


---------58:22----------
hard for you to understand is because I


---------58:25----------
think it formed it is it's a primitive


---------58:27----------
formation okay and the reason that's


---------58:29----------
primitive is because it was formed when


---------58:31----------
you were very young


---------58:32----------
okay so generally speaking when our mind


---------58:35----------
forms certain ideas about ourselves that


---------58:38----------
idea hairy's the maturity at which it


---------58:41----------
was born


---------58:43----------
okay so right so like if I if I sit down


---------58:46----------
and I draw a picture at the age of four


---------58:48----------
that picture stays that way


---------58:51----------
yeah it's a very young thought it's like


---------58:54----------
a very carnal thought right absolutely


---------58:56----------
concept right like that like you're just


---------58:58----------
like there's no one and then like if we


---------59:00----------
think about it so then my next thought


---------59:02----------
is that okay so you know who is it that


---------59:05----------
worries about not being able to take


---------59:07----------
care of themself there's a lack of


---------59:09----------
confidence we don't get any of that from


---------59:11----------
you I mean do you would you say you lack


---------59:12----------
confidence in yourself yes oh yes yeah


---------59:15----------
interesting here yeah


---------59:16----------
no I know I come off as like a confident


---------59:18----------
person I'm an incredibly unconfident


---------59:21----------
person okay


---------59:23----------
so maybe I just about entirely sohere's


---------59:26----------
because the reason I asked that question


---------59:27----------
is because now we have to we have to


---------59:29----------
question my assumptions so worrying


---------59:31----------
about not being able to take care of


---------59:32----------
yourself comes from two places one is a


---------59:35----------
lack of faith in yourself


---------59:36----------
okay and the second is a lack of faith


---------59:39----------
in others because you're the only person


---------59:41----------
that you can look like I just lack faith


---------59:43----------
across the board sure yeah and and


---------59:48----------
that's what happens to people when


---------59:49----------
they're young they have general swathes


---------59:52----------
of beliefs about the way that the


---------59:54----------
universe works and they those thoughts


---------59:56----------
stay that way they stay that way and


---------59:58----------
then as we grow old and we're mature


---------60:00----------
like we have logical things that tell us


---------60:02----------
because how old are you now Michael


---------60:05----------
twenty-two okay so you're 22 right so


---------60:09----------
you have 22 year-old logic that tells


---------60:11----------
you this is not [ __ ] that you have to


---------60:12----------
worry about yeah but there's like five


---------60:14----------
year old Michael who's like I can't


---------60:16----------
count on myself and I can't count on


---------60:17----------
anyone else and I think those are


---------60:19----------
actually related sick that's badass


---------60:21----------
that's so [ __ ] cool


---------60:22----------
how like I've never really thought about


---------60:24----------
that so do you personally do you ever


---------60:27----------
like replace those thoughts in your head


---------60:30----------
like say you have like a core


---------60:33----------
understanding about yourself that was


---------60:34----------
formed at a very young age do you is


---------60:36----------
like your goal to replace that with the


---------60:40----------
logic of an older smarter you or like


---------60:44----------
what what do you do about that you


---------60:47----------
personally like do you ever go back and


---------60:49----------
you're like I developed this worldview


---------60:51----------
young am I going to change it now how


---------60:54----------
does that work


---------60:57----------
can I ask a question before I answer


---------60:59----------
yours yeah sure you said that's badass


---------61:02----------
which is not the response I was


---------61:04----------
expecting oh it's cool it's that's cool


---------61:08----------
I like learning about this okay I like


---------61:14----------
it's interesting right what is


---------61:16----------
interesting about that concept of you


---------61:19----------
know you're young and you because I just


---------61:22----------
gained a little understanding about


---------61:23----------
myself right that's cool right okay so


---------61:27----------
now now Michael we're gonna rewind a


---------61:29----------
little bit


---------61:29----------
sorry I have a couple more questions I'm


---------61:31----------
a happy to answer yours okay so don't


---------61:32----------
let me get away from it I got it I'm


---------61:35----------
making a note so now we get to the


---------61:38----------
earlier question which is does


---------61:39----------
understanding help you remember they


---------61:41----------
asked this earlier so you've gained a


---------61:43----------
little bit of understanding do you think


---------61:46----------
it helps yeah yeah for sure okay ma'am


---------61:50----------
right do you remember what your earlier


---------61:51----------
answer was it was uncertainty absolute


---------61:56----------
yeah so now now we get to an even more


---------61:58----------
interesting question which is how on


---------62:01----------
earth are you saying for like like


---------62:03----------
literally ten minutes ago it was


---------62:05----------
uncertainty and now your answer is


---------62:07----------
literally for sure


---------62:08----------
let's have that now I have the reaction


---------62:12----------
to finding the root of that or or at


---------62:15----------
least so strand of in what way then I


---------62:17----------
feel like you've been helped because you


---------62:19----------
do feel you feel helped yeah well I feel


---------62:21----------
you know a level of understanding which


---------62:23----------
is in this case made me feel helped


---------62:26----------
right yeah so so let maybe we can


---------62:29----------
explore that down the road but I think


---------62:30----------
that in and of itself is gonna be part


---------62:32----------
of your answer so you have to understand


---------62:35----------
what has changed in you because


---------62:37----------
something just changed okay that'll help


---------62:39----------
us understand like the science of how


---------62:42----------
this [ __ ] works okay okay so we can


---------62:45----------
table that first maybe we can go back to


---------62:47----------
that because we still get to kind of go


---------62:48----------
back to existential Venza but if your


---------62:50----------
question was do I go back and and remap


---------62:53----------
the short answer is like absolutely okay


---------62:57----------
so here's the reason why so like when we


---------62:59----------
think about it like so man I just okay


---------63:05----------
I've always like wondered how that this


---------63:07----------
I call or that you know the the


---------63:09----------
psychologist psychologies there


---------63:11----------
no this is a call catch-22 oh yeah well


---------63:14----------
I think you know you know what I mean by


---------63:17----------
dr. kay


---------63:19----------
spam spam spam like a little little pep


---------63:23----------
og emote okay can I go into teaching


---------63:27----------
mode yeah do you understand how the [ __ ]


---------63:29----------
works


---------63:30----------
I'll tell you how it works


---------63:32----------
okay so it's funny I was teaching this


---------63:36----------
like an hour ago


---------63:39----------
geez huh really


---------63:41----------
to whom to our coaches so this is what I


---------63:44----------
teach our coaches um oh nice okay so


---------63:48----------
we're gonna try this let's see so you're


---------63:53----------
a question let me just make sure I


---------63:56----------
remember it okay so you're a question


---------64:01----------
hold on hold on a second let me just


---------64:04----------
think about what we're saying let me


---------64:10----------
think about how to teach this and help


---------64:12----------
you understand and I may just recap for


---------64:15----------
my own benefit if that's okay


---------64:17----------
yeah okay so something you just learned


---------64:21----------
something so like what just happened and


---------64:23----------
then your question was do I go back and


---------64:25----------
like reanalyze things from the past and


---------64:28----------
then does that help me in some way and


---------64:30----------
the answer is yes okay so here's what


---------64:32----------
I'd like to do I'd like to explain like


---------64:34----------
how that works in your mind okay so


---------64:36----------
there's the engineering portion of it


---------64:38----------
not necessarily like the psychology this


---------64:40----------
is more about like the science of the


---------64:42----------
mind all right so here's my general


---------64:46----------
hypothesis about somewhere along the way


---------64:48----------
you grew up and like your parents were


---------64:51----------
not able to like relate to you or


---------64:54----------
understand you in a way that made you


---------64:57----------
feel quite isolated it doesn't mean they


---------64:59----------
didn't love you yeah yeah and I think we


---------65:01----------
sort of hear that when you say like your


---------65:03----------
dad was kind of weird all right like


---------65:05----------
what does that mean that means that like


---------65:06----------
it's not that he's weird to you it's


---------65:09----------
that you're weird to him like weirdness


---------65:11----------
is like yeah a 2-person yeah yeah yeah


---------65:13----------
right so so there's some kind of


---------65:16----------
fundamental disconnection where I


---------65:18----------
suspect when you were young and we can


---------65:19----------
we can see if this is the case I mean


---------65:21----------
this is also one of those things that's


---------65:22----------
like it's probably true of everyone but


---------65:25----------
so you have to be careful about like


---------65:27----------
whether you have a story like this but


---------65:28----------
like I would suspect that in your past


---------65:31----------
there were several times when you were


---------65:33----------
quite young and like people did not


---------65:35----------
fundamentally like understand and this


---------65:38----------
school counselors story is a fantastic


---------65:41----------
example because you knew something that


---------65:43----------
was deeply important to you and


---------65:46----------
will told you you were [ __ ] wrong


---------65:47----------
that's how you feel alone when the


---------65:50----------
people who are supposed to help you and


---------65:52----------
support you and understand the way that


---------65:54----------
you feel tell you that you're [ __ ]


---------65:56----------
wrong for feeling that way and you new


---------65:57----------
start so they just don't understand like


---------66:00----------
they just don't understand it and you


---------66:03----------
just don't understand that hmm that is a


---------66:06----------
world where everyone speaks a language


---------66:07----------
that you don't speak okay and then the


---------66:10----------
world becomes a [ __ ] scary place and


---------66:13----------
the future becomes uncertain because you


---------66:16----------
know you're gonna screw up at some time


---------66:18----------
but people the reason that people have


---------66:19----------
faith in the future is not just because


---------66:22----------
of themselves it's because of the people


---------66:23----------
around mm-hmm now the interesting thing


---------66:27----------
there's another interesting so then the


---------66:29----------
world becomes a scary place and it's


---------66:31----------
hard to like have faith in the future


---------66:33----------
because you don't know if you can count


---------66:35----------
on people like that's what it comes down


---------66:37----------
to yeah and the future is filled with


---------66:40----------
dread like there's a general dread if


---------66:42----------
you live in a world where you can't


---------66:44----------
count on other people uh-huh


---------66:46----------
is that and I'm not trying to put words


---------66:49----------
in your mouth so please God say no and


---------66:51----------
it was helpful when you said yeah I


---------66:52----------
don't have any confidence in myself but


---------66:54----------
like I mean is that how you feel do you


---------66:56----------
feel like in the future when you think


---------66:58----------
about your future


---------66:59----------
is it a multiplayer game or is it a


---------67:01----------
single-player game I'm not talking about


---------67:03----------
what you think I'm talking about what


---------67:04----------
you feel I mean I think my world view of


---------67:11----------
it is like is that like it's always like


---------67:16----------
I can always depend on myself right and


---------67:19----------
any supplement to that is just like is a


---------67:21----------
bonus right yeah like being able to


---------67:24----------
depend on anyone else is like a great


---------67:26----------
bonus but sure it's not something that I


---------67:28----------
see is like like a hugely necessary


---------67:31----------
they're not not necessary no sorry not


---------67:34----------
saying it's like not necessary I want


---------67:37----------
other people in my life right yeah


---------67:39----------
here's what I'm hearing


---------67:41----------
okay what I'm hearing is it's it's not a


---------67:44----------
multiplayer game it's a single-player


---------67:45----------
game with NPCs ah that makes me sound


---------67:49----------
like an [ __ ]


---------67:51----------
yeah so we have to be careful Michael I


---------67:53----------
don't think you're an [ __ ] at all I'm


---------67:54----------
saying that I think that's the way


---------67:56----------
you're describing it right like because


---------67:57----------
it's not an [ __ ] it doesn't mean that


---------67:59----------
you don't care about


---------68:00----------
other people it doesn't mean that other


---------68:01----------
people care about you it's that there is


---------68:02----------
a corner of your mind that feels like at


---------68:05----------
the end of the day if other people are


---------68:07----------
around and they do nice things for me


---------68:09----------
that's supplemental it's extra but at


---------68:12----------
the core of the being like it's just you


---------68:15----------
yeah I think a good way of putting it as


---------68:18----------
like like I don't like there's not like


---------68:22----------
I don't rely


---------68:24----------
yeah like rely on yes other people first


---------68:27----------
survival yes I guess bringing it down to


---------68:30----------
it's like most big yeah thanks so so now


---------68:32----------
we get to another important point which


---------68:34----------
is where do people learn to not rely on


---------68:36----------
others own for survival because


---------68:38----------
generally speaking that's what we do


---------68:40----------
right like we rely yeah as for survival


---------68:42----------
yeah so my hypothesis is that this is a


---------68:46----------
learned thing for you for you you


---------68:48----------
learned at some point that you kind of


---------68:50----------
couldn't count on others because I think


---------68:52----------
you were young so you also like you may


---------68:54----------
be a genius and sometimes this happens


---------68:57----------
like I'm not saying that to like you


---------68:59----------
know like make you feel good about


---------69:01----------
yourself or anything but like yeah I


---------69:02----------
noticed that so one of my teachers once


---------69:04----------
told me that kids with high IQ or


---------69:12----------
actually special needs kids okay think


---------69:16----------
about that that's very interesting


---------69:18----------
you know actually I I'm like inclined to


---------69:21----------
agree with you for some people because I


---------69:25----------
definitely went to school some very


---------69:27----------
smart people who were just different


---------69:31----------
right


---------69:32----------
like genius I went to school awesome


---------69:33----------
like really smart people and some of


---------69:35----------
them were like


---------69:41----------
III guess mm not not normal but do you


---------69:45----------
know what I mean like yeah so but others


---------69:48----------
were like like different people you know


---------69:51----------
yeah so sorry smart yeah I think I think


---------69:54----------
what I the point there is that I think


---------69:56----------
that like kids who are smarter or just


---------70:00----------
think different it's not like I mean we


---------70:02----------
make smarter like we place a value


---------70:04----------
judgment and I want to steer clear of


---------70:05----------
value judges I don't think you're a bad


---------70:07----------
person I don't think you're an [ __ ]


---------70:08----------
in fact everything that I've heard about


---------70:10----------
you makes you sound like you're a


---------70:11----------
wonderful guy and and you know I I don't


---------70:14----------
think that you don't love your parents I


---------70:15----------
don't think your parents love you but I


---------70:17----------
think we have to look at the mind as


---------70:19----------
what it is and like try to not let our


---------70:23----------
judgments interfere with what we see


---------70:25----------
yeah and in my experience there are some


---------70:28----------
people who have like I think you're a


---------70:30----------
special needs kid and I don't mean that


---------70:33----------
in a bad way I mean I think you had


---------70:36----------
special needs growing up like I think


---------70:38----------
that when your program you when you're


---------70:42----------
teaching yourself to program in high


---------70:43----------
school because you're worried about a


---------70:45----------
job you have some needs that other


---------70:48----------
[ __ ] high school kids who are sure


---------70:50----------
that they're gonna be fine for the rest


---------70:52----------
of the life don't have okay I'm not


---------70:55----------
saying you're dumb or in fact I think


---------70:56----------
that that's a special need that comes


---------70:58----------
from I understand what you're trying


---------71:00----------
yeah I really do I got it so it's funny


---------71:03----------
what you put like that no but really


---------71:06----------
like it's like it blew my mind


---------71:08----------
when they were like and she's like you


---------71:09----------
know smart kids or special-needs kids


---------71:11----------
because they have special needs you


---------71:12----------
can't treat them like everyone else hmm


---------71:14----------
you know like yeah yeah you try in fact


---------71:18----------
if you try to treat them like everyone


---------71:20----------
else which is exactly what your parents


---------71:22----------
and your counselor did it's harmful


---------71:24----------
oh yeah it's a problem i I I think it it


---------71:27----------
a lot of it boils down to like the way


---------71:31----------
that we perceive what schooling in


---------71:35----------
general should be and how it you know I


---------71:37----------
I'm sure you have ADD you've had a


---------71:38----------
million talks about how schooling is


---------71:40----------
broken and it just benefits one type of


---------71:44----------
like learner one type of kid I think a


---------71:47----------
lot of that boils down to that because


---------71:49----------
I'm not I'm not very good at schooling


---------71:50----------
yet personally so the that's that


---------71:54----------
that supports your your idea yeah


---------71:56----------
because I I did very bad poorly in all


---------71:59----------
manner of school so yeah so I think so


---------72:04----------
kind of going back to your earlier


---------72:05----------
question about okay like what do we do


---------72:07----------
about it right so like like now do you


---------72:09----------
go back and you reprogram things


---------72:10----------
absolutely


---------72:11----------
so I'm sorry I'm bouncing around a


---------72:13----------
little bit is it okay if we go back to


---------72:15----------
that no no it's nothing yeah I go back


---------72:19----------
hey it works okay we were trying a new


---------72:23----------
format and I wasn't sure if it was gonna


---------72:27----------
work


---------72:27----------
but thankfully my are like producers and


---------72:31----------
our geniuses on the healthy gamer team


---------72:34----------
oh wow this is great


---------72:35----------
okay okay so here's the idea okay so the


---------72:40----------
first thing is we have different parts


---------72:41----------
of our mind okay so the first part of


---------72:43----------
our mind is called Manas and so this is


---------72:46----------
the emotional mind


---------72:48----------
and it is the part of our mind that


---------72:50----------
likes or dislikes


---------72:54----------
and it is the part of the mind that


---------72:56----------
reacts okay


---------72:58----------
so let me ask you this Michael what's


---------73:02----------
what's the most recent food that you


---------73:06----------
tried for the first time maybe some like


---------73:15----------
like like time was it what's just like a


---------73:19----------
new food that you tried maybe I think it


---------73:22----------
was like eel okay did you like it yeah


---------73:26----------
yeah it was pretty good I'm not a big i


---------73:28----------
member picky eater okay but I yeah it


---------73:31----------
was alright okay so let me ask you


---------73:34----------
something how long did it take you to


---------73:36----------
like it or dislike it um I don't


---------73:39----------
remember ever tasting it before this is


---------73:40----------
like my first recollection of trying you


---------73:42----------
know yes good just like just I bit into


---------73:45----------
it it was I I don't usually like seafood


---------73:49----------
so it had a little barrier to it but it


---------73:52----------
tasted good tastes like chicken how long


---------73:54----------
did it take you to like it or dislike it


---------73:57----------
few seconds even that long maybe maybe


---------74:04----------
one second right so it happened fast and


---------74:06----------
rightly mechanically one second yes yeah


---------74:08----------
like like okay so less than one second


---------74:10----------
okay and so if we think about you know


---------74:13----------
let's say like so the Manas tends to act


---------74:16----------
fence it's the first part of the mind so


---------74:18----------
it's usually zero to one second is when


---------74:20----------
the - activates so if we think about


---------74:22----------
liking or disliking something there's


---------74:24----------
nothing logical about it there's nothing


---------74:25----------
rational about it it's just like you put


---------74:28----------
it in your mouth and you're like then


---------74:29----------
it's good or that isn't good mm-hmm


---------74:31----------
similarly if we think about emotional


---------74:33----------
situations those two can be kind of you


---------74:37----------
know they tend to be instant so if you


---------74:39----------
like you know someone walks up to you


---------74:41----------
and you're in high school and you're


---------74:43----------
like you know someone's been bullying


---------74:44----------
you and you see them in the hallway your


---------74:47----------
emotional reaction happens like in less


---------74:49----------
than a second does that make sense yeah


---------74:52----------
and so then what happens is like


---------74:55----------
sometimes we'll have an emotional


---------74:56----------
reaction like you have the sense of


---------74:57----------
existential dread and then sometimes


---------75:00----------
you'll use your rational mind to try to


---------75:02----------
fight it okay did that make sense yeah


---------75:06----------
so I


---------75:07----------
but the your rational mind is so you say


---------75:10----------
you don't like Seaford


---------75:11----------
so did you fight a little battle with


---------75:13----------
yourself before you try to ill yeah


---------75:15----------
and so what were the two parts of your


---------75:18----------
mind how would you kind of describe it


---------75:20----------
you know like a guttural I don't like


---------75:23----------
seafood and then uh just try it for head


---------75:26----------
its food it's it's you know try


---------75:29----------
different foods experience new things


---------75:33----------
kind of kind of mean yeah man ate it


---------75:35----------
experience new things


---------75:39----------
okay mm-hmm so that the thing to notice


---------75:43----------
is that like I like this word got it oh


---------75:44----------
sure you're good with words Michael so


---------75:47----------
thank you it's cool


---------75:49----------
so the modest is kind of guttural it's


---------75:51----------
visceral and it's like reactionary and


---------75:53----------
then our booty which is so this is kind


---------75:56----------
of our emotional mind that's the other


---------75:57----------
way we can think about it and then our


---------76:01----------
booty is like our analytical mind or our


---------76:03----------
intellect


---------76:04----------
okay okay so then like you have this


---------76:07----------
little war where your Manas is like I


---------76:09----------
don't like it and then your buddies like


---------76:11----------
just try it man like experience new


---------76:12----------
things come on bro uh-huh and then they


---------76:15----------
fight a little war and then depending on


---------76:17----------
you know which one wins you'll either


---------76:20----------
try the eel or you won't try that you


---------76:21----------
okay so the interesting thing is like so


---------76:26----------
how well-developed do you think your


---------76:28----------
Whoopi is when you're given not not at


---------76:32----------
all not absolutely at all how well


---------76:33----------
develop do you think your Manas is when


---------76:35----------
you're young all the way not not all the


---------76:38----------
way but it is in control yep and so else


---------76:41----------
you get older Manas may say roughly the


---------76:43----------
same but would be changes over time okay


---------76:46----------
that's the difference between old and


---------76:48----------
young mm-hmm


---------76:49----------
okay and so the interesting thing is


---------76:52----------
that you know the the thoughts and


---------76:54----------
impressions that are laid down in the


---------76:56----------
mind at a young age are gonna be like


---------76:58----------
lobe with deep thoughts they're not


---------77:00----------
gonna be like nuanced or understood


---------77:02----------
they're gonna be like so the existential


---------77:04----------
dread is that like a mana sort of would


---------77:07----------
be thing


---------77:07----------
sounds like a Manas thing absolutely


---------77:10----------
right so it's like just this like raw


---------77:12----------
sort of got a little beautiful word sort


---------77:16----------
of sense within you so now I'm going to


---------77:21----------
run you through a couple examples so


---------77:23----------
let's say that so this is my favorite


---------77:28----------
example and I'm trying to come up with


---------77:29----------
another one but we're gonna choose this


---------77:32----------
one because that's the best one I can


---------77:33----------
think of so let's say that I'm walking


---------77:35----------
down the street with my four-year-old


---------77:36----------
and she sees a dog and she pets the dog


---------77:42----------
and the the dog kind of turns around


---------77:44----------
like nips at her a little bit


---------77:46----------
mmm-hmm what do you think the first


---------77:47----------
thing that happened what's the first


---------77:49----------
thing that happens in her mind fear dab


---------77:51----------
SOG bad right fear don't know okay so


---------77:57----------
that's her - reacts with from zero to


---------78:00----------
one side and then what's the next thing


---------78:02----------
that happens in her mind dog bad okay


---------78:10----------
it's funny I had the same problem


---------78:11----------
teaching with this example earlier


---------78:13----------
because most of the people that we teach


---------78:14----------
don't our kids so what does my dog do


---------78:18----------
probably seeks refuge with her parents


---------78:21----------
absolutely seeks refuge with their


---------78:23----------
parents is such a you know


---------78:24----------
twenty-two-year-old thing to say what


---------78:26----------
does she actually do


---------78:28----------
cries and hugs or a father or mother


---------78:31----------
absolutely hogs daddy picked me up


---------78:34----------
mm-hmm so this is a thought right she


---------78:42----------
tells me daddy picked me up she holds up


---------78:43----------
her ops mm-hmm so at this point this is


---------78:46----------
actually her booty but it's like not


---------78:50----------
very well developed okay okay and then


---------78:53----------
so so then what happens is like I say oh


---------78:56----------
you know like I check her out turns out


---------78:58----------
that you know the dog was just sniffing


---------79:00----------
her wasn't actually biting her and then


---------79:02----------
she cries I comfort her a little bit and


---------79:05----------
then I say oh look there's an ice-cream


---------79:06----------
shop do you want some ice cream and then


---------79:08----------
she says yes


---------79:09----------
ten minutes later she's got ice cream in


---------79:12----------
her hands and what's going on in her


---------79:14----------
mind she is happy with the afternoon


---------79:18----------
absolutely and what kind of thoughts is


---------79:20----------
she having do you think um not about the


---------79:24----------
dog absolutely she's just having normal


---------79:27----------
thoughts she's telling me about him


---------79:29----------
buying the ice cream you know she's


---------79:31----------
eating eating the ice cream she's


---------79:33----------
telling me about this picture that she


---------79:35----------
colored she's telling me about like you


---------79:37----------
know how she's like played with the ball


---------79:39----------
yesterday just like normal thoughts yeah


---------79:42----------
okay so now let me ask you something


---------79:46----------
Mike Michael where did these feelings go


---------79:52----------
the the feelings about the dog mm-hmm


---------79:55----------
are they gone no they probably


---------79:58----------
manifested and some they're probably she


---------80:03----------
remembers them right sure like in some


---------80:06----------
way she has a fear the next time she


---------80:09----------
sees a dog she'll probably been reckless


---------80:11----------
exactly right so the next time she sees


---------80:14----------
a dog so the next day we're walking down


---------80:15----------
the street she sees a dog what happens


---------80:18----------
in her mind


---------80:21----------
the dog bit me last time that's not the


---------80:24----------
first thing that happens in her mind is


---------80:27----------
it fear absolutely hmm right so she


---------80:31----------
freaks the [ __ ] out and if you guys have


---------80:34----------
like dealt with kids who are scared of


---------80:35----------
dogs


---------80:36----------
like you know it like all they have to


---------80:37----------
do is just see the dog yeah and then


---------80:40----------
they start freaking out there mm-hmm


---------80:42----------
right and so the question is like where


---------80:45----------
does that fear come from from that


---------80:49----------
previous experience so where did the


---------80:51----------
fear go between here and here somewhere


---------80:57----------
in her head right absolutely so this


---------81:00----------
gets stored in her unconscious mind is


---------81:03----------
something called a sauce sky some sky


---------81:06----------
some sky


---------81:08----------
si M s ka ra so this is a ball of


---------81:14----------
undigested emotion okay okay and so now


---------81:22----------
let's think about you so let's say Mike


---------81:24----------
Michael you're going down the street and


---------81:29----------
you see a dog and you pet the dog and


---------81:32----------
the dog bites you what's the first thing


---------81:34----------
that happens in your line ow dog bad a


---------81:38----------
fear fear fear fear right okay so then


---------81:41----------
then you have a thought your first thing


---------81:43----------
is a reaction dog bat and then what


---------81:47----------
happens in your mind


---------81:54----------
the reaction move away from the dog sure


---------81:57----------
you move away you mean after that yep


---------82:02----------
what comes after that what do you think


---------82:05----------
after you move away from the dog


---------82:10----------
dog bad I hate Sherlock okay all right


---------82:14----------
um I don't know what comes after that so


---------82:21----------
like you may check to see if you're hurt


---------82:23----------
okay right and then you may like start


---------82:27----------
to think about the situation yes


---------82:29----------
like what kind of thoughts would you


---------82:31----------
have about the situation I wonder whose


---------82:35----------
dog that was that I just went up in pet


---------82:36----------
and bit me yeah wonder if I need to go


---------82:40----------
to the hospital for a rabies shot


---------82:41----------
yep um but why did the dog bite me yep


---------82:48----------
no lots of thoughts yep and then how are


---------82:52----------
you feeling in ten minutes


---------82:54----------
probably okay I'm probably chillin


---------82:57----------
mm-hmm okay and then you're feeling


---------83:01----------
feeling okay great so now


---------83:06----------
the next time you see a dog since I


---------83:11----------
probably since I you know more developed


---------83:14----------
I will think that is not the same dog


---------83:17----------
unless it is in which case it's an


---------83:19----------
[ __ ] and what's what's the first


---------83:21----------
thing that happens in your mind oh


---------83:22----------
probably again fear yep and then what


---------83:26----------
happens


---------83:30----------
if it's not the same dog I may try to


---------83:33----------
pet it again okay hold on hold on is it


---------83:37----------
the same dog yeah if it is that's a


---------83:41----------
problem right but that's a thought


---------83:44----------
yeah yeah so now like even though you


---------83:47----------
get this some degree of fear your


---------83:49----------
response to it is different right so


---------83:52----------
this is like lower fear got it so the


---------83:55----------
question is like why does my daughter


---------83:58----------
react with essentially the same amount


---------84:00----------
of fear and you react with last year


---------84:03----------
that is your question


---------84:05----------
yep my worldview is different from it


---------84:10----------
okay so what changes


---------84:12----------
why is your worldview different from her


---------84:14----------
worldview because I understand it's not


---------84:17----------
the same unless it is the same dog in


---------84:19----------
which case why okay so what do you say I


---------84:21----------
understand what part of the mind and


---------84:24----------
we're in this process does your


---------84:25----------
understanding come from the booty right


---------84:30----------
is that absolutely trying to go for all


---------84:32----------
right so this is also the part of the


---------84:35----------
process that's different right here


---------84:39----------
okay so like what you do here is some


---------84:42----------
amount of processing okay you like you


---------84:45----------
essentially go from fear to feeling okay


---------84:48----------
and what's in the middle is this so you


---------84:53----------
kind of like process with yourself and


---------84:55----------
then you're kind of like okay maybe I


---------84:56----------
shouldn't pet dogs on the street you


---------84:58----------
kind of work through the problem and


---------85:01----------
then you're feeling okay and then you


---------85:03----------
may still have a visceral reaction but


---------85:06----------
then you're not gonna like it's not


---------85:08----------
gonna be exactly the same


---------85:09----------
whereas for her like this this step it's


---------85:12----------
the ten second to ten minute that I did


---------85:15----------
what what did I do for her you went and


---------85:19----------
got ice cream afterwards right a


---------85:21----------
structure right so this is processing


---------85:27----------
these are the important questions if you


---------85:31----------
don't have a chance to like sit down and


---------85:33----------
think about what happened to you and


---------85:34----------
what you did right and what you did


---------85:36----------
wrong and what the dog is then you


---------85:42----------
wouldn't you may let be left over with a


---------85:45----------
some scar but when you use distraction


---------85:47----------
or like a parent you know like you know


---------85:49----------
distracts you from it then that fear


---------85:51----------
basically goes dormant is this some spar


---------85:53----------
and then rises up again okay if you


---------85:56----------
treat it with distraction if you treat


---------85:59----------
it with distraction and this is what


---------86:01----------
we'll call processing


---------86:06----------
okay okay so now we think about now we


---------86:09----------
go back to your earlier question which


---------86:11----------
was do I go back and think about stuff


---------86:13----------
that happened to me when I was young


---------86:15----------
abso-fucking-lutely


---------86:16----------
okay and what I do as an adult is this I


---------86:20----------
add this step over here um so I recall


---------86:26----------
and experience all I'll tell you one so


---------86:28----------
this two makes my dad sound like kind of


---------86:30----------
an [ __ ] but he's not nestlé he's a


---------86:32----------
great guy huh


---------86:33----------
so when I was 13 I started a business


---------86:36----------
God and what I did is I started a BBS


---------86:38----------
you know what that is nope so a BBS is


---------86:41----------
something called a bulletin board system


---------86:42----------
so this is in the days before the


---------86:44----------
internet you got a dial-up connection


---------86:46----------
and you had a server and what would


---------86:48----------
happen is like people would use their


---------86:49----------
dial-up connection to call your house it


---------86:52----------
would connect to your computer which was


---------86:53----------
a server I mean and your server like you


---------86:56----------
had some persistent thing so people


---------86:58----------
could log on to like my server and they


---------87:01----------
can play different kinds of games they


---------87:03----------
could post on forums they could post


---------87:05----------
like pictures and things like that


---------87:06----------
that's gonna they had to log off but


---------87:08----------
only one user could log on time oh wow


---------87:11----------
okay well that's cool all right and


---------87:13----------
that's like the early days of the


---------87:14----------
internet before it was like a persistent


---------87:16----------
universe like you had to log on to one


---------87:18----------
person server and you had to interact


---------87:19----------
with them yeah yeah and so I ran a BBS


---------87:22----------
and I charged people $10 a month which


---------87:24----------
was a ridiculous amount of money back


---------87:26----------
then for access to my BBS and I had like


---------87:28----------
13 people


---------87:30----------
I started $10 a week and then I had 13


---------87:32----------
people that would be like users on my


---------87:34----------
BBS and I was making 130 bucks a week


---------87:36----------
back in like 19 like 94 or something so


---------87:41----------
after a couple and the interesting thing


---------87:43----------
so I was lucky enough to have parents


---------87:45----------
who were wealthy and so I never really


---------87:47----------
like needed money for anything like I


---------87:49----------
never had an allowance or whatever my


---------87:50----------
grades were good I got whatever I wanted


---------87:52----------
my grades were bad I didn't get whatever


---------87:54----------
I wanted all I ever wanted was video


---------87:56----------
games so it was like sort of simple I


---------87:58----------
wasn't like period materialistic I just


---------88:00----------
yeah and so I had kind of like Tiger


---------88:03----------
parents who were like sort of like yeah


---------88:04----------
you can't play games unless you're


---------88:05----------
you're great you're gonna do so I think


---------88:08----------
selected ton up like so I knew money was


---------88:10----------
good but I don't really have any use for


---------88:11----------
money so I just the wad of cash I'm like


---------88:12----------
hundreds of dollars just like sitting


---------88:15----------
somewhere not like I did it but one day


---------88:17----------
like my dad found


---------88:18----------
and then like he comes to me he's like


---------88:21----------
what is this and then I told him that


---------88:25----------
Ivan started a business and then he said


---------88:28----------
can you any idea what he said how did he


---------88:32----------
ask if you were selling drugs yeah so I


---------88:35----------
explained what the business was good


---------88:36----------
yeah okay and he was not impressed with


---------88:41----------
the business yeah so it's funny right so


---------88:44----------
actually I think he was impressed and he


---------88:46----------
still shot it down he was like I


---------88:48----------
shouldn't be doing this right now you


---------88:50----------
shouldn't be focusing on your studies


---------88:51----------
but I remember now that he was kind of


---------88:53----------
smiling when he said it because he could


---------88:55----------
tell that I was a clever kid but he


---------88:57----------
still shut it down and he took my money


---------88:59----------
away the money you had no value to me


---------89:01----------
but he took it away and so I was like


---------89:03----------
okay well I guess like you know whatever


---------89:05----------
hmm and so years later I I was I guess I


---------89:10----------
still AM so I was a faculty at a


---------89:12----------
particular academic institution and


---------89:14----------
there was someone at the academic


---------89:16----------
institution who had been very supportive


---------89:18----------
for me so they had actually been like


---------89:21----------
supportive to me when I was a medical


---------89:22----------
student and they even like you know were


---------89:26----------
supportive to me in terms of figuring


---------89:28----------
out where I went to become a


---------89:29----------
psychiatrist and so they really like


---------89:31----------
they've been nothing but nice and then I


---------89:34----------
had started to develop something at a


---------89:36----------
hospital that I was at that was like


---------89:38----------
pretty good and pretty robust and was


---------89:40----------
doing very well


---------89:41----------
and for some reason I became paranoid


---------89:43----------
that like this person was gonna try to


---------89:45----------
take credit for it and it was really


---------89:48----------
really bizarre but like it's like it's


---------89:50----------
what worried me and I was I was going


---------89:52----------
through some training slash and part of


---------89:54----------
that training was to kind of be in my


---------89:56----------
own therapy and so I was I was talking


---------89:59----------
with someone who's who is a therapist


---------90:01----------
and we were kind of talking about


---------90:03----------
they're like okay so just pick something


---------90:04----------
so that you know we can work on it and I


---------90:07----------
said okay well this is what's bothering


---------90:09----------
like I'm afraid that this guy's gonna


---------90:10----------
like take credit for my work and as we


---------90:12----------
dug into it I realize like this is


---------90:13----------
completely idiotic the guy has done


---------90:15----------
nothing but be supported for years why


---------90:18----------
on earth do I think that he's gonna take


---------90:21----------
something that's mine and what we kind


---------90:24----------
of came down to is like oh I have this


---------90:26----------
some scar are people who are like


---------90:29----------
positive figures in my life taking away


---------90:32----------
I have built I and it's really bizarre


---------90:36----------
because like no one had ever triggered


---------90:37----------
this before because the person has to be


---------90:39----------
like in order for my mind to associate


---------90:42----------
this situation with what happened to me


---------90:45----------
in the past


---------90:46----------
uh-huh like they have to meet certain


---------90:48----------
requirements right like it can't be a


---------90:50----------
cat it has to whoa yeah yeah it needs a


---------90:53----------
bit like a like your father like someone


---------90:55----------
you trust no exactly someone I trust


---------90:57----------
someone who cares about me and I'm


---------90:59----------
building something that is wildly


---------91:01----------
successful and then they're gonna take


---------91:03----------
it away because this is what happens cuz


---------91:05----------
that's how the brain learns mm-hmm


---------91:07----------
because my brain learned hey when these


---------91:09----------
things happen you get [ __ ] so watch


---------91:12----------
out because you're gonna get [ __ ] and


---------91:15----------
so now we get to your question which is


---------91:17----------
do you go back and do you analyze it and


---------91:20----------
the answer is absolutely okay because if


---------91:24----------
you want your source of existential


---------91:26----------
dread to go away I'm glad you feel


---------91:28----------
helped by it


---------91:29----------
okay I'm gonna switch back to the other


---------91:32----------
layout do you have questions about this


---------91:35----------
format or


---------91:36----------
like anything that were mad I mean sorry


---------91:38----------
questions about the diagrams or any of


---------91:40----------
those terms or anything


---------91:42----------
sorry I've we've been using diagrams oh


---------91:46----------
[ __ ] man I just I'm watching you talk


---------91:52----------
about your subs guys the last 25 likes


---------91:58----------
cool all over Oh see there's a soft


---------92:01----------
start what Dyke okay here let me show


---------92:04----------
you oh god I'm so sorry Mike come on let


---------92:09----------
me do this oh god I screwed up hold on


---------92:15----------
okay hold on I will rectify it oh [ __ ]


---------92:20----------
so everyone watching at home knows this


---------92:22----------
because I've been doing diagrams okay


---------92:24----------
I'm glad that they got this okay sure


---------92:27----------
this okay there I've been writing I've


---------92:32----------
been taking down oh wow okay so let me


---------92:34----------
let me run through this real quick okay


---------92:35----------
let's let's catch up my politics can you


---------92:37----------
see this now it's fine yes I can see


---------92:39----------
this okay okay well thing okay


---------92:43----------
so here's the first thing so between


---------92:45----------
zero and one second you know the -


---------92:47----------
happens first


---------92:48----------
so it's emotional it as likes and


---------92:51----------
dislikes it reacts its guttural the


---------92:54----------
booty is analytical and it this was kind


---------92:57----------
of the war that we talked about between


---------92:59----------
oh you don't like seafood and then you


---------93:00----------
were telling yourself just try it yeah


---------93:02----------
okay


---------93:03----------
so then we get to the first scenario


---------93:04----------
which is my daughter so this is daughter


---------93:06----------
mm-hmm so in the first second between


---------93:10----------
zero and one second we have - okay so


---------93:15----------
this is - and then we have thoughts


---------93:19----------
after that so this is where would the


---------93:21----------
activates okay wow dude you're a boss if


---------93:25----------
you were following this without seeing


---------93:27----------
the diagrams you know it might have been


---------93:28----------
easier like I'm not I'm not great at


---------93:31----------
looking at diagrams okay I kind of like


---------93:34----------
the personal rhetoric style sure okay so


---------93:38----------
then what happens is distraction right I


---------93:40----------
give her ice cream and then she's happy


---------93:41----------
and then what happens is this fear lives


---------93:45----------
in the some unconscious as a some scar


---------93:47----------
and that it emerges the next time we see


---------93:50----------
a dog right and in your case this part


---------93:54----------
is the same this part is the same but


---------93:59----------
then you're booed these steps in in this


---------94:00----------
critical step and helps you process and


---------94:03----------
then you end up feeling okay and then


---------94:07----------
the next time you see a dog you still


---------94:10----------
have that reaction but then you don't


---------94:12----------
freak out again because you've sort of


---------94:14----------
processed some of that emotion so


---------94:15----------
there's some scar is smaller


---------94:17----------
okay got it does that make sense yeah


---------94:19----------
okay we're gonna go back to this and


---------94:24----------
then we're gonna do this and then we're


---------94:27----------
gonna do this okay sorry about not


---------94:29----------
showing you the diagram it's not as fun


---------94:31----------
so you asked me a question do I go back


---------94:34----------
and re-examine things that happen to me


---------94:36----------
in my life and the answer is absolutely


---------94:37----------
yes


---------94:38----------
okay can you and what happened back to


---------94:41----------
yourself huh I'm just looking at myself


---------94:43----------
right now


---------94:43----------
oh very introspective mirror cut I'm


---------94:46----------
sorry I think so now what what I would


---------94:51----------
encourage you to do is to think a little


---------94:52----------
bit about like you know where this sense


---------94:54----------
so this is what you've got to do is like


---------94:56----------
go bet I can


---------94:57----------
think about like times in your life


---------94:59----------
where you felt a lot and you felt like


---------95:02----------
the only person you could rely on was


---------95:07----------
yourself mm-hmm because I can I would


---------95:09----------
bet money that that's the way that you


---------95:11----------
felt when you got walked into the


---------95:13----------
counselor's office


---------95:14----------
yeah I'm sure yeah right yeah and and so


---------95:17----------
like that strengthens the some scar


---------95:19----------
that's like you being bit by the dog the


---------95:21----------
second time and so the reason that your


---------95:24----------
feeling of existential dread is so


---------95:26----------
pervasive is because you've been bit by


---------95:28----------
a dog hundreds of times okay and so


---------95:32----------
you're some scar is quite large now and


---------95:34----------
you have it lives with you all the time


---------95:37----------
doesn't even need a trigger it's just


---------95:39----------
like there all the time okay and I'm


---------95:41----------
sure you can imagine that if you've been


---------95:43----------
bit by a dog hundreds of times you don't


---------95:45----------
even need to see a dog to feel anxious


---------95:47----------
about nothing yeah it's just like there


---------95:50----------
could be a dog yeah and and so I would


---------95:54----------
encourage you to think back like you


---------95:56----------
know can you imagine can you remember


---------95:57----------
the first time that you felt like your


---------96:00----------
parents like you couldn't count on your


---------96:02----------
parents and I know we're making him


---------96:07----------
sound like [ __ ] I'm not saying


---------96:08----------
they're [ __ ] I know my dad was a


---------96:10----------
good person but everyone winds up with


---------96:12----------
some scars that's just how it works it's


---------96:14----------
because our mind is not well formed


---------96:15----------
mm-hm can't thing back that I don't know


---------96:21----------
I get I had a similar experience to you


---------96:24----------
where I started a small business not as


---------96:26----------
smart I was selling sodas at school but


---------96:29----------
they shut that down very similar


---------96:31----------
actually I don't think that's it though


---------96:34----------
I don't know I can't think back to so


---------96:40----------
tell me about your dad being weird


---------96:42----------
he's just he's funny in social


---------96:45----------
situations with other people


---------96:47----------
definitely


---------96:50----------
he's a you know like is he funny with


---------96:54----------
you when you say what do you mean by


---------96:59----------
funny


---------97:00----------
whatever you mean by fun what do I mean


---------97:02----------
by funny yeah he said he's funny with


---------97:05----------
other people in social situations I like


---------97:07----------
what about like I don't think he he's


---------97:10----------
not very good at social norms like when


---------97:13----------
talking to people okay okay that's


---------97:16----------
that's what I mean by funny um yeah


---------97:19----------
that's what I mean by weird it's not


---------97:21----------
like now I'm never gonna social queues


---------97:23----------
okay okay oh it's not in the way I think


---------97:28----------
okay so that's a whole other


---------97:30----------
conversation so I think that makes sense


---------97:32----------
in terms of some of your self-reliance


---------97:35----------
because it sounds like there may be some


---------97:38----------
so a lot of confidence comes from


---------97:41----------
empathic mirroring okay so if we think


---------97:45----------
about something else to mirror from huh


---------97:47----------
like from something else


---------97:50----------
mirror yeah so like the way that a child


---------97:52----------
learns to move confidently in the world


---------97:54----------
basically has to do with how secure they


---------97:57----------
feel with their parents and how secure


---------98:00----------
they feel with their parents depends


---------98:02----------
roughly on how much their parents impact


---------98:06----------
like a mirror their emotions okay so


---------98:09----------
when when a child like like like the


---------98:12----------
world is a safe place when I bump my


---------98:14----------
head and I hurt and my parents run over


---------98:18----------
and scoop me up and express concern then


---------98:21----------
the world like becomes a safe place


---------98:24----------
because when I'm hurt there are people


---------98:26----------
there that express concern and like that


---------98:29----------
makes sense because the world reacts the


---------98:31----------
way that I feel


---------98:32----------
oh that sort of makes sense yeah yeah


---------98:34----------
absolutely and and so a lot of times


---------98:36----------
confidence happens when conference


---------98:39----------
problems happen when there are parents


---------98:40----------
who can't mirror what a child's


---------98:42----------
emotional needs are because then the


---------98:44----------
world becomes a confusing place where


---------98:46----------
shockingly the only person you can rely


---------98:48----------
on is yourself


---------98:49----------
uh-huh because the rest of the world


---------98:51----------
doesn't get ya the rest of the world


---------98:54----------
doesn't react the way you feel yeah I


---------98:55----------
see what you mean and so then you become


---------98:58----------
a pillar it becomes a single-player game


---------99:00----------
and you can't count on other people


---------99:02----------
okay so I wonder a little bit about you


---------99:07----------
know whether that plays into this


---------99:08----------
because you're saying that your dad


---------99:10----------
doesn't like pick up on social cues so


---------99:13----------
also then yeah I mean unclear it's just


---------99:16----------
another piece that could contribute yeah


---------99:20----------
so that by the way is attachment theory


---------99:23----------
if you're interested in reading like


---------99:24----------
attachment theory sort of talks about


---------99:26----------
like how security from a child comes


---------99:29----------
from empathic mirroring of parents


---------99:31----------
that's that arresting okay yeah so in


---------99:34----------
terms of practically what do you so


---------99:36----------
questions for me actually let's start


---------99:37----------
there no not really


---------99:41----------
okay so let me try to give you like so


---------99:43----------
you're one of your questions is like


---------99:45----------
okay maybe I don't know if this is only


---------99:47----------
your question but what do I do about it


---------99:48----------
okay yeah that's a good standard yeah


---------99:51----------
yeah so I would say that you know try to


---------99:54----------
notice that feeling of X is Central grad


---------99:56----------
whenever it's there and find out first


---------99:58----------
of all analyze it with your would be


---------100:00----------
because the more you analyze it with


---------100:01----------
your buddy I mean not just accept and


---------100:04----------
sometimes analysis involves like sitting


---------100:06----------
with it too but really like re


---------100:08----------
experiencing it and then like be a


---------100:11----------
shepherd for yourself okay so imagine


---------100:14----------
that there's like six year old Michael


---------100:16----------
or 13 year old Michael who's getting


---------100:18----------
taken into the counselor's office mm-hmm


---------100:21----------
and imagine the way that you felt and


---------100:23----------
then imagine that there's like


---------100:24----------
twenty-two year old Michael who's like


---------100:26----------
older and can be reliable and if nothing


---------100:30----------
else if you can't rely on anyone else


---------100:31----------
you can at least rely on 22 year old


---------100:33----------
Michael okay yeah and 22 year old


---------100:36----------
Michael is like gonna go back and tell


---------100:38----------
13 year old hey man like I know a lot of


---------100:39----------
people don't understand you bro and I


---------100:42----------
know you feel alone and isolated but


---------100:44----------
like it's okay and you're gonna be okay


---------100:45----------
and you don't have to be alone in this


---------100:47----------
world and there are people that love you


---------100:49----------
mm-hmm okay how do you feel about that


---------100:53----------
I like that like being your own kind of


---------100:56----------
pillar to mirror back on yeah yeah okay


---------100:59----------
I like this so when you think about when


---------101:02----------
you feel that way that feeling of


---------101:04----------
existential dread see if you can do that


---------101:07----------
with yourself or see if this feeling


---------101:11----------
reminds you of something in your past


---------101:15----------
okay


---------101:16----------
and then sit down and like think through


---------101:18----------
it in that way okay


---------101:20----------
okay and then if you do that over time I


---------101:24----------
think what's gonna happen is the feeling


---------101:25----------
of existential dread will get back okay


---------101:28----------
like this and my hope is that for them


---------101:31----------
you don't have to feel that way all the


---------101:32----------
time every yeah be nice yeah and then


---------101:36----------
the last thing that I'll point out is


---------101:38----------
that I don't know exactly how you had


---------101:40----------
that moment of feeling helped and then


---------101:42----------
you said for sure it helps I don't know


---------101:44----------
what that was but I think if you


---------101:45----------
continue doing this it'll result in more


---------101:49----------
of whatever happened for just a fraction


---------101:51----------
of a second mm-hmm that's the way you


---------101:53----------
cultivate more of those responses and


---------101:55----------
you're sure it helped like user like


---------101:57----------
you're like yeah for sure and then as


---------101:59----------
you do that for a while I don't know


---------102:00----------
exactly how it works but it helps and


---------102:01----------
then one day you're gonna wake up and


---------102:04----------
it's like not gonna be that big of a


---------102:05----------
deal okay I like this right yeah


---------102:11----------
how you feel yell I'll try that out not


---------102:13----------
feeling good yeah okay also if you if


---------102:16----------
you need some guidance and this kind of


---------102:17----------
thing so the other thing is that that


---------102:19----------
you know that emotional processing that


---------102:21----------
Woody does therapy also basically works


---------102:23----------
on that principle mmm so it's one of the


---------102:26----------
ways so the other thing you can think


---------102:27----------
about is is if you huh helping you


---------102:30----------
process yeah so it like that's how that


---------102:34----------
model of the mind like that's how I


---------102:35----------
understand what therapy is doing okay so


---------102:39----------
you can also think about seeing a mental


---------102:41----------
health professional depending on how bad


---------102:42----------
it is okay I mean I I consider I'm


---------102:46----------
despite that I'm a generally pretty


---------102:49----------
happy person yeah I can tell you assam


---------102:52----------
um but maybe i mean if it if it helps I


---------102:56----------
could consider it I'll you know try it


---------102:58----------
on my own first


---------102:58----------
oh yeah just think the recommendation


---------103:01----------
yeah


---------103:03----------
any other questions for me or thoughts


---------103:05----------
not really I mean I'd yeah I enjoyed the


---------103:08----------
talk like cool very insightful learned a


---------103:12----------
lot it's interesting sometimes I people


---------103:15----------
how to meditate are you interested in in


---------103:17----------
doing that today


---------103:18----------
sure yeah I I've tried meditation before


---------103:21----------
I I don't know like what are there


---------103:25----------
different types of meditation yeah


---------103:27----------
because I've done the one where you just


---------103:29----------
like try to empty all thoughts and just


---------103:32----------
try and be completely present mm-hmm


---------103:35----------
that and that's the one I've tried


---------103:37----------
before it's nice okay do like a


---------103:39----------
different kind of one yeah I do a lot of


---------103:43----------
different kinds of meditation depending


---------103:45----------
on what the goals are okay so there are


---------103:47----------
some meditations that are more cognitive


---------103:49----------
some meditations that are more physical


---------103:51----------
some meditations that are more


---------103:53----------
psychological some meditations that are


---------103:56----------
more spiritual okay what do you


---------103:58----------
recommend what are you what do you want


---------104:01----------
what do you want to be different about


---------104:03----------
um I think I think acting being in the


---------104:08----------
present more would definitely help


---------104:10----------
because I act a lot in the past and in


---------104:12----------
the you know thoughts of the future so


---------104:15----------
something to help you be in the present


---------104:24----------
okay are you up for doing something


---------104:26----------
that's a little bit more physical sure


---------104:30----------
are you okay feeling a little bit silly


---------104:33----------
own stream yeah my like pork on the like


---------104:36----------
kind of like a one of those what is that


---------104:39----------
nothing nothing


---------104:41----------
yeah no we'll go for it okay so I'm


---------104:43----------
gonna ask you to push your your chair


---------104:45----------
back sir and I'm gonna ask you to stand


---------104:48----------
up I'm gonna take off my headphones okay


---------104:57----------
okay can [ __ ] hear that Kenny I can't


---------105:01----------
hear you but that's okay can you hear me


---------105:06----------
okay so I want you to close your eyes


---------105:09----------
okay all right


---------105:12----------
just stand up straight


---------105:15----------
and now I want you to your mind to just


---------105:17----------
go where it goes so I start thinking


---------105:20----------
about the past start thinking about the


---------105:23----------
future


---------105:25----------
I'm really thinking about I think about


---------105:26----------
what you're gonna be doing next I still


---------105:28----------
can't hear you but what I would be being


---------105:30----------
soon ok so just think about the future


---------105:33----------
think about the past think about what


---------105:36----------
you're gonna do later today think about


---------105:39----------
who you're gonna see


---------105:40----------
now I want you to open your eyes and


---------105:42----------
look at me okay now I want you to do


---------105:45----------
this raise your arms above your head


---------105:47----------
okay and then I want you to take your


---------105:50----------
right foot and put it above your right


---------105:52----------
knee good and now I want you to close


---------105:56----------
your eyes and think about who you're


---------105:59----------
gonna see later okay so go ahead and


---------106:08----------
come back down so and as you adopt the


---------106:12----------
position so now we're gonna do it again


---------106:13----------
you can try with the left foot please


---------106:15----------
you dock the position I want you to know


---------106:18----------
that set your mind it's gonna force you


---------106:21----------
into the crust okay you're not going to


---------106:24----------
be able to think about other pests okay


---------106:26----------
so let's try again just try to maintain


---------106:31----------
the position


---------106:37----------
you can open your eyes open your eyes


---------106:39----------
open your Eska and focus


---------106:47----------
what are you thinking about balancing


---------106:51----------
yeah he can't [ __ ] hear me why am I


---------106:53----------
talking that's fine


---------106:55----------
I can't I can't hear when you speak like


---------106:56----------
that but yeah so just just notice what


---------106:58----------
you're thinking about right yes I feel


---------107:02----------
the present I feel pretty focused on


---------107:05----------
right now it's hard to do this and not


---------107:07----------
be focused on right now okay we can't


---------107:10----------
hear you but that's okay oh I know okay


---------107:12----------
so go ahead and come on that okay so so


---------107:18----------
now all right what were you thinking


---------107:25----------
about when you were bowed out about


---------107:27----------
balancing I was thinking about balancing


---------107:29----------
so now I'm gonna ask you an interesting


---------107:32----------
question so were you actually thinking


---------107:33----------
about balancing or were you focusing on


---------107:36----------
balancing what's the difference that's


---------107:40----------
that's what I mean so like when I'm


---------107:41----------
eating food I can think of better eating


---------107:44----------
food or I can actually just enjoy the


---------107:46----------
food uh-huh did that make sense yeah


---------107:49----------
yeah the difference what are you like


---------107:51----------
thinking like oh this is me balancing


---------107:52----------
were you just like your attention I was


---------107:55----------
doing the act of balancing yes so that's


---------107:57----------
how you come to the present because you


---------108:00----------
can't be in the past of the future when


---------108:02----------
you're doing that yeah if you try


---------108:04----------
difficult things so I had to be focused


---------108:06----------
on it yes okay and so the easy mode is


---------108:10----------
with your eyes open so your your sense


---------108:12----------
of balance comes from three neurological


---------108:15----------
parts it comes from your vestibular


---------108:17----------
system which is in your ears it comes


---------108:19----------
from your eye and it comes from your


---------108:21----------
dorsal columns or your proprioception or


---------108:24----------
your sensation of like position in space


---------108:26----------
okay positioning yeah I got it okay so


---------108:29----------
the interesting thing is that if you


---------108:30----------
close your eyes it becomes more


---------108:31----------
difficult to balance because you're


---------108:33----------
losing yeah you're not focusing on one


---------108:34----------
spot you're losing one of those three


---------108:35----------
rays yeah so it becomes hard so at the


---------108:38----------
beginning if you need to balance with


---------108:40----------
your eyes open


---------108:41----------
go for it and then at some point you're


---------108:43----------
gonna get good at it and then your mind


---------108:46----------
will start to wander and you won't need


---------108:47----------
to focus anymore


---------108:48----------
and when your mind starts to wander


---------108:50----------
close your eyes and then it'll become


---------108:53----------
harder okay so in general I think


---------108:57----------
Michael for whatever reason I feel like


---------109:00----------
maybe body is a good


---------109:01----------
for you to focus in the present so I'll


---------109:03----------
also tell you like do you out do you do


---------109:05----------
yoga done yet no I do not okay so I


---------109:09----------
think about maybe learning yoga and the


---------109:11----------
reason to learn yoga is because yoga is


---------109:13----------
not about like it's not about physical


---------109:15----------
health the reason that yoga was


---------109:17----------
developed is because when you do a yoga


---------109:19----------
posture it's not about how much you


---------109:21----------
stretch it's about focusing your mind on


---------109:24----------
the present so the reason that people do


---------109:26----------
yoga is because when they do yoga


---------109:28----------
properly you can't think about anything


---------109:30----------
else just about yoga yes and so what you


---------109:34----------
want from yoga is a position that is


---------109:36----------
stable and brings your mind to the


---------109:39----------
present and that way if you have a


---------109:41----------
position that you can hold for 10


---------109:43----------
minutes and it brings your mind to the


---------109:45----------
present then you can be in the present


---------109:47----------
for 10 minutes and it's like op2 just


---------109:51----------
use your body to force yourself to do


---------109:53----------
that you don't have to have to worry


---------109:54----------
about emptying your mind like you you


---------109:56----------
can you can try as hard as you want you


---------109:57----------
to think about stuff and you won't be


---------109:59----------
able to okay that's that's cool yeah


---------110:02----------
that's very interesting I never I didn't


---------110:05----------
realize yoga was


---------110:07----------
developed with that intent yep that's


---------110:09----------
cool you can also do like other things


---------110:11----------
like you can just go like this I'll try


---------110:13----------
it out and then if you just hold this


---------110:15----------
for a while soon like you can think


---------110:18----------
about things but as your arms get tired


---------110:21----------
they're gonna start to demand your


---------110:23----------
attention no just hold but using your


---------110:26----------
body to force attend yeah just just hold


---------110:28----------
it for a while and at some point your


---------110:30----------
body's gonna be like hey put our arms


---------110:32----------
down and you're gonna be like nope not


---------110:34----------
yeah and then you're gonna be focused on


---------110:35----------
so just focus on that sensation you


---------110:37----------
won't be able to think about anything


---------110:38----------
else all right


---------110:40----------
Janet's my exercise is therapeutic


---------110:44----------
that may be different but that's alright


---------110:47----------
yeah I'll try it out any last thoughts


---------110:49----------
or questions before we wrap up Michael


---------110:50----------
Reaves no I think is pretty fun


---------110:54----------
productive enjoyed talking thank you for


---------110:56----------
the appreciate it having me on yeah man


---------110:59----------
thanks for coming on and Mars yeah man


---------111:01----------
I'm I'm a big I like you a lot


---------111:04----------
thank you have you ever when you're


---------111:06----------
talking about the ear thing then inner


---------111:09----------
ear for balance have you ever seen those


---------111:10----------
you can stimulate the inner ear with


---------111:14----------
electrodes to make a person balance to


---------111:17----------
one side or not so you can you can you


---------111:20----------
can send electrical signals through the


---------111:22----------
vestibular system to like manipulate


---------111:24----------
balance it does just a fun tidbit I I


---------111:28----------
thought of what you were talking about


---------111:30----------
yeah that makes sense


---------111:32----------
so so usually like under neurons


---------111:34----------
transmit electricity yeah and and


---------111:38----------
generally speaking when we come to


---------111:40----------
applied neuroscience you know you can


---------111:41----------
stimulate different parts of the brain


---------111:43----------
with electrodes to do all kinds of stuff


---------111:46----------
so yeah that's that's cool yeah as a


---------111:49----------
little tidbit you can just like buy


---------111:50----------
those [ __ ] cool yeah odds are that


---------111:55----------
you might be interested in sticking


---------111:57----------
electrodes in your ear does that sound


---------111:59----------
like a good idea it's not yeah I


---------112:03----------
