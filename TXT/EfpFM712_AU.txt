---------00:00----------
this is the first time when people


---------00:02----------
couldn't hear jacksepticeye


---------00:03----------
and everyone rejoiced um


---------00:06----------
all right so you go by jack right yeah


---------00:09----------
jack's fine


---------00:10----------
and is there something in particular


---------00:11----------
that you want to talk about today


---------00:14----------
um not really specifically we i did talk


---------00:17----------
to


---------00:17----------
brandon about it and i was talking about


---------00:19----------
kind of the idea of parasocial


---------00:21----------
relationships and things like that but


---------00:22----------
i mean kind of everything that this job


---------00:25----------
sort of entails is fine with me


---------00:27----------
yeah absolutely um so you know my staff


---------00:29----------
asked me


---------00:30----------
a couple of questions and i got this


---------00:32----------
question a couple of times they're like


---------00:34----------
do you want to know what's going on with


---------00:35----------
jack and i was like no


---------00:37----------
and then they were like like two or


---------00:39----------
three people ask me they're like do you


---------00:41----------
do you want to know what's going on with


---------00:42----------
him and i'm like no right


---------00:44----------
and is that something we should talk


---------00:47----------
about whatever is


---------00:49----------
going on with you or is it sure


---------00:53----------
no i mean the the roughest part of it is


---------00:55----------
kind of past


---------00:56----------
what happened was that my father passed


---------00:58----------
away like


---------00:59----------
three weeks ago oh my god um yeah he


---------01:02----------
passed away at the end of january so


---------01:04----------
i've been taking


---------01:05----------
time away from youtube and streaming and


---------01:07----------
everything since then


---------01:09----------
um and i've done one update video on it


---------01:11----------
and talked a bit about it just to let my


---------01:13----------
audience kind of know where i was and


---------01:15----------
what's been going on but thankfully like


---------01:17----------
the the sort of grieving hump


---------01:19----------
is that i'm coming off the other end of


---------01:21----------
that so i'm in a better place mentally


---------01:24----------
now than i was and i'll probably be back


---------01:26----------
to making videos and stuff


---------01:28----------
next week i think uh okay okay


---------01:31----------
i assume that's what is going on with me


---------01:33----------
unless they know


---------01:34----------
something else about me that i don't


---------01:36----------
know i mean it sounds like that's the


---------01:38----------
kind of thing that


---------01:39----------
you know it sounds like it's affected


---------01:41----------
you uh


---------01:43----------
i mean affected in the sense that you


---------01:44----------
know it sounds like you've taken a step


---------01:46----------
back from making content and stuff


---------01:48----------
yeah i i took time away last year to try


---------01:51----------
and


---------01:52----------
like reevaluate who i am and what i want


---------01:54----------
to do and


---------01:55----------
where i fit into the world um and i


---------01:58----------
think this is another to hear more about


---------01:59----------
that


---------02:01----------
yeah we can circle back to that for sure


---------02:02----------
it was definitely a very formative


---------02:04----------
time in my career but i think this i was


---------02:08----------
going to take some time off in january


---------02:09----------
anyway


---------02:10----------
just because it's slow and i don't know


---------02:12----------
vacations are good


---------02:14----------
but then this sort of like forced me


---------02:16----------
into a sort of break


---------02:18----------
of sorts um but i wanted to make sure


---------02:20----------
that i took the time to do it and i feel


---------02:21----------
like i'm in a better place mentally


---------02:22----------
where i don't feel like i have to be


---------02:24----------
always on and give the audience what


---------02:26----------
they need or want constantly and being


---------02:28----------
able to take that time away and


---------02:30----------
just kind of say fu to everybody else


---------02:33----------
and take my time for myself


---------02:35----------
does that require an fu when you take


---------02:37----------
time for yourself


---------02:39----------
no no i'm being a little dramatic and


---------02:41----------
hyperbolic about it um


---------02:43----------
definitely for some people some people


---------02:45----------
need kind of like the harsh like no i'm


---------02:46----------
leaving


---------02:47----------
and you need to be okay with that for a


---------02:49----------
couple of weeks


---------02:50----------
but most people have been extremely


---------02:52----------
supportive about it okay


---------02:54----------
um yeah so what do you want us


---------02:57----------
uh thank you for sharing that with me i


---------02:59----------
i didn't uh i mean i guess in a sense i


---------03:01----------
did mean to pry


---------03:03----------
it's just it was strange like i don't i


---------03:06----------
try to actually talk to people sort of


---------03:08----------
blind


---------03:08----------
in the sense that um i think when when


---------03:12----------
we don't talk to people blind it's


---------03:14----------
quickly to get it


---------03:15----------
it's really easy to get into like drama


---------03:17----------
usually is what it is


---------03:18----------
like something is going on and like it's


---------03:21----------
like i don't really


---------03:22----------
care about that you know right um


---------03:26----------
so so but if it feels important to you


---------03:28----------
what i'm hearing from you is that you


---------03:30----------
know something really unfortunate


---------03:31----------
happened i'm assuming that you view it


---------03:33----------
as unfortunate


---------03:34----------
um which is a pretty big assumption but


---------03:36----------
and that you've


---------03:37----------
kind of worked through it you feel like


---------03:39----------
you're in a pretty good place and and


---------03:42----------
so i'm not hearing a whole lot that


---------03:43----------
needs to be talked about there


---------03:46----------
um probably not i mean we can go into it


---------03:48----------
a little bit um


---------03:50----------
i guess just uh because i don't feel


---------03:51----------
like i don't feel like it really happens


---------03:54----------
too often


---------03:55----------
in the online community you don't really


---------03:57----------
hear about this sort of thing happening


---------03:58----------
fairly often and um i think sort of to


---------04:02----------
owe it to the legacy of my dad it's nice


---------04:04----------
to kind of


---------04:04----------
remember him in good spirits and kind of


---------04:06----------
talk about him in a way


---------04:07----------
so i talked about him a little bit on my


---------04:09----------
channel before and i've


---------04:11----------
i've never been hugely close with him


---------04:13----------
growing up and


---------04:14----------
there's always kind of been a distance


---------04:15----------
to it but i think having something like


---------04:18----------
this happen it's nice to sort of


---------04:19----------
look back on it fondly and it's sort of


---------04:22----------
a weird thing


---------04:23----------
that when you're in this position you


---------04:27----------
it's a thing where you kind of have to


---------04:28----------
tell people that it's happened


---------04:30----------
but at the same time you kind of want to


---------04:32----------
keep it a bit more private


---------04:34----------
because i need to let people know to not


---------04:36----------
go poking when i disappear for


---------04:38----------
three weeks yep to leave my family alone


---------04:41----------
and to leave me alone and to kind of


---------04:42----------
respect the boundary


---------04:43----------
of what has happened and you kind of


---------04:44----------
just need to tell people up front


---------04:46----------
instead of leaving any sort of ambiguity


---------04:49----------
in the air because


---------04:50----------
from my experience that just makes


---------04:51----------
things worse yeah so


---------04:53----------
it's interesting because i'm noticing


---------04:54----------
these two threads kind of weave together


---------04:56----------
because


---------04:57----------
it sounds like we're starting us sort of


---------04:58----------
skirting on parasocial


---------05:00----------
relationships we're skirting on um


---------05:03----------
you know pressures of being a streamer


---------05:05----------
and how


---------05:07----------
you sort of don't i've worked with a


---------05:09----------
fair number of streamers and one of the


---------05:10----------
things that really shocks me is that


---------05:12----------
many of y'all you know are privileged in


---------05:15----------
many ways but that you guys don't get to


---------05:17----------
do things that normal people get to do


---------05:20----------
right in the sense give me an example


---------05:22----------
grieve in private


---------05:24----------
like you have to give people an


---------05:25----------
explanation to like


---------05:27----------
what like you know most people don't


---------05:30----------
have to give


---------05:31----------
you know the rest of the world an


---------05:32----------
explanation when they like go off and do


---------05:34----------
something


---------05:35----------
on their own for like two weeks yeah


---------05:37----------
it's it's a really strange phenomenon to


---------05:40----------
have to do


---------05:41----------
yeah um and and one of the things that


---------05:44----------
just keeps popping in my mind is like


---------05:46----------
i was talking to someone who was and i


---------05:48----------
sort of joked that


---------05:49----------
if they post a picture of them eating a


---------05:52----------
taco people will get upset with them for


---------05:54----------
being like


---------05:54----------
anti-hot dog right now i have this


---------05:58----------
feeling a lot and it's it's kind of


---------06:00----------
skirting between am i an [ __ ] or is


---------06:02----------
this like


---------06:03----------
my life now where i go out and you see


---------06:06----------
people look at you and then the first


---------06:07----------
assumption is do they know who i am


---------06:09----------
and then the part of me that kicks in is


---------06:11----------
like well


---------06:12----------
who do you think you are thinking that


---------06:14----------
people should know who you are but then


---------06:15----------
it's kind of


---------06:16----------
something that's happened in such a


---------06:17----------
pattern that it's hard


---------06:19----------
not to kind of fall under that


---------06:21----------
assumption and then when i'm out eating


---------06:23----------
at that moment where i'm i'm getting


---------06:24----------
ready to eat my food i'm like how do i


---------06:26----------
eat food again


---------06:27----------
how do humans eat food normally do i


---------06:30----------
look weird


---------06:30----------
are they gonna like talk about how i ate


---------06:33----------
my food weirdly or what i ordered and


---------06:34----------
things like that it's such


---------06:36----------
it's a weird sort of circus that goes on


---------06:38----------
in your brain when these things happen


---------06:41----------
um yeah i


---------06:45----------
jack it's talking about those kinds of


---------06:47----------
things which is why i love doing what i


---------06:49----------
do


---------06:50----------
because what i'm hearing from you is


---------06:52----------
that like your mind


---------06:53----------
is doing all kinds of stuff that


---------06:56----------
because of your life it's been trained


---------06:58----------
to do which are like not


---------07:00----------
normal things yeah right and and so


---------07:03----------
and and i really also really get excited


---------07:06----------
when i hear people sort of talking about


---------07:07----------
like


---------07:08----------
who they are like i i like talking about


---------07:10----------
the stuff i like


---------07:11----------
exploring kind of what the true nature


---------07:13----------
of self is


---------07:14----------
and yeah me too and and i i kind of


---------07:17----------
noticed because


---------07:18----------
because of the way that the the examples


---------07:21----------
that you used about oh like


---------07:22----------
am i someone like who am i to be someone


---------07:25----------
like what does that mean to


---------07:26----------
be someone and to not be someone i mean


---------07:28----------
at the end of the day you [ __ ] just the


---------07:29----------
same


---------07:30----------
as everyone else and you know so it's


---------07:32----------
not really like you're a different


---------07:34----------
person but it can sometimes feel like


---------07:35----------
you're a different person and


---------07:36----------
how do you navigate that um right so we


---------07:39----------
can talk about you know the circus that


---------07:40----------
goes on in your head too


---------07:42----------
um


---------07:45----------
i love the way you describe that too so


---------07:48----------
what where do you want to


---------07:49----------
what do you want to start with do you


---------07:50----------
want to start with and i wasn't really


---------07:52----------
sure whether you wanted to


---------07:54----------
say something a little bit about your


---------07:55----------
father or talk about that or we should


---------07:56----------
just skip over it and


---------07:58----------
you know get to taking a break or a pair


---------08:00----------
of social relationships or what


---------08:03----------
yeah i think i think the video i


---------08:04----------
uploaded on my channel kind of speaks


---------08:06----------
for itself


---------08:07----------
the things that i wanted to share and


---------08:08----------
the sort of legacy that i want to live


---------08:10----------
is it's a bit more internal than i want


---------08:13----------
people to know and i think the sort of


---------08:15----------
private matters of it


---------08:16----------
need to stay private personally i think


---------08:19----------
that it's


---------08:20----------
it's good not to share too much with


---------08:22----------
everybody all the time


---------08:23----------
yeah um and not just skirt over it


---------08:25----------
because i'm like avoiding it or anything


---------08:27----------
like that


---------08:27----------
but just uh i've said my piece you're


---------08:30----------
allowed to avoid it


---------08:32----------
true um but i think i've talked about it


---------08:35----------
enough and


---------08:36----------
okay i feel like i i've i've dealt with


---------08:39----------
it in my in my personal time so


---------08:41----------
perfect um i'm really happy to hear that


---------08:43----------
you know if that changes


---------08:45----------
um you know just a couple of quick


---------08:47----------
things just about grief for you and


---------08:48----------
everyone else


---------08:49----------
i lost my dad about nine years ago


---------08:52----------
and i was really surprised because


---------08:56----------
what i really felt was that i didn't


---------08:57----------
need a whole lot of support when it


---------08:59----------
happened


---------09:00----------
but i found myself like missing him


---------09:03----------
at kind of random moments over the next


---------09:05----------
decade


---------09:07----------
and and it was sort of like there's all


---------09:09----------
this support for the first month


---------09:11----------
and then like what i really needed is


---------09:13----------
that support sort of spaced out over the


---------09:15----------
next decade


---------09:17----------
and so yeah i've sort of realized that


---------09:19----------
in this sort of


---------09:20----------
business as well especially is that a


---------09:22----------
lot of people are there


---------09:23----------
in the like hyper intense moments and a


---------09:26----------
lot of people will say a lot of things


---------09:28----------
in those moments but i've come to


---------09:30----------
realize that a lot of the people in my


---------09:32----------
personal life


---------09:33----------
and a lot of people who i consider


---------09:34----------
really close friends you can really tell


---------09:37----------
the merit of their character during


---------09:39----------
times like this


---------09:40----------
because i've had some friends say


---------09:42----------
something immediately and then check in


---------09:43----------
a week later and then check in a week


---------09:45----------
later


---------09:46----------
and that that meant a lot more to me


---------09:48----------
than everybody just rushing to sort of


---------09:50----------
get social points


---------09:51----------
immediately and i noticed that


---------09:54----------
in some regards a lot of people took it


---------09:56----------
upon themselves to make it about them


---------09:59----------
which was a again it's something that i


---------10:01----------
kind of knew already but i've never been


---------10:03----------
through something


---------10:04----------
so intense like this that it became


---------10:07----------
sort of a writing essay for some people


---------10:09----------
to sort of


---------10:10----------
say who could give the best condolences


---------10:12----------
basically and who could be


---------10:14----------
the better person at being sorry for me


---------10:17----------
and then i just become a character and


---------10:19----------
sort of a


---------10:20----------
cast member outside of what their


---------10:22----------
conversation is


---------10:23----------
and i that was something that i just


---------10:25----------
wanted to shout out all the people


---------10:27----------
trolling on it and shut out all the


---------10:28----------
people just going way overboard in the


---------10:30----------
other direction and it was


---------10:32----------
it was everybody in the middle who were


---------10:33----------
genuine about it that i really


---------10:34----------
appreciated the most


---------10:36----------
what i'm hearing is that you became a


---------10:38----------
sidequest


---------10:39----------
npc for them yeah and i


---------10:42----------
i feel like that's what happens to a lot


---------10:44----------
of streamers you become a character in


---------10:45----------
people's lives rather than a person


---------10:48----------
that's something i've always strived to


---------10:50----------
deal with personally but also let


---------10:51----------
remind people that i am a human


---------10:54----------
underneath everything and i'm not


---------10:56----------
some weird character in your sort of


---------10:59----------
fantasy i'm not an anime for you to


---------11:01----------
watch and


---------11:02----------
fawn overall all the time fawn over


---------11:05----------
[Laughter]


---------11:07----------
i'm trying to increase my lexicon i've


---------11:09----------
been watching a lot of ludwig


---------11:11----------
um yeah so what how okay


---------11:16----------
so let can we actually just go back to


---------11:18----------
um


---------11:19----------
you know you said you took some time off


---------11:21----------
last last year to try to figure out who


---------11:23----------
you are and


---------11:24----------
what you wanted can we talk about that


---------11:26----------
yeah sure


---------11:28----------
um yeah i think for a long time i was


---------11:32----------
i experienced some like really shitty


---------11:33----------
years on my channel and then sort of


---------11:35----------
going through the motions and you


---------11:37----------
you kind of hit this well perceived peak


---------11:41----------
of what you want to do what you want to


---------11:42----------
accomplish and it's all about growth


---------11:44----------
growth growth all the time and


---------11:45----------
satisfying your audience and then you


---------11:46----------
kind of get to a point where that


---------11:48----------
hits its peak um and you kind of feel


---------11:51----------
burnt out and you're doing the same


---------11:52----------
thing and i


---------11:53----------
i felt like i kind of became a


---------11:54----------
caricature of myself that i


---------11:56----------
i do these things and then people


---------11:58----------
respond to certain aspects of it so i


---------11:59----------
just double down on those because that's


---------12:01----------
what people


---------12:02----------
react to yep and doing that for so long


---------12:04----------
and getting into that cycle i just


---------12:06----------
i kind of got tired of my own [ __ ] and i


---------12:09----------
was making stuff


---------12:10----------
that i wasn't fulfilled by my audience


---------12:12----------
could tell they were just showing up


---------12:13----------
because it was the same time every day


---------12:15----------
like uh


---------12:16----------
it's like the same reason people watch


---------12:18----------
one piece for so long they're sort of in


---------12:19----------
denial about how long it's going on and


---------12:21----------
how samey it is


---------12:22----------
i care after a while i can't get into it


---------12:25----------
man


---------12:26----------
yeah i just got into naruto and i'm


---------12:27----------
trying to like hold out on that and


---------12:29----------
that's a


---------12:30----------
that's a bear to take on as well it is


---------12:32----------
it is


---------12:33----------
i've been working on naruto now for


---------12:36----------
probably about 15 years and yeah


---------12:39----------
you know one episode at a time yeah


---------12:43----------
but one piece is a completely different


---------12:45----------
mountain to climb


---------12:46----------
yeah um yeah just going through those


---------12:48----------
motions for a while and then


---------12:50----------
wondering where i kind of fit in with


---------12:52----------
myself and then


---------12:53----------
at this big moment where i thought well


---------12:55----------
can i exist


---------12:56----------
outside of my channel and outside of my


---------12:58----------
numbers and outside of this perception


---------13:00----------
of what people think of me and


---------13:02----------
who even am i beyond jacksepticeye


---------13:04----------
anymore


---------13:05----------
does me as a person as shawn even exist


---------13:08----------
or the two so melded together that i


---------13:09----------
can't


---------13:10----------
differentiate them anymore and i took a


---------13:13----------
month off to kind of


---------13:14----------
i i thought i was going to quit i


---------13:16----------
thought i was done with everything


---------13:17----------
because i just


---------13:17----------
i kind of got tired of doing the same


---------13:19----------
stuff over and over again


---------13:21----------
um it took a lot of time i got into like


---------13:23----------
stoicism


---------13:24----------
and read up on a lot of books about like


---------13:26----------
marcus aurelius and things like that and


---------13:28----------
how to deal with


---------13:29----------
just yourself and how to deal with other


---------13:31----------
people in a healthier way


---------13:33----------
and it helped me a lot and i started to


---------13:35----------
come to some realizations after


---------13:36----------
reflecting for a while that i i can't


---------13:39----------
exist


---------13:40----------
as both and i just need to take the


---------13:42----------
right amount of time


---------13:43----------
for each and set healthy boundaries for


---------13:45----------
each and now


---------13:46----------
trying to get over kind of the


---------13:47----------
perceptions of what other people think


---------13:49----------
about me


---------13:50----------
versus how i actually act based on that


---------13:53----------
feedback


---------13:54----------
and realizing that i can't live my life


---------13:56----------
for everybody else


---------13:58----------
the feedback they were giving me i


---------13:59----------
realized that i would react to that and


---------14:00----------
then try and do that


---------14:01----------
and correct everything that was going


---------14:03----------
wrong according to them


---------14:06----------
sure um and so i wasn't really living


---------14:08----------
for me anymore i was kind of living for


---------14:10----------
what other people wanted me to do and


---------14:12----------
then it was just so many different


---------14:13----------
voices so many different opinions that i


---------14:15----------
couldn't i couldn't accurately


---------14:17----------
do what everybody wanted because that's


---------14:18----------
just impossible so it's something that


---------14:20----------
i've kind of dealt with for a long time


---------14:22----------
is kind of being a people pleaser and


---------14:24----------
trying to get over that


---------14:27----------
um do you want help with that


---------14:32----------
sure so how long have you been a people


---------14:36----------
pleaser


---------14:38----------
probably my whole life i think because


---------14:40----------
i'm the the youngest in my family and


---------14:42----------
i've


---------14:43----------
uh two older brothers and two older


---------14:44----------
sisters i think that i was always sort


---------14:46----------
of the


---------14:47----------
whenever things got tense i feel like i


---------14:49----------
was sort of the comic relief


---------14:51----------
of the family to try and like break


---------14:52----------
tension yeah and make sure that


---------14:54----------
everybody's


---------14:55----------
okay um but i think doing it my whole


---------14:58----------
life i think i started to realize that i


---------14:59----------
i didn't value myself anymore i didn't


---------15:02----------
care about my own opinions i just cared


---------15:03----------
about what other people thought about me


---------15:06----------
and i've gotten a lot better at it over


---------15:08----------
the last year but i think there's still


---------15:10----------
every now and then something will happen


---------15:12----------
and it'll kind of like hit that nerve


---------15:14----------
in me that i need to kind of like get


---------15:15----------
over again


---------15:17----------
um i don't know it's a bizarre thing


---------15:20----------
yeah so let's learn about that sure what


---------15:23----------
what is the what is the nerve what is


---------15:26----------
the nerve that they hit


---------15:29----------
just worrying that i've upset somebody


---------15:31----------
or haven't


---------15:33----------
met somebody's standards or haven't


---------15:35----------
given somebody


---------15:36----------
a good time because it's it's never been


---------15:39----------
about me it's always been about our


---------15:40----------
is somebody else having a good time yeah


---------15:43----------
and getting into this job i think


---------15:45----------
having so many other people to try and


---------15:47----------
please after a certain point


---------15:50----------
you realize that you can't please


---------15:51----------
everybody which is also cliche and


---------15:53----------
obvious


---------15:54----------
and people say it all the time but it's


---------15:55----------
so hard to actually do


---------15:58----------
so


---------16:01----------
jack are you okay if i like take a cup


---------16:03----------
so first


---------16:04----------
this is fantastic i'm i'm really happy


---------16:07----------
to be having this conversation


---------16:08----------
i i think it makes me so happy when


---------16:12----------
so i spent many years like studying this


---------16:15----------
stuff formally and i think it is the


---------16:17----------
coolest thing in the world when


---------16:19----------
i meet someone who just threw personal


---------16:21----------
reflection


---------16:23----------
has like understood so much of like what


---------16:25----------
i spent like


---------16:27----------
time studying and it really just makes


---------16:30----------
me


---------16:31----------
it reinforces in my mind that like there


---------16:33----------
is no substitute for personal reflection


---------16:36----------
and that you can read all the books in


---------16:37----------
the world but ultimately all of the


---------16:39----------
knowledge that you need is actually like


---------16:41----------
within you which sounds cliche too


---------16:45----------
and so if it's okay with you what i'd


---------16:47----------
like to do is


---------16:48----------
is i think one of the things i can do to


---------16:50----------
help you on your journey


---------16:51----------
is just to expand your lexicon and and


---------16:54----------
kind of


---------16:55----------
tie like sort of button down a few like


---------16:58----------
different kinds of concepts and nuances


---------17:00----------
which i think you already understand


---------17:02----------
but may not have language for and i


---------17:04----------
think it'll help you become


---------17:05----------
more versatile and like dealing with


---------17:07----------
these things and understanding these


---------17:09----------
things


---------17:10----------
let's go so so the first is that in


---------17:12----------
sanskrit there are two words for


---------17:14----------
knowledge one is vidya which


---------17:17----------
gets translated as objective knowledge


---------17:20----------
and is also like


---------17:21----------
information and transmissible okay


---------17:24----------
and then the second is nyan which is


---------17:27----------
subjective knowledge


---------17:30----------
not transmissible and oddly enough


---------17:34----------
in the west we tend to value vidya over


---------17:37----------
nyan


---------17:38----------
like we tend to say that unless


---------17:42----------
you know you can prove it to me so


---------17:43----------
science is all about vidya for example


---------17:45----------
so like science is about knowledge that


---------17:47----------
other people can gain from your efforts


---------17:50----------
but yogis and i would dare say marcus


---------17:53----------
aurelius


---------17:54----------
valued nyan more than vidya and what


---------17:57----------
they realized is that ultimately


---------17:59----------
subjective knowledge is superior to


---------18:01----------
objective knowledge okay


---------18:05----------
and so you know when you say like this


---------18:07----------
stuff sounds really cliche


---------18:09----------
but this is where i would call vidya


---------18:11----------
information


---------18:12----------
and nyan understanding and so we can say


---------18:15----------
cliche things and they sound cliche but


---------18:18----------
that's from a video perspective


---------18:20----------
but once you understand them from a neon


---------18:22----------
perspective


---------18:23----------
they actually start to shape your


---------18:25----------
actions and


---------18:26----------
shape your thoughts instead of being


---------18:28----------
like a fact that is philosophically or


---------18:30----------
intellectually or logically true


---------18:33----------
it becomes like a reality in your mind


---------18:36----------
which then alters the course of your


---------18:37----------
life


---------18:39----------
okay um and so


---------18:42----------
what i'd really like to explore with you


---------18:43----------
is i i think you've gained a lot of neon


---------18:45----------
over the last year or two and sort of


---------18:48----------
like exploring kind of what that is and


---------18:50----------
what you've discovered


---------18:52----------
um but what do you think about those


---------18:55----------
kind that differentiation of


---------18:56----------
of knowledge between these two types


---------18:59----------
i think it makes a lot of sense because


---------19:01----------
i think well maybe i


---------19:03----------
maybe i'm not right in saying this but i


---------19:05----------
feel like the stuff that i've


---------19:06----------
sort of gotten into over the last year


---------19:08----------
year and a half is sort of more


---------19:10----------
on the spiritual side of things um


---------19:13----------
i'm trying to get and trying to get in


---------19:14----------
touch with that stuff because


---------19:17----------
i've always been like a very scientific


---------19:19----------
minded person


---------19:20----------
i'm not like the smartest at it but i


---------19:22----------
always love the sort of


---------19:24----------
like machinations of how things work and


---------19:27----------
especially people i love


---------19:28----------
seeing how people take how they work i


---------19:30----------
love observing like body language and


---------19:32----------
how people react the way they react


---------19:34----------
um but that's all maybe that's like the


---------19:37----------
objective


---------19:38----------
side of things and i i really like


---------19:40----------
getting into sort of


---------19:41----------
the weeds of how people's brains work


---------19:45----------
and why everybody's different but the


---------19:46----------
same


---------19:47----------
and things like that so i think what


---------19:48----------
i've just


---------19:50----------
i think i've sort of broadened my mind


---------19:52----------
in the last year to realize that


---------19:54----------
i i can't control everything and the


---------19:55----------
reason i react certain ways to certain


---------19:57----------
things is because of the value systems


---------19:59----------
that i've kind of put on them


---------20:01----------
and then somebody breaches those value


---------20:03----------
systems in my mind so then


---------20:05----------
they're that's bad and you shouldn't do


---------20:07----------
that but what i've


---------20:08----------
started to get better at is realize that


---------20:10----------
just do whatever the [ __ ] you want i


---------20:12----------
who am i to tell you or to react that


---------20:14----------
way like just go live your life and i


---------20:16----------
live my life and hopefully we


---------20:18----------
we meet somewhere in the middle yeah so


---------20:20----------
i love the way that you talked about


---------20:22----------
value systems and how so other i have a


---------20:26----------
feeling we're going to cover a lot of


---------20:27----------
terminology today okay


---------20:28----------
so um so this is also where like buddha


---------20:32----------
buddha talked about something called


---------20:36----------
which is suffering it's the sanskrit


---------20:38----------
word for suffering


---------20:39----------
and what he said is that the root of


---------20:41----------
suffering is actually attachment to


---------20:42----------
expectation


---------20:44----------
and so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------20:47----------
you know


---------20:48----------
someone would do something and then it's


---------20:50----------
the value system that you


---------20:52----------
impose upon it that causes you the


---------20:55----------
suffering


---------20:56----------
right and so it's it's a really radical


---------20:59----------
way to look at life because what that


---------21:01----------
sort of posits


---------21:03----------
is that suffering or contentment is like


---------21:06----------
actually yours to control and that when


---------21:09----------
we let other people


---------21:12----------
when we when we so far i mean most


---------21:15----------
people


---------21:16----------
actually seed control over their their


---------21:18----------
well-being to the people around them


---------21:20----------
because they fall into those value


---------21:22----------
systems


---------21:23----------
right and when you start to step away


---------21:25----------
from those things or notice that your


---------21:27----------
your reactions to the thing is actually


---------21:28----------
what causes you the suffering


---------21:30----------
that's when people start to move towards


---------21:33----------
this


---------21:33----------
concept called enlightenment which is


---------21:36----------
sort of the stepwise process


---------21:37----------
of of eventually getting to the point


---------21:39----------
where like


---------21:40----------
you have essentially no reactions


---------21:44----------
um for as a scientist i'll also kind of


---------21:47----------
differentiate for a moment that


---------21:49----------
dukkha is different from pleasure and


---------21:50----------
pain so you can still experience


---------21:53----------
pleasure


---------21:53----------
and pain both with duke


---------21:56----------
but it sort of operates on a different


---------21:58----------
axis it's not like the same thing


---------22:01----------
okay so it's not that you're it


---------22:03----------
impervious to pain


---------22:04----------
it's that you're impervious to suffering


---------22:07----------
if you become enlightened


---------22:08----------
but if you imagine if you're enlightened


---------22:10----------
and you give childbirth like you have


---------22:12----------
childbirth you'll still be in a shitload


---------22:14----------
of pain


---------22:14----------
right um so


---------22:18----------
any thoughts about that concept or how


---------22:19----------
that relates to kind of your


---------22:21----------
self-reflections


---------22:23----------
yeah i think it makes a lot of sense um


---------22:26----------
i


---------22:27----------
i think sort of the way i i was


---------22:30----------
a while ago was that and i think this


---------22:33----------
sort of falls into the parasocial side


---------22:34----------
of things as well that


---------22:35----------
i've i did things for a certain amount


---------22:38----------
of time and then so many people told me


---------22:40----------
that i was right or i was smart or


---------22:42----------
you do this but this other person does


---------22:43----------
this and you're so much better than them


---------22:45----------
for doing it this way


---------22:46----------
that i feel like that sort of worm got


---------22:48----------
in my brain


---------22:49----------
a while back and it was as much as it is


---------22:52----------
praising me


---------22:53----------
and it's it's great at the time and it's


---------22:55----------
a compliment


---------22:56----------
it was putting down the other person and


---------22:58----------
it essentially built me on this platform


---------23:00----------
higher than they were in their brain


---------23:03----------
um and i feel like for me after a while


---------23:06----------
of hearing that


---------23:07----------
i i couldn't really tell


---------23:10----------
what it was doing to me anymore and


---------23:13----------
i started to realize like both extremes


---------23:15----------
of like the negative and positive


---------23:17----------
spectrum can influence your brain in


---------23:19----------
negative ways


---------23:21----------
i think yeah i i was about to say i i


---------23:23----------
think you may not have known what that


---------23:24----------
worm was doing to you there by the way


---------23:26----------
there's a sanskrit word for that worm


---------23:27----------
too


---------23:28----------
what is it ahamkada


---------23:31----------
okay i'm gonna forget all of these


---------23:33----------
that's okay so ahamkara is


---------23:36----------
technically translated as the i feeling


---------23:39----------
so it's the feeling of like i i am


---------23:42----------
dot dot dot oh i thought you said like


---------23:45----------
eyeball i


---------23:46----------
oh no and and it gets loosely translated


---------23:49----------
the closest word that we have in english


---------23:51----------
is ego


---------23:52----------
right but it's not just ego so like the


---------23:56----------
ahamkada has a couple of like


---------23:58----------
interesting attributes


---------23:59----------
anything that compares you to another


---------24:02----------
person is a hum god is the eye feeling


---------24:05----------
okay and and so um the other key thing


---------24:08----------
you know if you listen to buddha is that


---------24:10----------
ahamkar even though it makes you feel


---------24:12----------
pleasure is always going to be a source


---------24:15----------
of duk


---------24:17----------
okay what do you think about that


---------24:20----------
yeah that makes sense yep like i said i


---------24:23----------
think you understand all this stuff i'm


---------24:24----------
just going to give you terminology for


---------24:26----------
it today


---------24:27----------
well it's good to reaffirm it as well


---------24:28----------
and kind of hear it again so you kind of


---------24:31----------
stay on the path


---------24:32----------
and and i think that your your neon is


---------24:34----------
very very clear to me because you used


---------24:36----------
the word


---------24:37----------
worm right and and so this is like it's


---------24:39----------
such a beautiful word for a honk gun


---------24:41----------
because it kind of like burrows in and


---------24:44----------
you don't really notice


---------24:45----------
its negative effects and as you pointed


---------24:48----------
out you feel


---------24:49----------
good in the moment right like it's


---------24:51----------
pleasing for your ego


---------24:53----------
and then like but once it like kind of


---------24:54----------
burrows in like it starts like doing


---------24:56----------
this weird kind of damage


---------24:58----------
yeah like you know what i mean oh yeah


---------25:01----------
for sure


---------25:02----------
can you tell us a little bit about that


---------25:04----------
well i i was gonna say i feel like it


---------25:05----------
happens to a lot of people


---------25:07----------
in this industry um and the


---------25:09----------
self-awareness kind of evaporates after


---------25:11----------
a while and the humility kind of


---------25:13----------
disappears


---------25:14----------
a lot of times through no fault of their


---------25:16----------
own because a lot of people just tell


---------25:17----------
you that


---------25:18----------
you're amazing and when you become


---------25:20----------
successful at doing that and people tell


---------25:22----------
you you're amazing you tend to think


---------25:23----------
that your way is right


---------25:25----------
um and then any sort of criticism or any


---------25:28----------
sort of feedback


---------25:29----------
becomes an attack and then i i found


---------25:32----------
myself getting very defensive about


---------25:34----------
things in the past


---------25:35----------
um maybe not publicly but definitely


---------25:38----------
when somebody said something about me


---------25:39----------
online it's like


---------25:40----------
well who do they think they are without


---------25:42----------
and then it's like wait


---------25:43----------
wait why am i reacting that way yes


---------25:47----------
it's not it's not a good way of reacting


---------25:49----------
to things so i'm gonna tunnel down into


---------25:51----------
that for a moment so a criticism becomes


---------25:53----------
an attack


---------25:54----------
so what i want you to notice there is a


---------25:56----------
criticism is directed at who


---------25:59----------
all right what i should say


---------26:02----------
i mean for me it would have been a


---------26:05----------
jacksepticeye and not


---------26:06----------
me as a person sort of exactly right so


---------26:09----------
like


---------26:10----------
like and i think that's the attack part


---------26:11----------
so what i was going to say is that


---------26:13----------
someone can criticize let's say a piece


---------26:15----------
of content that you make


---------26:17----------
right but when the hum car is strong


---------26:19----------
it's not


---------26:20----------
you don't you take that attack on your


---------26:24----------
content and you it turns into an attack


---------26:26----------
on you


---------26:29----------
right like does that make sense yep like


---------26:31----------
they're not actually criticizing you as


---------26:33----------
a person but when the ahm god is strong


---------26:36----------
you sort of like taunt their aggro and


---------26:39----------
then like it's pointed to you as a


---------26:40----------
person


---------26:41----------
and that's why they use a hum god is the


---------26:43----------
i feeling so if you think about it


---------26:45----------
you know you inject yourself into their


---------26:48----------
criticism


---------26:49----------
yeah um which is good so it's it's it


---------26:52----------
seems like you've learned how to


---------26:54----------
not do that yeah i mean it crops up


---------26:57----------
every now and then


---------26:58----------
but i think i've gotten a lot better at


---------27:00----------
like ego checking myself


---------27:03----------
um and kind of stopping that trail of


---------27:04----------
thought before it becomes like i


---------27:06----------
remember in the past it would be a lot


---------27:07----------
of like


---------27:08----------
i need to tweet out something and tell


---------27:10----------
everybody because this one person


---------27:12----------
online said something so then i ended up


---------27:14----------
thinking that everybody was saying this


---------27:16----------
about me or if four people said it


---------27:19----------
and it's like well everybody's talking


---------27:21----------
about that now and then you have to


---------27:23----------
like respond to it but i think i've


---------27:24----------
gotten a lot better at just not


---------27:26----------
responding to it and letting it kind of


---------27:27----------
just sit


---------27:28----------
in the ether um and realizing that


---------27:31----------
because it became this weird thing where


---------27:33----------
jacksepticeye became this like being


---------27:35----------
outside of me and outside the audience


---------27:37----------
it was like everybody was watching this


---------27:39----------
other entity


---------27:40----------
that i didn't even have control over


---------27:42----------
anymore because the community kind of


---------27:44----------
took it upon itself


---------27:45----------
to build it into whatever they wanted to


---------27:47----------
and in some ways that was good but


---------27:49----------
i think the feeling of me as a person


---------27:51----------
separate from that kind of


---------27:53----------
um evaporated yeah so this is where


---------27:57----------
just to give you once again a little bit


---------27:58----------
of a structure


---------28:00----------
which i you know isn't true it's just


---------28:02----------
for you to consider


---------28:04----------
way against your experience and then you


---------28:06----------
be the scientist


---------28:07----------
and conclude what you want to so one is


---------28:10----------
that ahamkar


---------28:11----------
and self-awareness are at opposite ends


---------28:13----------
of a spectrum


---------28:14----------
okay so the more egotistical you become


---------28:17----------
the less self-aware you become


---------28:19----------
and furthermore that i think the your


---------28:21----------
awareness


---------28:22----------
at one point was completely absorbed in


---------28:25----------
the identity of jacksepticeye


---------28:27----------
and that you felt a lot of suffering at


---------28:29----------
that time and the more that you've been


---------28:31----------
able to externalize


---------28:33----------
jacksepticeye the more you've been able


---------28:36----------
to separate who you


---------28:37----------
are from the character i think the more


---------28:40----------
at peace


---------28:41----------
you'll become yeah for sure about that


---------28:44----------
okay i think there was a lot of there


---------28:47----------
was a lot of fear in the past of


---------28:48----------
separating them because then


---------28:50----------
a lot of people tend to think that oh


---------28:52----------
well what you're doing is jacksepticeye


---------28:53----------
is fake then because it's a character


---------28:55----------
that you're playing and essentially it


---------28:58----------
is because it's a persona


---------28:59----------
it's like the best version of me that i


---------29:02----------
want to show the world


---------29:03----------
um and it's me and my zone and it's me


---------29:05----------
going to work and doing what i do


---------29:07----------
um and i always worry that if i talked


---------29:09----------
about separating them and setting more


---------29:11----------
boundaries


---------29:12----------
that people wouldn't think of what i was


---------29:15----------
doing as genuine


---------29:16----------
anymore which it obviously is i don't


---------29:18----------
think i could do this for this long


---------29:20----------
and be this excited about what i do if


---------29:23----------
it was all an


---------29:23----------
act and so i know this is going to sound


---------29:26----------
weird but


---------29:26----------
where does that fear come from


---------29:32----------
i don't know so that comes from the


---------29:35----------
ahamkar too


---------29:36----------
because if you think about it what are


---------29:38----------
you afraid of you're afraid of how they


---------29:40----------
will perceive you


---------29:41----------
do you see that yeah and so like all


---------29:45----------
that crap


---------29:45----------
always comes back to the amkar okay how


---------29:48----------
they will see you


---------29:49----------
and so like it's sort of like you were


---------29:50----------
afraid of separating from the ahamkar


---------29:53----------
because then like they would see you a


---------29:54----------
particular way but that right


---------29:56----------
that fear is a hum guard does that make


---------29:58----------
sense yep


---------30:00----------
and so it's it's weird because like it


---------30:02----------
fears for itself it fears for the


---------30:04----------
dissolution of itself


---------30:06----------
it warns you against abandoning it


---------30:10----------
okay what do you think about that


---------30:15----------
uh could you go into it a little bit


---------30:17----------
more yeah


---------30:18----------
so like i i know it sounds kind of weird


---------30:21----------
but


---------30:22----------
you know you were afraid of what people


---------30:23----------
would think of you


---------30:25----------
right but that thought in and of itself


---------30:28----------
so like the reason you're not separating


---------30:30----------
from


---------30:31----------
your k like like jacks up there's


---------30:33----------
jacksepticeye and then there's the real


---------30:35----------
you right


---------30:36----------
and when you were thinking about


---------30:37----------
separating the real you from


---------30:38----------
jacksepticeye


---------30:40----------
something in your mind warned you


---------30:42----------
against it


---------30:43----------
and it said jack don't do that because


---------30:46----------
if you do


---------30:47----------
if you separate the ego from your true


---------30:50----------
self


---------30:51----------
then what will people say about you they


---------30:53----------
will say you are not genuine


---------30:55----------
but that thought in and of itself is


---------30:57----------
coming from the ahamka


---------30:59----------
right so it's sort of like you know an


---------31:01----------
abusive person telling you


---------31:03----------
not to break up with them because you'll


---------31:05----------
always be alone


---------31:07----------
right yeah it's getting kind of weird


---------31:10----------
and abstract but like


---------31:11----------
it's just interesting that you know i


---------31:12----------
think a lot of your thoughts the more


---------31:14----------
that we tunnel down into this


---------31:15----------
i think a lot of what is going to have


---------31:17----------
kept you trapped is going to be that


---------31:19----------
uh-hum god


---------31:20----------
like a lot of your hanging out and stuff


---------31:22----------
yeah for sure


---------31:24----------
any questions so far no


---------31:27----------
i think you've been very good at


---------31:28----------
explaining things how do you feel about


---------31:30----------
the direction of this conversation


---------31:32----------
it's great i love it okay this is the


---------31:35----------
[ __ ] that i live for


---------31:36----------
okay um yeah i think uh like i was


---------31:39----------
saying earlier sometimes people will


---------31:41----------
sort of have an


---------31:42----------
expectation that if someone has gone


---------31:43----------
through something like losing a parent


---------31:45----------
like


---------31:45----------
we're gonna you know cry and talk about


---------31:47----------
your dad and all that kind of stuff and


---------31:49----------
you know i'm sorry to disappoint which i


---------31:51----------
know once again is like what people come


---------31:53----------
to dr k to see


---------31:55----------
yeah and so even right now i have a


---------31:57----------
little bit of a struggle within me about


---------31:59----------
oh should i ask him about things that


---------32:01----------
are like


---------32:01----------
deeply emotional and then oh jack to


---------32:03----------
accept a guy's gonna cry


---------32:05----------
and then it's gonna be a really good


---------32:06----------
moment everyone's gonna love it and


---------32:08----------
there's gonna be lots of hearts in chat


---------32:09----------
you'll get


---------32:10----------
you'll get your clickbait yeah


---------32:12----------
absolutely right and so


---------32:14----------
sometimes what we have to do is like not


---------32:16----------
give in to that thing


---------32:17----------
even though that may lead to more growth


---------32:20----------
but what are we here for


---------32:21----------
we're not here for growth yeah that's


---------32:24----------
that's one of the things that i


---------32:26----------
i think a lot of the burnout that i've


---------32:28----------
felt about my own channel was also


---------32:30----------
feeling burnout against


---------32:31----------
other creators at the same time i think


---------32:34----------
it was like burn out against


---------32:36----------
against the system in a way the way


---------32:38----------
certain people react


---------32:40----------
to the way the system works like the


---------32:41----------
algorithm or whatever


---------32:43----------
terminology you want to use for it that


---------32:48----------
i think a lot of people show a certain


---------32:51----------
version of themselves but then when it


---------32:52----------
gets down to it it's very it's a very


---------32:55----------
insular sort of


---------32:56----------
thing that's happening on youtube all


---------32:58----------
the time is that everybody's kind of


---------32:59----------
fighting for themselves


---------33:01----------
and if they have a chance to get more


---------33:02----------
views out of something they'll go for


---------33:04----------
that and i


---------33:05----------
for a while it felt like everyone was


---------33:06----------
kind of like climbing over each other


---------33:09----------
of course not everybody's like that


---------33:10----------
there are some very good genuine


---------33:11----------
kind-hearted people there who are just


---------33:13----------
there to have fun


---------33:14----------
and i've tried to sort of vibe with them


---------33:16----------
and kind of


---------33:17----------
magnetize myself towards them more and


---------33:20----------
get surrounded by those types of people


---------33:21----------
but i think


---------33:23----------
it's just something that no one really


---------33:25----------
wants to talk about how everyone's kind


---------33:26----------
of like


---------33:27----------
fighting each other just to get to the


---------33:29----------
top and then it's like you get to the


---------33:30----------
top it's like well


---------33:31----------
what's there like what are you aiming


---------33:34----------
for it feels like this sort of


---------33:36----------
idea of growth is kind of leading people


---------33:38----------
to nowhere


---------33:39----------
that you get to the top and then what


---------33:42----------
happens you kind of sacrifice


---------33:44----------
friendships or you sacrifice personal


---------33:46----------
health and


---------33:47----------
mental health and your own time away


---------33:49----------
from everything and everybody's so


---------33:50----------
entrapped in their work and


---------33:52----------
always on and working for themselves


---------33:54----------
constantly all the time


---------33:55----------
why do you think that people get trapped


---------33:57----------
by the idea of growth


---------34:00----------
i think just the metrics that were shown


---------34:02----------
all the time kind of do it and the


---------34:04----------
audience kind of reaffirming that like


---------34:05----------
oh you're dropping off


---------34:07----------
well last time you got this many views


---------34:08----------
on something well this time you're


---------34:10----------
getting


---------34:10----------
less or this person did the game and


---------34:13----------
they got


---------34:13----------
x number but you did it and you got y


---------34:15----------
number like


---------34:17----------
they're so much better and then people


---------34:18----------
have a fear of they have a fear if they


---------34:20----------
don't stay on this treadmill


---------34:22----------
constantly that they're just gonna fall


---------34:23----------
off and they can never get back onto it


---------34:25----------
again and that everyone's gonna forget


---------34:26----------
about them


---------34:27----------
i've tried to like i've had a bunch of


---------34:29----------
friends especially after i took that


---------34:31----------
break


---------34:32----------
who came to me and talked about it i was


---------34:34----------
like no it's the best thing you can do


---------34:35----------
like no one's going to leave you


---------34:36----------
if some people will and that's fine


---------34:38----------
you're going to have to just deal with


---------34:39----------
that


---------34:40----------
but i feel like the people who are


---------34:42----------
actually genuinely there


---------34:44----------
to just have fun and watch your content


---------34:46----------
are the people who kind of stick around


---------34:47----------
and for me that was kind of a hard


---------34:49----------
hurdle to get over as well because i


---------34:51----------
used to do two videos


---------34:53----------
every single day for like five years and


---------34:56----------
i never missed an upload time it was


---------34:57----------
always the same time every day and i was


---------34:59----------
so proud of it


---------35:00----------
but then i became the guy who was


---------35:02----------
uploading at the exact same time and i


---------35:04----------
was just so


---------35:05----------
consistent and i worked so hard and i


---------35:07----------
realized that i didn't really want to be


---------35:09----------
that guy


---------35:10----------
and just work for the sake of having


---------35:12----------
that title


---------35:14----------
um and there was more important things


---------35:16----------
outside of that


---------35:17----------
again needing to realize if i could


---------35:18----------
exist outside of that work ethic


---------35:21----------
how did you realize what was important


---------35:25----------
um i don't know i think i just


---------35:29----------
physically and mentally got exhausted


---------35:31----------
first and then started questioning


---------35:32----------
things


---------35:33----------
and then uh being in like a really


---------35:35----------
healthy relationship now that kind of


---------35:37----------
gives me the support


---------35:38----------
and really wanting to spend time in that


---------35:42----------
um and swim around in that relationship


---------35:44----------
and enjoy it and have fun with it and


---------35:46----------
just kind of like hang out and do things


---------35:48----------
together meant a lot more to me because


---------35:50----------
i


---------35:51----------
when i started off my channel it was


---------35:52----------
like trying to find that sort of family


---------35:54----------
or that sort of relationship so i dealt


---------35:56----------
i dove head first into that parasocial


---------35:59----------
aspect of it where i


---------36:00----------
i craved that sort of attention from


---------36:02----------
people because it was like finally


---------36:04----------
like-minded people who hang out with me


---------36:06----------
and we all do the same sort of thing we


---------36:07----------
can all


---------36:08----------
it kind of felt like a bunch of friends


---------36:10----------
were showing up each and every day


---------36:12----------
and then realizing that that


---------36:15----------
that sort of feeling and that sort of


---------36:17----------
happiness was never going to come from


---------36:19----------
an external source and the other people


---------36:21----------
that i had to sort of


---------36:23----------
find it within me and i watched a really


---------36:26----------
nice video about like buddhism on like a


---------36:29----------
ted talk


---------36:30----------
where they talked about like well why


---------36:32----------
are you happy i was like well this


---------36:34----------
happened today


---------36:34----------
and you realize well that thing made you


---------36:36----------
happy and that's not a consistent source


---------36:38----------
of happiness that


---------36:39----------
you can't have that same thing every


---------36:40----------
single day so you need to find a better


---------36:43----------
way of having consistent


---------36:44----------
internal happiness to try and like i'm


---------36:46----------
butchering it but


---------36:48----------
it was that idea of finding more inner


---------36:50----------
peace and i think a lot of people sort


---------36:52----------
of rolled their eyes at that but that


---------36:53----------
was like fascinating to me


---------36:55----------
why did they were butchering it


---------36:58----------
because i feel like they just had such a


---------37:00----------
magical way with words


---------37:02----------
and i feel like synopsizing it didn't do


---------37:04----------
it justice


---------37:05----------
because it had such a profound impact on


---------37:07----------
me when i heard it


---------37:09----------
that i would like people to hear it the


---------37:10----------
same way and potentially have the


---------37:12----------
same reaction


---------37:15----------
so this is where we get subtle so that's


---------37:17----------
a really wonderful thing


---------37:19----------
and at the same time what are you doing


---------37:21----------
to the words that you say


---------37:24----------
devaluing them yep and you're comparing


---------37:28----------
them to the ted talk


---------37:30----------
right there it is again you see how good


---------37:32----------
they are at explaining buddhism and how


---------37:34----------
bad i am


---------37:35----------
there's the aham god so jack if you


---------37:38----------
really want people to hear it i can


---------37:40----------
guarantee you that


---------37:42----------
what you said was like beautifully


---------37:43----------
explained


---------37:45----------
and the only thing that got in the way


---------37:48----------
because you


---------37:48----------
know this right like why do you think


---------37:50----------
that the person giving the ted talk


---------37:52----------
understands it better than you do true


---------37:55----------
[Music]


---------37:56----------
and so the only thing that's getting in


---------37:57----------
the way is your own ego


---------38:00----------
right so if you've learned something and


---------38:02----------
you have something to share with the


---------38:04----------
world


---------38:05----------
then i know because i know i know you


---------38:06----------
understand this then just


---------38:08----------
[ __ ] share it and for the people that


---------38:10----------
are in the frame of mind to hear it


---------38:13----------
and are ready to hear it they'll hear it


---------38:15----------
true and for the people that aren't


---------38:17----------
ready to hear it they won't hear it


---------38:18----------
but that like you can't control that


---------38:20----------
right all you can control is what you


---------38:23----------
put out there yeah that's true


---------38:27----------
now if you want to if you want to get


---------38:28----------
like psychological and all that kind of


---------38:30----------
stuff then we've got to talk about this


---------38:31----------
whole like craving attention and family


---------38:33----------
and parasocial relationships


---------38:34----------
but that's good let's go baby okay it's


---------38:37----------
going to be a different tone okay i'm


---------38:38----------
going to ask you like


---------38:39----------
personal questions about feelings and


---------38:41----------
[ __ ] like that it's going to be more of


---------38:42----------
what


---------38:43----------
people you know come here to see sure


---------38:46----------
okay so tell me about your family


---------38:48----------
growing up


---------38:50----------
um it's a we had a pretty big family so


---------38:54----------
there was seven of us


---------38:55----------
total um my my dad was


---------38:58----------
an older man he was in his 80s when he


---------39:01----------
passed


---------39:02----------
so he would have been 85 this year so he


---------39:05----------
was he was


---------39:06----------
much much older than i was


---------39:09----------
so there was always this sort of


---------39:10----------
generational gap to things


---------39:13----------
and i think my brothers and my


---------39:16----------
especially my older sister


---------39:17----------
they i feel like they had a stronger


---------39:20----------
relationship


---------39:20----------
with him growing up because he was just


---------39:23----------
more


---------39:24----------
present he was there he he was in sort


---------39:26----------
of like his prime years so to speak


---------39:28----------
um so they always had some sort of


---------39:31----------
connection whether it be


---------39:32----------
negative or positive there was there was


---------39:34----------
at least some sort of like emotional


---------39:35----------
attachment


---------39:36----------
there that sounds


---------39:40----------
kind of sad yeah


---------39:44----------
i i've often told people that neither of


---------39:46----------
my parents have never


---------39:47----------
verbalized that they love me


---------39:50----------
in a way and it's the thing that i can


---------39:52----------
tell that they did


---------39:53----------
and my dad has always talked about how


---------39:55----------
he was proud of the stuff that i'm doing


---------39:56----------
especially now


---------39:57----------
and i can tell that he always like


---------39:59----------
worked for his family


---------40:00----------
and he was he he definitely deeply cared


---------40:03----------
it's just


---------40:04----------
he's an older irishman from a different


---------40:06----------
generation so he just


---------40:07----------
can't he can't verbalize things


---------40:10----------
camper blaze's thoughts his dreams his


---------40:12----------
goals


---------40:13----------
and i feel like that was sort of the


---------40:15----------
legacy that i wanted to


---------40:16----------
bring with me to sort of like


---------40:20----------
be that person for him in a way while


---------40:22----------
also learning from that experience


---------40:24----------
how do you mean by that what do you mean


---------40:26----------
by that


---------40:28----------
because i i wonder about like his goals


---------40:30----------
and his aspirations and his dreams


---------40:32----------
and if he saw enough of the world and if


---------40:34----------
he


---------40:35----------
met enough people or if he i don't know


---------40:39----------
i just


---------40:39----------
hope that he had fulfilling experiences


---------40:42----------
in his life


---------40:43----------
and i feel like for me having


---------40:46----------
seen stuff like that and somebody who


---------40:48----------
just works all the time and works really


---------40:50----------
hard and for a good purpose


---------40:51----------
i want to make sure that i'm just not


---------40:53----------
working all the time i want to make sure


---------40:55----------
that i take the time


---------40:56----------
to let people know that i love them and


---------40:58----------
to share my feelings and to


---------41:00----------
openly talk about things and keep up


---------41:03----------
with my family and make sure that i'm


---------41:05----------
seeing parts of the world that i want to


---------41:06----------
instead of putting it on the back burner


---------41:08----------
and realizing oh there'll be time for


---------41:09----------
that


---------41:10----------
later i want to make sure that i'm not


---------41:12----------
just working myself to the bone


---------41:14----------
doing what i do here for the sake of


---------41:17----------
what other people expect me to do and


---------41:20----------
that hey i might take a month off every


---------41:22----------
now and then and


---------41:23----------
go do whatever the hell i want to do


---------41:26----------
it sounds like you've become acutely


---------41:28----------
aware of the value of time


---------41:31----------
yeah probably through some


---------41:35----------
through some unfortunate circumstances


---------41:37----------
um and having to go through


---------41:39----------
kind of a marathon emotionally to get


---------41:42----------
there but


---------41:42----------
i feel like i feel like the sort of


---------41:45----------
emotional strength i've come away with


---------41:47----------
has definitely been worth it and i've


---------41:49----------
definitely matured emotionally


---------41:51----------
a lot over the last like year or so


---------41:54----------
yeah you seem like an absolute beast man


---------41:57----------
i was watching


---------41:58----------
i don't know about that i was watching


---------42:01----------
you play bloodborne and one shot things


---------42:03----------
with the whirly gig saw


---------42:04----------
like oh hell yeah it was it was the


---------42:06----------
first time i'd seen your stream and i


---------42:08----------
think the only time i've seen your


---------42:09----------
stream


---------42:10----------
um wow and i was surprised because like


---------42:12----------
what happened is i someone recommended


---------42:13----------
bloodborne to me in my in


---------42:15----------
my channel because i was looking for


---------42:16----------
something to play good show


---------42:18----------
yeah it was fantastic and so then i was


---------42:20----------
like oh like let me just see you know if


---------42:22----------
anyone's playing bloodborne


---------42:23----------
because like you know the game is like


---------42:24----------
five years old now or something right


---------42:27----------
i saw you just one shotting things and


---------42:28----------
that's what i think you're doing today


---------42:30----------
you're just like one-shotting [ __ ] like


---------42:31----------
left and right bro


---------42:34----------
well i'll take that your way any day of


---------42:36----------
the week


---------42:37----------
um so tell me a little bit about uh so


---------42:41----------
how old was your dad when you were born


---------42:45----------
um late 50s okay


---------42:48----------
and how much older are your siblings


---------42:52----------
my oldest sister is mid-40s


---------42:55----------
and my other brothers are in their 40s i


---------42:58----------
think one of them is about to hit 40


---------43:00----------
or is 40. i'm bad at my family's age


---------43:02----------
that still means that your dad it sounds


---------43:04----------
like was


---------43:05----------
40 when he had his first child


---------43:08----------
yeah okay and how old is your ballpark


---------43:11----------
how old is your mom like about the same


---------43:13----------
age or no she's


---------43:15----------
she's 20 years younger than him and so


---------43:17----------
there's a massive


---------43:18----------
age difference between them as well so


---------43:21----------
and you said your dad was


---------43:22----------
50 when you were born in late 50s yeah


---------43:25----------
late 50s okay so then your mom was


---------43:28----------
late 30s when you were born about that


---------43:31----------
yeah


---------43:32----------
mid to late 30s and and what do you


---------43:35----------
remember about kind of like


---------43:37----------
growing up i remember that


---------43:41----------
my dad had retired when i was at a young


---------43:44----------
age


---------43:45----------
it's like one of the earlier memories i


---------43:47----------
have of him retiring and they gave him a


---------43:49----------
lamp


---------43:50----------
for retiring like here's years of


---------43:52----------
servitude here's a [ __ ] lamp


---------43:55----------
and i remember the party for that and i


---------43:58----------
was taking pictures of it on like


---------44:01----------
pre-digital photographs and i remember


---------44:04----------
i remember it was the first time i ever


---------44:06----------
got to have like a camera in my hand and


---------44:07----------
i got to take pictures of things and i


---------44:09----------
took about 40 pictures of this


---------44:10----------
[ __ ] lamp that were all pointless and


---------44:13----------
useless and


---------44:14----------
really badly shot i would love to say


---------44:16----------
that i had like spielberg's eye at a


---------44:17----------
young age but i didn't


---------44:19----------
um but i remember that vividly


---------44:22----------
i i don't know why i think it was just a


---------44:24----------
turning point and kind of realizing how


---------44:26----------
much older my dad was than everybody


---------44:28----------
else


---------44:29----------
uh or everybody else's dads because he


---------44:31----------
was retiring and their theirs wasn't


---------44:34----------
um and i remember then the


---------44:37----------
when he was retired he would always he


---------44:39----------
was like the


---------44:40----------
the stay-at-home dad then i i would go


---------44:43----------
to school and


---------44:43----------
when i come home he would always cook me


---------44:45----------
my dinner and he was always the person


---------44:47----------
who was there


---------44:48----------
it was just me and him in the house for


---------44:49----------
like a couple of hours after school


---------44:51----------
every day and i think that those were a


---------44:54----------
lot more formative for me than i


---------44:56----------
realized at the time so having him cook


---------45:00----------
me dinner every day was always something


---------45:01----------
that i


---------45:02----------
i now greatly appreciated realizing


---------45:06----------
kind of like all the hard work he did


---------45:07----------
growing up and when he was retired he


---------45:09----------
was like still


---------45:09----------
taking care of me um and then


---------45:13----------
like 10 years or so ago when we moved


---------45:16----------
and it was just kind of like us


---------45:19----------
like to cut a long story short i lived


---------45:20----------
in a log cabin in the middle of the


---------45:22----------
woods for like four years


---------45:24----------
um and my parents lived in one as well


---------45:26----------
so i would cook them dinner


---------45:28----------
every day sort of like the cycle kind of


---------45:30----------
like continued


---------45:32----------
at that point and i kind of took care of


---------45:33----------
them every day


---------45:35----------
but i i always remember him doing that


---------45:38----------
for me when i was a kid


---------45:40----------
what are you feeling right now good


---------45:44----------
it's nice to remember the good things


---------45:46----------
that happened with my dad and


---------45:48----------
kind of recalling all of these memories


---------45:49----------
that i didn't realize were kind of like


---------45:51----------
in my brain and then when something like


---------45:53----------
this happens and you're


---------45:54----------
i want to reminisce and i want to


---------45:56----------
remember and think about him fondly it


---------45:58----------
was like oh yeah these were all


---------46:00----------
great times and we had some good years


---------46:03----------
what would you cook uh what would he


---------46:05----------
cook you for dinner


---------46:07----------
he would cook me like potato waffles um


---------46:11----------
i don't know if many people outside of


---------46:13----------
like uk ireland or whatever would have


---------46:15----------
those and like fish fingers which you


---------46:17----------
guys would call fish sticks


---------46:19----------
and he would cut me that every day and i


---------46:20----------
would just have a big blob of ketchup on


---------46:21----------
the side of the plate


---------46:23----------
i would always say that i went to my


---------46:24----------
friend's house at one point and they his


---------46:26----------
mother coke [ __ ] fish fingers i was like


---------46:29----------
no my dad's the best at cooking them you


---------46:30----------
don't you don't know what you're doing


---------46:33----------
and what would what would you make for


---------46:34----------
them when y'all lived in the log cabin


---------46:37----------
um a main favorite was like lasagna


---------46:41----------
i always cook a mean lasagna and they


---------46:43----------
love that but then


---------46:44----------
i when i was trying to like get


---------46:45----------
healthier and like bulk up and work out


---------46:47----------
and all that kind of stuff in my early


---------46:49----------
20s


---------46:49----------
i would cook them like just really


---------46:52----------
healthy like stir fries and


---------46:53----------
like just try and cut out as much fat


---------46:56----------
and try and take care of them


---------46:58----------
as much as possible because i feel like


---------47:00----------
they were just very


---------47:01----------
indulgent because it's just it's easy to


---------47:03----------
do that


---------47:04----------
how did they feel about that i don't


---------47:07----------
think my mother liked it too much


---------47:08----------
because


---------47:09----------
to her it was taking out a lot of the


---------47:10----------
flavor but i think my dad liked it


---------47:12----------
yeah that's wonderful how did you guys


---------47:15----------
wind up


---------47:16----------
and you know i know you mentioned


---------47:17----------
earlier that there are particular


---------47:19----------
boundaries you want to keep in terms of


---------47:20----------
what's private and what isn't


---------47:22----------
um you know you'd mentioned that you


---------47:24----------
were pretty happy with what you shared


---------47:25----------
in terms of the youtube video about your


---------47:27----------
dad so if i


---------47:28----------
ask anything that it feels off limits to


---------47:30----------
you just let me know and we don't have


---------47:31----------
to


---------47:32----------
you don't have to answer okay sure i am


---------47:34----------
i find myself curious though how does


---------47:36----------
you know how do you wind up in a log


---------47:37----------
cabin with your parents for four years


---------47:40----------
or it sounds like you guys had separate


---------47:41----------
log cabins


---------47:43----------
yeah it was weird we we sold our house


---------47:46----------
and then we moved because my


---------47:47----------
mother wanted to get closer to her


---------47:48----------
mother so we moved in like next door


---------47:50----------
because she was in her uh


---------47:52----------
later years as well so we moved like log


---------47:55----------
cabins at the time sounded


---------47:56----------
like fancy and it sounded like a nice


---------47:59----------
dream sort of getaway sort of thing


---------48:00----------
everyone thinks that they want us to


---------48:02----------
live in a log cabin in the woods


---------48:03----------
that [ __ ] is cold you do not want to


---------48:05----------
live in one of those yeah oh i'm with


---------48:06----------
you


---------48:07----------
i think it's wonderful to spend a


---------48:09----------
weekend in a lob cat


---------48:10----------
log cabin oh yeah i i don't know about


---------48:13----------
living there


---------48:15----------
no it was tough i it's like


---------48:18----------
i mean i guess a lot of texans can


---------48:20----------
relate right now is that


---------48:21----------
my pipes would freeze every winter and


---------48:24----------
that ice would like come up to the


---------48:25----------
insides of the walls


---------48:27----------
all the time so we had to get like a


---------48:28----------
stronger heater for the cabin to kind of


---------48:31----------
like make sure i didn't get hypothermia


---------48:34----------
yeah


---------48:35----------
for like a year it was really really


---------48:36----------
rough with the cold and


---------48:39----------
i think that's where i kind of i


---------48:40----------
realized that i didn't want to like


---------48:42----------
this i didn't want that to be my life i


---------48:44----------
didn't want that to be like


---------48:45----------
what i did all day every day and that's


---------48:48----------
kind of where i started my youtube


---------48:49----------
channel


---------48:49----------
maybe out of spite of that sort of


---------48:52----------
living arrangement


---------48:53----------
can you tell us a little bit about what


---------48:55----------
inspired you to start making content on


---------48:56----------
youtube


---------48:58----------
i i watched a lot of youtube back in the


---------49:01----------
day i


---------49:02----------
i watched i was playing battlefield 3 a


---------49:04----------
lot back then


---------49:05----------
and i just got a gaming pc for the first


---------49:07----------
time when i was like 21


---------49:08----------
and i was fascinated by i was like how


---------49:10----------
are people so good at this and how are


---------49:12----------
they so quick and


---------49:13----------
i can't even like figure out how to move


---------49:14----------
the mouse without taking it off the


---------49:16----------
thing and i felt like such an old man


---------49:18----------
and then i


---------49:19----------
i have an upon a channel called level


---------49:20----------
cap gaming who still makes content


---------49:22----------
um a really nice guy and he i was


---------49:26----------
watching him a lot and then one time he


---------49:27----------
mentioned that he did it as a job


---------49:29----------
that kind of blew my mind open and i i


---------49:32----------
never like intended to start doing it as


---------49:34----------
a job it was never my goal


---------49:36----------
but i thought man people do this like


---------49:37----------
full time that's so cool i was like i


---------49:39----------
wonder what that's


---------49:40----------
like to do and i kind of got into it and


---------49:42----------
i was like well i'm playing games all


---------49:43----------
day anyway


---------49:44----------
it would be cool to learn how to edit


---------49:45----------
and talk over them and i've always kind


---------49:47----------
of been


---------49:48----------
i've always been fascinated by like


---------49:49----------
acting and showmanship


---------49:51----------
and things like that and maybe being the


---------49:53----------
baby at the family i


---------49:54----------
i loved being the center of attention at


---------49:56----------
one point in my life yeah but i


---------49:59----------
you keep i kind of got into it that way


---------50:01----------
you keep mentioning being the baby of


---------50:03----------
the family


---------50:04----------
can you tell me a little bit about what


---------50:06----------
that was like for you


---------50:09----------
um i i don't know quite what that means


---------50:11----------
but you kind of you know you'll


---------50:13----------
attribute many things that you say to


---------50:15----------
being the baby of the family


---------50:17----------
right i think it was just something i


---------50:19----------
was told a lot growing up


---------50:21----------
because i was i was always like a


---------50:22----------
miniature version of other members of my


---------50:24----------
family


---------50:25----------
rather than being my own person i mean


---------50:27----------
me and my


---------50:28----------
the brother closest to me were really


---------50:30----------
really um


---------50:32----------
alike when i was growing up so i was


---------50:33----------
always called the younger version of him


---------50:36----------
um and i think being the baby of the


---------50:38----------
family my voice kind of got drowned out


---------50:40----------
a lot when family gatherings would


---------50:42----------
happen so i kind of like fought to have


---------50:44----------
my place at the table


---------50:46----------
i think that's why i've always been good


---------50:47----------
at sort of talking


---------50:49----------
and like why a lot of my humor is very


---------50:52----------
quick and


---------50:54----------
and things like that i was trying to


---------50:55----------
like if i said something loud


---------50:57----------
and quick and clever then i would be


---------50:59----------
heard more than everybody else


---------51:02----------
and that feeling of like cutting the


---------51:03----------
room with laughter was always something


---------51:05----------
really fun when i was a kid it sounds


---------51:07----------
like you learned how to be a character


---------51:09----------
at quite a young age


---------51:11----------
i guess so i am and that you had to be a


---------51:13----------
character to be noticed


---------51:16----------
oh now we're getting into some [ __ ]


---------51:18----------
aren't we i


---------51:19----------
warned you oh no i guess so i never


---------51:23----------
thought about it like that


---------51:24----------
right i mean but that's what i mean it's


---------51:26----------
fascinating yeah


---------51:28----------
that's what i'm hearing from myself now


---------51:30----------
not that i say it yep


---------51:33----------
what do you think i think it's


---------51:36----------
again it's fascinating this is the stuff


---------51:38----------
that i love like figuring out and


---------51:40----------
realizing oh that's where certain things


---------51:42----------
come from and i didn't realize i was


---------51:44----------
doing that


---------51:44----------
back then but yeah that absolutely makes


---------51:47----------
a lot of sense now


---------51:49----------
yeah i think you were jack's


---------51:50----------
jacksepticeye long before


---------51:52----------
you created a youtube account no


---------51:55----------
probably most likely yeah he's buried


---------51:56----------
somewhere


---------51:57----------
yeah well i don't know about buried


---------51:59----------
sounds to me like he's i was out in the


---------52:01----------
open from a young man


---------52:03----------
[Laughter]


---------52:08----------
and just to also kind of telegraph where


---------52:11----------
this could go


---------52:12----------
i think as we explore some of who you've


---------52:14----------
become jack


---------52:15----------
there may be certain things that we'll


---------52:17----------
talk about which could


---------52:19----------
paint things in a possible negative


---------52:22----------
light


---------52:23----------
sure okay so if you feel that way


---------52:26----------
it's not really my intention to paint


---------52:28----------
things in a negative light but


---------52:29----------
in my experience you know kind of like


---------52:32----------
you said you know things are getting


---------52:34----------
serious like why did you feel like that


---------52:36----------
was a serious comment


---------52:38----------
i think it's just because it sounds so


---------52:41----------
psychological


---------52:42----------
to put a pin in it that way it's like oh


---------52:45----------
okay


---------52:46----------
it's like it's like those psychologists


---------52:48----------
like sort of like twist that you see in


---------52:50----------
movies


---------52:51----------
all the time where it's like i i used to


---------52:53----------
always make that joke


---------52:54----------
people would say i had a dream last


---------52:55----------
night that i ate marshmallows for eight


---------52:57----------
hours i'm like what does that say about


---------52:58----------
you and your father


---------53:00----------
a lot and i would always just make that


---------53:02----------
joke um


---------53:04----------
so hearing it that way is kind of it's


---------53:06----------
very profound and i kind of like that


---------53:08----------
sort of stuff


---------53:09----------
sure so that's a moment of neon


---------53:12----------
okay does that make sense absolutely


---------53:15----------
yeah


---------53:16----------
yeah so that's what we shoot for is


---------53:19----------
because that's


---------53:19----------
understanding and then that's gonna like


---------53:21----------
you know it's not just a bit of


---------53:22----------
information


---------53:23----------
that's the light bulb going off


---------53:25----------
something landing so um


---------53:28----------
because here's the concern that i have


---------53:30----------
is if we sort of say that you had to be


---------53:32----------
funny to be noticed


---------53:34----------
sure what that also sort of means is


---------53:35----------
that you kind of weren't


---------53:38----------
you you weren't given you had to like


---------53:40----------
kind of elbow your way in


---------53:43----------
you know and and so what that could


---------53:45----------
imply is that like people didn't


---------53:47----------
give you an opportunity to speak


---------53:51----------
because generally speaking you think


---------53:52----------
about you know the lower you are on the


---------53:55----------
totem pole like the more


---------53:56----------
support you need from loving people to


---------53:59----------
you know get a seat at the table


---------54:01----------
do you feel um like we're being


---------54:03----------
judgmental or anything are you kind of


---------54:05----------
getting that


---------54:06----------
kind of flip side of the argument at all


---------54:09----------
no i mean i can see why it's perceived


---------54:11----------
judgment but if


---------54:12----------
if anything it's bettering me as a


---------54:15----------
person and it's helping me understand


---------54:16----------
more about why i am


---------54:18----------
the way i am and i i kind of like that


---------54:20----------
and it also reaffirms a lot of stuff


---------54:22----------
that


---------54:22----------
even these days if i'm talking in a


---------54:25----------
group and people don't hear me it's not


---------54:27----------
that i


---------54:28----------
i feel like i'm important listen to what


---------54:30----------
i'm saying it's just


---------54:31----------
i don't like that feeling of being


---------54:32----------
talked over which i imagine a lot of


---------54:34----------
people don't


---------54:35----------
but i feel like that's


---------54:38----------
i don't know it hits upon a lot of


---------54:39----------
things that i think are very relevant to


---------54:41----------
me as a person


---------54:42----------
even today that i'm trying to like i'm


---------54:44----------
trying to undo


---------54:45----------
or trying to come to terms with and be


---------54:47----------
better about and form healthier habits


---------54:49----------
with


---------54:49----------
and i feel like you can't do that unless


---------54:51----------
you get into


---------54:53----------
the weeds of it all how does it feel to


---------54:55----------
be talked over


---------54:57----------
awful especially when


---------55:01----------
well in in this day and age it's like


---------55:04----------
buffering issues and internet issues and


---------55:05----------
all that kind of thing


---------55:06----------
it's like you get talked over anyway


---------55:09----------
just because the sound kind of cuts out


---------55:10----------
and whatnot


---------55:11----------
in conference calls but it's i just


---------55:14----------
i think that's where i'm de-valuing


---------55:17----------
people talk over you


---------55:19----------
that's [ __ ] stop doing it


---------55:23----------
i i feel like that's where


---------55:26----------
my devaluing of my own opinions come


---------55:28----------
from


---------55:29----------
because when i get talked over then i


---------55:31----------
just kind of like shut down


---------55:32----------
and then i stop giving my opinion on


---------55:35----------
things


---------55:38----------
okay


---------55:41----------
so do you remember times growing up


---------55:45----------
where


---------55:46----------
people didn't respect your opinion and


---------55:48----------
talked over you


---------55:52----------
not that i can vividly recall there's


---------55:55----------
nothing that's like really stands out to


---------55:56----------
me


---------55:58----------
i feel like maybe i like said a joke and


---------56:00----------
no one heard it and that kind of was


---------56:02----------
like oh man i thought that was a good


---------56:03----------
one


---------56:04----------
but nothing where i had anything of like


---------56:08----------
like profoundness to say and then


---------56:10----------
somebody talked over and they kind of


---------56:11----------
like defeated me


---------56:12----------
now at least nothing comes to mind right


---------56:13----------
now sure sure sure that makes sense i


---------56:15----------
think the real


---------56:16----------
tricky thing there is that you know if


---------56:17----------
you were devalued then


---------56:19----------
in retrospect you may not think it was


---------56:21----------
profound


---------56:23----------
probably yeah right it's kind of weird i


---------56:25----------
think that's a very irish way of


---------56:26----------
speaking that if you're not heard


---------56:28----------
everyone says well it wasn't important


---------56:29----------
then


---------56:30----------
yeah oh interesting um


---------56:33----------
yeah so let's uh what was it like having


---------56:35----------
a dad who was like significantly older


---------56:37----------
did you


---------56:37----------
kind of feel like because it sounds like


---------56:40----------
you noticed


---------56:41----------
that things were different compared to


---------56:44----------
your friends and stuff like that


---------56:47----------
yeah i think i just hearing my friends


---------56:49----------
talk about their dads being at work


---------56:50----------
i couldn't really relate to that at the


---------56:52----------
time and also


---------56:54----------
you get a slight bit of ridiculing


---------56:56----------
growing up i wouldn't say i was like


---------56:57----------
bullied about it or anything but


---------56:59----------
definitely when people hear it it's like


---------57:01----------
oh it's always like a point of


---------57:03----------
conversation


---------57:04----------
it's always something that people feel


---------57:06----------
like they have to like yeah


---------57:08----------
they have to like poke further into to


---------57:10----------
try and understand because it's so


---------57:11----------
foreign to them for that but for me that


---------57:13----------
was my


---------57:14----------
normality but hearing that it wasn't


---------57:16----------
normal was like well


---------57:17----------
what's what's wrong with me what's wrong


---------57:19----------
with my family why why is everyone


---------57:20----------
reacting to that


---------57:23----------
do you remember when


---------57:26----------
you started how old you were when you


---------57:28----------
started being concerned about your


---------57:29----------
opinion not being taken seriously and


---------57:31----------
talk being talked over


---------57:34----------
um i think it was more in my teenage


---------57:37----------
years probably


---------57:38----------
because i think those are very formative


---------57:41----------
years for anybody and


---------57:43----------
trying to figure out who you are in the


---------57:44----------
world and trying to put your stamp on it


---------57:46----------
which i mean nobody ever does when


---------57:48----------
they're a teenager it's like a


---------57:50----------
a weird fallacy that everybody talks


---------57:52----------
about because you're taught i saw that


---------57:53----------
in school like you need to know who you


---------57:54----------
are going into college


---------57:56----------
you need to know like the rest of your


---------57:57----------
life is being set up right now what are


---------57:58----------
you going to be what are you going to do


---------58:00----------
it's like i don't [ __ ] know i just


---------58:01----------
want to play metal gear solid and


---------58:02----------
collect yu-gi-oh cards


---------58:04----------
yeah um exactly who you were going to be


---------58:08----------
when you grew up


---------58:11----------
i mean i did this didn't exist back then


---------58:14----------
so no


---------58:15----------
yeah but you are still you i think


---------58:17----------
that's cool right


---------58:18----------
anyway i just you know i was just


---------58:21----------
thinking it was kind of ironic because


---------58:22----------
you're like i don't know who i am and


---------58:24----------
that's actually exactly who you were you


---------58:25----------
knew exactly who you were


---------58:27----------
well yes just realized you could be that


---------58:30----------
yeah


---------58:30----------
that's against the norm at the time at


---------58:32----------
the time it's like well you grow up you


---------58:33----------
work in a factory you


---------58:35----------
slave away you get your two weeks every


---------58:37----------
year you


---------58:38----------
you get married you have kids like it's


---------58:40----------
so burrowed into your head that


---------58:42----------
from everybody else's experience and in


---------58:44----------
ireland especially it's like you


---------58:46----------
you work to get drunk at the weekend and


---------58:48----------
that's it that's what everybody's lives


---------58:50----------
were everybody


---------58:51----------
starts in a small town and everyone


---------58:53----------
stays in a small town you can go back 20


---------58:55----------
years later and they're all still there


---------58:57----------
a lot of them are i mean i shouldn't


---------58:59----------
generalize but a lot of them are kind of


---------59:01----------
stuck in the same sort of jobs and stuck


---------59:02----------
in the same cycles as their parents and


---------59:04----------
i think i was always determined to not


---------59:05----------
do that


---------59:06----------
especially being in the world of video


---------59:08----------
games i always saw so much more of the


---------59:10----------
world like oh there's japanese game devs


---------59:12----------
and like what are they doing and


---------59:14----------
like oh american game releases are like


---------59:15----------
earlier than hours like


---------59:17----------
what's that about that sort of like


---------59:19----------
knowledge door was opened at a very


---------59:20----------
young age


---------59:22----------
and i feel like because ireland is very


---------59:23----------
heavily religious i remember being 12


---------59:25----------
years old and like rejecting that


---------59:28----------
and being like no i don't believe in any


---------59:29----------
of that i'm not going to church every


---------59:30----------
weekend


---------59:31----------
anymore and it was always sort of this


---------59:33----------
sort of defiance


---------59:34----------
against culture and i think that


---------59:38----------
i mean you might not know this but when


---------59:39----------
i started off my channel i i didn't talk


---------59:41----------
in my regular voice i had like a


---------59:43----------
weird sort of americanization


---------59:45----------
pronunciation of everything because that


---------59:47----------
was how i spoke clearly and


---------59:49----------
everybody i watched kind of spoke like


---------59:50----------
that and to try and speak clearly i


---------59:52----------
changed my accent because i thought


---------59:54----------
well if i sound different then


---------59:55----------
everyone's going to notice that


---------59:58----------
sounds like you've been on a long


---------59:59----------
journey to become yourself


---------60:01----------
oh yeah that's why anybody watching this


---------60:04----------
right now if you're in your 20s and


---------60:05----------
everyone's like time to figure out who


---------60:07----------
you are


---------60:07----------
in college it's you're not going to


---------60:09----------
figure that out that quick


---------60:11----------
it's like at least i didn't maybe some


---------60:13----------
of you will if you're emotionally


---------60:15----------
incredibly mature and had to


---------60:16----------
have a great functioning life but i


---------60:18----------
didn't i barely know who i am at 31


---------60:20----------
years old


---------60:22----------
i feel like it's going to take me until


---------60:23----------
i'm 40 before i'm like actually


---------60:25----------
very comfortable with doing whatever i


---------60:27----------
want to do


---------60:29----------
yeah it was interesting because i think


---------60:30----------
those people do exist i


---------60:32----------
um you know when i was training to


---------60:34----------
become a psychiatrist i was surprised by


---------60:36----------
how many people i was surrounded by like


---------60:37----------
who knew exactly who they were going to


---------60:39----------
be for a very long time


---------60:41----------
did they or were they just pretending


---------60:43----------
that they no


---------60:44----------
that's the things i think they knew for


---------60:47----------
a long time


---------60:48----------
yeah and and looking at them


---------60:52----------
i'm not so sure that they're lucky i


---------60:54----------
don't know that they're luckier


---------60:56----------
i i think that's a value judgment that


---------60:58----------
we place that knowing who you are


---------61:00----------
earlier is better but i don't i don't


---------61:02----------
necessarily think


---------61:04----------
um but i'm curious what happened when


---------61:06----------
you told people that you were


---------61:08----------
not interested in going to church


---------61:11----------
um my mother didn't like it uh my dad


---------61:15----------
well my parents have always been like


---------61:17----------
really good at let me do what i do


---------61:18----------
almost to a fault


---------61:19----------
at some point um i'm sure we can come


---------61:21----------
back to that


---------61:23----------
in a bit but it was always just


---------61:25----------
something that everybody did


---------61:27----------
my friends were always like jealous that


---------61:29----------
i didn't have to go anymore


---------61:31----------
because i mean as a kid i didn't really


---------61:33----------
care about any of it i would be an altar


---------61:34----------
boy sometimes just so i didn't have to


---------61:36----------
go to church and sit down the same way


---------61:38----------
all the time


---------61:39----------
it's like well at least now i have


---------61:40----------
something to do at church yeah i can


---------61:42----------
ring a bell or


---------61:43----------
hand a collection plate to somebody but


---------61:46----------
when i was younger i i don't know why i


---------61:48----------
vividly remember going around


---------61:50----------
the field at the back of my house i was


---------61:51----------
just like walking around as kids do


---------61:54----------
and i just had this like profound point


---------61:56----------
in my head where i was like i don't


---------61:57----------
believe in any of this


---------61:59----------
and then i started like questioning


---------62:00----------
everything and that sort of like


---------62:01----------
scientific side of me kicked in


---------62:04----------
or i wanted to just like question the


---------62:05----------
world and the universe and


---------62:08----------
i don't know my mother didn't like it


---------62:09----------
and she was like don't tell your


---------62:10----------
grandmother because my grandmother was


---------62:12----------
hyper religious


---------62:13----------
and i i never had any sort of like


---------62:15----------
animosity towards anybody who did


---------62:17----------
believe i'm like that's


---------62:18----------
fine even at a young age i was like


---------62:20----------
that's fine you can still believe that


---------62:21----------
if you want if i'm wrong i'm wrong


---------62:23----------
it's just not for me


---------62:27----------
so it sounds like overall people sort of


---------62:29----------
were pretty accepting of that


---------62:31----------
i think so yeah weirdly yeah because


---------62:34----------
you're


---------62:34----------
what i'm really hearing is that your mom


---------62:36----------
wasn't concerned that your


---------62:38----------
you know your soul would wind up in


---------62:39----------
eternal hellfire she was more concerned


---------62:41----------
that your grandmother would find out


---------62:42----------
which is just actually sort of a tacit


---------62:45----------
acceptance


---------62:46----------
of your beliefs right right it's like


---------62:48----------
you're like


---------62:49----------
yeah i feel like a lot of my family were


---------62:51----------
into the religious side of things as a


---------62:53----------
sort of


---------62:54----------
sort of like a a transcendental sort of


---------62:57----------
meditative


---------62:58----------
aspect of life like knowing that there


---------63:00----------
was something there and doing prayer and


---------63:02----------
everything was a very


---------63:03----------
like calming thing for them to do and


---------63:06----------
gave them a sense of purpose and


---------63:07----------
everything and i i feel like that that's


---------63:08----------
that's fine to do that i never i i


---------63:12----------
didn't get that


---------63:12----------
aspect out of it and my grandmother i


---------63:14----------
think definitely got that


---------63:16----------
in her later years and it was something


---------63:17----------
to like keep her company and


---------63:19----------
give her sort of peace of mind every day


---------63:21----------
and i i think that that's kind of nice


---------63:23----------
yeah so i think at that point it doesn't


---------63:25----------
matter if it's real or not it was real


---------63:27----------
for her so it doesn't matter


---------63:28----------
i was i had i was kind of fishing around


---------63:31----------
a little bit there


---------63:31----------
because i'm going to be sniffing around


---------63:34----------
for you know moments where you felt


---------63:36----------
devalued and talked over


---------63:38----------
and and you know sort of coming out


---------63:41----------
as being agnostic or atheistic in a in a


---------63:45----------
catholic uh household


---------63:48----------
um would be you know kind of prime


---------63:52----------
prime time for being disrespected and


---------63:55----------
undervalued but i'm not really hearing


---------63:57----------
that at all


---------63:58----------
yeah i think ireland was in sort of a


---------64:01----------
transitional period at that point


---------64:02----------
where the church kind of ruled


---------64:04----------
everything versus government and


---------64:06----------
i think in the 90s to early 2000s it


---------64:08----------
kind of shifted very drastically


---------64:11----------
um so right now i have a pretty clear


---------64:14----------
intention just in my head and i want to


---------64:16----------
share that with you and you let me know


---------64:18----------
if that's good or not


---------64:20----------
which is that i'm going to try to help


---------64:21----------
you understand a little bit about this


---------64:23----------
devaluing business


---------64:24----------
and being talked over sure and in order


---------64:27----------
to do that i think what we need to do is


---------64:29----------
access that emotion like a little bit


---------64:31----------
more


---------64:31----------
raleigh if you can't in a raw format


---------64:35----------
what i mean


---------64:36----------
if you can't think of any time during


---------64:38----------
your teenage years when you really felt


---------64:40----------
like you were talked over people didn't


---------64:41----------
listen


---------64:43----------
then that's okay um then what i'm going


---------64:45----------
to ask you is there a time recently


---------64:47----------
that you sort of really felt that way


---------64:48----------
and it bothered you


---------64:52----------
um i think


---------64:56----------
just doing because i've been doing a lot


---------64:57----------
more like larger multiplayer sessions


---------64:59----------
with people


---------65:00----------
and i feel like just the nature of like


---------65:02----------
i said the way the internet buffering


---------65:03----------
and everything is sometimes what you say


---------65:05----------
can get lost


---------65:07----------
and i think sometimes it kind of like it


---------65:10----------
kind of triggers that sort of response


---------65:11----------
in me


---------65:13----------
but i think nowadays it's not sort of a


---------65:15----------
malicious like how dare they not listen


---------65:16----------
to me it's more of like a


---------65:18----------
ah they probably just didn't hear it and


---------65:19----------
that's fine i think


---------65:21----------
i've tried to get a little better about


---------65:22----------
realizing that like what i said doesn't


---------65:24----------
always need to be heard all the time


---------65:26----------
yeah so so that's actually a really good


---------65:29----------
nuance which i want to point out which


---------65:31----------
is that


---------65:32----------
your reaction to them not hearing you is


---------65:35----------
somewhat automatic


---------65:36----------
and then a different part of your mind


---------65:39----------
has to kind of calm


---------65:40----------
that pissed off part down do you see


---------65:43----------
that


---------65:44----------
yep and and so still what happens though


---------65:47----------
is that programming


---------65:48----------
activates in those moments


---------65:52----------
sure and so the question is like so


---------65:54----------
let's move a little bit further back


---------65:57----------
has there been a time that you can think


---------65:58----------
of where that programming sort of


---------66:00----------
activated before


---------66:02----------
ideally we want to find something before


---------66:03----------
like a year ago because i think that's


---------66:05----------
really when you started to gain a lot of


---------66:06----------
self-awareness


---------66:07----------
and the more self-awareness you have the


---------66:09----------
less that that programming is going to


---------66:10----------
control you


---------66:13----------
because that too do you see how you have


---------66:14----------
the reaction


---------66:16----------
and then awareness steps in and then you


---------66:19----------
rationalize


---------66:20----------
and then you kind of end up in a sort of


---------66:22----------
more peaceful place


---------66:25----------
yeah and so what you want to do is go


---------66:28----------
back to


---------66:28----------
sorry go ahead i was going to say maybe


---------66:31----------
some


---------66:32----------
scenarios again with like other creators


---------66:34----------
where we're


---------66:35----------
we're at like uh a business thing or


---------66:38----------
something or maybe we're trying to get


---------66:40----------
like


---------66:40----------
feedback on something and i say


---------66:41----------
something and then i get talked over


---------66:44----------
by them and then their opinion matters


---------66:47----------
more in the eye


---------66:48----------
of the eyes of the people who are asking


---------66:49----------
and then


---------66:51----------
i think that sort of like it just shuts


---------66:53----------
me down a little


---------66:54----------
[Music]


---------66:55----------
and just that because i i guess it's


---------66:58----------
sort of like imposter syndrome that


---------67:00----------
i feel like a lot of why i am who i am


---------67:02----------
now and


---------67:03----------
where i got to is a lot of like


---------67:05----------
circumstance and look


---------67:07----------
um definitely hard work put in


---------67:11----------
but getting to this point now like being


---------67:14----------
told a lot that like oh you got a


---------67:16----------
pewdiepie shout out that's why you're


---------67:17----------
popular


---------67:18----------
and things like that it's like i i was


---------67:20----------
never allowed to enjoy the merits of my


---------67:22----------
own success


---------67:23----------
for what they were absolutely that had a


---------67:26----------
contributing factor to it


---------67:28----------
um but then always feeling like the


---------67:30----------
lesser of


---------67:31----------
greater people i think that


---------67:34----------
that's where it kind of kicks in


---------67:38----------
do you feel like you were the youngest


---------67:40----------
child in the household of youtube


---------67:44----------
probably yeah i feel like


---------67:47----------
because i came on the i came on a tail


---------67:50----------
end of a lot of things where


---------67:51----------
like bigger youtubers like a pewdiepie


---------67:53----------
or a markiplier would have been in the


---------67:54----------
same space and


---------67:56----------
for a long time the three of us were


---------67:57----------
associated incredibly heavily together


---------68:00----------
but i was always considered like i just


---------68:02----------
kind of like came along


---------68:03----------
that i didn't pioneer anything that i


---------68:05----------
didn't like set the ground for anything


---------68:08----------
and i felt like a lot of times i'm like


---------68:09----------
well i feel like i deserve a little bit


---------68:11----------
of


---------68:11----------
recognition in like certain aspects of


---------68:14----------
what i did but just hearing over and


---------68:18----------
over again that you're


---------68:19----------
you're not good enough to be considered


---------68:21----------
on the same level as people like that


---------68:22----------
i think it's always been this sort of


---------68:24----------
like comparison in my brain


---------68:27----------
to other creators of that stature and


---------68:30----------
then


---------68:30----------
it was something that i didn't like for


---------68:31----------
a while because i'm like well these guys


---------68:33----------
are my friends i don't want to compare


---------68:34----------
myself


---------68:34----------
too much to them because then it becomes


---------68:36----------
me versus them and the youtube system


---------68:38----------
rather than real realizing like oh no


---------68:40----------
we're just friends that


---------68:42----------
like we shouldn't be against each other


---------68:46----------
yeah so what i'm hearing jack is that


---------68:49----------
in some ways you've always been sort of


---------68:51----------
standing in the shadows of giants


---------68:55----------
yeah it kind of feels like that and so i


---------68:57----------
think the tricky thing here is that


---------69:01----------
can i think for a second i need to find


---------69:03----------
the right words


---------69:04----------
absolutely go for it


---------69:21----------
do you think you're standing in the


---------69:22----------
shadows of giants


---------69:24----------
let me rephrase is there a part of you


---------69:27----------
that thinks that you're standing in the


---------69:28----------
shadows of giants


---------69:31----------
part of me definitely i feel like


---------69:34----------
there's a there's like an expectation to


---------69:37----------
know exactly what you're doing at this


---------69:38----------
level


---------69:39----------
to have every move planned out and you


---------69:42----------
are like 10 steps ahead and you're like


---------69:44----------
a business mogul and like you got to the


---------69:47----------
top and like you're the greatest of what


---------69:48----------
you do


---------69:49----------
when in actuality a lot of the people


---------69:51----------
doing this i feel like


---------69:53----------
a lot of people i talk to have no idea


---------69:55----------
what they're doing and we're kind of


---------69:56----------
just taking it day by day


---------69:58----------
and i'd like to see it perceived more


---------69:59----------
like that


---------70:01----------
and i'm kind of just trying to have fun


---------70:02----------
in the moment rather than


---------70:04----------
creating 10 businesses a year out from


---------70:07----------
now and things like that


---------70:08----------
like most days i don't have a [ __ ]


---------70:10----------
clue what i'm doing and i feel like


---------70:12----------
that's fine


---------70:15----------
i feel like i i want to try and like


---------70:16----------
normalize that aspect more


---------70:18----------
normalize the sort of like


---------70:22----------
breaking down of the pedestals of sort


---------70:24----------
of


---------70:25----------
the the idolization of things because i


---------70:27----------
feel like that's


---------70:28----------
that's where a lot of the the stan


---------70:31----------
culture comes from


---------70:32----------
which i feel like the what culture


---------70:36----------
oh am i gonna have to explain something


---------70:38----------
to you


---------70:39----------
please you don't know what stan culture


---------70:42----------
is


---------70:43----------
no so you have fans of something


---------70:46----------
and then standing something is like the


---------70:48----------
next level


---------70:49----------
of that so it's like whenever you hear


---------70:52----------
of like


---------70:52----------
k-pop twitter or something like that or


---------70:54----------
people being


---------70:56----------
like very hyper aggressive and i i by no


---------70:59----------
means want to tire everybody with the


---------71:00----------
same brush here


---------71:01----------
um i'm just trying to like break it down


---------71:03----------
that standing is like really


---------71:05----------
really obsessive like idolization of


---------71:07----------
something where it like consumes your


---------71:09----------
life and you're like hyper into it and


---------71:10----------
everything about your day


---------71:12----------
is part of it um but i feel like that


---------71:16----------
leads to a lot of negative things i feel


---------71:19----------
like it leads to a lot of


---------71:20----------
because people talk about haters a lot


---------71:22----------
and like ignore the haters and like


---------71:23----------
don't listen to them


---------71:25----------
like sometimes they have a little bit of


---------71:27----------
good things to say


---------71:28----------
sometimes you kind of need a little bit


---------71:30----------
of that because sometimes you're not


---------71:31----------
right about everything


---------71:32----------
but on the other scale of things you


---------71:34----------
have the stands


---------71:36----------
and i feel like those are also not there


---------71:39----------
to help


---------71:40----------
you in most regards but they are to


---------71:42----------
build you up they're there to make you


---------71:44----------
a team to fight on and i i didn't like


---------71:47----------
people doing that with me either because


---------71:49----------
then the comparison


---------71:50----------
happens and then everyone fights for


---------71:52----------
their you become a fighter in a game


---------71:55----------
you become a character in a show a tribe


---------71:58----------
yeah like that a lot of people who are


---------72:00----------
charging onto the field of battle with


---------72:02----------
their banners with that have


---------72:03----------
jacksepticeye


---------72:05----------
and then other people have you know the


---------72:06----------
other youtubers


---------72:08----------
and that tribalization happens and then


---------72:10----------
everyone fights for you


---------72:11----------
on your behalf and from an outside


---------72:13----------
perspective


---------72:14----------
it can look cool but i feel like it's


---------72:17----------
just not helping me


---------72:18----------
it's not good for anybody because i feel


---------72:21----------
like i can


---------72:24----------
i i just don't want people talking for


---------72:26----------
me i don't want people to feel like they


---------72:28----------
know who i am


---------72:29----------
100 where they feel like they're like my


---------72:31----------
best friend online


---------72:33----------
and then they go start attacking other


---------72:34----------
people in my stead


---------72:37----------
when i'm a 31 year old man i can fight


---------72:39----------
my own fights if i'm ignoring something


---------72:41----------
it's probably for a very good reason


---------72:42----------
you can speak for yourself exactly


---------72:46----------
i mean not always i i definitely didn't


---------72:48----------
speak up when i should have but


---------72:50----------
i feel like these days absolutely i


---------72:53----------
i i'm allowed to speak for myself and


---------72:55----------
it's i feel like a lot of people have a


---------72:57----------
hard time


---------72:58----------
tackling that because it feels like


---------73:00----------
you're attacking your fans


---------73:02----------
when that's not at all what i'm trying


---------73:04----------
to do i'm trying to let people know that


---------73:06----------
hey


---------73:06----------
some of you go a little bit too far


---------73:09----------
thankfully


---------73:10----------
humorous manner


---------73:13----------
when you point that i used to i used to


---------73:15----------
i think these days i've gotten a lot


---------73:16----------
better at like setting the boundary


---------73:19----------
and just cutting things off when they


---------73:21----------
need to


---------73:23----------
so jack i've got a couple questions but


---------73:25----------
i'm noticing like a bizarrely common


---------73:27----------
theme here and i don't know if it's just


---------73:29----------
because i'm


---------73:29----------
you know looking to make constellations


---------73:31----------
out of stars here


---------73:33----------
okay but i'm hearing these same themes


---------73:35----------
of like speaking


---------73:36----------
up and being heard and other people


---------73:39----------
talking


---------73:40----------
interestingly enough i don't know if


---------73:41----------
they're talking over you here


---------73:43----------
but they're talking for you and then


---------73:45----------
it's our we have to sort of decide


---------73:48----------
as scientists whether we want to do the


---------73:49----------
mental gymnastics of saying that those


---------73:51----------
two things are connected


---------73:53----------
is it talking over you or is it simply


---------73:55----------
that like because what i'm really


---------73:56----------
hearing is a common theme of


---------73:58----------
you really having to carve out your


---------74:00----------
voice


---------74:02----------
yeah i feel like that's fair


---------74:05----------
and and so then the question becomes you


---------74:07----------
said that in the past


---------74:09----------
you didn't speak up for yourself what do


---------74:11----------
you mean by that like now you've gotten


---------74:12----------
better about it


---------74:15----------
i feel like if i saw something in my


---------74:16----------
community that was getting out of hand


---------74:18----------
i would kind of brush it aside and hope


---------74:20----------
that it would just go away


---------74:22----------
and kind of like funnel in something


---------74:23----------
else to kind of drown it out


---------74:27----------
yeah or like if i saw something on


---------74:30----------
twitter getting out of hand


---------74:31----------
i would just ignore it and then move on


---------74:34----------
and then hope that everyone just reacts


---------74:36----------
to the next thing that i do


---------74:38----------
instead of just calling it out


---------74:41----------
i mean some some things can probably


---------74:43----------
just be left alone because there's no


---------74:44----------
point like


---------74:45----------
making a mountain out of a molehill but


---------74:48----------
definitely some of the stuff that's kind


---------74:49----------
of pushed my boundaries


---------74:50----------
and pushed me as a person and that i


---------74:52----------
didn't appreciate


---------74:54----------
i think i've gotten better at


---------74:57----------
just drawing attention to it and saying


---------74:58----------
like that's not okay please stop


---------75:01----------
okay i still i still falter every now


---------75:03----------
and then but it's something i've tried


---------75:05----------
to get much better at over the years


---------75:07----------
so jack um i i'm going to share with you


---------75:11----------
a couple of thoughts these are going to


---------75:12----------
be like pretty half formed


---------75:14----------
but i want to leave you with something


---------75:16----------
you know if if it strikes a chord with


---------75:17----------
you and and you want to talk about it


---------75:19----------
you're


---------75:20----------
you know we're more than welcome to i'm


---------75:22----------
going to sort of


---------75:25----------
yeah i'm just gonna toss it out because


---------75:26----------
i think you're an incredibly


---------75:27----------
self-reflective person and i think that


---------75:30----------
even though it makes for a little bit of


---------75:31----------
unsatisfying television


---------75:34----------
i wanna give you something to turn over


---------75:36----------
in your mind and


---------75:38----------
and maybe it'll help okay and then if


---------75:40----------
something


---------75:41----------
triggers and and there's an experience


---------75:43----------
that you can think of or


---------75:44----------
it really resonates with the way that


---------75:47----------
you feel like we can certainly talk more


---------75:49----------
about it


---------75:50----------
but usually what i do is i ask a bunch


---------75:51----------
of questions and then i offer a


---------75:53----------
conclusion


---------75:54----------
at this point i'm going to just offer


---------75:55----------
the potential conclusion first and then


---------75:57----------
like we can sort through


---------75:59----------
you know i like to make it sort of like


---------76:00----------
the climax but you know


---------76:03----------
here it goes so so i i think this is


---------76:06----------
going to sound kind of weird but i think


---------76:07----------
a lot of this actually comes back so we


---------76:09----------
were


---------76:10----------
kind of hunting around for this idea


---------76:11----------
that there may have been moments in your


---------76:13----------
life where you had something to say and


---------76:15----------
people spoke over you


---------76:17----------
and and the funny thing is that you know


---------76:19----------
that really sounds like it's the thing


---------76:20----------
but when i ask you about that you're


---------76:21----------
like ah nothing really


---------76:23----------
jumps out we sort of went down the dead


---------76:25----------
end of the religious thing because that


---------76:26----------
sounds like oh man like that was like oh


---------76:28----------
he was like religion he liked practicing


---------76:30----------
religious freedom and he was oppressed


---------76:32----------
oh my god that's when he lost his voice


---------76:34----------
it's perfect oppression


---------76:35----------
great but this was sort of a dead end


---------76:38----------
too right


---------76:39----------
yeah so so i i think what what i'd like


---------76:42----------
to toss out then if that's a dead end


---------76:43----------
like let's just let it be a dead end


---------76:44----------
like that's okay


---------76:46----------
and oddly enough i think some of this


---------76:48----------
may have to come from your perception


---------76:52----------
that you're standing in the shoulder in


---------76:54----------
the shadows of giants


---------76:56----------
and what i mean by that is like so what


---------76:58----------
i'm hearing you say is that you have to


---------76:59----------
you know you have to elbow your way to


---------77:01----------
the table


---------77:02----------
you have to really like go out of your


---------77:03----------
way to be noticed


---------77:05----------
and so if we really think about it like


---------77:07----------
you know the things that bother us


---------77:09----------
like when people talk over you or don't


---------77:11----------
listen to your opinion


---------77:13----------
that could be sort of traumatic in its


---------77:16----------
origin in the sense that something


---------77:17----------
happened to you at some point


---------77:19----------
like you know sometimes we'll see this


---------77:20----------
kind of thing with people who grew up in


---------77:22----------
abusive households where they're like


---------77:23----------
they really weren't


---------77:24----------
they had something to say like i worked


---------77:26----------
with one particular patient who was


---------77:29----------
molested in a gas station bathroom


---------77:32----------
and like tried to tell people and like


---------77:35----------
people wouldn't


---------77:36----------
listen and and so


---------77:39----------
it was like a really challenging sort of


---------77:41----------
situation where like he was trying to


---------77:43----------
speak and like


---------77:44----------
people weren't listening and so


---------77:47----------
sometimes that's where that kind of


---------77:48----------
comes from i'm not really


---------77:49----------
getting any of that from you so the


---------77:51----------
other option is that it's not actually


---------77:53----------
that you were ever truly spoken over


---------77:56----------
but that you felt like you didn't belong


---------78:00----------
and so anything that exposes that


---------78:03----------
or resonates with that genuine fear that


---------78:05----------
you have about yourself


---------78:08----------
is what like really kind of triggers you


---------78:11----------
so it's sort of like


---------78:12----------
this idea that you know it's not that


---------78:14----------
other people


---------78:15----------
didn't let you speak it's that you kind


---------78:17----------
of feel like you're


---------78:18----------
playing in a game with the big boys and


---------78:21----------
that you're the small you're the


---------78:22----------
youngest kid in the room


---------78:24----------
and so as you carry that fear within you


---------78:28----------
you're kind of very sensitive to


---------78:31----------
anything


---------78:32----------
which like may rub up against it


---------78:35----------
so if someone says something you know


---------78:37----------
it's sort of like if i'm insecure about


---------78:39----------
my appearance


---------78:40----------
and someone doesn't give me a job and


---------78:42----------
then i'm like oh it's because


---------78:44----------
the other person was prettier than i am


---------78:46----------
it's not because


---------78:47----------
that's not true at all maybe it's true i


---------78:49----------
mean i don't know but our


---------78:51----------
own insecurities are the things that


---------78:53----------
cause us suffering because


---------78:55----------
our brain is sort of scanning for a


---------78:57----------
confirmation bias to make us feel like


---------78:59----------
devalued


---------79:00----------
yeah so the interesting thing is like


---------79:02----------
maybe we can approach it from sort of a


---------79:04----------
traumatic angle where you were really


---------79:05----------
not listened to but the other thing is


---------79:06----------
that you


---------79:07----------
you genuinely there's a part of you and


---------79:09----------
so i kind of asked you this earlier


---------79:11----------
do you feel like you're kind of like


---------79:14----------
there's a part of you and this is the


---------79:15----------
tricky thing is that


---------79:16----------
as the awareness grows outside of


---------79:18----------
jacksepticeye this other part of you is


---------79:20----------
going to get kind of packaged


---------79:22----------
and set aside and there are going to be


---------79:24----------
moments where you're more aware where


---------79:25----------
that thing isn't really going to have


---------79:26----------
any power over you


---------79:28----------
but your own awareness outside of


---------79:30----------
jacksepticeye is going to fluctuate


---------79:32----------
and in periods of time when your own


---------79:34----------
awareness is low


---------79:36----------
that kind of devaluing insecurity the


---------79:39----------
idea that you're the small


---------79:40----------
kid in the room full of big kids that


---------79:42----------
you're the kid whose dad is retired and


---------79:44----------
there's like there's like everyone else


---------79:46----------
and then there's you


---------79:48----------
and and if that's really the case then


---------79:50----------
like i think the the sensitivity


---------79:54----------
to you know other people speaking over


---------79:56----------
you


---------79:57----------
may come from your own insecurity that


---------79:59----------
you don't deserve to speak


---------80:03----------
yeah what do you think about that


---------80:06----------
i mean it feels like you're hitting a


---------80:08----------
lot of the right points


---------80:12----------
is that feels like that's kind of yeah i


---------80:14----------
feel like that's kind of the


---------80:15----------
avenue that i'm in um


---------80:19----------
it's kind of because i i have always


---------80:21----------
wondered that like where where is it


---------80:22----------
coming from why do i feel this way and


---------80:25----------
why there why do i react a certain way


---------80:28----------
and trying to get over it but never


---------80:29----------
really fully understanding where it


---------80:30----------
comes from


---------80:31----------
to begin with yeah um


---------80:34----------
so it's always been a tricky thing to


---------80:35----------
grapple with


---------80:37----------
so then the question becomes when did


---------80:39----------
you start to


---------80:41----------
feel like you weren't good enough


---------80:45----------
or that you not good enough good enough


---------80:46----------
isn't the right word when did you


---------80:49----------
start to feel that you were kind of last


---------80:51----------
place


---------80:52----------
in a particular group of people oh


---------80:55----------
that's school for sure


---------80:57----------
like even from the earliest ages seeing


---------81:00----------
i had a lot of friends who were very


---------81:02----------
very smart


---------81:04----------
and who were very good at like maths or


---------81:07----------
some were good at


---------81:08----------
xyz subject and i always felt like i


---------81:11----------
kind of


---------81:13----------
lagged behind and i didn't get like bad


---------81:15----------
grades but


---------81:16----------
my friends were always getting great


---------81:18----------
grades and they were always doing so


---------81:20----------
much better than me and i remember


---------81:23----------
just not being out like certain things


---------81:24----------
didn't click with me but


---------81:26----------
i never really had the hunger to make


---------81:28----------
them click with me


---------81:29----------
but the dissatisfaction of not feeling


---------81:33----------
like i kept up with them


---------81:34----------
was still present and i feel like are we


---------81:37----------
talking about your school friends or


---------81:38----------
pewdiepie and markiplier


---------81:40----------
no school friends school friends um


---------81:43----------
they i feel like when i was in college


---------81:46----------
as well i went to college twice and the


---------81:48----------
first time i went for like


---------81:49----------
music production um in my when i was


---------81:51----------
like 18 19


---------81:53----------
and i i remember leaving that course


---------81:56----------
because even though i passed all my


---------81:58----------
exams year two


---------81:58----------
i didn't go back for the third year


---------82:00----------
because i felt like i just didn't get it


---------82:02----------
i other people were like sailing ahead


---------82:04----------
they had so much hunger for they


---------82:05----------
understood everything all the time


---------82:08----------
and i just couldn't get it it didn't


---------82:11----------
click with me


---------82:12----------
so instead of asking for help and


---------82:13----------
admitting that i looked dumb


---------82:16----------
i felt like i had to just like leave


---------82:19----------
that i


---------82:19----------
i'm not smart enough to keep up with


---------82:21----------
these people so this just isn't the


---------82:22----------
place for me i need to like get out of


---------82:24----------
here


---------82:25----------
um and i feel like that sort of


---------82:28----------
that fear of looking dumb has always


---------82:30----------
been sort of something that's persisted


---------82:32----------
in my life for a very long time


---------82:36----------
and i feel like doing this sort of job


---------82:37----------
as well it's it's very easy for people


---------82:39----------
to just


---------82:40----------
say that to you um


---------82:43----------
and it's it's like it's not like one of


---------82:45----------
those like super biting like slurs or


---------82:48----------
anything like that it's just something


---------82:49----------
so


---------82:50----------
childish and benign sounding but it it's


---------82:52----------
always like struck a chord with me


---------82:54----------
so i'm like damn it's like i really do


---------82:56----------
suck at this don't i


---------82:57----------
and i always kind of shoot myself down


---------82:59----------
as a result of that


---------83:02----------
so let me ask you something when you


---------83:04----------
feel like someone is talking over


---------83:06----------
you does it feel to you like you have to


---------83:09----------
rebel


---------83:11----------
against that part because like like


---------83:13----------
here's what i'm envisioning okay this is


---------83:14----------
gonna get


---------83:15----------
man this is gonna fall apart real quick


---------83:17----------
so


---------83:19----------
you know it's my fault really not yours


---------83:20----------
if i can't explain this but here's what


---------83:22----------
i'm envisioning and it's going to happen


---------83:24----------
lightning quick okay


---------83:25----------
so like you're not a failure you've


---------83:28----------
never thought of yourself as a failure


---------83:30----------
because you always passed your exams


---------83:31----------
like you actually you know


---------83:33----------
finished your two years but everyone


---------83:35----------
else is just


---------83:36----------
so much better and you carry that


---------83:38----------
thought with you


---------83:39----------
that everyone else is so much better but


---------83:41----------
then there's another part of your mind


---------83:42----------
that's like [ __ ] we can't


---------83:44----------
think that way about ourselves and so


---------83:46----------
like if someone else


---------83:48----------
even remotely like


---------83:51----------
suggests that they are better than you


---------83:54----------
you're like


---------83:55----------
that part of you comes rushing to your


---------83:56----------
rescue and they're like no


---------83:58----------
jack's opinion is just as good as yours


---------84:01----------
how dare you guys treat him that way


---------84:03----------
i deserve to speak and i'm not stupid


---------84:08----------
yeah is that what happens


---------84:12----------
yeah i don't think in as much of an


---------84:14----------
aggressive way but


---------84:15----------
definitely that sort of like tide starts


---------84:18----------
rolling in pretty quick


---------84:20----------
right but but the tide is a response


---------84:23----------
to that initial insecurity what do you


---------84:25----------
think about that and it's it's going to


---------84:26----------
be quick it could be hard to notice


---------84:28----------
and i could be wrong yeah no absolutely


---------84:30----------
yeah


---------84:31----------
so now if you want to unravel this


---------84:34----------
you've actually got two or three options


---------84:36----------
okay


---------84:37----------
one is that you can notice that


---------84:39----------
protective part of you


---------84:40----------
and that protective part of you like if


---------84:42----------
you i know it sounds weird


---------84:44----------
but if you disarm that that's gonna be


---------84:46----------
the same thing as like


---------84:47----------
looking at yourself and asking for help


---------84:51----------
does that make sense like both of those


---------84:52----------
are protective mechanisms


---------84:54----------
yeah and so if you dismantle that with


---------84:58----------
your awareness or if you notice it


---------84:59----------
this will start to dwindle away because


---------85:02----------
i


---------85:02----------
it's hard to describe but like if you


---------85:05----------
stop the over compensation


---------85:07----------
then you can actually fix the problem


---------85:10----------
but as long as you're applying band-aids


---------85:12----------
like you're never going to get to the


---------85:13----------
root of it yeah and then the other thing


---------85:15----------
that you can do is actually


---------85:17----------
explore and this is the kind of thing


---------85:18----------
that you you know you can do with a


---------85:19----------
therapist


---------85:20----------
or um you're a twitch streamer yeah okay


---------85:24----------
um so so this is also where you know


---------85:26----------
this is the kind of work that our


---------85:27----------
our creator coaching program does but


---------85:29----------
i'd say if you haven't seen a therapist


---------85:30----------
it's a good thing to work on


---------85:32----------
um which is that that initial idea of


---------85:34----------
like why did you start devaluing


---------85:36----------
yourself


---------85:38----------
right and you got to talk and this is


---------85:39----------
where you've got a lot of stories


---------85:41----------
and so this is where like you have to


---------85:42----------
talk through and sort of sit with and


---------85:44----------
reflect on


---------85:46----------
all these instances and they're gonna be


---------85:47----------
tiny tiny instances


---------85:50----------
where you didn't fail but you felt like


---------85:52----------
other people were better


---------85:54----------
right and like as you settle


---------85:57----------
each of those moments down then you'll


---------86:00----------
be free of this


---------86:03----------
okay thoughts questions


---------86:07----------
responses yeah i mean again


---------86:11----------
you're very good at explaining things so


---------86:12----------
i think you kind of hit the nail on the


---------86:14----------
head


---------86:15----------
um and it's kind of it's things that


---------86:17----------
i've kind of known for a while


---------86:19----------
and especially again a lot of the


---------86:21----------
reflecting over the last year i've


---------86:23----------
gotten better at like


---------86:24----------
when these things happen to kind of like


---------86:26----------
stop and take a pause


---------86:28----------
and think about it objectively and


---------86:31----------
realize like


---------86:32----------
what they're saying is not the truth and


---------86:34----------
kind of has no bearing on me and i


---------86:35----------
shouldn't take it so much to heart


---------86:37----------
every time i've definitely gotten better


---------86:40----------
at it but i still i still think i'm on


---------86:41----------
that journey


---------86:43----------
yeah so so let me try to help you just a


---------86:45----------
little bit of tweaking that


---------86:47----------
the first step is to say i shouldn't


---------86:49----------
take it the heart


---------86:50----------
to heart the second step is why do i


---------86:53----------
take that to heart in the first place


---------86:56----------
okay because you could take all kinds of


---------86:58----------
stuff to heart


---------86:59----------
does that make sense yeah like your


---------87:01----------
physical appearance


---------87:03----------
you know whatever your accent right


---------87:06----------
and so like like there are lots of


---------87:08----------
things which you have allowed yourself


---------87:10----------
to be


---------87:10----------
but this is the one thing that still


---------87:13----------
like


---------87:13----------
is the [ __ ] in the armor that like you


---------87:16----------
do take to heart so forget about the


---------87:18----------
fact that i mean


---------87:18----------
you think you've you're halfway there so


---------87:20----------
the next step is


---------87:22----------
why does this thing resonate with you so


---------87:24----------
much


---------87:25----------
right and as you explore that then


---------87:27----------
you'll get to the real root of it


---------87:30----------
yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense


---------87:35----------
cool awesome


---------87:37----------
[Music]


---------87:39----------
i feel like we're at a decent stopping


---------87:41----------
point i mean


---------87:42----------
but you know it's sort of like i feel


---------87:44----------
like if we keep talking we have to open


---------87:46----------
up something else


---------87:48----------
um yeah and we'd probably be here for


---------87:50----------
another three hours


---------87:52----------
so so i also find that when i'm working


---------87:54----------
with someone


---------87:55----------
i think it's important from a memory


---------87:57----------
consolidation point to kind of like


---------87:59----------
pause and let you kind of process this


---------88:00----------
digest this


---------88:01----------
express skepticism with yourself etc and


---------88:04----------
you can always like revisit things later


---------88:06----------
but like this is what i kind of want to


---------88:07----------
leave you with


---------88:09----------
especially given your own capacity for


---------88:11----------
self-reflection i think it's like pretty


---------88:13----------
good


---------88:15----------
well i hope so but yeah i think that's a


---------88:16----------
good like pin to put on things


---------88:19----------
yeah um do you have any questions or


---------88:21----------
anything that i can try to clarify


---------88:23----------
further or anything that you feel like


---------88:24----------
didn't make sense


---------88:27----------
um no i feel like if it didn't at the


---------88:30----------
time i would have


---------88:31----------
poked a little bit further and asked


---------88:32----------
about it yeah and i thought it was very


---------88:34----------
helpful when i sort of


---------88:36----------
sniffed up the idea of like you know


---------88:37----------
people talking over you when you were a


---------88:39----------
kid and you were kind of like nah


---------88:40----------
nothing comes in mind and that's really


---------88:41----------
helpful so that is i think ultimately


---------88:43----------
what allowed us because if you had sort


---------88:45----------
of played along i don't think we would


---------88:46----------
have ever gotten here


---------88:48----------
yeah i i like that sort of avenue aspect


---------88:51----------
of doing things because i can sit here


---------88:52----------
and think about it all day but there's


---------88:53----------
just so much to consolidate


---------88:55----------
then like i you'd never know where to


---------88:57----------
start it's like well what am i trying to


---------88:58----------
fix and what am i trying to think about


---------89:00----------
what am i where am i trying to start


---------89:01----------
with any of it so it's nice to have


---------89:02----------
somebody kind of like funnel that down


---------89:04----------
yep and and i think this is where like


---------89:05----------
if something doesn't resonate to you


---------89:07----------
with you


---------89:07----------
ultimately it's not about what i think


---------89:09----------
it's about what fits


---------89:11----------
right when i say something some things


---------89:13----------
are going to resonate and some things


---------89:14----------
aren't and you really know


---------89:16----------
and this is what marcus aurelius would


---------89:17----------
say is that like you know everything


---------89:20----------
you just don't know that you know well i


---------89:22----------
don't know if you would say that


---------89:22----------
precisely but


---------89:24----------
you know that that like the change comes


---------89:26----------
from within that the neon is like buried


---------89:28----------
within you


---------89:29----------
and and all you have to do is follow


---------89:31----------
that internal compass and you'll get to


---------89:33----------
your answers


---------89:35----------
yeah i think the the self-confidence in


---------89:38----------
myself is something that i


---------89:40----------
definitely need to work on a little bit


---------89:42----------
further


---------89:43----------
yep maybe forever but i don't think


---------89:46----------
that's a bad thing


---------89:47----------
no i don't think so yeah so i think it's


---------89:49----------
interesting because you know we've


---------89:50----------
stayed away from the term


---------89:52----------
self-confidence because i think you come


---------89:53----------
across and you would even describe


---------89:55----------
yourself


---------89:55----------
as a confident person


---------89:58----------
did i wouldn't you


---------90:02----------
i guess so i'm confident


---------90:06----------
and i'm confident in my myself yeah like


---------90:10----------
me as a person yeah um outside of


---------90:13----------
everything i i kind of know who i might


---------90:15----------
yeah i know where my brain is at


---------90:17----------
yeah and and i think that this is the


---------90:20----------
other interesting thing is that


---------90:21----------
you know that self-confidence is outside


---------90:23----------
of jacksepticeye


---------90:24----------
and jacksepticeye thinks that


---------90:27----------
he's you know the youngest kid in the


---------90:30----------
room


---------90:32----------
and and so that's that's what we kind of


---------90:34----------
got to dig into


---------90:36----------
yeah cool do you meditate


---------90:41----------
uh probably not as frequently as i would


---------90:44----------
like to but it's definitely something


---------90:45----------
i've started doing


---------90:46----------
in the last year i was doing it a little


---------90:48----------
bit before this call


---------90:49----------
even what kind of meditation do you do


---------90:52----------
if you don't mind me asking


---------90:54----------
i don't know if i'd have a term for it


---------90:56----------
but i like to just like


---------90:57----------
sit in silence and kind of like just


---------91:00----------
focus on my breath


---------91:00----------
and my breathing and try and camp things


---------91:03----------
down i try to think about nothing


---------91:06----------
okay and kind of just have like one


---------91:08----------
focal point


---------91:09----------
in my body and just kind of sit there


---------91:11----------
with that for like 20 minutes


---------91:13----------
what's the focal point you use uh


---------91:16----------
it's usually like my nose or just my my


---------91:18----------
breathing in general


---------91:20----------
okay um can i share with you a slightly


---------91:24----------
different technique please


---------91:27----------
so i'm going to teach you a technique


---------91:30----------
that comes from


---------91:31----------
kundalini tantra or kundalini yoga


---------91:35----------
and kundalini yoga is like this business


---------91:37----------
about chakras or chakras


---------91:40----------
which are these sort of energy centers


---------91:41----------
it's super super hokey not very


---------91:43----------
scientific


---------91:44----------
but particularly what i want to do is


---------91:46----------
teach you a meditation technique that is


---------91:48----------
going to govern


---------91:50----------
and strengthen this once again not very


---------91:52----------
scientific


---------91:53----------
concept of the third eye which is like


---------91:55----------
your sense of intuition and


---------91:57----------
understanding


---------91:58----------
so like knowledge and nyan comes from


---------92:01----------
the third eye


---------92:02----------
and i think that when you're the journey


---------92:04----------
that you're on


---------92:05----------
jack is like one that really has to do


---------92:07----------
with a lot of like


---------92:08----------
understanding and so i don't think you


---------92:11----------
need success


---------92:12----------
i don't think you need self-compassion i


---------92:14----------
don't think you need to


---------92:15----------
you know conquer your impulsive desires


---------92:17----------
or anything like that there are


---------92:18----------
techniques for all that kind of crap


---------92:20----------
but i think if i had to share one thing


---------92:21----------
with you it would just be to enhance


---------92:23----------
your ability to understand


---------92:26----------
i was about to say yourself but i'm not


---------92:28----------
going to add anything just understand


---------92:30----------
period


---------92:31----------
okay um how does that sound to you great


---------92:36----------
so i want you to sit up straight your


---------92:39----------
back and neck need to be straight


---------92:40----------
okay okay so this is um so


---------92:44----------
and uh take off your glasses


---------92:47----------
i think yeah okay so i know this is


---------92:50----------
gonna sound it's gonna be really weird


---------92:52----------
but what i'm gonna ask you to do is


---------92:53----------
is close your close your eyes and then


---------92:56----------
i'm going to ask you to take i'll show


---------92:58----------
you so i want you to take your middle


---------93:00----------
finger and i want you to hover it


---------93:02----------
like maybe a few centimeters


---------93:06----------
off of the middle of your two eyebrows


---------93:08----------
and slightly above


---------93:10----------
okay so there's a point right here yeah


---------93:12----------
now close your eyes don't touch


---------93:14----------
don't touch and focus on the sensation


---------93:18----------
kind of in your forehead that your


---------93:21----------
middle finger is hovering over


---------93:27----------
are you able to kind of feel something


---------93:29----------
there


---------93:30----------
yeah yeah that's weird yes it's gonna be


---------93:34----------
so just focus on that for like let's say


---------93:38----------
so actually let's pause for a second go


---------93:40----------
ahead and open your eyes


---------93:41----------
so what we're going to do is we're going


---------93:42----------
to do some deep breathing for about 30


---------93:44----------
seconds and then i want you to start


---------93:46----------
that practice


---------93:48----------
and then we're going gonna do that for


---------93:49----------
about 60 seconds where you're going to


---------93:51----------
hold your middle finger over that point


---------93:53----------
and then after about 60 seconds i'm


---------93:56----------
going to ask you to relax


---------93:57----------
i want you to adopt let me think about


---------94:00----------
this


---------94:01----------
chin mudra so do this with your hands


---------94:06----------
okay and then put them palms face up


---------94:10----------
on your knees when we're done okay so


---------94:13----------
it's gonna be 30 seconds of breathing


---------94:14----------
one minute of finger over that and then


---------94:16----------
adopt this mudra


---------94:18----------
and then just sit there and i want you


---------94:19----------
to continue concentrating on that spot


---------94:22----------
okay okay and we'll do a total of about


---------94:25----------
maybe three minutes of practice


---------94:27----------
so 30 seconds 60 seconds and then 90


---------94:29----------
seconds of just focusing on that spot


---------94:32----------
okay two questions yeah when i do this


---------94:35----------
should i keep my eyes closed yes eyes


---------94:38----------
closed the whole time


---------94:39----------
okay and will you prompt me when to


---------94:42----------
switch yes


---------94:43----------
okay okay beautiful okay so let's close


---------94:46----------
your eyes


---------94:48----------
and let's just start by anchoring


---------94:49----------
ourself in the breath


---------95:13----------
breathe nice and slow


---------95:16----------
really want to stretch out that


---------95:26----------
exhalation


---------95:29----------
and now take your middle finger on your


---------95:31----------
right hand and hover it between your


---------95:33----------
eyebrows and slightly above


---------95:37----------
and you can vary how close it is you


---------95:39----------
don't want to touch


---------95:41----------
but there's going to be a particular


---------95:44----------
distance


---------95:44----------
that will kind of maximize the sensation


---------95:50----------
so focus on that sensation we'll do this


---------95:53----------
for about 60 seconds


---------95:56----------
don't try to move around too much


---------95:59----------
once you find like a decent spot just


---------96:01----------
stay there


---------96:03----------
and concentrate on your eyebrow center


---------96:34----------
it may feel a little bit intense


---------96:38----------
but try to stay on top of it continue


---------96:41----------
your attention there


---------97:01----------
and now let your hands come down let


---------97:03----------
your eyes remain closed


---------97:05----------
and continue concentrating on that point


---------97:07----------
now in a relaxed manner


---------97:54----------
try to drive your attention


---------97:58----------
or put energy into that point


---------98:03----------
focus your concentration


---------98:06----------
into the eyebrow center


---------98:19----------
we'll practice for another 60 seconds


---------99:05----------
now let yourself come back


---------99:08----------
let your eyes remain closed but let the


---------99:12----------
eyebrow center go


---------99:15----------
return back to where you are


---------99:21----------
your breath returns


---------99:26----------
notice your body and your mind as they


---------99:28----------
start to wake up again


---------99:39----------
and now i want you to put your palms


---------99:41----------
together in front of you in sort of a


---------99:42----------
namaste position


---------99:45----------
and then rub them together rub rub rub


---------99:47----------
rub rub hot


---------99:48----------
hot hot and cup them over your eyes


---------99:53----------
take a deep breath in and as you exhale


---------99:55----------
slowly open your eyes with your palms


---------99:58----------
covering them


---------100:00----------
as the breath completes let your hands


---------100:02----------
come down


---------100:11----------
that was great


---------100:14----------
smile says it all yeah


---------100:18----------
i love that what did you love about it


---------100:22----------
i love the what's the right word for it


---------100:26----------
i love the


---------100:27----------
the focus of it i tend to


---------100:30----------
when i try and meditate on my own i tend


---------100:32----------
to get very sporadic


---------100:34----------
thoughts and it's it's very hard to


---------100:36----------
control them and


---------100:38----------
bring them back non-judgmentally to


---------100:40----------
nothing


---------100:42----------
and it's like to focus on my breath and


---------100:43----------
everything is one thing but then i get


---------100:44----------
aware of like


---------100:46----------
am i breathing too much am i breathing


---------100:47----------
too little that kind of stuff so it's


---------100:49----------
nice


---------100:50----------
to like it shut off my brain more i


---------100:52----------
think


---------100:53----------
and it helped me have a better focal


---------100:55----------
point did you experience any sensations


---------101:00----------
um i don't think so on the first time


---------101:03----------
okay just sort of like


---------101:04----------
a lightness okay totally fine


---------101:08----------
um but you know if it if it grabbed your


---------101:10----------
attention


---------101:11----------
that's the point of a good meditation


---------101:13----------
technique and i think this is hard


---------101:15----------
because


---------101:15----------
you know this gets we get this gets lost


---------101:17----------
with like all of the apps


---------101:19----------
because the apps aren't really tailored


---------101:22----------
right


---------101:22----------
but i think you know a good meditation


---------101:24----------
technique should


---------101:26----------
help it become easier for you to


---------101:28----------
meditate


---------101:29----------
and and ideally what a good meditation


---------101:32----------
technique would do is let your mind


---------101:34----------
fall into the meditation more naturally


---------101:36----------
as opposed to like


---------101:38----------
wrangling it and forcing it in right


---------101:41----------
um which is i think the way that a lot


---------101:43----------
of people kind of do it nowadays but


---------101:45----------
you know yeah so i i'd say


---------101:48----------
i think a lot of people tend to think


---------101:49----------
like am i meditating right am i doing it


---------101:52----------
is this meditation yep and i think for


---------101:54----------
me a good one was um


---------101:56----------
binaural stimulation helped a lot and i


---------101:59----------
talked to a therapist before about like


---------102:00----------
cognitive behavioral stuff and like


---------102:02----------
doing stuff with like a pen back and


---------102:04----------
forth and like making sure your eyes are


---------102:06----------
drifting back and forth and that


---------102:07----------
that definitely helped me a lot so


---------102:09----------
anything sort of like


---------102:11----------
anything with sort of like a sensation


---------102:13----------
kind of gets me into it more i think


---------102:16----------
yeah and also if if there's a


---------102:18----------
fluctuating sensation i think that's


---------102:20----------
going to work better for you too


---------102:22----------
but i really think you you sort of


---------102:24----------
stumbled upon the preparatory practice


---------102:26----------
to this practice so this


---------102:28----------
practice is sort of phase two of a


---------102:30----------
sequence of practices


---------102:31----------
and phase one is concentrating on your


---------102:33----------
breath in the tip of your nose and


---------102:35----------
actually gazing


---------102:36----------
at the tip of your nose um so i think


---------102:39----------
you're sort of naturally gravitating


---------102:40----------
along this path i think also where you


---------102:42----------
are it sort of fits because this is the


---------102:45----------
path of like understanding it's not


---------102:47----------
going to do anything for you it's just


---------102:48----------
going to give you answers


---------102:52----------
and so try it out i'd say you can do


---------102:53----------
this practice for


---------102:55----------
three to five minutes i recommend about


---------102:58----------
20 minutes of total practice


---------103:00----------
at least three days a week that's from a


---------103:02----------
clinical standpoint and sort of a


---------103:04----------
neuroscience standpoint what's required


---------103:06----------
to make


---------103:06----------
changes in your brain right but i would


---------103:10----------
try to do this practice three to five


---------103:11----------
minutes and then you can combine


---------103:13----------
you know the other things that you do


---------103:14----------
with it you can lengthen it out if you


---------103:16----------
want to if you want to do this for a


---------103:17----------
full 20 minutes that would be wonderful


---------103:19----------
but


---------103:20----------
don't stress about it sure i'll try it


---------103:24----------
and then if we get a chance if you do


---------103:26----------
the practice diligently


---------103:27----------
and we get a chance to follow up at some


---------103:29----------
point um


---------103:31----------
you know just let me know and then i'll


---------103:33----------
teach you


---------103:34----------
step three okay


---------103:37----------
okay exciting okay well


---------103:40----------
thanks for coming on jack no problem


---------103:43----------
this is great


---------103:44----------
yeah and and good luck to you any last


---------103:46----------
thoughts or questions before we


---------103:48----------
wrap up uh no i was just gonna ask about


---------103:51----------
like um


---------103:52----------
how long to meditate and how often and


---------103:54----------
stuff like that so you answered that


---------103:55----------
already


---------103:56----------
yeah um good well you know


---------103:59----------
best of luck to you i think it was


---------104:00----------
awesome having you i i hope that


---------104:03----------
i really loved our conversation um it


---------104:06----------
was


---------104:06----------
awesome because i think you've come so


---------104:08----------
far on your own it's like really fun to


---------104:10----------
work with someone who's


---------104:11----------
you know halfway there yeah no this is


---------104:14----------
great this is the


---------104:15----------
type of conversation that i love and


---------104:17----------
i've always been trying to like champion


---------104:18----------
mental health for years on


---------104:20----------
youtube and what i do so it's good to


---------104:22----------
have like


---------104:23----------
tools to deal with this sort of stuff


---------104:25----------
and just talk it out and reaffirm things


---------104:28----------
yeah i think it's wonderful that you're


---------104:29----------
championing mental health i think part


---------104:31----------
of


---------104:32----------
you know a mistake that we sometimes


---------104:34----------
make is because sometimes


---------104:35----------
things do get kind of emotionally


---------104:37----------
cathartic on this channel i think


---------104:38----------
everyone thinks that understanding


---------104:40----------
mental health has to be like


---------104:42----------
a painful you know tearful kind of thing


---------104:45----------
but i i think


---------104:45----------
understanding your mind is can actually


---------104:48----------
be like a really fun


---------104:50----------
and kind of curious sort of exploration


---------104:53----------
and i think you really exemplified that


---------104:55----------
really really well today


---------104:57----------
it doesn't have to be like therapy you


---------104:59----------
know where you're like talking about


---------105:00----------
like uh my dad


---------105:01----------
like passed away and like he didn't love


---------105:03----------
me yeah


---------105:04----------
it's like you know you know your dad


---------105:06----------
loved you it's clear yeah you know


---------105:07----------
you don't need to be tragic about it


---------105:09----------
exactly right so


---------105:10----------
exploring mental health even the


---------105:12----------
challenges that we face can actually be


---------105:14----------
like


---------105:14----------
pleasant enjoyable and funny and


---------105:16----------
insightful


---------105:18----------
and i think you did a wonderful job of


---------105:19----------
kind of walking that journey today so


---------105:21----------
