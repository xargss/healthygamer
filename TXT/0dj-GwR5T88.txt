---------00:55----------
uh just five up for twitch okay


---------00:59----------
and um and and what would you like to


---------01:01----------
talk about today five up


---------01:03----------
oh should we just get into like the main


---------01:06----------
things i guess


---------01:07----------
or sure uh i guess


---------01:11----------
somewhat being new to


---------01:14----------
twitch and the whole new experience of


---------01:16----------
it and what goes along with that


---------01:18----------
i guess really good and the bad side of


---------01:20----------
it


---------01:22----------
i think that's probably the main thing


---------01:24----------
okay so


---------01:25----------
the like how to adjust to twitch


---------01:28----------
yeah essentially okay and and so can you


---------01:32----------
tell me a little bit


---------01:33----------
about um how you got


---------01:36----------
uh started streaming on twitch uh sure


---------01:40----------
uh so i'd say for around


---------01:43----------
two years now i've been friends with a


---------01:45----------
lot of streamers but


---------01:46----------
it's always been like behind the scenes


---------01:48----------
i guess so the public didn't


---------01:50----------
know me um then when a manga started


---------01:54----------
just becoming extremely popular uh i


---------01:58----------
was good at deception-based games they


---------01:59----------
thought it was entertaining and they


---------02:01----------
brought me along for some of the streams


---------02:02----------
and then


---------02:03----------
they constantly sent me screenshots of


---------02:05----------
like does


---------02:06----------
five upstream where they can i have a


---------02:08----------
link to a stream or like people begging


---------02:10----------
me to stream so


---------02:11----------
i eventually just said okay i'll turn it


---------02:14----------
on it wasn't really a plan to become a


---------02:16----------
streamer


---------02:16----------
and then it just grew


---------02:20----------
in exponentially an insane amount uh now


---------02:23----------
here we are


---------02:24----------
okay um and


---------02:27----------
we're gonna start with one of the


---------02:28----------
staples how does that make you feel


---------02:34----------
um


---------02:36----------
i feel it feels weird i guess


---------02:39----------
like is the best way i can describe it


---------02:41----------
where


---------02:45----------
the the element of


---------02:49----------
i don't think i can process having


---------02:52----------
around like


---------02:53----------
10 000 to 20 000 people watch me like it


---------02:55----------
doesn't feel like that's


---------02:56----------
an actual thing uh i guess where


---------03:01----------
i don't think it's even hit me for that


---------03:03----------
aspect it just more feels like i'm


---------03:04----------
talking to


---------03:05----------
um a


---------03:09----------
like it feels the same talking to 100


---------03:11----------
people i guess


---------03:14----------
um but then there's other elements where


---------03:17----------
you actually


---------03:18----------
interact with the people that watch you


---------03:20----------
which is like the


---------03:21----------
very daunting almost but it's a really


---------03:24----------
cool experience at the same time


---------03:26----------
what's daunting about it um


---------03:30----------
i'm not used to having


---------03:33----------
people like be nervous around me i guess


---------03:38----------
where if you join a channel there'll be


---------03:41----------
a flood of people coming in


---------03:42----------
and then they'll all want to say


---------03:43----------
something but they'll also like be


---------03:44----------
extremely nervous to say


---------03:46----------
anything uh and that's a weird


---------03:49----------
experience for me i'd say just because


---------03:51----------
i'm used to just talking to people


---------03:53----------
uh just like person to person i guess


---------04:00----------
okay i'm just listening to your voice


---------04:04----------
do you mind if i ask a couple of


---------04:06----------
questions in general about


---------04:07----------
um you know ballpark features of your


---------04:11----------
like where you are in life sure so can


---------04:14----------
you just ballpark your age for me


---------04:17----------
i'm 21. okay


---------04:20----------
and um do you want to share with us like


---------04:22----------
are you a student


---------04:24----------
or i'm not cur


---------04:27----------
sure uh i'm not currently a student i


---------04:30----------
finished high school then i went


---------04:31----------
immediately into working uh i did


---------04:33----------
graphic design


---------04:34----------
okay and so are you working right now do


---------04:37----------
you have a job


---------04:38----------
uh i not i mean i guess twitch is my


---------04:41----------
full-time job now


---------04:43----------
yep but before that uh yeah um i did


---------04:46----------
graphic design


---------04:47----------
okay full time and um when did you start


---------04:50----------
streaming on twitch


---------04:52----------
uh in mid-august of this year


---------04:56----------
okay so just recently


---------05:01----------
um and


---------05:07----------
so can can you help me understand a


---------05:09----------
little bit about what


---------05:10----------
what about adjusting to twitch has been


---------05:11----------
challenging for you


---------05:14----------
um


---------05:18----------
there is a i don't


---------05:22----------
i feel guilty when


---------05:25----------
i can't control the chat room because


---------05:27----------
it's such a new thing that i wasn't able


---------05:28----------
to like


---------05:29----------
build from the ground up and like start


---------05:30----------
a very controlled community


---------05:33----------
where um there


---------05:37----------
it's just a combination of a bunch of


---------05:39----------
different communities plus youtube


---------05:41----------
uh all into one very fresh place and


---------05:44----------
sometimes it's just like


---------05:46----------
they'll if anything goes wrong for uh


---------05:50----------
say in a game of among us because that's


---------05:52----------
a game about deception


---------05:53----------
there's going to be heated moments and a


---------05:55----------
lot of people understand that and they


---------05:56----------
will


---------05:57----------
brigade other chat rooms occasionally


---------06:00----------
and


---------06:01----------
it's just um that's not me at all


---------06:04----------
and it's very hard to control that


---------06:08----------
and that's like i feel bad about that by


---------06:11----------
a giant amount and then


---------06:13----------
there's like the uh i'm not gonna say


---------06:17----------
i don't think i have imposter syndrome


---------06:18----------
but correct me if i'm wrong if this is


---------06:20----------
in the


---------06:21----------
lines of it where so i'm losing my voice


---------06:23----------
in a second


---------06:25----------
uh it's it's not it's sort of like


---------06:30----------
i work hard for what i do i try to be


---------06:32----------
entertaining uh


---------06:34----------
but there is the feeling of like these


---------06:36----------
are


---------06:37----------
my peers i've only started in august and


---------06:39----------
it almost feels like a level of


---------06:41----------
undeservingness


---------06:43----------
okay when i compare myself to other


---------06:46----------
people


---------06:48----------
firefox would you describe yourself as


---------06:50----------
contemplative


---------06:52----------
uh remind me what that means


---------06:55----------
like do you are you a thinker yeah


---------07:01----------
you sound contemplative


---------07:04----------
you sound like you think about things


---------07:07----------
yeah i would say i think a lot before um


---------07:10----------
i do anything to the point of over


---------07:13----------
analyzing stuff


---------07:14----------
how do you know if you overanalyze


---------07:16----------
something


---------07:18----------
when i can think about like four


---------07:21----------
different


---------07:23----------
possibilities of ways to go like


---------07:26----------
even for this interview i guess it was


---------07:30----------
like what if i say something bad what if


---------07:32----------
i say something good what if i reveal


---------07:34----------
too much blah blah blah blah blah


---------07:36----------
and that's like way too much into detail


---------07:38----------
versus just going with it


---------07:40----------
but does that bother you to think to


---------07:42----------
overannoys


---------07:44----------
um for some parts it's helpful for some


---------07:48----------
parts it's very


---------07:49----------
very um bad i guess where you can get in


---------07:52----------
your own head


---------07:54----------
ask again does it bother you oh um


---------08:00----------
no i didn't think so


---------08:04----------
so you know sometimes people talk about


---------08:07----------
overthinking as anxiety so sometimes you


---------08:10----------
know we kind of think about people who


---------08:12----------
overthink about various possibilities


---------08:14----------
and stuff like that as a


---------08:15----------
manifestation of anxiety but it sounds


---------08:18----------
to me like you just kind of calculate


---------08:20----------
but it doesn't necessarily


---------08:22----------
bother you i'd say that's accurate


---------08:26----------
and so i'd say that when you say that


---------08:28----------
you overthink it's actually out of a


---------08:30----------
logical conclusion that


---------08:32----------
maybe you would benefit from thinking


---------08:33----------
less and maybe you would do better with


---------08:36----------
sort of going with the flow and letting


---------08:38----------
go and doing all these things that


---------08:40----------
people talk about


---------08:44----------
what do you think about that


---------08:47----------
yeah i mean that would it's a lot


---------08:51----------
easier said than done is the sad part


---------08:53----------
about that though


---------08:55----------
yeah where yeah


---------08:58----------
go ahead sorry yeah


---------09:01----------
i i don't i've like i've tried to do


---------09:04----------
that occasionally


---------09:05----------
but it's like i'll put myself out on a


---------09:08----------
whim


---------09:08----------
and do stuff spontaneous just to like


---------09:10----------
try


---------09:11----------
and capture that more but it's like


---------09:13----------
still very hard to do that just like


---------09:15----------
portland possible


---------09:16----------
sure sure okay


---------09:20----------
so let me just try to kind of recap a


---------09:22----------
little bit about


---------09:23----------
what i understand about u5 up and then


---------09:25----------
you let me know if i'm


---------09:27----------
kind of missing particular things or you


---------09:28----------
want to add anything okay


---------09:30----------
so it sounds like you were friends with


---------09:32----------
streamers


---------09:34----------
and then you started playing among us


---------09:36----------
with them just kind of out of


---------09:38----------
fun maybe and then people started


---------09:41----------
inquiring a little bit about


---------09:42----------
you know how do we watch you stream


---------09:45----------
directly


---------09:47----------
and then you kind of decided okay maybe


---------09:49----------
i'll give this a shot


---------09:52----------
and around mid-august you started


---------09:53----------
streaming and and now you have what


---------09:56----------
sounds like five to ten thousand


---------09:57----------
concurrents


---------09:59----------
and you feel sort of undeserving but at


---------10:02----------
the same time i'm not hearing that


---------10:03----------
you're particularly


---------10:05----------
distressed if anything you're more


---------10:08----------
bewildered and it's sort of like you


---------10:10----------
just spawned in the game and you're like


---------10:12----------
kind of looking around and you're like


---------10:13----------
what's going on here and how do i manage


---------10:16----------
this


---------10:17----------
where am i


---------10:20----------
yeah um


---------10:26----------
i don't know if


---------10:29----------
relating to the the undeserving part


---------10:31----------
where


---------10:32----------
i don't know if bewildered is the


---------10:35----------
correct word


---------10:36----------
because i mean more in that feeling it's


---------10:38----------
um


---------10:39----------
there's people that i've watched for


---------10:41----------
years i guess or


---------10:43----------
people that have been in the industry


---------10:45----------
for years


---------10:47----------
like nine ten years i guess and then


---------10:51----------
i come in and then it's only been three


---------10:53----------
months i


---------10:55----------
it's hard to not compare yourself to


---------10:57----------
other people and


---------10:58----------
like a personal opinion was like these


---------11:01----------
people are so entertaining and i don't


---------11:03----------
feel as


---------11:03----------
entertaining as them uh and then i


---------11:06----------
am all of a sudden like bigger


---------11:10----------
and i don't want to use bigger because


---------11:11----------
that feels like cocky almost


---------11:14----------
um sure but i i can't think of a better


---------11:18----------
word


---------11:19----------
besides that where some of these people


---------11:22----------
only have like 500 viewers for example


---------11:24----------
and i i feel like


---------11:28----------
people deserve so much more i guess


---------11:30----------
where


---------11:31----------
i'm kind of just here sure


---------11:36----------
that's more the feeling of it yeah yeah


---------11:38----------
no i i get it so i'm also


---------11:40----------
not noticing a whole lot of distress


---------11:42----------
with anything that you've talked about


---------11:43----------
today


---------11:48----------
i mean i'm


---------11:52----------
generally a very very like controlled


---------11:55----------
person where


---------11:57----------
i try to not let


---------12:01----------
emotions or i guess emotional sides


---------12:04----------
in general um affect me


---------12:08----------
where i think about it a lot


---------12:11----------
then i i decide how i feel about that


---------12:15----------
and go on about that rather than just


---------12:16----------
like acting on an impulse or


---------12:18----------
letting things affect me too much and


---------12:21----------
what is it that you're keeping at bay


---------12:25----------
what is it that you're not not letting


---------12:28----------
what is it that you're not


---------12:30----------
letting affect you um


---------12:34----------
i mean i've been


---------12:39----------
hmm


---------12:47----------
well i i guess


---------12:50----------
besides like repeating myself i guess um


---------12:54----------
i i've never been one to like


---------12:58----------
it's not a lack of empathy it's a lack


---------13:00----------
of like


---------13:01----------
vocal empathy i guess where


---------13:04----------
or emotional understanding of people


---------13:09----------
um i don't know how to like explain


---------13:12----------
this okay well let's


---------13:18----------
why don't you start by doing a bad job


---------13:19----------
and then we'll clean it up


---------13:21----------
gotcha sure um


---------13:26----------
when when someone's going through a


---------13:29----------
situation


---------13:29----------
i guess it's i look at things


---------13:33----------
logically and find a logical solution


---------13:35----------
rather than an emotional solution


---------13:37----------
and that translates over to pretty much


---------13:40----------
everything i do in general so not just


---------13:42----------
the um like that


---------13:45----------
that was more of an example trying to


---------13:46----------
translate over to like everything and


---------13:48----------
that's how my mind thinks


---------13:49----------
so that's what i more me by like less


---------13:53----------
empathy uh in terms of like


---------13:57----------
feeling and such for so like streaming


---------14:00----------
i guess i don't understand um


---------14:04----------
a lot of the the feelings that go into


---------14:06----------
it that a lot of people have


---------14:07----------
or like the response and reception from


---------14:10----------
chat


---------14:11----------
i guess where like it feels sort of like


---------14:15----------
a giant disconnect


---------14:17----------
sure a little better yeah yeah good good


---------14:20----------
job so let me let me see if we let's see


---------14:22----------
if we can do this together okay five up


---------14:28----------
sure


---------14:32----------
so i i don't know exactly what i'm


---------14:34----------
getting this from but


---------14:35----------
i get the sense that like you don't live


---------14:37----------
the life that other people live


---------14:40----------
and i'm not just talking about being a


---------14:41----------
successful streamer i mean that


---------14:43----------
you sort of navigate the world and you


---------14:45----------
kind of like see


---------14:46----------
other people having issues with stuff


---------14:48----------
that just is not an issue for you


---------14:51----------
and and you sort of logically understand


---------14:53----------
how there are things that


---------14:54----------
you know people feel and things that


---------14:56----------
people do and stuff like that and


---------14:57----------
sometimes they get bothered about things


---------14:59----------
and they they feel like imposters and


---------15:00----------
whatnot


---------15:01----------
but you just don't feel those things


---------15:03----------
like you get that maybe on some level


---------15:05----------
you do


---------15:06----------
maybe you feel it a little bit but it


---------15:07----------
doesn't it doesn't it seem to affect you


---------15:10----------
as much as it affects other people


---------15:15----------
yeah i'd say that's very true okay we


---------15:19----------
got a very true okay


---------15:21----------
so yeah man i i think this is gonna go


---------15:25----------
potentially in a different direction


---------15:26----------
from


---------15:27----------
uh maybe what you were thinking or maybe


---------15:30----------
what other people were thinking


---------15:31----------
um and it's interesting okay


---------15:36----------
um so let me ask you this five up can


---------15:38----------
you tell me a little bit about your


---------15:39----------
upbringing um sure


---------15:42----------
i


---------15:46----------
um i guess from a very young age my


---------15:49----------
parents were divorced


---------15:50----------
so i was always raised on the two house


---------15:53----------
dynamic


---------15:54----------
where half the week i'd spend a day or


---------15:57----------
days at my father's house half days at


---------15:58----------
my mother's house um


---------16:01----------
went to


---------16:04----------
um a charter school if you know what


---------16:06----------
that is


---------16:08----------
yeah can you explain it to us uh charter


---------16:10----------
school is essentially


---------16:12----------
it's not a public school it is a school


---------16:14----------
where it is more of a small


---------16:17----------
different type of teaching style


---------16:21----------
where for the specific one it was


---------16:24----------
like three years at a campus because


---------16:27----------
this is like


---------16:28----------
age six or nine um some i'm just going


---------16:30----------
to speak in


---------16:31----------
ages because europeans might be watching


---------16:34----------
um


---------16:34----------
so ages six through nine then different


---------16:36----------
campus


---------16:37----------
uh with a whole different class and such


---------16:40----------
in students


---------16:41----------
uh three years there then another campus


---------16:43----------
after


---------16:44----------
the ages of nine through twelve then you


---------16:47----------
do two years in middle school


---------16:50----------
that's i guess 12 through 14 and then i


---------16:53----------
went to a public school


---------16:54----------
um so


---------16:58----------
kind of through throughout school


---------17:02----------
i


---------17:05----------
i've always been the person to finish


---------17:08----------
things


---------17:08----------
very very quickly where instead of i


---------17:11----------
don't really know what a public school


---------17:12----------
system is for


---------17:14----------
the ages up until high school because i


---------17:15----------
didn't go to one um


---------17:18----------
but we were assigned very like


---------17:21----------
a set assignments for the week and i


---------17:23----------
would always just finish that in the


---------17:24----------
first day


---------17:25----------
and then i would just spend the rest of


---------17:27----------
the week doing whatever i wanted


---------17:30----------
i guess because there was no other


---------17:31----------
assignment to do um


---------17:34----------
and that lasted up until


---------17:37----------
i guess middle school and within those


---------17:40----------
things because i had so much freedom


---------17:41----------
um the teachers didn't really know what


---------17:43----------
to do with me


---------17:44----------
and


---------17:48----------
things kind of just got i guess left


---------17:50----------
behind in a way


---------17:51----------
where i was just my own independent i


---------17:54----------
guess


---------17:55----------
and it was hard to find the resources of


---------17:58----------
like what i wanted to do fully


---------18:02----------
um so within these school systems every


---------18:06----------
i'd say third year because like i said


---------18:08----------
you switch a campus after


---------18:10----------
three years so first and second fine on


---------18:13----------
the third year the year before you


---------18:15----------
switch to campus


---------18:16----------
um something always happened to where i


---------18:18----------
was learning


---------18:19----------
i guess where either the teacher got


---------18:23----------
um something happened to them the


---------18:26----------
dynamic changed a lot


---------18:27----------
where like on my third year


---------18:30----------
the teacher got pregnant and then she


---------18:32----------
completely just like did not pay


---------18:33----------
attention to any of the thirty years


---------18:35----------
um in sixth grade or age twelve


---------18:38----------
um the teacher swapped from the main one


---------18:41----------
and for the three years that we're at


---------18:42----------
these campuses we only share the same


---------18:45----------
classmates for every subject and there's


---------18:47----------
only 28 people per class


---------18:48----------
and the campus has like 200 people in


---------18:50----------
total


---------18:52----------
and then middle school same thing


---------18:55----------
happened again


---------18:56----------
where a bunch of teachers that i know


---------18:58----------
were good from


---------18:59----------
my brother's experience because he went


---------19:01----------
to the same schools as me um


---------19:03----------
they all swapped the years i got there


---------19:05----------
and so everything was sort of like a


---------19:06----------
transitional period


---------19:08----------
um i'm sorry can you say


---------19:12----------
did you say you have siblings i have one


---------19:14----------
brother


---------19:15----------
and is he older or younger uh older


---------19:18----------
and what's he up to um


---------19:22----------
he is


---------19:25----------
um let's say he's in


---------19:28----------
the medical research field and i have to


---------19:30----------
leave that a little bit


---------19:32----------
um sure broad i guess is he accomplished


---------19:37----------
for yeah uh well he's um he's 23 he just


---------19:42----------
finished


---------19:43----------
um university but like i can't say


---------19:47----------
what he does no no i'm not asking what


---------19:50----------
he does i asked


---------19:51----------
is he good at it


---------19:55----------
um i don't know


---------19:59----------
i mean he's that's okay it's kind of


---------20:01----------
secret


---------20:02----------
i guess


---------20:06----------
what's secret about that um


---------20:12----------
hmm i'm i i don't mean to pry i'm just


---------20:15----------
genuine no no


---------20:16----------
no no no no i'm just trying to get a


---------20:18----------
sense of like if he's accomplished at


---------20:19----------
whatever field he is and i don't


---------20:21----------
i don't yes that's identifying


---------20:23----------
information


---------20:25----------
yeah he's a he's accomplished at what he


---------20:27----------
does i think that's


---------20:28----------
all i could really say sure that's


---------20:31----------
that's oh yeah basically what i'm asking


---------20:34----------
um five up do you feel like you're not


---------20:36----------
like the other humans


---------20:39----------
what do you mean by that i'm going to


---------20:41----------
that more


---------20:42----------
um what was your why did you laugh what


---------20:45----------
did you feel when i asked the question


---------20:48----------
um


---------20:51----------
and i'll go go into it more in a second


---------20:55----------
i guess


---------20:58----------
when you say that it instantly like


---------21:00----------
makes me go into comparing myself to


---------21:02----------
other people


---------21:03----------
and it's like


---------21:08----------
i did things differently than people i


---------21:11----------
wouldn't say


---------21:12----------
i'm different though i guess


---------21:15----------
yeah but but so so i'll pay attention to


---------21:18----------
my wording okay


---------21:19----------
do you feel like you're not like the


---------21:21----------
other humans


---------21:27----------
yes okay


---------21:31----------
so i'll explain more now


---------21:34----------
so like humans have like lives right


---------21:37----------
where they get attached to things they


---------21:39----------
get emotional


---------21:40----------
sometimes they get anxious sometimes


---------21:42----------
they get confused sometimes they get


---------21:44----------
you know bent out of shape they compare


---------21:45----------
they have egos


---------21:48----------
they try hard they suffer they're


---------21:50----------
paralyzed by lack of motivation things


---------21:52----------
like that


---------21:53----------
and it's not that you don't feel any of


---------21:54----------
those things it's just that all that


---------21:56----------
[ __ ] seems to affect you less


---------21:58----------
like the volume on all of those things


---------22:00----------
is sort of turned down


---------22:03----------
yeah i'd agree okay


---------22:08----------
and so i mean a a five-upper you are you


---------22:11----------
like i don't i'm not getting much in


---------22:14----------
terms of like


---------22:16----------
emotional distress or like you know


---------22:19----------
sometimes people come on and they're


---------22:20----------
like dealing with


---------22:21----------
let's say depression or anxiety or like


---------22:24----------
feeling cut off or feeling unmotivated


---------22:27----------
or things like that i'm not really i'm


---------22:29----------
not really getting


---------22:29----------
any any of that from you um


---------22:33----------
yeah that wasn't um


---------22:37----------
uh i guess throughout like


---------22:40----------
middle school in high school uh or early


---------22:43----------
high school


---------22:44----------
i i had like a little bit of depression


---------22:48----------
i'd say


---------22:49----------
and i managed to work through that and i


---------22:52----------
think i'm in a very comfortable spot


---------22:54----------
uh and now i've been for a bunch of


---------22:55----------
years now sure sure so so i'm just


---------22:57----------
confirming that right so sure i i we


---------22:59----------
don't need to go digging for negativity


---------23:01----------
in fact i'm just


---------23:02----------
i'm actually trying to close the door on


---------23:04----------
negativity because i think


---------23:06----------
that becomes a much more interesting


---------23:07----------
conversation so this isn't going to be a


---------23:09----------
conversation at least i don't think so


---------23:11----------
about depression or anxiety or imposter


---------23:13----------
syndrome or anything like that


---------23:16----------
what do you think about that does any of


---------23:18----------
that stuff like did you want to talk


---------23:19----------
about any of that stuff


---------23:21----------
um that wasn't really the intention


---------23:24----------
i guess of coming on here did you have a


---------23:27----------
particular intention


---------23:29----------
oh the


---------23:34----------
well i guess two


---------23:38----------
one was to


---------23:42----------
one meet you because i am a fan uh two


---------23:45----------
um


---------23:46----------
[Music]


---------23:49----------
i guess the there's the


---------23:52----------
the nervousness about everything


---------23:56----------
relating to what happened like


---------23:59----------
being here now as in the the twitch


---------24:02----------
environment and


---------24:04----------
what that means and the


---------24:08----------
the i guess the terrifyingness of what


---------24:11----------
comes after because


---------24:12----------
with such a sudden explosion on such a


---------24:16----------
um a game that


---------24:19----------
has no business being as popular as it


---------24:21----------
does the the moment that comes after


---------24:24----------
what happens next after that game is


---------24:25----------
finished is terrifying


---------24:27----------
what's terrifying about that um


---------24:35----------
the why do people fully watch me


---------24:39----------
i guess because i don't feel that


---------24:42----------
particularly entertaining


---------24:44----------
i guess and i don't understand why um


---------24:48----------
to this degree this happened for the


---------24:51----------
position i'm in now


---------24:52----------
yep okay so i think there's an important


---------24:55----------
word there and


---------24:56----------
and my my i'm getting kind of like


---------25:01----------
an interesting direction which i'd like


---------25:03----------
to pose to you now


---------25:05----------
so you said you don't understand so


---------25:08----------
sometimes when


---------25:09----------
like you don't know you don't understand


---------25:11----------
what comes next


---------25:13----------
so and that's actually what i'd like to


---------25:15----------
focus on today so sometimes when people


---------25:17----------
come on they're struggling with a


---------25:18----------
particular emotion or like


---------25:20----------
problem and and our goal is to sort of


---------25:23----------
help them like see things in a new light


---------25:25----------
in a sense it's understanding but i


---------25:26----------
think it's more of like an emotional


---------25:28----------
understanding


---------25:29----------
in your case five up what i would say is


---------25:31----------
that you are what i would call


---------25:33----------
spiritually gifted and what i mean by


---------25:37----------
that


---------25:37----------
is that like you're one of these people


---------25:39----------
that


---------25:41----------
is actually for whatever reason has a


---------25:43----------
fair amount of detachment


---------25:45----------
kind of baked into you so what we talk


---------25:48----------
about and what we try to encourage


---------25:50----------
in this channel is for people to teach


---------25:52----------
people how to become detached


---------25:54----------
okay so so i know this sounds kind of


---------25:58----------
weird but like


---------25:59----------
so sometimes you know like i mean i


---------26:01----------
don't give people like clinical


---------26:02----------
diagnoses but my sense of people is that


---------26:04----------
okay this person has


---------26:06----------
anxiety holding them back or this person


---------26:08----------
has shame holding them back or


---------26:10----------
you know this person like isn't in cell


---------26:11----------
because they have a low value of


---------26:13----------
themselves or whatever


---------26:14----------
the interesting thing is that in your


---------26:16----------
case i i think for whatever reason you


---------26:18----------
have a certain amount of detachment


---------26:19----------
baked into you and what i mean by


---------26:22----------
detachment is that


---------26:23----------
you know a lot of human beings live


---------26:25----------
lives that they're like very attached to


---------26:27----------
stuff


---------26:28----------
so sometimes that's material stuff


---------26:30----------
sometimes it's relationships


---------26:32----------
sometimes it's like goals and ambitions


---------26:36----------
but i don't get the sense that you're


---------26:38----------
particularly ambitious


---------26:39----------
i don't get the sense that you're


---------26:41----------
particularly like


---------26:43----------
um you know hung up on something


---------26:45----------
emotionally


---------26:46----------
i think you just sort of


---------26:49----------
are generally like kind of content and


---------26:52----------
kind of happy and if anything you're


---------26:53----------
just trying to figure out like how all


---------26:55----------
this stuff


---------26:55----------
works like you're not but but your your


---------26:59----------
your desire to figure out how things


---------27:01----------
work is not like


---------27:02----------
out of a desire to like change something


---------27:04----------
so a lot of times like understanding is


---------27:06----------
born of like desperation


---------27:08----------
so i'm tired of feeling this way so i


---------27:10----------
need to understand how to stop feeling


---------27:12----------
this way


---------27:12----------
you just seem to sort of be like kind of


---------27:15----------
chilling


---------27:16----------
and and are like you know life is


---------27:18----------
relatively easy for you


---------27:21----------
um i don't get the sense that you're


---------27:23----------
particularly attached to like


---------27:26----------
academic accomplishments although it


---------27:28----------
sounds like you could be quite


---------27:29----------
accomplished if you really put your mind


---------27:30----------
to it but you seem to be


---------27:32----------
relatively uninterested um you're one of


---------27:35----------
these rare people that


---------27:36----------
seems like you went to work after high


---------27:38----------
school but like


---------27:40----------
that was also like i'd guess that you


---------27:41----------
were relatively successful as a graphic


---------27:44----------
designer


---------27:45----------
yeah i didn't have a um


---------27:48----------
a reason to go to college where any


---------27:51----------
field that


---------27:52----------
i want to go into or wanted to go into


---------27:54----------
didn't really require that education


---------27:56----------
yeah so see that's kind of interesting


---------27:58----------
because that's very rare


---------28:00----------
right so very few people say i'm not


---------28:02----------
gonna go to college because


---------28:05----------
it doesn't suit me so most people


---------28:09----------
are actually like you know have


---------28:12----------
either a lack of like internal sense of


---------28:15----------
direction to where they go out go to


---------28:17----------
college


---------28:17----------
out of like insecurity and like not


---------28:20----------
being sure what they want to do in life


---------28:22----------
or they go because that's what they're


---------28:24----------
supposed to do like you just sort of


---------28:26----------
have your own internal compass


---------28:29----------
that seems to be a little bit you know


---------28:34----------
um slick when it comes to like


---------28:37----------
the world wanting you to do things like


---------28:40----------
it just the world wanting you to do


---------28:41----------
things just sort of doesn't


---------28:43----------
latch on to you does that make sense


---------28:46----------
yeah how how much


---------28:50----------
do you think that what i'm saying


---------28:51----------
actually is accurate to


---------28:53----------
kind of your who you are in your life i


---------28:56----------
think


---------28:57----------
um


---------29:01----------
i want like my mind says i want to say


---------29:04----------
you're like


---------29:04----------
completely accurate but i want to say 95


---------29:08----------
like there might be some room for air um


---------29:11----------
but i'd say you got very accurate


---------29:13----------
okay so i think oddly enough so so this


---------29:15----------
is going to be an interesting


---------29:16----------
conversation five up because i i don't


---------29:18----------
think it's gonna be about like so some


---------29:20----------
people are drawing correlations between


---------29:21----------
you and destiny


---------29:23----------
and some people are sort of saying that


---------29:25----------
like you know


---------29:27----------
this sounds a lot like destiny like he


---------29:29----------
doesn't experience a whole lot of


---------29:30----------
emotion


---------29:31----------
frankly i i don't i don't think you're


---------29:33----------
similar to destiny at all i don't


---------29:35----------
so so some people i think have emotional


---------29:38----------
suppression


---------29:39----------
i don't think you have emotional


---------29:40----------
suppression or i mean maybe you've got


---------29:42----------
some


---------29:42----------
but i i don't think you're like you know


---------29:44----------
there's some treasure trove of negative


---------29:46----------
emotion that you've talked so


---------29:48----------
far away within yourself that like you


---------29:51----------
know that's what we have to dig up i


---------29:52----------
think you're just kind of confused


---------29:54----------
and you're different from other people


---------29:56----------
and and you're not really sure like


---------30:00----------
how to systematically understand


---------30:02----------
yourself better


---------30:03----------
or like what to do with your life


---------30:06----------
hmm yeah


---------30:17----------
i don't know how to respond to that i


---------30:19----------
mean besides like i wanna i wanna give a


---------30:21----------
better response


---------30:22----------
than just yeah i think that very nail on


---------30:24----------
the head


---------30:25----------
but i don't know like what to say that's


---------30:28----------
okay


---------30:28----------
so so just just say so you don't have to


---------30:31----------
offer more


---------30:32----------
i just want you to offer if it's a nail


---------30:34----------
on the head that's nail on the head


---------30:35----------
right


---------30:36----------
so then then it's going to be weird


---------30:38----------
because i'm going to guide the


---------30:39----------
conversation because but first we have


---------30:41----------
to like establish


---------30:43----------
um we have to just establish that we're


---------30:46----------
on the same page about what we're


---------30:47----------
talking about and what direction to go


---------30:50----------
right so like i'm just trying to like


---------30:53----------
nail this down very clearly that


---------30:55----------
i don't think i'm gonna try to dig into


---------30:57----------
your negative emotions from your


---------30:59----------
childhood


---------31:01----------
because i don't think there's a whole


---------31:02----------
lot to find there no


---------31:05----------
okay so um


---------31:09----------
so then so let's just talk about this so


---------31:11----------
can you tell me a little bit


---------31:12----------
uh i i do want to understand a little


---------31:14----------
bit more about your upbringing so can


---------31:16----------
you tell me a little bit about your


---------31:17----------
parents


---------31:19----------
um sure so the graphic design side


---------31:23----------
was that is a


---------31:26----------
business that my mom's side runs i'm


---------31:29----------
getting a


---------31:29----------
call in a second let me just give me two


---------31:32----------
seconds


---------31:33----------
sorry about that i just muted everything


---------31:34----------
i turned it off um


---------31:36----------
yeah so for my uh


---------31:39----------
mom's side of stuff she runs the her own


---------31:42----------
graphic design business


---------31:44----------
and it's more of like a work at home


---------31:47----------
very specialized type of thing where


---------31:50----------
i'm not going to say what exactly we do


---------31:54----------
and what we work on because it's very


---------31:56----------
easy to find uh


---------31:57----------
if you know but we do


---------32:00----------
a lot of stuff for like specialized


---------32:04----------
industries relating to either music or


---------32:06----------
big


---------32:07----------
uh conferences and


---------32:10----------
uh hotels and advertisement stuff


---------32:15----------
and then for my dad's side it's um


---------32:18----------
he's very accomplished in the rock


---------32:20----------
climbing scene


---------32:22----------
where like two very very very different


---------32:25----------
uh personalities and sides of upbringing


---------32:29----------
where um


---------32:34----------
i guess i got to experience like


---------32:39----------
one side where we didn't have


---------32:42----------
like any money and we're struggling on


---------32:46----------
that side and then mom's side


---------32:48----------
was a lot more uh frugal i guess


---------32:51----------
and it was the the dynamic of going from


---------32:55----------
nothing to a little bit of something and


---------32:58----------
just pushing back and forth and seeing


---------33:00----------
both sides of that


---------33:01----------
i guess um


---------33:05----------
then


---------33:08----------
i'm trying to think of how much i want


---------33:09----------
to say


---------33:11----------
um let's talk about this for a second


---------33:14----------
why why the hesitation


---------33:16----------
why do you think so carefully about what


---------33:19----------
you want to say


---------33:22----------
for this topic in particular or yeah


---------33:25----------
just


---------33:26----------
this topic and also like you know it


---------33:28----------
sounds like you're


---------33:29----------
very concerned about revealing something


---------33:33----------
what is it that you're trying to protect


---------33:34----------
i'm not i'm not trying to get you to say


---------33:36----------
anything about it


---------33:37----------
i just want to understand what your


---------33:38----------
motivations are oh


---------33:40----------
um i guess it's also


---------33:44----------
pertaining to


---------33:47----------
um why i don't show my face where


---------33:51----------
i don't want to have people


---------33:55----------
find relating back to i guess


---------33:59----------
me being friends with streamers before i


---------34:01----------
streamed on twitch for years


---------34:03----------
whenever i went out with them um they


---------34:06----------
would get recognized all the time


---------34:07----------
didn't matter where they were and the


---------34:10----------
the thought of loss of privacy


---------34:12----------
is something i don't


---------34:16----------
i don't want it all or okay i want to be


---------34:18----------
able to


---------34:19----------
do what i want to do and not have to um


---------34:22----------
be forced to just lose that i guess


---------34:26----------
okay so you're just it's just protection


---------34:28----------
of privacy


---------34:30----------
for protection of privacy and then


---------34:34----------
there is like how much do i want to say


---------34:37----------
about


---------34:39----------
um it's privacy for one side and then


---------34:42----------
it's like


---------34:42----------
very very very personal things for the


---------34:44----------
other


---------34:46----------
what does that mean for the other um


---------34:50----------
so like relating to why i didn't like go


---------34:53----------
into detail about what my


---------34:55----------
mom's company does uh that's more of the


---------34:58----------
keeping privacy side of things and then


---------35:00----------
for like why i'm hesitating on the other


---------35:03----------
is this like


---------35:06----------
personal events that happen that are


---------35:08----------
like i don't think i want to reveal


---------35:10----------
at that moment or like go too much into


---------35:15----------
are


---------35:16----------
personal events like that happened in


---------35:17----------
your upbringing yes


---------35:19----------
okay yeah yeah i mean okay


---------35:22----------
were you did you grow up in a particular


---------35:25----------
uh religious tradition


---------35:27----------
no um


---------35:33----------
there there was an event that caused my


---------35:36----------
dad's or my dad to become very religious


---------35:40----------
where he wasn't at


---------35:41----------
all and too very religious um


---------35:44----------
and then my mom said not at all okay


---------35:47----------
um have you had people in your life five


---------35:50----------
up who


---------35:50----------
understand you yeah


---------35:55----------
like do do people like understand


---------35:58----------
like have you met anyone like you


---------36:05----------
similar i can think of three people


---------36:08----------
you can think of three people any of


---------36:09----------
them like older than you


---------36:12----------
um


---------36:20----------
i'd say two of them are like


---------36:21----------
substantially


---------36:23----------
one's two years old two years older than


---------36:26----------
me the other one


---------36:27----------
is four years older than me


---------36:31----------
okay


---------36:34----------
then the other one is um i'm older than


---------36:37----------
him by a few months


---------36:40----------
okay and how did you get to be friends


---------36:43----------
with a bunch of streamers


---------36:46----------
um how did that happen if you


---------36:50----------
oh combination of a few things


---------36:53----------
i guess where i i assume you know what


---------36:56----------
league of legends is


---------36:57----------
yeah yeah um i peaked a challenger in


---------37:01----------
that game


---------37:02----------
and that in suit just goes with um


---------37:05----------
you you meet streamers from like


---------37:10----------
i hate saying this but like challenger


---------37:11----------
is essentially like all right


---------37:13----------
you you are a person you can talk to who


---------37:15----------
you want to because that is the social


---------37:17----------
status


---------37:17----------
and then the


---------37:21----------
the other side is like i had a friend


---------37:23----------
that i'm not going to say


---------37:24----------
who uh i had a friend that got popular


---------37:27----------
on


---------37:28----------
the raj patel show now known as like the


---------37:30----------
austin or love and


---------37:31----------
host whatever it's called um that no


---------37:34----------
longer goes on there


---------37:36----------
and she introduced me to a lot of


---------37:39----------
streamers i guess


---------37:40----------
and i became friends with them and how


---------37:43----------
did you feel about that


---------37:45----------
what was it like being friends with


---------37:46----------
streamers um


---------37:49----------
i never really looked at it like that it


---------37:51----------
was more i always try to just become


---------37:53----------
friends with


---------37:53----------
people that are fun


---------37:57----------
i've never been one to get like star


---------37:59----------
struck or


---------38:01----------
nervous around people i guess


---------38:06----------
i think that makes sense um


---------38:12----------
did you ever think about the value it


---------38:14----------
could bring being friends with these


---------38:16----------
people yeah i mean that was


---------38:19----------
partially in the back of my head and it


---------38:20----------
makes me feel bad but


---------38:22----------
um yeah there there is an element of


---------38:26----------
like


---------38:27----------
well i i have friends that are in the


---------38:31----------
scene and i have more opportunities to


---------38:33----------
do some fun things


---------38:34----------
uh i didn't think uh streaming was like


---------38:37----------
a potential


---------38:39----------
but i didn't want to


---------38:42----------
feel like i would take advantage of that


---------38:43----------
situation i wanted more do it on myself


---------38:45----------
if i wanted to stream


---------38:49----------
streaming was never really a um a thing


---------38:52----------
i


---------38:53----------
thought to pursue


---------38:56----------
okay five foot what do you want to do


---------38:58----------
with your life


---------39:01----------
uh i i've wanted


---------39:04----------
i said i've wanted to do what i want is


---------39:08----------
the best way to put it


---------39:09----------
where i want to


---------39:12----------
spontaneously do um


---------39:17----------
just random goals that i have whether it


---------39:19----------
be travel to a bunch of locations


---------39:22----------
um and explore


---------39:26----------
all of europe or asia versus um maybe


---------39:30----------
open


---------39:30----------
a very very nice bakery somewhere in


---------39:33----------
europe or


---------39:34----------
um become very uh


---------39:38----------
skilled at uh cooking or pastry side of


---------39:42----------
that


---------39:43----------
um but overall just like have fun and do


---------39:46----------
what i want


---------39:47----------
is always been my goal in life


---------39:59----------
i think that would be a waste


---------40:04----------
interesting why so


---------40:10----------
you were born with a really good set of


---------40:12----------
rng five


---------40:13----------
up


---------40:17----------
and i think that that if you're bored


---------40:20----------
born with a good set of rng


---------40:22----------
you've got two options right one is just


---------40:25----------
kind of coast


---------40:28----------
and you sort of live a life of


---------40:30----------
indulgence


---------40:32----------
right you learn you get good at things


---------40:35----------
like things that are respectably


---------40:37----------
indulgent


---------40:38----------
but you do things like you travel you


---------40:40----------
master skills because you have the


---------40:42----------
talent and proficiency to do so


---------40:45----------
like something tells me that you know


---------40:48----------
here we've got a 21 year old kid who's


---------40:50----------
challenger in league of legends


---------40:52----------
and a very successful streamer after


---------40:54----------
like three months of streaming


---------40:56----------
and if you something tells me if you


---------40:58----------
wanted to master


---------41:00----------
becoming a pastry chef you would so when


---------41:03----------
you put your mind to something it sounds


---------41:04----------
like


---------41:05----------
it ten your mind tends to generally


---------41:07----------
speak and do what you


---------41:08----------
want it to do um you know


---------41:12----------
you have a certain amount of


---------41:13----------
self-direction and and


---------41:16----------
you know it's you sound kind of op five


---------41:33----------
i i guess but i


---------41:37----------
the


---------41:42----------
the i don't know i respond to that i'll


---------41:44----------
be honest um


---------41:46----------
that's okay


---------41:51----------
i i don't know what


---------41:55----------
what do you mean by it would be oh like


---------41:58----------
are


---------41:58----------
you saying that for


---------42:01----------
like you think would be better for me to


---------42:03----------
pursue i uh


---------42:07----------
i don't know uh a field or


---------42:10----------
i i don't generally know what you mean


---------42:11----------
by it would be a waste yeah


---------42:13----------
i i get that and so we're going to talk


---------42:16----------
about that in a second


---------42:17----------
yeah okay so here's here's what i think


---------42:19----------
would be a waste


---------42:20----------
so like okay so five up i think this


---------42:24----------
will make a lot more sense if i give you


---------42:26----------
just some


---------42:27----------
actual context so in the


---------42:30----------
karmic religions like hinduism and


---------42:32----------
buddhism


---------42:33----------
they believe in the principle of cause


---------42:36----------
and effect


---------42:37----------
okay so that's what karma means so karma


---------42:40----------
means that for


---------42:41----------
each action there's an equal and


---------42:43----------
opposite reaction


---------42:44----------
that all things that happen have causes


---------42:48----------
and that all things


---------42:51----------
and that all causes lead to happenings


---------42:55----------
you with me so far yes okay


---------42:58----------
so then let me ask you a question


---------43:02----------
if you got a good rng like you spawned


---------43:05----------
with a good seed


---------43:07----------
okay like you know i'm talking about


---------43:09----------
like rng seed from like roguelikes


---------43:11----------
yes okay so if you spawn with a good


---------43:14----------
seed


---------43:17----------
so let's let me start by asking you this


---------43:19----------
question okay so we're gonna like


---------43:20----------
philosophize a little bit which is not


---------43:22----------
something i do often on stream but i


---------43:23----------
think it's actually probably what you


---------43:24----------
need


---------43:25----------
because i imagine you have these kinds


---------43:26----------
of thoughts a lot so


---------43:29----------
um so do you think that


---------43:32----------
cause and effect is a universal


---------43:34----------
principle of existence or do you think


---------43:36----------
that it is


---------43:37----------
it is limited and that some causes exist


---------43:40----------
without


---------43:41----------
effects and that some effects are not


---------43:43----------
preceded by causes


---------43:46----------
uh definitely the second one so give me


---------43:49----------
an example of an effect that is not


---------43:50----------
preceded by a


---------43:53----------
where cause cause and effect break down


---------43:57----------
so i mean causes uh


---------44:02----------
inspired by a person wanting to make a


---------44:04----------
change or motivation or something happen


---------44:06----------
and a person can pursue that


---------44:10----------
and do that for a this is a this is more


---------44:13----------
on the negative side of thinking but


---------44:14----------
it's still a example of it doesn't


---------44:16----------
necessarily always because you said


---------44:18----------
some potential parts um so


---------44:22----------
the cause that they are trying to make


---------44:23----------
an effect happen from


---------44:25----------
doesn't sometimes amount to anything


---------44:27----------
that's like


---------44:28----------
not that's a very negative way of


---------44:31----------
looking at it where there's also


---------44:32----------
the complete opposite where a person can


---------44:35----------
strive out to do something and make a


---------44:36----------
change


---------44:37----------
and that change will actually have a


---------44:38----------
great effect


---------44:40----------
um but you you can't


---------44:43----------
or at least i don't look at it like that


---------44:45----------
is a guarantee


---------44:48----------
no well well yeah so so the question is


---------44:51----------
is there an effect


---------44:52----------
it's not that there's a particular


---------44:54----------
effect right


---------44:55----------
so like for example so i i'll just be


---------44:58----------
transparent so i believe that


---------45:01----------
um you know causes have effects and that


---------45:03----------
effects have causes


---------45:05----------
so it's been my experience generally


---------45:07----------
speaking as a scientist


---------45:10----------
that barring some very rare situations


---------45:13----------
the laws of physics don't randomly break


---------45:17----------
down


---------45:18----------
okay from that perspective i agree with


---------45:20----------
you right so like like even if i have


---------45:23----------
a motivation or intention to do


---------45:26----------
something


---------45:27----------
and the thing doesn't happen that


---------45:29----------
doesn't mean that my actions don't have


---------45:31----------
effects it just means that the effect


---------45:32----------
that i wanted was not achieved


---------45:35----------
so that's different it's like kind of


---------45:36----------
saying if i roll a pair of dice


---------45:40----------
and i want an 11 just because i want an


---------45:43----------
11 doesn't mean that


---------45:45----------
once i roll the dice they're not going


---------45:46----------
to land on a particular number like once


---------45:48----------
i roll the dice the dice will land on


---------45:50----------
some number


---------45:55----------
so does that you with me yeah no i


---------45:58----------
follow you


---------45:59----------
so so just because the you know i'm not


---------46:01----------
saying that you can necessarily control


---------46:03----------
a particular outcome in fact the


---------46:04----------
opposite


---------46:05----------
but what i'm saying is that all things


---------46:07----------
come from somewhere like


---------46:08----------
it's impossible to get a plant without a


---------46:11----------
seed


---------46:12----------
and generally speaking well i mean not


---------46:15----------
all plants but


---------46:16----------
not all seeds will go grow into plants


---------46:18----------
right so there are a number of things


---------46:20----------
that can influence


---------46:21----------
whether a seed winds up growing into a


---------46:23----------
plant or not


---------46:24----------
but once again you can look at each of


---------46:26----------
those seeds and you can kind of say that


---------46:28----------
like


---------46:29----------
the reason for this effect is because of


---------46:32----------
particular causes like if i


---------46:34----------
put a seed in


---------46:38----------
you know in a metal box it's not going


---------46:41----------
to turn into


---------46:42----------
an apple tree right because the


---------46:45----------
sufficient causes are not there with me


---------46:49----------
yes okay so so from that perspective


---------46:53----------
completely


---------46:53----------
agree with uh every cause has an effect


---------46:56----------
okay


---------46:57----------
so so then let me ask you this do you


---------46:59----------
think your birth


---------47:02----------
has antecedent causes


---------47:07----------
what go into more what antecedent means


---------47:10----------
so like is your birth


---------47:11----------
influenced by prior causes


---------47:16----------
i mean yeah okay which ones


---------47:23----------
i mean i i guess just


---------47:26----------
me being born sure sex like sure


---------47:30----------
absolutely right and so your makeup is


---------47:32----------
influenced by what


---------47:36----------
i mean like the likes of the parents


---------47:37----------
absolutely right


---------47:39----------
now what about your parents financial


---------47:41----------
situation


---------47:44----------
would you consider that to be a cause


---------47:47----------
that determines who you are


---------47:54----------
no i i wouldn't say so really


---------47:57----------
not to a specific degree


---------48:00----------
where i've always been allowed to do


---------48:05----------
whatever i want um and


---------48:09----------
when it comes to like if i wanted to do


---------48:11----------
something as in


---------48:12----------
travel or uh get anything i'd have to


---------48:16----------
work for that


---------48:17----------
so okay it was own effort to get what i


---------48:20----------
want i guess


---------48:21----------
where i did have a um


---------48:24----------
a more privileged side at least on my


---------48:26----------
mom's side


---------48:28----------
um but i don't think


---------48:32----------
money has i mean it has shown me more


---------48:35----------
potentials in the world


---------48:36----------
so on that aspect yes where i've been


---------48:39----------
given more opportunities to see stuff


---------48:41----------
and that gathers inspiration


---------48:42----------
to and motivation to do over things but


---------48:46----------
i don't think money is fully the


---------48:47----------
influence yeah yeah but but i i


---------48:49----------
i i think you're actually i


---------48:53----------
i didn't answer the question i i didn't


---------48:54----------
ask the question clearly but your answer


---------48:56----------
implies to me that


---------48:58----------
that that and that the answer is yes so


---------49:01----------
let me put it this way


---------49:02----------
you know part of who you are today is


---------49:04----------
because of your genetics


---------49:06----------
part of who you are today is the


---------49:08----------
financial situation that your parents


---------49:10----------
brought you up in


---------49:13----------
yes right so so if you're i'm not saying


---------49:16----------
that you're


---------49:17----------
money-oriented or that or anything i'm


---------49:19----------
not making a particular claim about how


---------49:21----------
the dice


---------49:22----------
landed all i'm saying is that there are


---------49:24----------
a number of things that kind of


---------49:26----------
influence


---------49:27----------
and drive into who you are in this


---------49:31----------
moment


---------49:32----------
and so some of that is genetics right so


---------49:34----------
those are some


---------49:35----------
aspects of your being that are


---------49:37----------
essentially determined before you were


---------49:39----------
born


---------49:41----------
fair mm-hmm and then there are all these


---------49:45----------
other like nurture aspects


---------49:47----------
but those in turn are determined by like


---------49:50----------
your parents because your parents have a


---------49:52----------
slew of experiences


---------49:54----------
and then they share certain principles


---------49:56----------
or values with you


---------49:57----------
and those in turn are like built on


---------49:59----------
their own experiences which in turn


---------50:02----------
are influenced by their genetics and


---------50:04----------
their upbringing


---------50:05----------
and on and on and on


---------50:09----------
make sense yes okay


---------50:12----------
so then the question is like okay so


---------50:13----------
like you are what you are


---------50:16----------
and then the question is like what do


---------50:17----------
you do with the seed that you're given


---------50:20----------
and so this is where i'm gonna make a


---------50:21----------
claim so so far i feel like i've been on


---------50:23----------
pretty


---------50:24----------
standard footing or pretty solid


---------50:26----------
foundation and i feel like if you


---------50:27----------
disagreed i could


---------50:29----------
you know make a convincing argument


---------50:30----------
whether i can bring you around to it or


---------50:32----------
not is a different story


---------50:33----------
now i'm gonna go out on a limb okay so


---------50:35----------
this is where like i'm on shaky ground


---------50:38----------
so it's been my experience that from a


---------50:42----------
call


---------50:42----------
so this is where like now we get into


---------50:44----------
sort of the spirituality or the


---------50:45----------
religious aspect of it where


---------50:47----------
it becomes harder to elucidate logically


---------50:50----------
although in my experience if you spend


---------50:52----------
enough


---------50:53----------
time and energy exploring it you'll come


---------50:55----------
to this conclusion


---------50:57----------
so there's like this idea of like good


---------50:59----------
karma and bad karma which i think is


---------51:01----------
actually


---------51:01----------
false there's no such thing as good


---------51:03----------
karma and bad karma karma is just karma


---------51:06----------
energy is just energy and cause and


---------51:08----------
effect is just cause and effect


---------51:10----------
it's we as human beings who apply our


---------51:13----------
own


---------51:13----------
value system onto karma so it is because


---------51:16----------
we desire particular effects that we say


---------51:19----------
that something is better than something


---------51:20----------
else


---------51:22----------
with me so far yes okay


---------51:26----------
and so what i'm going to say though is


---------51:30----------
that like it's been my experience


---------51:33----------
that people who are born with a good


---------51:35----------
seed


---------51:37----------
can go one of two directions they either


---------51:40----------
use


---------51:40----------
that seed for themselves or they use


---------51:43----------
that seed for


---------51:44----------
others


---------51:48----------
what do you think about this


---------51:51----------
yeah i mean i i agree is


---------51:54----------
it's just up to the motivation of that


---------51:57----------
person


---------51:57----------
and the how much effort they want to put


---------52:00----------
into it


---------52:01----------
yep and so i think


---------52:05----------
so i think part of the reason that you


---------52:07----------
did you got this seed


---------52:09----------
is because of your past karma


---------52:12----------
and i think that you've got an


---------52:14----------
interesting choice because i think if


---------52:15----------
you go the route that you were talking


---------52:17----------
about


---------52:18----------
in terms of like learning lots of skills


---------52:20----------
and doing cool stuff and traveling the


---------52:21----------
world


---------52:22----------
i think your life will be a little bit


---------52:24----------
of a waste


---------52:28----------
okay that's a provocative statement


---------52:32----------
how do you how do you feel about that


---------52:42----------
in in some senses it's like


---------52:46----------
if i i feel like


---------52:51----------
people in general have um


---------52:55----------
a talent and they you can do something


---------52:58----------
to make a little bit of a difference


---------53:00----------
or a massive difference depending on


---------53:02----------
things that you


---------53:04----------
put yourself out to do and some people


---------53:06----------
are going to be better at that some


---------53:08----------
people can contribute a lot to


---------53:10----------
the uh i guess society or


---------53:15----------
um i'm just gonna use society there's


---------53:18----------
obviously a


---------53:19----------
bunch of words or different types of


---------53:20----------
things i could describe um


---------53:22----------
and while that is true


---------53:26----------
i feel like


---------53:29----------
learning a bunch of different skills and


---------53:32----------
applying it and not necessarily just


---------53:34----------
like a make a difference to the


---------53:36----------
world um is a


---------53:40----------
needed or not i needed isn't the correct


---------53:42----------
word


---------53:44----------
is uh i don't want to be for example a


---------53:46----------
politician


---------53:48----------
um i don't want to be a


---------53:53----------
a pub like i don't know a public speaker


---------53:56----------
or a motivator


---------53:57----------
i guess so well that i i


---------54:00----------
could be i guess it's


---------54:04----------
uh it's hard for me to


---------54:07----------
[Music]


---------54:08----------
say like is that what you're telling me


---------54:11----------
to do


---------54:11----------
is that no i'm not telling you to do any


---------54:14----------
of those things i'm also not telling you


---------54:16----------
to become a doctor or anything like that


---------54:19----------
so here's here's i think what i'm


---------54:21----------
telling you is


---------54:22----------
is really just to introduce this concept


---------54:25----------
because i think for


---------54:26----------
i think you should do everything that


---------54:27----------
you have said


---------54:29----------
but i think that i'm just kind of


---------54:32----------
introducing the idea


---------54:33----------
that you know you've got a really good


---------54:36----------
rng and so like the world is going to


---------54:40----------
like you you you basically have a fork


---------54:42----------
in the road


---------54:42----------
of like your life right you can live a


---------54:44----------
life where


---------54:46----------
you tend to focus on yourself or you can


---------54:49----------
live a life


---------54:50----------
where you improve the lives of others


---------54:52----------
now i'm not saying that those two are


---------54:53----------
mutually exclusive i'm not saying that


---------54:56----------
becoming a pastry chef won't be the way


---------54:58----------
in which you give back to other people i


---------55:00----------
don't think it looks like anything


---------55:01----------
particular


---------55:02----------
what i'm really trying to do here and


---------55:04----------
this is hard um


---------55:06----------
a five up is that i'm trying to get you


---------55:08----------
to think about things because i don't


---------55:10----------
know if you've


---------55:11----------
quite been exposed to some of these


---------55:15----------
concepts


---------55:18----------
and that's really the goal is like i


---------55:20----------
think it's like i think if you want to


---------55:21----------
travel the world you absolutely should


---------55:23----------
if you want to focus on yourself for a


---------55:24----------
while that's actually totally fine too


---------55:27----------
but i i think that when when i ask you


---------55:29----------
you know what do you want it's


---------55:31----------
essentially


---------55:31----------
to kind of you're kind of saying i want


---------55:33----------
to do what i feel like


---------55:35----------
which is a very good goal but at some


---------55:38----------
point


---------55:38----------
having seen people who are somewhat like


---------55:41----------
you


---------55:42----------
and who are also very accomplished


---------55:45----------
they tend to find that their life starts


---------55:47----------
to become like


---------55:48----------
relatively empty at some point


---------55:52----------
and so what i'm trying to do is actually


---------55:54----------
since based on our karma i have the


---------55:56----------
opportunity to talk to you when you're


---------55:58----------
21


---------55:59----------
i've talked to you when you are 30


---------56:02----------
and i've talked to you when you're like


---------56:04----------
45


---------56:05----------
and i can tell you where you're gonna


---------56:07----------
end up with a lot of confidence


---------56:10----------
because i've talked to people who are


---------56:12----------
you when they're 30 years old


---------56:14----------
and they've built a company that's worth


---------56:15----------
20 million dollars and sold it


---------56:18----------
and i've talked to you when you were 45


---------56:20----------
years old who built companies that are


---------56:22----------
worth a billion dollars insulted


---------56:26----------
and and i just want to introduce the


---------56:28----------
concept because i don't think you have a


---------56:30----------
good


---------56:32----------
so it's not that you don't have you have


---------56:34----------
a good internal compass


---------56:36----------
but but i i think you could really


---------56:38----------
benefit from


---------56:40----------
experiences and a system of knowledge


---------56:44----------
that is sort of like hard uh does


---------56:47----------
doesn't apply to most people which is


---------56:49----------
essentially like some of these like


---------56:51----------
uh eastern texts on spirituality and


---------56:53----------
sort of


---------56:54----------
the nature of happiness and stuff like


---------56:55----------
that because as i said before i think


---------56:57----------
you're spiritually gifted so you have a


---------56:59----------
natural degree of a certain amount of


---------57:01----------
detachment


---------57:02----------
you also like tend to operate in terms


---------57:05----------
of accomplishment like relatively


---------57:06----------
effortlessly


---------57:08----------
like it seems like if you really want to


---------57:10----------
do something like you said you know when


---------57:11----------
you were in fifth grade you would do all


---------57:13----------
your homework at the beginning of the


---------57:14----------
week


---------57:14----------
and it doesn't sound like anyone sat you


---------57:16----------
down to try to do that


---------57:20----------
yeah right which if you think about our


---------57:23----------
audience especially our audience at


---------57:25----------
healthy gamer people would kill for that


---------57:28----------
they work their entire they spend years


---------57:30----------
of their life


---------57:32----------
trying to get themselves to do things do


---------57:34----------
things like


---------57:35----------
do their work on monday and then be free


---------57:38----------
the rest of the week


---------57:39----------
and instead what they do is they like


---------57:41----------
procrastinate and suffer and push it


---------57:43----------
back


---------57:44----------
and play games for five days and then


---------57:46----------
like panic on friday


---------57:48----------
and it's the same amount of effort it's


---------57:50----------
just one is relatively like fun and


---------57:52----------
effortless


---------57:53----------
and then like the other is like fraught


---------57:55----------
with anxiety procrastination and shame


---------58:00----------
and and so i don't even it's kind of


---------58:02----------
weird five up because i i kind of feel


---------58:04----------
like


---------58:04----------
you need to just like i think if you


---------58:06----------
study eastern spirituality


---------58:08----------
and i don't mean from an academic sense


---------58:10----------
i mean in the way that you study things


---------58:12----------
which is like very very practically


---------58:14----------
then i think you'll learn a lot


---------58:17----------
about yourself and like what you should


---------58:20----------
do with your life


---------58:22----------
okay oh i should get that done


---------58:28----------
just so i don't forget something i can


---------58:29----------
always look back to


---------58:34----------
eastern spirituality


---------58:37----------
sure i'll send you more concrete


---------58:39----------
recommendations after the talk


---------58:41----------
if you could that'd be very nice yep i


---------58:44----------
have a couple of things particularly in


---------58:48----------
mind


---------58:50----------
right thank you um what do you think


---------58:53----------
about this conversation


---------58:57----------
um it's a little bit intimidating i


---------59:00----------
think is a good way to put how i'm


---------59:04----------
feeling


---------59:04----------
where i get what you mean


---------59:08----------
uh i think i have a better understanding


---------59:10----------
of what you meant by i was a waste


---------59:11----------
i guess or it would be a potential waste


---------59:13----------
um


---------59:16----------
more so now after you went into that


---------59:17----------
side


---------59:28----------
what's intimidating about the


---------59:30----------
conversation hmm


---------59:31----------
[Music]


---------59:33----------
the i guess everything that goes into


---------59:37----------
um doing something


---------59:41----------
very large


---------59:44----------
yeah so this is exactly what you need to


---------59:46----------
learn man it doesn't have to be large


---------59:50----------
right so like you could become a pastry


---------59:51----------
chef and you could run a little bakery


---------59:54----------
in some small town in europe


---------59:56----------
and that can be actually completely


---------59:58----------
sufficient it could be perfect


---------60:01----------
right like like if if what you devote


---------60:03----------
yourself to is making


---------60:05----------
delicious pastries that enrich the lives


---------60:08----------
of people


---------60:09----------
and like that's what you put all of your


---------60:11----------
focus into i think it's fine i don't


---------60:13----------
think you have to


---------60:14----------
you know do something grand you don't


---------60:16----------
have to save the world


---------60:18----------
it's just about and this is what's so


---------60:20----------
hard to explain five up is it's not


---------60:22----------
about the outward action forget about


---------60:24----------
the outward action


---------60:25----------
it's about what's going on on the inside


---------60:27----------
it's about what your intention is and


---------60:29----------
what your mindset is


---------60:32----------
it's about like you know that internal


---------60:34----------
compass that drives you to act the


---------60:36----------
action stuff you've gotten taken care of


---------60:38----------
like that's not a big deal


---------60:40----------
and so the manifestation i think is is


---------60:42----------
actually somewhat irrelevant i mean it's


---------60:44----------
not irrelevant but


---------60:45----------
you'll figure out what that is the point


---------60:48----------
is like


---------60:48----------
what what is on the inside


---------60:52----------
right like what do you what do you


---------60:55----------
like when you wake up and you because


---------60:58----------
you're


---------60:59----------
it's kind of interesting because you're


---------61:00----------
halfway there so


---------61:02----------
so you know what's your intention when


---------61:04----------
you start to bake something


---------61:06----------
um i think you might be


---------61:10----------
focusing on the baking side a little bit


---------61:13----------
much as in that that's just a


---------61:17----------
uh i guess a goal or not a goal just a a


---------61:20----------
potential


---------61:21----------
pursuit where at some point i


---------61:24----------
think it'd be fun to do that and then


---------61:26----------
after that i would pursue something else


---------61:29----------
after i was finished with that whether


---------61:30----------
that be


---------61:32----------
um i mean i guess another goal is be


---------61:34----------
trilingual


---------61:35----------
um just i i don't


---------61:38----------
want to only focus on one thing five up


---------61:41----------
i i'm i'm not focusing on i'm just using


---------61:44----------
it as a placeholder because i don't know


---------61:45----------
what else to say


---------61:46----------
okay right so so my point is that it


---------61:49----------
doesn't matter


---------61:50----------
whether you're a teacher a doctor


---------61:53----------
a streamer or a baker that's my whole


---------61:56----------
point is that like


---------61:57----------
i think this i know this is kind of hard


---------61:58----------
to understand but your battles are going


---------62:00----------
to be


---------62:01----------
internal they're not going to be


---------62:02----------
external


---------62:04----------
does that make sense yeah so like i


---------62:07----------
don't care what it looks like that's why


---------62:09----------
i'm saying you don't have to like start


---------62:10----------
something grand like


---------62:11----------
forget about the outside world right


---------62:14----------
because like that [ __ ] is like


---------62:16----------
you know you started streaming three


---------62:19----------
months ago and you have


---------62:20----------
five to ten thousand concurrence were


---------62:21----------
you in the right place at the right time


---------62:23----------
sure did you cultivate it


---------62:32----------
absolutely


---------62:35----------
i think i like 70 percent understand you


---------62:39----------
and i i feel bad that i don't fully what


---------62:41----------
do you what do you


---------62:42----------
see like it's it's interesting to hear


---------62:44----------
how self-aware you are


---------62:46----------
right like you have a good understanding


---------62:49----------
of


---------62:50----------
you kind of say that this is


---------62:51----------
intimidating fair and yet you're able to


---------62:54----------
tolerate it


---------62:56----------
you're able to gauge what you understand


---------62:58----------
and what you don't understand


---------63:00----------
so tell me what you do understand and


---------63:02----------
tell me what you don't understand


---------63:04----------
i think i get at what you're trying to


---------63:09----------
i guess let me know or like try and open


---------63:12----------
another perspective on it


---------63:14----------
um the the thing that i'm


---------63:17----------
i i guess struggling is when when you


---------63:19----------
respond with like


---------63:21----------
the the you were just using the the


---------63:24----------
baking thing as an example


---------63:25----------
and you're more trying to like open up


---------63:27----------
like what do i want to do internally i


---------63:29----------
guess


---------63:30----------
um or the the internal side of it it's


---------63:37----------
like in my mind at least when i say like


---------63:41----------
i want to do what i want that's like


---------63:43----------
already somewhat the internal


---------63:45----------
stuff of i'm not just going to lay about


---------63:49----------
do like i'm going to do stuff i guess


---------63:52----------
um


---------63:55----------
and whether how easy or how hard or how


---------63:59----------
that makes me feel like i'm going to


---------64:02----------
do stuff that'll be challenging to me


---------64:04----------
i'm going to do stuff that's easy and


---------64:06----------
fun


---------64:06----------
um so that's why i guess i'm confused


---------64:09----------
when you said like


---------64:11----------
or why why i'm not gathering when you're


---------64:13----------
saying


---------64:14----------
that i'm not fully there it's a it's a


---------64:18----------
it's a good 0.5 up and


---------64:19----------
if anything the deficiency is on is on


---------64:22----------
my end because what i'm doing


---------64:24----------
is telling you i'm trying to


---------64:27----------
i'm being unfair with you because what


---------64:29----------
i'm doing is injecting conversations


---------64:32----------
that i've had like i said


---------64:33----------
with 30 year old you and 45 year old you


---------64:36----------
to attempt to guide


---------64:37----------
21 year old you and the problem is that


---------64:39----------
21 year old you hasn't had that


---------64:42----------
degree of experience so it's like kind


---------64:43----------
of confusing it's probably a mistake on


---------64:45----------
my part


---------64:47----------
but let me put it this way so let me ask


---------64:49----------
you this okay so


---------64:51----------
so let's say you were talking to a


---------64:53----------
streamer who had just blown up


---------64:56----------
but the streamer is concerned that their


---------64:58----------
stream has


---------65:01----------
a certain amount like a certain lifespan


---------65:03----------
to it


---------65:04----------
right they're like i stream this


---------65:06----------
particular game it's really popular


---------65:08----------
right now and i don't know what comes


---------65:09----------
next what would you say to them


---------65:14----------
okay that makes more sense now


---------65:24----------
if the streamer is worried pretty much


---------65:25----------
what you're doing is the streamer's


---------65:26----------
worried about the lifespan you give them


---------65:28----------
um the nudge of like


---------65:31----------
what they can do um


---------65:35----------
ways to either help sustain it or


---------65:39----------
what they can do after that or what


---------65:41----------
they've created i guess


---------65:44----------
um or


---------65:48----------
other things to do in the solution


---------65:50----------
behind it


---------65:51----------
okay and are you doing that stuff


---------65:55----------
oh yeah i mean yeah i'm


---------66:01----------
i'm doing a mixture of


---------66:05----------
i so is this relating back to myself as


---------66:06----------
like giving self advice or like what i'm


---------66:08----------
doing currently


---------66:09----------
so i'm just saying like so so here's


---------66:11----------
okay


---------66:13----------
this is tough five okay so let me let me


---------66:16----------
start with this so like


---------66:17----------
you say you're terrified of what's gonna


---------66:19----------
happen after among us


---------66:21----------
right i don't think you're actually that


---------66:23----------
worried about it


---------66:30----------
um


---------66:33----------
i i there is a degree of worry where


---------66:36----------
sure it's not like


---------66:39----------
i don't think i'm gonna go from


---------66:42----------
ten thousand to zero i don't think that


---------66:44----------
will be a thing because that doesn't


---------66:45----------
make sense


---------66:46----------
in terms of where things are but there


---------66:48----------
is the um


---------66:51----------
i guess the the self-conscious aspect of


---------66:54----------
i know a lot of people watch me because


---------66:56----------
i'm good at the game


---------66:58----------
and it's i tend not to like think about


---------67:02----------
numbers


---------67:03----------
um but when you compare like among us to


---------67:06----------
let's say i stream a different game


---------67:08----------
it's hard to i mean that is like


---------67:11----------
there's a there's a jump now i've taken


---------67:14----------
this step in trying to


---------67:17----------
i guess introduce people to more sides


---------67:19----------
of what i do


---------67:21----------
but it's still a very big intimidation


---------67:25----------
or an intimidation i keep saying that


---------67:26----------
word it


---------67:28----------
it's daunting i guess yeah so if you


---------67:31----------
went from ten thousand to zero five up


---------67:36----------
how would you feel about that


---------67:40----------
i'd feel pretty sad about it um not


---------67:43----------
relating to like


---------67:48----------
damn i really want to be a streamer and


---------67:50----------
in sex that i killed my stream it'd be


---------67:51----------
more like wow


---------67:52----------
i guess people didn't find me


---------67:54----------
entertaining and really only watch me


---------67:56----------
for this that make me feel sad


---------67:59----------
and where would you be a year from then


---------68:03----------
um if streaming died completely youtube


---------68:07----------
died completely


---------68:08----------
i would probably pursue


---------68:11----------
a degree in denmark from


---------68:15----------
some stuff that i've earned from


---------68:16----------
streaming and try and pursue


---------68:19----------
uh education from their kids i mean this


---------68:21----------
is a goal that i've


---------68:23----------
wanted to move to denmark for a very


---------68:26----------
long time


---------68:26----------
and so i would use what i've gotten from


---------68:29----------
streaming to


---------68:31----------
help me with uh getting there as a goal


---------68:34----------
and whether it be so like this is kind


---------68:38----------
of my point


---------68:39----------
right so man this is so hard i'm i'm


---------68:40----------
sorry five up i i may i may need to


---------68:43----------
take another crack at you later but so


---------68:46----------
like this is my point so like


---------68:47----------
if your streaming career ended in


---------68:50----------
dumpster fire


---------68:52----------
i think you would be fine in a year i


---------68:55----------
think you would continue moving along


---------68:57----------
the goals that you've set for yourself


---------69:02----------
yeah okay if your streaming career was


---------69:04----------
successful i think you'd do the same


---------69:06----------
thing


---------69:08----------
like here's what i think you think about


---------69:10----------
your streaming career and when i make


---------69:11----------
statements like this i


---------69:12----------
i'm i'm giving you an opportunity to


---------69:15----------
tell me that i'm wrong


---------69:16----------
okay so i don't want you to like by all


---------69:18----------
means say


---------69:19----------
you have no idea what you're talking


---------69:20----------
about dr k so like here's


---------69:22----------
like i think that you recognize that you


---------69:24----------
have an opportunity


---------69:26----------
and you're going to make the most of


---------69:27----------
this opportunity and something of your


---------69:29----------
identity and your ego is kind of getting


---------69:31----------
confused because i think you had a


---------69:33----------
pretty clear sense of who you were


---------69:34----------
before this whole thing happened


---------69:36----------
and that this streaming thing is like


---------69:38----------
kind of a weird stress or pressure


---------69:40----------
where you still have a pretty good sense


---------69:42----------
of your identity but it's starting to


---------69:43----------
get maybe a little bit muddy


---------69:45----------
and then like at the end of the day like


---------69:47----------
your compass is your compass and if you


---------69:48----------
have a good opportunity you're gonna


---------69:49----------
take advantage of it


---------69:50----------
and you're gonna make the most of it and


---------69:53----------
you're gonna try to make it


---------69:54----------
do what you can out of streaming because


---------69:57----------
it's like it'd be dumb if you didn't


---------69:59----------
but i don't hear that you're caught up


---------70:01----------
in the idea of being a streamer i don't


---------70:02----------
hear that it's actually important


---------70:04----------
to it's just a means to an end


---------70:07----------
yeah the way i've looked at streaming is


---------70:10----------
i've always decided like like i said in


---------70:14----------
the beginning


---------70:14----------
i wasn't i didn't have the intention of


---------70:16----------
being a streamer it just sort of


---------70:18----------
happened


---------70:18----------
and i told people in the beginning um


---------70:22----------
i'm going to stream if people want to


---------70:23----------
watch me and be a means of entertainment


---------70:25----------
um and then maybe form a nice community


---------70:29----------
about it and then


---------70:30----------
if people didn't watch me then i would


---------70:33----------
go on about it so


---------70:35----------
while i am saying that from where i am


---------70:37----------
now going from


---------70:38----------
a big number to zero is daunting it's


---------70:42----------
it's that wasn't the this hasn't been


---------70:45----------
something that i've like worked my whole


---------70:46----------
life towards i guess


---------70:48----------
like a lot of people it's their


---------70:49----------
aspiration and their like life's desire


---------70:50----------
to be a streamer


---------70:52----------
um where i just didn't go through that i


---------70:56----------
don't have the


---------70:56----------
attachment of trying to


---------71:01----------
like i guess make this work like other


---------71:03----------
people have


---------71:07----------
it just sort of happened and here i am


---------71:12----------
right so so okay i don't even know what


---------71:15----------
i'm trying to say at this point


---------71:16----------
let me just think about this for a


---------71:18----------
second


---------71:23----------
do you have questions five up that would


---------71:25----------
probably focus my mind a lot


---------71:28----------
um


---------71:31----------
give me a second let me think


---------71:50----------
i thought i'm on the spot it's hard to


---------71:51----------
think of a question um it's okay


---------72:14----------
um


---------72:18----------
i guess what do you what do you do


---------72:22----------
because you you have a lot of influence


---------72:24----------
especially for what you provide


---------72:26----------
and especially being a doctor or


---------72:28----------
therapist or


---------72:30----------
um this means like what do you do with


---------72:32----------
the amount of influence that you have


---------72:34----------
and how do you like fully control it


---------72:35----------
because


---------72:35----------
i think you you do a very good job


---------72:39----------
at helping people and educating the


---------72:40----------
public and making people have


---------72:43----------
a better mindset uh or way of thinking


---------72:47----------
and it's very hard for me to


---------72:52----------
even realize the influence


---------72:55----------
because it's also new i don't know how


---------72:57----------
to control it that's like i guess i got


---------72:59----------
into


---------73:00----------
a big drama in the middle of me


---------73:03----------
streaming i guess with xqc


---------73:05----------
for example um what happened


---------73:11----------
uh so i guess during


---------73:14----------
an among us lobby


---------73:18----------
um i had the intention of


---------73:22----------
going to a specific group but i saw one


---------73:25----------
group was forming


---------73:25----------
uh like a lot earlier so i was gonna


---------73:27----------
play in that group


---------73:29----------
uh and then swap to the other group when


---------73:31----------
that time frame happened


---------73:32----------
this group happened to be the the prior


---------73:35----------
group the early one that i was going to


---------73:36----------
swallow through later


---------73:37----------
was the one with felix and then


---------73:40----------
um how much do you know about among us


---------73:44----------
i played it once played it once okay for


---------73:47----------
like


---------73:47----------
an hour and a half gotcha let's just say


---------73:51----------
i am you


---------73:54----------
you've spoken to me for like an hour or


---------73:57----------
so now i think you


---------73:58----------
probably gathered that i'm like heavily


---------74:00----------
logical thinker


---------74:01----------
that side um i will


---------74:05----------
try and have a conversation and


---------74:08----------
try and like provide my side of it and


---------74:10----------
that might come off as arrogant because


---------74:12----------
i think


---------74:13----------
at least from the logical side and i


---------74:15----------
have a giant amount of experience


---------74:17----------
when it comes to deception based games


---------74:19----------
because i've played


---------74:20----------
do you know what mafia is for example


---------74:22----------
yeah okay i've played mafia


---------74:24----------
in a hyper competitive scenario or


---------74:26----------
hyper-competitive environment for like


---------74:27----------
five years


---------74:28----------
so like that was just


---------74:31----------
that trained me for among us i guess for


---------74:33----------
the the social side


---------74:35----------
um and then mechanics from i guess


---------74:36----------
league transfer over


---------74:38----------
or i guess games so it i people deemed


---------74:42----------
me as a very good player i guess


---------74:44----------
um in among us interesting karma there


---------74:47----------
huh


---------74:48----------
yeah um so


---------74:51----------
when i go at it versus felix it was like


---------74:55----------
just the clash of he


---------74:59----------
i guess intentions of how to play the


---------75:01----------
game where


---------75:03----------
in the old game um you used to be able


---------75:06----------
to confirm if a person is imposter or a


---------75:09----------
crewmate just by looking at the taskbar


---------75:11----------
at the top


---------75:12----------
and i felt that defeated the the purpose


---------75:14----------
of the game


---------75:15----------
in general because it's no longer a


---------75:17----------
social deduction game it's more just


---------75:18----------
i'm going to look at a person do this


---------75:20----------
and the game mechanics instantly


---------75:22----------
confirms who


---------75:23----------
all the imposters are and who all their


---------75:24----------
criminals are i as a person who is


---------75:27----------
intention is like string me the game for


---------75:29----------
entertainment


---------75:31----------
um my goal is like for all the streamers


---------75:33----------
to have fun in the audience to have fun


---------75:34----------
because there's


---------75:35----------
what like 200 000 people watching uh


---------75:37----------
across all the streamers


---------75:39----------
so when that happened and i


---------75:42----------
just i'm known as like one of the best


---------75:45----------
imposters in the game


---------75:46----------
in general uh that causes me to get


---------75:49----------
voted out consistently


---------75:50----------
it doesn't matter if i'm good or bad um


---------75:54----------
and that got heavily on my nerves and he


---------75:57----------
got he gets hyper competitive um


---------76:00----------
so eventually just left me to leaving


---------76:02----------
the lobby after a few scenarios where i


---------76:04----------
call him and posture explain why


---------76:05----------
and then he's i guess [ __ ] talking and


---------76:09----------
it was a consistent thing where that


---------76:11----------
entire


---------76:13----------
uh thing annoyed me and um i eventually


---------76:16----------
just left


---------76:17----------
he said a bunch of things uh


---------76:20----------
and continue to speak about it after i


---------76:22----------
even left i said my piece of what i


---------76:24----------
thought of the situation


---------76:26----------
that heavily blew up um on live stream


---------76:29----------
fails


---------76:30----------
got on to like random gaming web


---------76:33----------
articles was on snapchat


---------76:36----------
and just caused like a really really


---------76:40----------
shitty dynamic


---------76:42----------
what does that mean shitty dynamic where


---------76:46----------
if you do anything wrong text you see


---------76:48----------
his chat will brigade you


---------76:50----------
um and that is what like people only


---------76:54----------
knew me for for a month


---------76:55----------
and was like it feels awkward


---------76:59----------
uh it felt awkward for a while it's like


---------77:02----------
i can't play in the game with him


---------77:04----------
and because you're gonna get brigaded by


---------77:07----------
his chat


---------77:08----------
uh well it's not


---------77:12----------
like people were on my side and now you


---------77:14----------
have


---------77:16----------
uh his chat defending him but


---------77:19----------
everyone else [ __ ] on him and then


---------77:21----------
it's like if i play in a lobby with him


---------77:23----------
there's going to be no matter what me


---------77:25----------
versus him


---------77:27----------
um and i like i


---------77:31----------
among this is 10 people and i want to


---------77:33----------
play with my friends but he also plays


---------77:34----------
with my friends


---------77:36----------
um so it was just


---------77:39----------
that whole situation was really bad so


---------77:42----------
how does that make you feel


---------77:44----------
well it made me feel bad i didn't like


---------77:46----------
that at all what did you feel bad about


---------77:49----------
um there were two things one


---------77:54----------
i am a hyper competitive person also so


---------77:56----------
i understand that but i have never been


---------77:58----------
one to rage


---------77:59----------
um but i'm very understanding of like


---------78:02----------
who xqc is and why he's like that


---------78:06----------
and i didn't find it like


---------78:10----------
i i didn't want there to be a rift or a


---------78:12----------
weird dynamic but i knew


---------78:14----------
the chat would cause it so if it was


---------78:15----------
just like if me and him were it was just


---------78:17----------
like a one-on-one


---------78:18----------
or just playing with friends it wouldn't


---------78:20----------
matter um


---------78:22----------
we would just both move on and it'd be


---------78:24----------
fine but because there


---------78:25----------
is a bunch of other people talking about


---------78:28----------
it looking about it causing a bunch of


---------78:30----------
trouble he got tons of hate for it


---------78:33----------
um because everyone made him look out to


---------78:35----------
be like this the worst guy in the world


---------78:37----------
uh and i felt bad about that and i mean


---------78:40----------
train talked to me about like


---------78:42----------
how the bigger streamer pretty much no


---------78:43----------
matter what gets the fault


---------78:45----------
just because of the audience um


---------78:49----------
and that's not necessarily true for


---------78:50----------
everything but


---------78:52----------
the more people you have the more people


---------78:53----------
there are to [ __ ] on you and


---------78:56----------
so there was the combination of i don't


---------78:57----------
think i was in the wrong yet i also feel


---------79:00----------
bad about the situation that happened


---------79:01----------
and that's also why i wanted like how do


---------79:03----------
i


---------79:03----------
control an audience because i don't want


---------79:06----------
that to happen again


---------79:07----------
okay so um my answer is going to be


---------79:11----------
somewhat disappointing but


---------79:13----------
you don't right so like let's just talk


---------79:16----------
about what you're saying


---------79:18----------
so how do you control the behavior i i


---------79:21----------
mean i'm going to give you a more


---------79:22----------
satisfying answer in a second but the


---------79:23----------
short answer and it's really important


---------79:25----------
to understand this


---------79:26----------
is that you don't right like i can't


---------79:28----------
control


---------79:29----------
toxicity like i don't control what


---------79:31----------
someone else does


---------79:34----------
like i can't control what someone else


---------79:35----------
does now there are a lot of practical


---------79:36----------
things that will people will tell you


---------79:38----------
that you can


---------79:39----------
sort of cultivate a particular kind of


---------79:41----------
chat and we work very hard to do that


---------79:43----------
so you can have you know mods that have


---------79:46----------
low tolerance towards certain kinds of


---------79:47----------
behaviors and things like that for sure


---------79:49----------
they're practical things


---------79:50----------
but in in the essence of it i want you


---------79:52----------
five up to take a step back from like


---------79:54----------
controlling another human being


---------80:00----------
and now you may not agree with that


---------80:04----------
because i i think you probably are


---------80:06----------
really good at hurting


---------80:07----------
other people i i said heard h-e-r


---------80:10----------
i i heard i probably probably


---------80:14----------
right so i i think you're good at that


---------80:17----------
but like be really


---------80:18----------
really careful about what you actually


---------80:20----------
expect from


---------80:22----------
yourself and just because you tend to be


---------80:25----------
pretty good at like


---------80:26----------
hurting other people into doing what you


---------80:29----------
want to


---------80:29----------
doesn't mean that you can actually


---------80:31----------
control them


---------80:32----------
and the bizarre thing is i think that


---------80:34----------
it's the understanding that you can't


---------80:36----------
control someone


---------80:37----------
that in and of itself is one of the most


---------80:40----------
useful things in influencing them


---------80:42----------
because once you acknowledge that you


---------80:45----------
can't control another person


---------80:47----------
once you seed that power over


---------80:50----------
to your audience you


---------80:53----------
also


---------80:58----------
can kind of like influence them in the


---------81:00----------
purest way


---------81:02----------
which is to like give them an offer so


---------81:05----------
what i try to do is


---------81:06----------
is cultivate a particular like attitude


---------81:09----------
and i model particular behavior and


---------81:13----------
with a lot of help from mods we sort of


---------81:16----------
encourage a certain we cultivate right


---------81:18----------
so you can't


---------81:19----------
control someone but you can absol


---------81:21----------
absolutely cultivate behavior


---------81:24----------
it's the difference between control and


---------81:27----------
cultivation


---------81:30----------
yeah i i didn't want to say con


---------81:33----------
control i guess like that's not how i


---------81:35----------
felt about i don't want to control


---------81:37----------
people


---------81:37----------
it's i guess influence is the better


---------81:39----------
word yeah so


---------81:41----------
so so and i think you use the word


---------81:43----------
influence


---------81:44----------
actually in your question and and so i


---------81:47----------
just want to kind of


---------81:48----------
maybe i'm belaboring a useless point but


---------81:50----------
so then the next thing is that i


---------81:51----------
i think like you can just model write


---------81:54----------
the appropriate behavior


---------81:56----------
and and so i mean i think that's the


---------81:59----------
most that you can do but frankly this


---------82:00----------
sounds to me like a hazard of like being


---------82:02----------
a streamer on twitch


---------82:04----------
right because you've got a community and


---------82:06----------
he's got a community and y'all are gonna


---------82:08----------
get into it


---------82:09----------
it sounds to me like you're choosing


---------82:10----------
your words very comparably


---------82:12----------
uh carefully because you said the word


---------82:14----------
competitive


---------82:16----------
like 15 times and it sounded to me like


---------82:19----------
that was code for something else


---------82:23----------
um but i i mean it i i mean i haven't


---------82:26----------
figured out how to avoid twitch drama


---------82:28----------
if that if that's your end if that's


---------82:30----------
what your real question is


---------82:34----------
um yeah i mean they're


---------82:39----------
uh for for me uh i i am carefully


---------82:43----------
saying what i say um yeah i can tell


---------82:46----------
just i i don't i don't want to get into


---------82:49----------
a situation


---------82:50----------
like that pretty much ever again i don't


---------82:52----------
want to say something that


---------82:55----------
wouldn't or like give people a wrong


---------82:58----------
impression


---------82:58----------
or i'll try to correct that wrong


---------83:00----------
impression as soon as i think i might


---------83:01----------
have given it


---------83:02----------
um but but i i think five up so


---------83:06----------
maybe here i can give you some concrete


---------83:08----------
advice and then i'll try to i'll try to


---------83:09----------
like circle back to


---------83:10----------
what on earth i was trying to say for


---------83:12----------
the last hour um but


---------83:14----------
let me say this so i think when you


---------83:15----------
choose your words very very carefully


---------83:17----------
i think people can tell and i think if


---------83:20----------
anything


---------83:21----------
it highlights like something weird


---------83:25----------
right so so i think sometimes being


---------83:28----------
transparent and authentic


---------83:31----------
and kind of accepting of things is


---------83:33----------
actually


---------83:35----------
like way better from a drama reduction


---------83:38----------
standpoint


---------83:39----------
than being like choosing your words


---------83:42----------
super carefully


---------83:46----------
i feel like that's hard to do because it


---------83:48----------
is hard to do so


---------83:49----------
so like i think like for example if i if


---------83:52----------
i had to say


---------83:53----------
if i was in your situation here's how i


---------83:55----------
would tell the story


---------83:57----------
so felix and i were in an among us game


---------83:59----------
we're both [ __ ] competitive he


---------84:01----------
got super [ __ ] toxic i got super


---------84:03----------
[ __ ] toxic


---------84:05----------
i thought i was less toxic than he was


---------84:06----------
we got into it our chats started yelling


---------84:08----------
at each other now the internet hates him


---------84:11----------
and his chat hates me and i like felix


---------84:15----------
and i want to be able to play with him


---------84:16----------
but it's [ __ ] awkward every time


---------84:18----------
we're in the lobby now


---------84:20----------
and i just want to be able to play the


---------84:21----------
game and i think he just wants to be


---------84:23----------
able to play


---------84:23----------
the game and i wish everyone would


---------84:25----------
[ __ ] come calm the [ __ ] down


---------84:29----------
there's the there's the side of me also


---------84:32----------
that it's like


---------84:33----------
i have my opinions um


---------84:36----------
i don't think what i said was wrong and


---------84:38----------
i don't think what i said was toxic


---------84:41----------
and i will die on that hill


---------84:45----------
um so it's like it's a god there's the


---------84:49----------
attachment


---------84:51----------
so so it's a matter of like


---------84:56----------
i'm not going to


---------84:59----------
just not give out my opinion


---------85:02----------
um and if i say something i mean


---------85:05----------
everything i say generally


---------85:08----------
i'm not a toxic person and i've never


---------85:10----------
been


---------85:16----------
so that's why that situation bothered me


---------85:17----------
heavily


---------85:20----------
yeah so so i think it's taken us about


---------85:23----------
an hour and a half to find which hail


---------85:24----------
you're willing to die on because that's


---------85:26----------
an attachment


---------85:27----------
i haven't detected an attachment in you


---------85:30----------
5 up until this moment


---------85:32----------
everything that you've said


---------85:36----------
so now now the question is like why is


---------85:39----------
it so important


---------85:40----------
for you to die on that hill


---------85:43----------
um


---------85:43----------
[Music]


---------85:50----------
i i guess just because i believe what


---------85:52----------
i'm saying and


---------85:55----------
if


---------85:59----------
if something's bothering me i will try


---------86:02----------
and say it


---------86:02----------
in a more respectful way i don't want to


---------86:05----------
like burn bridges with anyone


---------86:07----------
i don't want to um i don't want to teach


---------86:10----------
people from


---------86:11----------
like if i'm in front of people i want to


---------86:16----------
like give them it's okay that you don't


---------86:18----------
have to accept an apology or you don't


---------86:19----------
have to say you're sorry


---------86:21----------
i wanted to say um


---------86:24----------
i i want to stand for what i believe in


---------86:26----------
and if what i think is right i'm going


---------86:27----------
to


---------86:28----------
say that i'm not going to say no i'm


---------86:29----------
wrong like that's not


---------86:31----------
how i want to think about things yeah so


---------86:33----------
so i i


---------86:34----------
oddly enough i i think that's okay so i


---------86:37----------
think it's okay to die on a hill


---------86:39----------
but let me just so i still think you can


---------86:42----------
be transparent about that


---------86:48----------
um there's a degree of transparency that


---------86:51----------
you can go to


---------86:52----------
where it


---------86:55----------
you can have an opinion about something


---------86:57----------
on twitch or another person


---------86:59----------
and it's not good to say that sometimes


---------87:03----------
like sure some people say whatever the


---------87:04----------
[ __ ] they want and


---------87:06----------
go for it i mean that's fine uh but i


---------87:09----------
also don't think that's like a good


---------87:12----------
environment at the same time for


---------87:16----------
like having a relationship with people


---------87:19----------
and if you're no matter what going to be


---------87:21----------
in contact with


---------87:23----------
uh x person um


---------87:27----------
whether that's like in your control or


---------87:29----------
not just because of the nature


---------87:31----------
so uh community and such let me be let


---------87:34----------
me be let me circle back to your


---------87:35----------
original question five up


---------87:37----------
so you said you know what like how do


---------87:39----------
you influence


---------87:40----------
people like in twitch chat and my answer


---------87:43----------
was


---------87:44----------
i would be a little bit more transparent


---------87:45----------
than your being


---------87:48----------
so that's my answer right so like like i


---------87:51----------
agree with you i mean i have all kinds


---------87:53----------
of opinions that i don't share


---------87:55----------
so for everything that i say there are


---------87:57----------
like nine things that i don't say


---------88:00----------
so i'm not advocating for like radical


---------88:02----------
honesty i think that's


---------88:03----------
idiotic so i i think but


---------88:07----------
something tells me that you know


---------88:08----------
something about the way that you speak


---------88:10----------
i think twitch chat so twitch chat is


---------88:12----------
like very very like intuitive


---------88:14----------
like they're very smart and they're also


---------88:16----------
like deeply empathic


---------88:18----------
and i think they sniff out bs


---------88:22----------
and i think one thing that you do


---------88:23----------
project when you choose your words very


---------88:25----------
very carefully is it sets people's bs


---------88:27----------
meter off


---------88:34----------
and and so if you want to like calm chat


---------88:37----------
down it's been my experience that you


---------88:39----------
have to be like honest with them and you


---------88:40----------
have to sort of treat them with respect


---------88:43----------
like don't try to pull a fast one over


---------88:44----------
on them because it's not gonna work


---------88:47----------
and just you know just and then like if


---------88:50----------
there's something that you stand behind


---------88:52----------
i think it's okay to say it


---------88:54----------
um and but at the same time if you feel


---------88:58----------
like it's going to create more drama


---------89:00----------
then it's a tricky balance like don't


---------89:03----------
get me wrong


---------89:04----------
i i i think that you know it's hard like


---------89:07----------
when you're


---------89:08----------
when you when you play at a


---------89:10----------
tension-inducing game like among us


---------89:14----------
with streamers and not everyone is going


---------89:16----------
to be quite as like


---------89:19----------
detached as you are it's part of what


---------89:22----------
makes them successful right is being


---------89:24----------
emotionally invested in the games that


---------89:26----------
they play like i think this is gonna


---------89:27----------
happen


---------89:30----------
yeah um


---------89:34----------
that's not my my


---------89:40----------
i could say this also um with what i


---------89:42----------
said with


---------89:43----------
regarding xqc in that moment i would say


---------89:46----------
the same thing again


---------89:47----------
i don't have regrets on that um if that


---------89:50----------
arose again uh with a different person i


---------89:53----------
would


---------89:54----------
say my opinion on it um what actually


---------89:57----------
happened i i don't even


---------89:59----------
know i'm saying that oh what happened


---------90:02----------
was


---------90:04----------
i


---------90:07----------
in the for when that whole situation


---------90:10----------
happened


---------90:11----------
he just every time i played with him


---------90:14----------
he would vote me out as in he they call


---------90:17----------
button nobody's dead and still vote me


---------90:19----------
out


---------90:20----------
that was how the game was played and


---------90:23----------
i sat through that um for two hours on a


---------90:26----------
specific day on other days i enjoyed


---------90:27----------
hopefully playing with him but on that


---------90:29----------
day it was just


---------90:30----------
uh like already being tilted


---------90:34----------
just going into it where i have


---------90:36----------
everything


---------90:37----------
uh going for me in a game and then


---------90:41----------
i just get voted out because it was me


---------90:42----------
and it was always him doing it and that


---------90:44----------
got on my nerves


---------90:45----------
and then whenever i call him out it's


---------90:46----------
like he called me like


---------90:48----------
it just discredited everything i said


---------90:51----------
and eventually it left me to


---------90:52----------
leave the lobby i left politely i


---------90:56----------
there's there's a video on it i mean i i


---------90:59----------
try to make things


---------91:00----------
as peaceful as an exit as i could and


---------91:04----------
it's just because i left on me catching


---------91:07----------
him


---------91:08----------
and just the whole situation going down


---------91:11----------
horribly and then me saying it after and


---------91:13----------
then that exploding


---------91:15----------
and then


---------91:20----------
i don't want to say some stuff i'd be


---------91:22----------
fine messaging you some stuff but i


---------91:24----------
don't want to say some stuff


---------91:25----------
that's fine and i just i was just like


---------91:27----------
you're talking around something and i


---------91:28----------
don't know


---------91:30----------
yes there is something i'm talking


---------91:31----------
around and i can't say it that's fine


---------91:33----------
don't worry about it i mean i i think at


---------91:35----------
the end of the day like


---------91:37----------
so your original question so it sounds


---------91:38----------
like this was just a mess


---------91:41----------
yeah it was it was a disaster definitely


---------91:45----------
so um but


---------91:48----------
that's not my main worry that was that


---------91:50----------
was a a battle between him and that's


---------91:52----------
over with we've


---------91:53----------
spoken it's fine um my thing with twitch


---------91:56----------
has


---------91:57----------
there is such a juxtaposition between


---------92:00----------
i don't try and hide stuff um i'm i'm


---------92:03----------
being selective what i say right now


---------92:05----------
because it's related to this specific


---------92:06----------
topic


---------92:07----------
if i'm talking about like it seems like


---------92:10----------
chat as a whole it doesn't matter how


---------92:12----------
like i'm playing with friends when i


---------92:13----------
play right now


---------92:15----------
it's i genuinely enjoy love everyone


---------92:18----------
that i play with right now


---------92:19----------
um but if they do something stupid it's


---------92:23----------
everyone just in insane


---------92:26----------
um toxicity towards that streamer and


---------92:29----------
it's the juxtaposition of like


---------92:31----------
why why is that happening when there's


---------92:34----------
like no hostility


---------92:36----------
in the game in general someone made a


---------92:37----------
mistake it's a game about deception and


---------92:39----------
i can't i i just don't know why that's


---------92:43----------
happening and it's


---------92:44----------
so many people and i it's


---------92:47----------
virtually impossible to control okay so


---------92:51----------
i mean that i have sort of a slightly


---------92:52----------
different answer for


---------92:54----------
so you know i went off on i feel like


---------92:56----------
this conversation has been a lot of


---------92:58----------
tangents that i'm going off on that may


---------93:00----------
not be very relevant to what we're


---------93:02----------
actually talking about or where you are


---------93:04----------
so i apologize for that but i'll share


---------93:06----------
with you something that we try to tell


---------93:08----------
our coaches


---------93:10----------
um which is that be careful about


---------93:13----------
judging your own influence and what i


---------93:16----------
mean by that is that we frequently have


---------93:18----------
the situation where our coaches feel


---------93:20----------
like they


---------93:21----------
get like they're like i'm not doing


---------93:23----------
enough for my client


---------93:25----------
like my client is still struggling like


---------93:27----------
they're depressed every day or like


---------93:28----------
they're


---------93:29----------
having trouble finding a girlfriend or


---------93:30----------
whatever and our coaches meet with


---------93:32----------
people on a weekly basis weekly basis


---------93:34----------
and they kind of meet with them week


---------93:35----------
after week after week and it sort of


---------93:36----------
feels like


---------93:37----------
since the person doesn't have a


---------93:38----------
girlfriend our coaches can feel very


---------93:41----------
frust not frustrated but really um


---------93:44----------
like they're letting down their client


---------93:47----------
so


---------93:48----------
one of the things that we try to tell


---------93:49----------
them is that you know be careful because


---------93:51----------
change happens slowly


---------93:52----------
and it's very very hard to judge your


---------93:55----------
impact on something


---------93:56----------
in a short term so what i would say to


---------93:59----------
you actually


---------94:00----------
five up is that like you know if people


---------94:02----------
respond to someone making a mistake with


---------94:04----------
toxicity


---------94:06----------
you can model the right kind of behavior


---------94:09----------
and if you


---------94:10----------
chip away at that long enough you'll


---------94:12----------
start to see a change


---------94:14----------
the other thing i mean you can even use


---------94:16----------
some particular techniques


---------94:19----------
if you really want to get into it but


---------94:21----------
you can help people understand their


---------94:22----------
toxicity


---------94:25----------
and it can be as simple as like hey


---------94:27----------
everyone is jumping down


---------94:28----------
xqc's throat right now or my throat it's


---------94:31----------
hard for yourself


---------94:32----------
but if someone you know if someone makes


---------94:33----------
a mistake and everyone jumps on them you


---------94:35----------
can ask people hey i'm noticing that a


---------94:36----------
lot of people are jumping down this


---------94:37----------
person's throat


---------94:39----------
you know what's going on there you can


---------94:41----------
ask an open-ended question or you can


---------94:43----------
even pull a dr k


---------94:44----------
and ask like how do you guys feel about


---------94:46----------
this person making a mistake


---------94:48----------
and then as you bring attention and


---------94:50----------
awareness to the behavior


---------94:52----------
it tends to get better like once people


---------94:55----------
realize what they're doing that they're


---------94:57----------
actually channeling their frustration


---------95:00----------
out on someone else and if you can bring


---------95:02----------
attention to it it'll kind of slow down


---------95:06----------
okay i mean i feel like i've done


---------95:10----------
at least that to a degree and i try to


---------95:13----------
as much as possible


---------95:14----------
it just doesn't feel like the the result


---------95:17----------
is much i guess right so


---------95:20----------
that's where you have to think a little


---------95:22----------
bit about what is your


---------95:24----------
when you say the result doesn't it


---------95:26----------
doesn't feel like the result as much


---------95:29----------
so that you have to pay attention to


---------95:31----------
like how calibrated that instrument is


---------95:33----------
and what are your expectations


---------95:35----------
right so what's your ability to detect


---------95:38----------
change


---------95:39----------
in in an among us game are you expecting


---------95:41----------
that


---------95:43----------
patterns that have been reinforced


---------95:44----------
through years of gaming and blaming


---------95:46----------
other people because


---------95:47----------
that's what games tend to make us do are


---------95:50----------
gonna be wiped away by one comment


---------95:52----------
or a dozen comments or comments over the


---------95:54----------
course of three months


---------95:57----------
no obviously not well i i


---------96:00----------
i don't know right so what's your


---------96:02----------
expectation on like


---------96:03----------
what would change look like like what


---------96:05----------
are you looking for


---------96:06----------
um i just don't


---------96:10----------
want like my ideal world


---------96:13----------
i guess is if someone makes a mistake in


---------96:15----------
the game


---------96:16----------
um whether i mean so hofu is the main


---------96:20----------
person i play with


---------96:21----------
um became really really good friends


---------96:23----------
with her um


---------96:24----------
i guess they're among us and there is so


---------96:27----------
much blatant


---------96:29----------
i guess sexism um


---------96:32----------
like if she does something that like she


---------96:35----------
catches me in a lie


---------96:37----------
or um or someone makes a dumb play in


---------96:41----------
that lobby


---------96:42----------
then the chat will just


---------96:45----------
go like rampant like pure rampage on


---------96:48----------
like


---------96:49----------
i hate this person they caught like it's


---------96:52----------
people are so invested into what happens


---------96:56----------
towards me in a game where i understand


---------96:59----------
what the game's about but even when i


---------97:02----------
try to


---------97:03----------
like i defend people 24 7 i guess


---------97:07----------
and that's the biggest like i don't it's


---------97:10----------
hard to control that


---------97:12----------
okay is there some way to observe


---------97:16----------
an among us game i mean watching a


---------97:20----------
stream i guess


---------97:22----------
or what do you mean by like are you guys


---------97:23----------
on a discord call or like how does that


---------97:25----------
work


---------97:26----------
we are on discord yes


---------97:29----------
so like everyone who's in the game is on


---------97:31----------
discord yes so we play the round we're


---------97:33----------
all muted


---------97:34----------
and then when a body is found we all


---------97:37----------
mute and talk in the meeting


---------97:38----------
and there's no looking at chat during


---------97:40----------
the game because people will say


---------97:41----------
spoilers so


---------97:42----------
i can't control my chat while i'm alive


---------97:44----------
in the game unless i'm an imposter


---------97:46----------
so if i'm a crewmate like it's all mod's


---------97:49----------
responsibility


---------97:50----------
um can i can i actually


---------97:53----------
watch this like can i sit in a discord


---------97:55----------
call with you guys one day


---------97:57----------
sure i don't want to actually play the


---------97:59----------
game is there is there like an observer


---------98:01----------
position in the game


---------98:02----------
you would have to watch a stream there's


---------98:03----------
no spectator there's no spectator okay


---------98:06----------
i'm just a little bit curious now i find


---------98:08----------
myself being curious about what y'all's


---------98:09----------
actual interactions look like it's


---------98:12----------
anyway so that that's one thought


---------98:16----------
um because i i feel like if you wanted


---------98:18----------
more advice about how to handle that


---------98:20----------
it's just such a unique environment that


---------98:23----------
i don't know


---------98:24----------
i feel like me just watching it once i'd


---------98:27----------
actually be able to answer your question


---------98:28----------
way better okay


---------98:33----------
um because i played like i said i played


---------98:35----------
among us once


---------98:37----------
and and like it was like with our


---------98:40----------
community and like


---------98:41----------
our communities like super healthy


---------98:44----------
like everyone cares about each other and


---------98:45----------
[ __ ] so i feel like i didn't even i


---------98:47----------
haven't been


---------98:48----------
i haven't seen this world that you're


---------98:50----------
talking about i've been in the kiddie


---------98:51----------
pool


---------98:52----------
and you guys are like swimming in the


---------98:53----------
english channel and it's just not


---------98:56----------
it's not the same at all


---------98:59----------
um yeah just watch any um


---------99:02----------
among the stream where someone


---------99:06----------
gets caught i guess so just the


---------99:08----------
reactions


---------99:09----------
five up i wanna if it's okay with you i


---------99:11----------
wanna try to circle back and like


---------99:13----------
share something with you in a sensical


---------99:16----------
way before we wrap up is that cool


---------99:18----------
sure so a lot of people have been asking


---------99:22----------
um you know


---------99:27----------
i kind of early on i sort of said that i


---------99:28----------
think like you're you're spiritually


---------99:30----------
gifted


---------99:31----------
and people are kind of confused by what


---------99:33----------
that means i'm sure you're confused by


---------99:34----------
what that means so that that's kind of


---------99:36----------
like


---------99:36----------
i just want to address that for a second


---------99:39----------
and do something that i i do


---------99:41----------
kind of rarely which is like advise you


---------99:44----------
so


---------99:45----------
five up so it seems to me like you know


---------99:46----------
like i kind of said earlier you were


---------99:48----------
born with good rng


---------99:50----------
so you have a certain kind of like mind


---------99:52----------
so it sounds like you're intelligent um


---------99:54----------
it sounds like you


---------99:55----------
grew up you know i'm not hearing any any


---------99:58----------
inkling of like abuse or anything like


---------99:59----------
that although maybe it's just really


---------100:01----------
really well hidden


---------100:03----------
um but i'm not hearing that you struggle


---------100:05----------
with any negative emotions


---------100:06----------
or not when i say it's not that you


---------100:08----------
don't have negative emotions it seems


---------100:10----------
like you're pretty good at like kind of


---------100:11----------
processing with


---------100:12----------
them processing them dealing with them


---------100:15----------
things like that


---------100:16----------
and when i kind of ask you like okay


---------100:18----------
what are you going to do in your life


---------100:19----------
and it sounds like you've got a strong


---------100:21----------
internal compass


---------100:22----------
that sort of is like yeah college is not


---------100:24----------
actually something that i need to do so


---------100:25----------
i'm not going to do it


---------100:27----------
i'm not hearing i mean this could be


---------100:28----------
there but you know


---------100:30----------
i'm not hearing um that you


---------100:34----------
in high school were thought that you


---------100:36----------
should go to a place like harvard or


---------100:37----------
yale or whatever


---------100:39----------
stanford and that you were afraid that


---------100:40----------
you wouldn't get in so you like decided


---------100:42----------
not to apply at all i'm not


---------100:44----------
getting that whiff um did you have those


---------100:48----------
kinds of thoughts or feelings


---------100:50----------
um there's a there's a big element of


---------100:53----------
comparing myself to my brother


---------100:54----------
where uh


---------100:58----------
i i we didn't dive too far into this i


---------101:00----------
guess for the school


---------101:02----------
my brother was a complete straight a


---------101:04----------
like beyond honor student


---------101:06----------
um and then because of the the


---------101:09----------
situations that i learned from like the


---------101:10----------
first


---------101:11----------
eight years of school i guess where it


---------101:14----------
didn't matter like


---------101:15----------
it felt like uh my perception of school


---------101:17----------
was they all taught


---------101:18----------
at least the school that i went to um i


---------101:20----------
live in arizona


---------101:22----------
the way the school systems work here is


---------101:24----------
they pay the teachers based off of


---------101:25----------
the grades people get not just for the


---------101:28----------
students so


---------101:29----------
a lot of the teachers would


---------101:34----------
inflate people's grades just so they get


---------101:35----------
better pay also


---------101:37----------
so it i realized that i was all teaching


---------101:40----------
to the test


---------101:42----------
and not necessarily teaching people and


---------101:45----------
i heavily disagreed with that and it


---------101:48----------
made me lose a heavy interest in school


---------101:50----------
so it was


---------101:51----------
here's my brother getting perfect grades


---------101:53----------
working hard because


---------101:54----------
he he knew what he wanted to do that


---------101:56----------
required


---------101:57----------
stuff like really good grades to get in


---------102:00----------
and


---------102:01----------
then i just had a complete loss of


---------102:03----------
interest


---------102:04----------
in all that because of how the system


---------102:05----------
worked


---------102:08----------
so it wasn't necessarily that i got good


---------102:10----------
grades


---------102:11----------
um but it was like here i am not


---------102:13----------
necessarily doing the best in school


---------102:16----------
but that's off my own volition but


---------102:17----------
here's my brother doing the best and


---------102:18----------
it's like


---------102:19----------
well i mean i there is the pressure from


---------102:22----------
family to do very well


---------102:26----------
so not necessarily like harvard but


---------102:28----------
there is good school


---------102:30----------
um they're like you know probably should


---------102:33----------
go to that potentially


---------102:36----------
okay so maybe maybe i i i've misjudged


---------102:40----------
this


---------102:40----------
i don't think i'm entirely wrong but


---------102:42----------
that sounds way more


---------102:44----------
of sometimes what happens so maybe


---------102:47----------
that's worth


---------102:48----------
you know exploring a little bit further


---------102:50----------
unfortunately i i have to get going in a


---------102:52----------
few minutes but


---------102:54----------
you know it may be far more pedestrian


---------102:56----------
than than i thought


---------102:58----------
um in terms of just you know standard


---------103:00----------
comparison and stuff and i apologize for


---------103:02----------
not


---------103:04----------
exploring that with you i think that was


---------103:06----------
also my fault for not like going


---------103:08----------
to that degree because that's definitely


---------103:09----------
important


---------103:12----------
yeah so but let's kind of just circle


---------103:13----------
back to this idea of like spiritually


---------103:15----------
gifted because i still think that that's


---------103:16----------
true


---------103:18----------
so so then then i think the next thing


---------103:19----------
to kind of think about is that like you


---------103:21----------
seem to have


---------103:22----------
you know streaming success kind of


---------103:23----------
dumped in your lap


---------103:25----------
like you sort of fell into it um


---------103:28----------
and you're kind of like focusing on like


---------103:31----------
fun for now


---------103:32----------
and things like that and and you're kind


---------103:35----------
of like okay what am i going to do that


---------103:36----------
will give me more freedom what am i


---------103:37----------
going to do that i


---------103:39----------
enjoy and it seems to me like you kind


---------103:41----------
of just put those


---------103:42----------
together and like you know you move in


---------103:46----------
the direction that is good for your like


---------103:48----------
long-term security and that is like


---------103:50----------
enjoyable


---------103:51----------
i'm not hearing you as the kind of


---------103:53----------
person who will like


---------103:54----------
sacrifice eight years of your life to


---------103:56----------
become a doctor if you don't enjoy doing


---------103:58----------
that


---------103:59----------
right and and so the other interesting


---------104:02----------
thing is that i i do think you


---------104:03----------
you genuinely have a fair amount of


---------104:05----------
detachment and what i mean by that is


---------104:07----------
that if your streaming career tanked in


---------104:10----------
a year i think you would be okay with


---------104:12----------
that


---------104:13----------
you'd sort of be sad because you


---------104:15----------
recognized that you maybe had an


---------104:17----------
opportunity that you missed


---------104:18----------
or you squandered something or something


---------104:20----------
along those lines


---------104:22----------
maybe you screwed up in some way and so


---------104:24----------
you'd be kind of sad about that


---------104:26----------
but you'd also be like relatively


---------104:27----------
calculating and sort of think about okay


---------104:29----------
how could i do it better next time


---------104:32----------
but overall i'm getting the sense that


---------104:34----------
you're going to be okay


---------104:36----------
and here's here's what i'm i would tell


---------104:40----------
you five up the first thing is that if


---------104:41----------
at some point you feel


---------104:43----------
directionless you know i do think that


---------104:46----------
there is a system of


---------104:49----------
exploration of the self and the meaning


---------104:52----------
of life and things like that


---------104:54----------
which i think may be interesting to you


---------104:56----------
and hopefully helpful


---------104:58----------
which is sort of like this eastern


---------104:59----------
perspective on like life and and


---------105:02----------
karma and things like that i'm not


---------105:04----------
trying to you know say like you don't


---------105:05----------
have to


---------105:06----------
it's not about religion it's just about


---------105:08----------
um


---------105:09----------
when i think about religion i tend to


---------105:10----------
think about like belief systems


---------105:12----------
and sort of like you know faith and


---------105:15----------
things like that


---------105:16----------
it's really more um


---------105:19----------
an exploration of like how stuff works


---------105:22----------
it's about understanding what are the


---------105:24----------
different way like why are we here like


---------105:26----------
how does this stuff work


---------105:27----------
what should i do with my life what is


---------105:29----------
the nature of happiness


---------105:30----------
where does happiness come from where


---------105:32----------
does desire come from


---------105:34----------
you strike me as someone who would


---------105:35----------
really really enjoy


---------105:37----------
and probably benefit from some amount of


---------105:39----------
formal instruction and this kind of


---------105:41----------
stuff


---------105:42----------
because i think you figure a lot of this


---------105:43----------
stuff out on your own and all i'm


---------105:44----------
telling you is that


---------105:46----------
you know you may like it's kind of like


---------105:48----------
you're working through the laws of


---------105:49----------
physics on your own and it's like hey by


---------105:51----------
the way there's a physics textbook you


---------105:52----------
can read


---------105:54----------
which you should still question um


---------105:58----------
you know and by all means you should


---------106:00----------
question it's a big part of it


---------106:02----------
but i think that you know you may find a


---------106:04----------
lot of value in that because i i think


---------106:06----------
that a lot of the


---------106:07----------
common wisdom may not apply to you


---------106:10----------
because i think you're different


---------106:11----------
five up um and for people that i've i've


---------106:15----------
met who are sort of like you they tend


---------106:17----------
to find


---------106:18----------
a lot of solace and direction in


---------106:21----------
some of these texts the next thing that


---------106:24----------
i would say to you is that i think that


---------106:27----------
you're gonna sort of gradually feel


---------106:29----------
empty if you continue this path for a


---------106:32----------
long time


---------106:33----------
i don't think you should deviate from it


---------106:34----------
now but what i mean is that


---------106:36----------
right now you're sort of leaning towards


---------106:37----------
the next strategically best thing


---------106:40----------
that fills you with the most enjoyment


---------106:42----------
from day to day


---------106:43----------
the thing that challenges you the most


---------106:45----------
the thing that gives you a sense of


---------106:46----------
mastery


---------106:47----------
and you're gonna do that right like you


---------106:49----------
said you're gonna do baking for a little


---------106:50----------
while and then


---------106:51----------
like don't get too caught up in baking


---------106:53----------
because i'm gonna move on to something


---------106:54----------
agree you're gonna learn three languages


---------106:57----------
you're gonna learn how to bake you're


---------106:58----------
gonna stream some


---------106:59----------
and then you'll get to be 25 and then


---------107:01----------
you'll get to be 30 and you'll get to be


---------107:02----------
35 and you'll have accumulated a lot of


---------107:05----------
skills


---------107:06----------
and then that process and this is the


---------107:09----------
real point that i've been trying to make


---------107:11----------
that process of chasing after one thing


---------107:14----------
at a time until you sort of master it


---------107:17----------
and move on


---------107:18----------
is gonna start to feel empty does that


---------107:21----------
make sense


---------107:22----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense and that's


---------107:25----------
why i'm telling you like i've talked to


---------107:27----------
you when you're 30 and i've talked to


---------107:29----------
you when you're 45 and that's what i've


---------107:31----------
seen from people like you


---------107:33----------
and then ultimately what brings these


---------107:35----------
people happiness


---------107:36----------
is like us a stark and difficult


---------107:39----------
exploration that's entirely internal


---------107:44----------
and if you have questions about that or


---------107:46----------
if at some point you feel directionless


---------107:48----------
or you feel like you have difficulty you


---------107:51----------
know and you don't know what to do with


---------107:53----------
your life like


---------107:54----------
you know shoot me a dm because i i may


---------107:57----------
be able to give you some concrete


---------107:59----------
recommendations at that time


---------108:02----------
all right i'll remember that is that


---------108:07----------
no yeah that makes sense okay that's


---------108:09----------
basically what i was trying because i i


---------108:11----------
think like you can't live


---------108:12----------
normal people's lives if you're not a


---------108:14----------
normal person


---------108:16----------
and i i think you've already figured


---------108:17----------
that out um


---------108:19----------
and there may be some stuff around


---------108:20----------
comparison and ego and


---------108:22----------
and not being able to live up to


---------108:23----------
expectations and stuff


---------108:26----------
but at the end of the day you know i


---------108:29----------
think you can keep on doing what you're


---------108:30----------
doing but


---------108:31----------
you'll move from one thing to the next


---------108:33----------
to the next to the next


---------108:35----------
and you may feel accomplished and you


---------108:36----------
may feel like you're progressing but


---------108:38----------
it'll start to feel empty


---------108:39----------
is my guess


---------108:43----------
yeah i can


---------108:46----------
i mean that is a worry um that i've had


---------108:49----------
so i thought about that a little bit um


---------108:53----------
so i i definitely know what you're


---------108:55----------
saying


---------108:56----------
but but i i would also say that


---------108:59----------
there's no it's worth it for you to go


---------109:02----------
down that road


---------109:03----------
so you feel that worry very genuinely


---------109:09----------
i don't know i'm not saying you should


---------109:10----------
avoid that is what i'm saying


---------109:16----------
no i mean i i'm definitely still going


---------109:19----------
to


---------109:21----------
pursue a lot of my goals yeah yeah i


---------109:23----------
think you should


---------109:25----------
absolutely any last questions for me


---------109:28----------
five up


---------109:30----------
um not so much question but more of like


---------109:33----------
a


---------109:33----------
thank you for talking to me i guess not


---------109:35----------
having the time


---------109:37----------
yeah of course man i i you know i feel


---------109:39----------
like i kind of owe you an apology


---------109:40----------
because i'm not sure how helpful this


---------109:42----------
was and i


---------109:42----------
i really do try to help people but i


---------109:45----------
don't know maybe it's not having the cam


---------109:46----------
i'm not quite sure no i mean i think it


---------109:50----------
was


---------109:51----------
if anything like no matter how helpful


---------109:54----------
it was i mean talking to a person is


---------109:56----------
also nice about the


---------109:58----------
things and advice about it from a


---------110:00----------
different perspective


---------110:02----------
it's always really good


---------110:05----------
yeah i feel like i have i have a karmic


---------110:08----------
debt that needs to be paid


---------110:10----------
in this conversation i feel like what


---------110:13----------
i'm supposed to give you i haven't given


---------110:15----------
you yet


---------110:16----------
hmm


---------110:22----------
um i think you i think you have


---------110:26----------
to a very big degree but also


---------110:29----------
i don't think i've given you the means


---------110:31----------
to like i don't think i know what i need


---------110:32----------
to give to


---------110:33----------
help you also i guess possible


---------110:37----------
i i don't need um just to clarify i


---------110:39----------
don't need you to


---------110:41----------
it's just a feeling i'm sharing with you


---------110:43----------
okay it's not a particular response i'm


---------110:46----------
looking for


---------110:49----------
but you know


---------110:52----------
yeah i was just letting you know maybe


---------110:53----------
we can talk more about your brother


---------110:57----------
sure um so


---------111:00----------
listen thank you very much and are you


---------111:03----------
interested in learning meditation


---------111:04----------
five up um sure


---------111:08----------
i mean i've yeah


---------111:12----------
what am i going to teach you have you


---------111:14----------
have you watched our


---------111:16----------
have you learned alternate nostril


---------111:17----------
breathing


---------111:19----------
i don't think so actually we're gonna do


---------111:22----------
a different one for you


---------111:23----------
um okay give me a second


---------111:28----------
okay so i'm gonna do something a little


---------111:30----------
bit different for you okay i want you to


---------111:32----------
close your eyes okay and listen to the


---------111:36----------
sound of your breath


---------111:50----------
can you hear it


---------112:00----------
and so what i want you to do is


---------112:05----------
phonetically spell out the sound of the


---------112:14----------
breath


---------112:22----------
that's hard


---------112:25----------
so can you give me anything give me a


---------112:28----------
bad answer before a good one


---------112:30----------
can we say it out loud sure whatever


---------112:33----------
you've got whatever you


---------112:34----------
whatever you can think of


---------112:44----------
i think it's like inhaling is a lot of


---------112:47----------
like


---------112:47----------
s's and exhaling is a lot of h's


---------112:52----------
okay good so practice it for


---------112:56----------
a couple of weeks and then let me know


---------113:01----------
and just see if you can figure it out


---------113:04----------
okay


---------113:05----------
okay


---------113:09----------
that's difficult all right yeah so it


---------113:12----------
requires it requires


---------113:14----------
practice and it requires you focusing


---------113:17----------
your attention


---------113:18----------
on something relatively internal


---------113:22----------
but i i think for definitely for you


---------113:24----------
five up


---------113:25----------
you want well i mean you can learn


---------113:27----------
formal meditation at some point but


---------113:30----------
i think an investigative technique is


---------113:31----------
definitely the way for you to start


---------113:36----------
okay


---------113:39----------
any last thoughts or questions before


---------113:40----------
you wrap up


---------113:42----------
good answer by the way you're on the


---------113:43----------
right track okay


---------113:46----------

---------113:50----------

---------113:54----------
