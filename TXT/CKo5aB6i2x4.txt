---------00:00----------
let's talk a little bit about toxicity


---------00:01----------
so one of the things that gamers


---------00:03----------
struggle with is that their brains are


---------00:06----------
so used to like the more you play games


---------00:08----------
and Men especially are are really good


---------00:12----------
at this we're really good at suppressing


---------00:14----------
our emotions and games actually shut off


---------00:16----------
of our emotional circuitry and so what


---------00:19----------
happens is games gamers become something


---------00:21----------
called Alexa thymic so alexithymia is


---------00:25----------
the inability to recognize your internal


---------00:27----------
emotional state and so what happens is a


---------00:30----------
lot of gamers actually are their


---------00:32----------
emotions rolling around inside of them


---------00:35----------
but they're not aware of them because


---------00:37----------
there are parts of their brain that are


---------00:39----------
kind of suppressing them all the time so


---------00:41----------
let's say that like you know I get into


---------00:42----------
a fight with my parents and then I turn


---------00:44----------
on a videogame and then like all those


---------00:45----------
emotions just get shut off and so a lot


---------00:48----------
of times what happens with gamers is


---------00:52----------
that they feel like everything is fine


---------00:53----------
they feel like oh yeah they're happy and


---------00:56----------
they're healthy and they enjoy gaming


---------00:57----------
but what actually happens is they have a


---------00:59----------
lot of sub-surface emotions that they're


---------01:02----------
not even aware of and that's what


---------01:04----------
alexithymia is and then what happens is


---------01:06----------
those those emotions kind of bubble to


---------01:08----------
the surface and start to impact their


---------01:10----------
life so what what ends up happening is


---------01:12----------
when they're alexithymia cuz gamers get


---------01:14----------
this illusion that they're not actually


---------01:16----------
experiencing negative emotions and a lot


---------01:18----------
of gamers that I talk to I'll ask them


---------01:20----------
like you know you know what's your


---------01:22----------
relationship with your emotions I mean I


---------01:24----------
don't ask that because that's a weird


---------01:26----------
question like I don't know how even I


---------01:28----------
would answer that but then the more I


---------01:29----------
ask them about essentially the


---------01:30----------
relationship to their emotions what they


---------01:32----------
come back with is that oh I'm in control


---------01:34----------
of my emotions and so when we talk about


---------01:38----------
that like the funny thing about gamers


---------01:39----------
is that they they feel like they're in


---------01:41----------
control of their emotions and by control


---------01:43----------
of their emotions what that means so


---------01:45----------
that they can watch like let's say a sad


---------01:46----------
movie and like everyone else around them


---------01:49----------
is crying but they're not crying and so


---------01:53----------
they're also like able to be in


---------01:55----------
uncomfortable situations and like be


---------01:57----------
kind of essentially like a blank slate


---------01:59----------
and so if we really think about it what


---------02:01----------
that means is that a lot of gamers it's


---------02:04----------
not that they're in control of their


---------02:05----------
emotions like Vulcans what that really


---------02:09----------
means is that they're just they they


---------02:11----------
just know how to suppress their emotions


---------02:13----------
and as those emotions get suppressed


---------02:16----------
it's kind of like this this emotional


---------02:18----------
like pile is like building and building


---------02:21----------
and building inside you and I'll give


---------02:22----------
you guys kind of an example for my


---------02:24----------
personal life like I remember feeling


---------02:26----------
like a failure right so I would wake up


---------02:28----------
every day I would skip class I would


---------02:31----------
like game until I was exhausted and I'd


---------02:33----------
like pass out at 4:00 in the morning and


---------02:35----------
every day that went by I'd feel more and


---------02:38----------
more like a failure and the only way


---------02:40----------
that I could get I could tolerate those


---------02:43----------
feelings was by escaping through gaming


---------02:44----------
and then I kind of I kind of like I kind


---------02:50----------
of got stuck because what would happen


---------02:54----------
is like every day that goes by I'm not


---------02:57----------
moving forward in life and I'm actually


---------02:59----------
failing in life more and more and more


---------03:01----------
and more and the only way that I could


---------03:03----------
so like day one let's say I feel like a


---------03:05----------
failure of 5 out of 10 and day 2 it's 6


---------03:08----------
out of 10 because now I've up for


---------03:10----------
2 days


---------03:11----------
day 3 is 7 out of 10 and so I'm digging


---------03:14----------
myself deeper and deeper and deeper and


---------03:16----------
the more and more failure I feel inside


---------03:19----------
me the more I have to turn to video


---------03:21----------
games to like make that feeling of


---------03:23----------
failure go away and so the more I turn


---------03:25----------
to video games the less for I mean the


---------03:28----------
more stuck I get and so it's this


---------03:29----------
vicious cycle and so gamers kind of get


---------03:31----------
into this and so the only way that they


---------03:34----------
learn how to manage their emotions


---------03:35----------
because gaming leads to escapism is


---------03:38----------
through playing video games and so they


---------03:42----------
have this gigantic pile of emotion


---------03:44----------
that's building up and I remember for me


---------03:46----------
sometimes like there are some moments


---------03:48----------
and if you guys really pay attention to


---------03:50----------
your lives maybe you can find out like


---------03:51----------
when are these moments but for me there


---------03:54----------
were some moments that the emotions


---------03:56----------
would just come flooding back and be


---------03:57----------
like completely overwhelming and for me


---------04:00----------
that was when I was going to bed at


---------04:01----------
night right so I'd like finish gaming


---------04:03----------
and if I got into bed and like my mind


---------04:06----------
would start to wander it would start to


---------04:08----------
think about how I was screwing up my


---------04:09----------
life and I would feel such an


---------04:11----------
overwhelming sense of hopelessness shame


---------04:15----------
and guilt that it was like intolerable


---------04:18----------
so what I had to do was game so much


---------04:22----------
until I got so mentally exhausted that


---------04:25----------
when I hit the sack I would just pass


---------04:27----------
out
