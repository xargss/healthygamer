[Music]


---------00:04----------
all righty folks let's go ahead and


---------00:09----------
begin so welcome to the healthy gamer


---------00:13----------
webinar day - all right so let's get


---------00:30----------
started so my name is dr. Alok Canoga


---------00:32----------
welcome to the healthy gamer webinar day


---------00:34----------
- so we decided to do this webinar


---------00:37----------
because we you know I know I know a


---------00:40----------
bunch of people are kind of stuck at


---------00:41----------
home with kovat and so we thought it


---------00:43----------
would be a good opportunity to offer a


---------00:45----------
different kind of content and what we're


---------00:48----------
hoping to do is offer more comprehensive


---------00:51----------
teaching about various concepts so


---------00:54----------
welcome today - I'm excited I'm glad


---------00:56----------
that you know all of you guys are here


---------00:58----------
just a little bit about the structure of


---------01:00----------
the webinar so we're going to start with


---------01:04----------
10 minutes of yoga and based on


---------01:06----------
yesterday's feedback thank you very much


---------01:08----------
everyone who filled it out we are I'm


---------01:11----------
going to start by actually demonstrating


---------01:13----------
one round and we're gonna go slower and


---------01:15----------
we're gonna do three rounds today so


---------01:17----------
actually yoga may take a little bit


---------01:19----------
longer than 10 minutes


---------01:21----------
the second thing so the topic for the


---------01:23----------
day so we do yoga for about 10 minutes


---------01:25----------
then we cover a topic for somewhere


---------01:26----------
between 30 and 50 minutes and the topic


---------01:30----------
today is going to be anxiety so I'm


---------01:32----------
gonna explain kind of my take on anxiety


---------01:35----------
and really not so much we're gonna go


---------01:38----------
into some detail but I think a big part


---------01:40----------
of the reason that I'd like to talk


---------01:41----------
about anxiety today is to teach some


---------01:44----------
basic principles about how the mind


---------01:45----------
works and as we better understand like


---------01:48----------
what are the rules of the mind then I


---------01:51----------
think our ability to control ourselves


---------01:52----------
sort of improves over time and so we're


---------01:56----------
gonna talk a little bit about anxiety


---------01:57----------
today and then we'll have time for Q&A


---------02:00----------
and I think another piece of feedback


---------02:02----------
about last week's are sorry yesterday's


---------02:06----------
webinar was that people felt like that


---------02:08----------
QA was a little bit disorganized I


---------02:10----------
completely agree and so they're hoping


---------02:11----------
for a little bit more structure and


---------02:13----------
maybe even


---------02:13----------
a little bit more time for QA so I'm not


---------02:16----------
quite sure exactly how we're gonna


---------02:18----------
manage that but we're gonna do our best


---------02:21----------
so we'll have a little bit more time for


---------02:23----------
QA and then we'll end with about ten


---------02:27----------
minutes of meditation so we're gonna


---------02:29----------
start with yoga so I encourage everyone


---------02:33----------
to get up and do yoga with me so the


---------02:35----------
purpose of doing the webinar at the same


---------02:37----------
time every day and starting it with


---------02:38----------
yoga's so that you guys can start out


---------02:40----------
with yoga I think it's a great way to


---------02:42----------
start your day it's a great way to yeah


---------02:48----------
it's a great way to start your day it's


---------02:50----------
a great way to sort of physically get up


---------02:51----------
and moving a little bit and we can talk


---------02:54----------
a little bit more about that so let me


---------03:01----------
just this there we go okay so let's do


---------03:10----------
it so a reminder that I'm gonna


---------03:14----------
demonstrate one round of Surya Namaskar


---------03:33----------
all right so Surya Namaskar is the Sun


---------03:38----------
script phrase that means Sun Salutation


---------03:42----------
so this is a set of yoga practice


---------03:44----------
practices that's designed to do first


---------03:46----------
thing morning and it kind of prepares


---------03:49----------
your body in your mind for the day so


---------03:51----------
the first step of Surya Namaskar is I'm


---------03:53----------
gonna I'm gonna stand with my feet close


---------03:55----------
together a kind of a detention and then


---------03:57----------
arms kind of relaxed in in namaste


---------04:01----------
position and then the first step is arms


---------04:06----------
up so biceps are going to be near the


---------04:09----------
ears so I'm gonna try to give you guys a


---------04:10----------
couple of like physical landmarks that


---------04:15----------
if you try to do the posture is going to


---------04:17----------
be a little bit easier to achieve and


---------04:20----------
then second one is step down and or go


---------04:24----------
down and touch your toes and remember


---------04:26----------
the goal here is not


---------04:27----------
your toes we don't want to bend her


---------04:28----------
knees it's really to just bend your back


---------04:30----------
and let gravity do the work for you so


---------04:35----------
go ahead and lean down you guys can just


---------04:37----------
watch this round right third round I'm


---------04:40----------
going to put my hands the palms of my


---------04:43----------
hands right next to my feet so they're


---------04:45----------
forming kind of a little bit of a lines


---------04:47----------
of surety that's the sway that sort of


---------04:50----------
makes sense


---------04:51----------
and then what I'm going to do is put one


---------04:54----------
leg back and so once again and put and


---------04:59----------
leg back here and then what you can


---------05:02----------
really notice about this pose you can


---------05:03----------
look up where you're supposed to look up


---------05:05----------
is that you can kind of like lean into


---------05:07----------
it and you'll feel like a different


---------05:10----------
structure you can kind of come back out


---------05:11----------
lean into it


---------05:15----------
come back out and this knee should kind


---------05:19----------
of be right next to your shoulder so


---------05:20----------
I'll kind of demonstrate maybe on this


---------05:22----------
side okay and then this leg back and now


---------05:32----------
we're going to kind of be in push-up


---------05:33----------
position so you want to be kind of


---------05:37----------
straight and then down and for this


---------05:45----------
position you want toes knees chest so


---------05:51----------
your butt is slightly elevated and then


---------05:53----------
for them and then we push up so hips


---------06:01----------
going to the ground the back is bent


---------06:03----------
shoulders are not like this shoulders


---------06:05----------
are rolled out elbows are bent that's


---------06:07----------
completely fine as you get better you'll


---------06:09----------
be able to push up more but we can stay


---------06:11----------
low it's not a big deal look up and I


---------06:17----------
want you guys to notice when you do yoga


---------06:19----------
even as you move a subtle part of your


---------06:21----------
body like your neck you'll notice


---------06:24----------
different things in other parts of your


---------06:26----------
body and then we go to part of a passing


---------06:31----------
or Mountain Pose once again ears by the


---------06:35----------
biceps


---------06:39----------
put your heels into the ground other leg


---------06:42----------
forward look up again and then back to


---------06:57----------
head down you'll notice that even


---------07:00----------
between the first round and the second


---------07:02----------
round


---------07:03----------
your flexibility is going to be far more


---------07:05----------
increased and that's the purpose of yoga


---------07:09----------
let me go up again just and then back to


---------07:19----------
the center okay so let's now you guys do


---------07:25----------
it with me we're gonna do three rounds


---------07:26----------
we're gonna go slow maybe the CEO is


---------07:28----------
gonna take a little bit longer actually


---------07:30----------
it's okay so start start with your feet


---------07:34----------
apart close your eyes go ahead and just


---------07:38----------
feel your body for a moment and now put


---------07:43----------
your feet together feel the instability


---------07:53----------
open your eyes and then close them again


---------07:57----------
you can use this just slight opening and


---------08:01----------
closing of the eyes like open for a few


---------08:02----------
seconds feel the stability to return


---------08:05----------
close your eyes feel the instability so


---------08:10----------
even that can kind of anchor you in the


---------08:12----------
present it's gonna be important skill


---------08:14----------
we'll talk about later


---------08:16----------
now must a position deep breath in and


---------08:21----------

---------08:26----------
slowly biceps two ears go ahead and


---------08:34----------
stretch your arms up a little bit good


---------08:37----------
feel that expansion in your back and now


---------08:44----------
the next step will be to going to touch


---------08:47----------
our toes or bend down and touch your


---------08:50----------
toes so go ahead and do that


---------09:02----------
let gravity do the work for you let


---------09:05----------
yourself hang let your head hang hold


---------09:10----------
that for about 10 seconds


---------09:12----------
just hang you don't have to be very low


---------09:15----------

good thing for the pose so hips into the


---------16:58----------
ground now shoulders rolled out not like


---------17:01----------
this this is what you guys may want to


---------17:03----------
do you're gonna push up you can use your


---------17:04----------
arms to push up right but don't do that


---------17:07----------
shoulders out it's gonna weaken the


---------17:09----------
strength of your arms and you're in the


---------17:11----------
ability to push up your body and you're


---------17:13----------
gonna turn you're gonna come down a


---------17:14----------
little bit which is perfectly fine you


---------17:17----------
do not want your arms to push your back


---------17:19----------
past where it wants to go


---------17:21----------
so stay like this it's going to be


---------17:24----------
physically way more taxing which is


---------17:26----------
perfectly fine if you guys need to rest


---------17:29----------
you can actually go back to this but


---------17:32----------
we're gonna go to blue janessa elbows


---------17:35----------
bent shoulders out back bent hips to the


---------17:39----------
ground look up and then part about


---------17:42----------
awesome


---------17:42----------
Mountain Pose so we're gonna use a


---------17:46----------
couple of our anchors here like ears -


---------17:48----------
biceps once again heels into the ground


---------17:51----------
flattening of the feet which is going to


---------17:55----------
create stretch in the calf let it happen


---------18:03----------
feel the blood flow into your brain


---------18:09----------
and now right leg forward now look up


---------18:17----------
straight in the back move your hips into


---------18:20----------
it and feel the freeness of your breath


---------18:28----------
and now we're gonna come up foot forward


---------18:34----------
hands hanging down head hanging down


---------19:00----------
and now palms together go back to


---------19:05----------
standing straight and tall


---------19:22----------
feel the relaxation let your hands come


---------19:26----------
down whoo and now notice this position


---------19:32----------
so I want you guys to understand that


---------19:34----------
this starting position with no mosfet


---------19:37----------
position with your hands in front of you


---------19:39----------
doesn't feel like much when you start


---------19:43----------
the practice but just notice how you


---------19:45----------
feel at the end of the practice right


---------19:51----------
this is how this position was developed


---------19:53----------
it wasn't to start the practice it's


---------19:54----------
actually to end the practice and your


---------20:00----------
body is like man that was good but I'm


---------20:02----------
glad we're not doing it anymore


---------20:05----------
notice kind of a tingling sensations in


---------20:08----------
the energy that's the sensation of


---------20:09----------
Brahma Brahma has life energy or Chi


---------20:14----------
your body is waking up now we're going


---------20:19----------
to do our 3rd round ok do this one a


---------20:22----------
little bit faster so take a deep breath


---------20:28----------
in out and arms up here so your biceps


---------20:35----------
stretch stretch your back reach your


---------20:38----------
arms up keep your feet flat on the


---------20:40----------
ground but otherwise to leech out for


---------20:41----------
each other now down and hanging arms


---------20:48----------
hanging go ahead and move into it let


---------20:51----------
gravity do the work for you no further


---------20:56----------

---------25:01----------
[Music]


---------25:07----------
alright so that took thirty minutes


---------25:12----------
okay so I've got a question for you guys


---------25:14----------
okay let's do a poll so we're gonna do a


---------25:18----------
poll what do you guys want to talk about


---------25:21----------
today yoga or anxiety I can we can just


---------25:26----------
talk about yoga actually if you guys


---------25:28----------
want oh all right so let me know what do


---------25:34----------
you so we can just talk about what yoga


---------25:36----------
is or we can go back to anxiety and how


---------25:40----------
yoga works oh man I love this okay so it


---------25:47----------
sounds like we're sticking with anxiety


---------25:49----------
[Music]


---------25:50----------
No


---------25:52----------
[Music]


---------25:54----------
within like five seconds I saw a huge


---------26:01----------
spike for your anxiety so we'll do that


---------26:03----------
that's okay we'll stick with anxiety


---------26:05----------
okay it's all the same anyway okay thank


---------26:11----------
you guys very much I found that very


---------26:12----------
helpful okay so


---------26:17----------
[Music]


---------26:22----------
Oh interesting


---------26:26----------
[Music]


---------26:33----------
okay so someone suggested that I use a


---------26:43----------
different note taking app which I'm


---------26:47----------
happy to but I just realized that I


---------26:49----------
can't screaming capture on this app or I


---------26:52----------
don't know how to so we're actually


---------26:53----------
going to go back to just regular notes


---------26:55----------
okay oh okay all right so let's talk


---------27:09----------
about anxiety oh my god my OCD is


---------27:13----------
killing me okay so when let's go ahead


---------27:20----------
and screen share so thank you guys very


---------27:21----------
much and let's go ahead and go back to


---------27:26----------
this channel your inner boomer okay so


---------27:34----------
then what we're gonna do is this so


---------27:36----------
let's talk about anxiety you guys see in


---------27:39----------
this okay let me just make sure so


---------27:43----------
question number one what is anxiety


---------27:51----------
right let's start with basics no no


---------27:58----------
interesting looks like I can't cap cast


---------28:00----------
maybe it's because it's it's using


---------28:02----------
reflector okay so what is anxiety so the


---------28:06----------
first thing is like let's just think a


---------28:08----------
little bit about what our experience of


---------28:10----------
anxiety is so when I'm anxious about


---------28:13----------
something I'm worrying right so we use


---------28:15----------
this word worry and so what is worried


---------28:18----------
worried is thinking of consequences


---------28:28----------
right we're usually worried about stuff


---------28:31----------
we're worried about what are people


---------28:33----------
gonna think of me


---------28:35----------
what are what's gonna happen at work


---------28:36----------
today what is my boyfriend or girlfriend


---------28:39----------
gonna think what are how do I look or


---------28:42----------
people gonna think I'm stupid so there


---------28:43----------
are all kinds of thoughts but they're


---------28:45----------
basically thinking about consequences


---------28:49----------
usually of your actions like if I go to


---------28:52----------
you know if I go out with friends and I


---------28:55----------
open my mouth is everyone to think I'm


---------28:56----------
dumb if I answer a question and I get it


---------28:59----------
wrong in class as everyone gonna think


---------29:01----------
I'm done and so that's really what we're


---------29:04----------
he is so thinking about consequences and


---------29:07----------
so the next question is if we look at


---------29:09----------
consequences this is gonna sound like a


---------29:12----------
weird question when do consequences


---------29:14----------
happen and the answer is in the future


---------29:21----------
so the first thing to understand about


---------29:23----------
anxiety is anxiety is our minds ability


---------29:31----------
to predict problems in the future okay


---------29:44----------
so so if we think about this so like


---------29:51----------
let's say here's our mind right here's


---------29:53----------
our brain whatever it's a bad looking


---------29:55----------
brain five head so we'll give this


---------29:59----------
person dr. K's artwork okay so this is


---------30:05----------
who we are and this is your anxious mind


---------30:06----------
right because the anxious mind is kind


---------30:08----------
of like always you know it's gigantic it


---------30:12----------
feels heavy and then since we're anxious


---------30:14----------
we're gonna give you a frowny face all


---------30:16----------
right that's a mustache and then that's


---------30:18----------
your face okay all right so this is our


---------30:24----------
brain right and what we're gonna so if


---------30:28----------
we think about it like our brain is kind


---------30:30----------
of thinking about the future right what


---------30:36----------
if


---------30:38----------
[Music]


---------30:40----------
what if what so this is anxiety does


---------30:48----------
that make sense


---------30:49----------
so fundamentally our my this is our our


---------30:52----------
minds ability to like look into the


---------30:53----------
future so what that means is that you


---------30:57----------
know if we think about it like how does


---------30:58----------
anxiety work it is essentially Minds


---------31:00----------
predictive capability so anxiety is


---------31:03----------
actually a normal function of the mind


---------31:05----------
which is our predictive you know kind of


---------31:13----------
like danger like it's predictive and


---------31:19----------
like danger oriented like that's what


---------31:20----------
our mind has this capability that sort


---------31:23----------
of looks into the future and then let's


---------31:29----------
[Music]


---------31:34----------
so our mind has this capability to look


---------31:37----------
into the future and predict problems and


---------31:41----------
if we didn't have this capability like


---------31:43----------
we wouldn't be alive so this is an


---------31:44----------
evolutionary capability so evolution


---------31:48----------
helps us predict problems okay and so


---------31:52----------
when our problem predicting capability


---------31:56----------
gets out of our control


---------31:59----------
this is anxiety so I want you guys to


---------32:01----------
think about this for a second okay so we


---------32:03----------
have our head I'm just gonna make a


---------32:04----------
circle and then it has all these


---------32:06----------
functions right so danger prediction


---------32:11----------
kind of reflecting on the past fantasy


---------32:20----------
right when that to is sort of future


---------32:23----------
oriented has things like imagination


---------32:27----------
these are all the functions of the mind


---------32:30----------
like they're more but these are kind of


---------32:32----------
what we'll talk about so the interesting


---------32:35----------
thing is that when these so generally


---------32:37----------
speaking what we want to do is we want


---------32:38----------
to be in control of these functions of


---------32:40----------
our mind so you know I want to think


---------32:43----------
about okay if I'm going to you know


---------32:46----------
let's say Co bid the Kournikova


---------32:48----------
quarantine is like going on in many


---------32:49----------
places so we want our mind to be able to


---------32:52----------
look


---------32:53----------
to the future and anticipate problems


---------32:55----------
right so anticipate problems and this is


---------33:03----------
vital because like unless we know how to


---------33:04----------
prepare for the future like we're gonna


---------33:06----------
get screwed so our mind kind of like I


---------33:08----------
say okay so kovat is going on what do I


---------33:10----------
need to do like how do I prepare so


---------33:13----------
that's like a very healthy part of our


---------33:14----------
mind the what anxiety is is when this


---------33:17----------
function of our mind actually like we


---------33:20----------
lose control of it so we don't get to


---------33:22----------
decide when it operates


---------33:23----------
that's what anxiety is so anxiety is


---------33:29----------
problem anticipation out of control


---------33:40----------
right and if you think about it that's


---------33:42----------
what really it really is like if I'm


---------33:43----------
gonna if I have social anxiety I'm gonna


---------33:45----------
create all these kinds of potential


---------33:47----------
problems from my social interaction I


---------33:50----------
you know if I'm worried about my health


---------33:52----------
then I'm like I have a pain in my chest


---------33:54----------
and then my mind automatically goes to


---------33:56----------
all these different thoughts about oh


---------33:58----------
maybe I have a heart attack maybe I


---------34:00----------
cancer maybe have this maybe I have that


---------34:01----------
and it's like problem anticipation but


---------34:04----------
just blown out of proportion


---------34:05----------
so this kind of comes back to and I'm


---------34:08----------
not gonna I'm gonna just steer away from


---------34:10----------
my earlier drawing so this is the mind


---------34:13----------
so anxiety is future-focused


---------34:18----------
okay so now what does this mean so like


---------34:23----------
let's just think about this like can you


---------34:25----------
have anxiety about the past or is all


---------34:28----------
anxiety focused in the future can you


---------34:30----------
have any anxiety in the present and some


---------34:33----------
people will say oh you can't have


---------34:34----------
anxiety in the past like I'm I'm super


---------34:37----------
anxious and I think about last night


---------34:39----------
like I woke up this morning and I'm


---------34:41----------
feeling super anxious because last night


---------34:43----------
I went out with some friends and then I


---------34:45----------
made a joke and then like six people


---------34:47----------
laughed but then it was sort of like


---------34:49----------
directed at the seventh person because


---------34:51----------
this is how anxiety we're excited it's


---------34:52----------
super complicated and then you kind of


---------34:54----------
notice that that seventh person laughed


---------34:55----------
maybe they were offended so isn't that


---------34:57----------
thinking in the past the answer is


---------35:03----------
actually no because what is anxiety


---------35:04----------
really doing it's thinking about a path


---------35:07----------
event and it's thinking about the


---------35:09----------
consequences in the future right even


---------35:14----------
when you think about anxiety like if you


---------35:16----------
have anxiety about past events if you


---------35:18----------
really pause and study yourself well but


---------35:21----------
you're really worried about is the


---------35:22----------
future impact of your actions in the


---------35:25----------
past


---------35:25----------
so anxiety is always anxiety is always


---------35:41----------
future focused so this is like piece of


---------35:47----------
homework number one right I encourage


---------35:49----------
you to examine this point so between now


---------35:57----------
and tomorrow I don't want you to think


---------35:58----------
about every single anxious thought or


---------36:00----------
like whenever you have an anxious


---------36:01----------
thought you can remember it look at


---------36:04----------
yourself and try to figure out okay am i


---------36:06----------
worried about something in the present


---------36:07----------
the past or the future and see if this


---------36:11----------
this is my assertion you guys tell me if


---------36:14----------
that's true or if that's false


---------36:16----------
okay so anxiety is essentially our


---------36:19----------
future like problem predicting


---------36:22----------
capability so can it exist in the past


---------36:24----------
or can it exist in the present second


---------36:26----------
thing that I want to note is that since


---------36:28----------
anxiety is essentially a normal function


---------36:30----------
[Music]


---------36:34----------
gone wild what is that you know what are


---------36:40----------
some of the implications of that so the


---------36:42----------
first is that the higher the IQ the


---------36:49----------
worse the anxiety so just think about


---------36:56----------
this for a second okay so if you have a


---------36:59----------
function that predicts problems the


---------37:02----------
greater your analytical capability the


---------37:05----------
stronger your analytical capability the


---------37:08----------
greater chance there is that it's going


---------37:12----------
to be able to predict more problems and


---------37:14----------
what this means is that if people try to


---------37:16----------
fight against your anxiety and by people


---------37:18----------
we're including your


---------37:19----------
self the smarter you are the stronger it


---------37:22----------
is so when you try so a lot of times the


---------37:25----------
response is reassurance and what do I


---------37:32----------
mean by that people tell you you say oh


---------37:33----------
everyone thinks I'm a dumbass and then


---------37:35----------
someone comes to you and says oh no man


---------37:37----------
like we all like you we think you're a


---------37:38----------
fantastic person and the smarter you are


---------37:41----------
like the stronger you are at knocking


---------37:43----------
that away right you say no no dude like


---------37:45----------
you really don't understand and they can


---------37:47----------
make all these different arguments to


---------37:49----------
try to convince you that you don't have


---------37:52----------
anything to worry about that people like


---------37:53----------
you and then your anxiety is like that


---------37:55----------
I'm pretty sure I'm right about this


---------37:57----------
because this is what I want you guys to


---------37:59----------
understand is that this is actually a


---------38:01----------
normal function of your mind so if your


---------38:03----------
mind is strong if you're high level then


---------38:06----------
you know your your stats are gonna be


---------38:09----------
high and like if anxiety takes control


---------38:10----------
of you then like its stats are gonna be


---------38:12----------
high I want you guys to think kind of


---------38:14----------
think about you know in games like their


---------38:15----------
mind control mechanics right and like


---------38:17----------
you want to mind control the strongest


---------38:19----------
enemy you can because then you're gonna


---------38:22----------
get the strongest ally and anxiety is


---------38:25----------
sort of like mind controlling your it's


---------38:27----------
could taking control of your problem


---------38:29----------
anticipation your ability to predict


---------38:31----------
problems and it's kind of like using it


---------38:33----------
against you so the first thing to


---------38:35----------
understand is that anxiety is not


---------38:37----------
necessarily an illness I mean I think it


---------38:39----------
certainly is an illness but it's not an


---------38:41----------
illness in the way that an infection


---------38:43----------
like Kove it isn't illness right it's


---------38:45----------
not something that happens to you it's


---------38:47----------
actually a part of you that is


---------38:49----------
malfunctioning it's not external so next


---------38:59----------
thing to kind of think a little bit


---------39:00----------
about is that most things in our brain


---------39:03----------
are learned and I want you guys to


---------39:08----------
appreciate for a second that anxiety is


---------39:10----------
usually learned okay and what I mean by


---------39:12----------
that is that you know if you're worried


---------39:15----------
about social anxiety there's usually a


---------39:18----------
reason you're worried about that as


---------39:19----------
opposed to health care anxiety or other


---------39:22----------
kinds of things so if we think about


---------39:24----------
when does the mind when does the


---------39:26----------
predictive capability of the mind


---------39:29----------
activate it is to protect us from


---------39:31----------
problems so depending on what's Happ


---------39:33----------
- in the past your anxiety will manifest


---------39:52----------
in different ways okay so this is why


---------40:00----------
people are anxious about different


---------40:01----------
things so the more that you talk to


---------40:03----------
people with anxiety the more you


---------40:05----------
discover that like their anxiety traces


---------40:08----------
back to like particular events and


---------40:10----------
that's to learn behavior because if you


---------40:12----------
think about you know if I'm worried


---------40:13----------
about getting burned by a stove why am I


---------40:17----------
worried about getting burned by a stove


---------40:18----------
it's because I've been burned by a stove


---------40:20----------
before and the more recent the injury


---------40:22----------
the more likely I am to be worried about


---------40:24----------
it you know if you are dating someone


---------40:27----------
who breaks up with you and then two


---------40:29----------
months later wants to get back together


---------40:31----------
your anxiety is going to be like what if


---------40:34----------
they break up with me again like that


---------40:35----------
comes from some some injury that you've


---------40:37----------
you've experienced and that's the way


---------40:41----------
that our brain works our brain anytime


---------40:44----------
we suffer or we we take damage of some


---------40:46----------
kind our brain tries to learn from it


---------40:49----------
and protect us and the way that our


---------40:51----------
brain tries to protect us is through


---------40:53----------
anxiety right so it predicts problems so


---------40:58----------
this is kind of interesting because if


---------41:00----------
we kind of like look at this this is not


---------41:02----------
necessarily I mean sure it causes us


---------41:04----------
suffering and we'll kind of get to that


---------41:05----------
for a second in a second but I want you


---------41:08----------
guys to first realize that your anxiety


---------41:10----------
is a part of your mind


---------41:11----------
that is actually like you know it's not


---------41:14----------
something you need to get rid of it's


---------41:15----------
something that you need to tame it's


---------41:17----------
kind of like a horse that's gone out of


---------41:19----------
control and is like bucking around and


---------41:21----------
you need to calm it down and help it do


---------41:23----------
what it's supposed to do which is


---------41:25----------
activate when you want to activate okay


---------41:30----------
so let's just think a little bit about


---------41:33----------
what anxiety looks like


---------41:37----------
[Music]


---------41:43----------
what does anxiety look like okay so


---------41:59----------
anxiety usually manifests as thoughts


---------42:04----------
about the future and then anxiety also


---------42:11----------
has a focus on the self so what does


---------42:20----------
that mean so if you think about like if


---------42:21----------
you if you write down and I encourage


---------42:23----------
you guys to do this so task number two


---------42:25----------
is write down ten anxious thoughts and


---------42:34----------
we're actually gonna switch gears for a


---------42:36----------
second so this is what I want you guys


---------42:38----------
to do his anxiety something you can


---------42:41----------
really switch on and off we're gonna see


---------42:43----------
right ah I'm very good


---------42:46----------
so we're gonna get to the physical


---------42:48----------
sensations in a second so I want you


---------42:50----------
guys can someone just post an example of


---------42:52----------
a like in chat some way just give me an


---------42:54----------
example of an anxious thought can I get


---------43:02----------
an example I don't know how much of a


---------43:10----------
lag there is no one likes me Oh perfect


---------43:12----------
what if I can't get a girlfriend


---------43:14----------
beautiful okay what if I can't get a


---------43:23----------
girlfriend okay okay okay will I be good


---------43:37----------
enough that's good guys thank you very


---------43:39----------
much will I be good enough to pass the


---------43:47----------
test right so I want you guys to notice


---------43:52----------
a couple of things the first is this you


---------43:58----------
can't have anxiety without I or me


---------44:00----------
actually I mean you can you can be


---------44:02----------
anxious about other people but generally


---------44:04----------
speaking a lot of the anxiety that we


---------44:07----------
experience is focused on the self the


---------44:10----------
second thing is that like what is the


---------44:12----------
tense I mean yeah what is it like what


---------44:15----------
is the direction of these thoughts right


---------44:16----------
so like will what if so these are future


---------44:21----------
oriented and these are focused on the


---------44:32----------
self right you guys see that and this


---------44:39----------
stuff can change this stuff is actually


---------44:44----------
kind of irrelevant this is the important


---------44:47----------
thing so if we're talking about how


---------44:49----------
anxiety works like what is the nature of


---------44:52----------
anxiety like how does it function in


---------44:54----------
your mind if we're opening up the hood


---------44:56----------
this is the consistent part because this


---------44:58----------
can be like completely random right will


---------45:01----------
I dot dot dot what if da da da and this


---------45:08----------
stuff this stuff has to do with like you


---------45:10----------
know specifically what your anxieties


---------45:12----------
about and I want you guys to write down


---------45:14----------
ten anxious thoughts and and


---------45:20----------
see like what about this pattern applies


---------45:23----------
and what doesn't so throughout your day


---------45:25----------
if you have an anxious thought just make


---------45:26----------
a note of it and write it out and I want


---------45:28----------
you guys to understand that you can't


---------45:30----------
say something like some people


---------45:37----------
so some people's like are using words


---------45:40----------
right so they're saying getting replaced


---------45:43----------
getting replaced is not an anxious


---------45:45----------
thought so you guys have to capture the


---------45:48----------
full thought right so so NOAA says


---------45:52----------
getting replaced so what I want you guys


---------45:57----------
to think about that's not actually the


---------45:59----------
thought that you have in your head so


---------46:00----------
train yourself because what that really


---------46:03----------
thought is the real thought is what if I


---------46:07----------
get replaced that's the full thought and


---------46:12----------
part of this process of understanding


---------46:15----------
and overcoming anxiety is to be clear


---------46:17----------
and descriptive about what is going on


---------46:19----------
in your mind


---------46:20----------
so as you can you know try to really


---------46:27----------
capture the fullness of the thought okay


---------46:30----------
so the next thing to think about anxiety


---------46:33----------
so the first thing is with their


---------46:34----------
thoughts right so there's their thoughts


---------46:36----------
of anxiety and then they're also


---------46:38----------
feelings see dr. K learned something


---------46:44----------
there are also feelings so the feelings


---------46:47----------
are like pain in your chest


---------46:50----------
[Music]


---------46:53----------
nausea butterflies headache sweaty palms


---------47:08----------
shortness of breath


---------47:12----------
right here are examples of physical


---------47:14----------
sensations that come with anxiety so the


---------47:16----------
first thing to understand is that


---------47:17----------
anxiety has cognitive and physical


---------47:23----------
manifestations so these are


---------47:27----------
fundamentally different right and you


---------47:30----------
guys have to understand that like like


---------47:31----------
notice both of these things and


---------47:33----------
sometimes you have an


---------47:34----------
thought without the sensations and


---------47:36----------
sometimes you have the sensations


---------47:37----------
without a thought so we're gonna get to


---------47:39----------
how to deal with each of these because


---------47:40----------
the the pathway is a little bit


---------47:42----------
different okay so now what do we do with


---------47:46----------
this so there are thoughts in there


---------47:48----------
there are physical sensations so the


---------47:52----------
other thing that I so now what we're


---------47:54----------
going to talk about is like what is your


---------47:55----------
mind how do these thoughts that we have


---------48:00----------
how does anxiety affect our mind so I


---------48:11----------
know this is kind of a weird kind of


---------48:14----------
question right like like we don't really


---------48:16----------
think about we think like oh I'm anxious


---------48:18----------
and that's sort of like I want to stop


---------48:20----------
being a anxious but let's try to figure


---------48:23----------
out like that's not actually that's not


---------48:26----------
sufficient if we really want to


---------48:27----------
understand anxiety we have to think a


---------48:29----------
little bit about what is the implication


---------48:31----------
or what is happening in our mind when I


---------48:32----------
have an anxious thought so how does it


---------48:34----------
affect our mind so the first thing is


---------48:37----------
that anxious thoughts are circular okay


---------48:47----------
so I want you guys to just think about


---------48:49----------
that so anxious thoughts lead to more


---------48:52----------
thoughts which lead to more thoughts


---------48:56----------
which lead to more thoughts and then we


---------49:00----------
kind of end up where we started guys


---------49:02----------
agree so this is called rumination and


---------49:08----------
this is actually a hijacking of


---------49:12----------
something called like our


---------49:13----------
problem-solving thought process right so


---------49:15----------
problem thinking solution and then so


---------49:26----------
let's say anxiety relaxation


---------49:33----------
right and then actually decrease in


---------49:39----------
thought so I want you guys to look at


---------49:44----------
these two things okay so this is


---------49:46----------
problem-solving let me try to fix this


---------49:54----------
okay and then move that up back over


---------50:05----------
here okay so let's just think about that


---------50:12----------
right


---------50:13----------
this is rumination and this is anxiety


---------50:16----------
and this is problem-solving so do you


---------50:21----------
guys see the difference between the do


---------50:27----------
you get any kind of the difference


---------50:28----------
between like these two processes


---------50:31----------
so this one is productive and both of


---------50:33----------
them start from the same place like they


---------50:35----------
start with anxiety right like you're


---------50:36----------
worried about something but one is a


---------50:38----------
productive problem-solving process and


---------50:40----------
the other is kind of like a self fueling


---------50:43----------
process so we can think about


---------50:45----------
problem-solving is thinking through


---------50:47----------
things right you start at point a and


---------50:51----------
you go to point Z and then anxious


---------51:03----------
thinking is you start at point a and


---------51:06----------
then you end up at point a so you never


---------51:11----------
get anywhere so what this means is that


---------51:13----------
that if we think about this like anxiety


---------51:16----------
is exhausting because it doesn't stop


---------51:19----------
and problem-solving is relaxing because


---------51:22----------
you kind of like think through things


---------51:23----------
and then you feel good about yourself so


---------51:26----------
anxiety sort of exhausts when we think


---------51:28----------
about how does anxiety affect the mind


---------51:30----------
the first thing that it does is it's


---------51:32----------
circular and it ends up exhausting the


---------51:34----------
mind and so if we think about how do


---------51:36----------
people cope


---------51:37----------

---------51:44----------
so what are the coping mechanisms for


---------51:46----------
anxiety right so it's stuff that what


---------51:53----------
what is the main coping mechanism of the


---------51:56----------
anxiety is to shut off thoughts or mind


---------52:03----------
so good examples of this are sleep


---------52:08----------
gaming drugs right there there are


---------52:16----------
things that essentially try to shut off


---------52:19----------
our thoughts because this is this is not


---------52:22----------
getting anywhere right it's not like


---------52:24----------
it's not doing anything for us so it's


---------52:26----------
circular and so the only general e


---------52:29----------
speaking the solution that we have to


---------52:31----------
anxiety is to shut it off or you know


---------52:35----------
turn off the mind or shut off our


---------52:36----------
thoughts the problem is that what


---------52:40----------
happens so if we do this what happens


---------52:43----------
when the mind turns back on right this


---------52:54----------
is the real problem so let's say you


---------52:56----------
start playing video games like you're


---------52:57----------
worried oh am I going to fail out of


---------52:58----------
class am I prepared for the test that


---------53:01----------
that feeling is exhausting you guys are


---------53:04----------
thinking about that for a while and then


---------53:06----------
you're like oh I can't take this anymore


---------53:08----------
I'm exhausted I don't feel good you


---------53:09----------
start to play a video game and then it's


---------53:11----------
relief it's sweet sweet relief and then


---------53:14----------
after you play the video game then you


---------53:17----------
know if you turn off the video game like


---------53:19----------
what happens the anxious feelings come


---------53:21----------
back you're just back to square one


---------53:23----------
you're right back here because you're


---------53:24----------
not actually solving any problems okay


---------53:28----------
so the second thing to understand is


---------53:32----------
that so if we think about this this so


---------53:36----------
this process if we think about


---------53:38----------
problem-solving leads to a decrease in


---------53:40----------
thought anxiety leads to an increase in


---------53:45----------
thought so this is what I want you guys


---------53:49----------
to kind of think a little bit about okay


---------53:51----------
so what happens when we increase thought


---------53:54----------
versus the


---------53:55----------
Chris thought so this is our mind and


---------53:58----------
there are some things that we do that


---------53:59----------
sort of increase our thoughts and some


---------54:04----------
things that we do that decrease our


---------54:06----------
thoughts okay so what this essentially


---------54:12----------
means is that when we feed the mind we


---------54:17----------
increase thoughts and we when we


---------54:20----------
essentially starve the mind we decrease


---------54:26----------
thoughts and what do I mean by this like


---------54:29----------
it's kind of like you know when you when


---------54:34----------
you have an anxious thought that anxious


---------54:37----------
thought starts to breed right it's like


---------54:40----------
oh my god this person doesn't like me


---------54:42----------
and then this is gonna happen and then


---------54:43----------
this is gonna happen and then this is


---------54:44----------
gonna happen so what that looks like is


---------54:46----------
anxious thought right so let's say


---------54:50----------
anxious thought number one and then okay


---------55:00----------
and then that leads to number two which


---------55:05----------
leads to number three and then one


---------55:07----------
thought leads to another leads to


---------55:09----------
another right so what we're doing is


---------55:10----------
we're actually creating more and more


---------55:12----------
thoughts the other thing that happens is


---------55:16----------
like sometimes when people have anxiety


---------55:19----------
they try to argue so this is mechanism


---------55:23----------
number two so you try to tell yourself


---------55:26----------
against the thoughts and this can be


---------55:33----------
yourself or other people okay and so as


---------55:43----------
you argue against the thoughts what


---------55:44----------
happens the thoughts just grow it leads


---------55:48----------
to thought number four number five and


---------55:52----------
number six right so do you guys see how


---------55:56----------
they're trying to argue against the


---------55:57----------
thoughts if we look at the mechanism of


---------55:59----------
mind we see that arguing against your


---------56:03----------
thoughts actually does not work and in


---------56:06----------
fact makes your anxiety


---------56:08----------
worse right this is the same problem


---------56:11----------
it's all the same thing


---------56:12----------
so then the question becomes what do we


---------56:17----------
do about that right so like if if this


---------56:19----------
is if we assume that thoughts kind of


---------56:24----------
breed other thoughts or we assume that


---------56:27----------
conflict within the mind so the other


---------56:29----------
way to describe this is tension actually


---------56:34----------
that's not this but that's so this


---------56:37----------
process here is tension so this creates


---------56:44----------
tension in the mind right when you try


---------56:46----------
to argue against yourself you get


---------56:47----------
yourself riled up and the more tension


---------56:51----------
you create the more active the mind


---------56:53----------
becomes so if we think about this you


---------56:56----------
know how do we how does the mind how can


---------57:01----------
I say come up with the right word for


---------57:02----------
this what makes the mind grow right so


---------57:14----------
we're talking about feeding so tension


---------57:18----------
makes the mind grow number one right so


---------57:22----------
this can also include I'm gonna these


---------57:24----------
are essentially synonyms but conflict


---------57:28----------
what else makes that mind girl


---------57:30----------
excitement things like fantasy so I want


---------57:38----------
you guys to think about a daydream right


---------57:40----------
a daydream is one thought leading to


---------57:42----------
another thought leading to another


---------57:43----------
thought leading to another thought and


---------57:44----------
the mind locks this and so if we think


---------57:48----------
about the the a active mind an act of


---------57:54----------
mind is not really relaxed when you


---------57:56----------
think about like fantasy your mind isn't


---------57:58----------
relaxed right it's like super excited


---------58:00----------
and it's like active super super active


---------58:02----------
when your intention when you're in


---------58:03----------
conflict when you're in worry your mind


---------58:05----------
is not relaxed and what is a relaxed


---------58:08----------
mind mean I I pause it to you guys that


---------58:11----------
a relaxed mind has fewer thoughts


---------58:22----------
so if you think about like when is your


---------58:24----------
mind relaxed okay so when does this


---------58:31----------
happen so the first thing is that if we


---------58:36----------
do this right if we find a solution that


---------58:41----------
leads to relaxation then you don't have


---------58:42----------
to worry about anymore


---------58:43----------
the amount of thoughts once you come up


---------58:45----------
with a good solution and buy a good


---------58:47----------
solution I don't mean a fictional or


---------58:50----------
fantasy solution I mean an actual


---------58:52----------
solution that calms you down leads to a


---------58:55----------
decrease in thought so when does this


---------58:57----------
happen solution number two sunset number


---------59:05----------
three shavasan okay that's that last


---------59:11----------
pose that we did after the yoga like how


---------59:14----------
active was your mind number four


---------59:16----------
meditation number five


---------59:21----------
eating a cookie with full awareness


---------59:28----------
[Music]


---------59:30----------
right so let me ask you guys something


---------59:37----------
what time frame are these things focused


---------59:42----------
on where are you


---------59:49----------
are you in the past the present or the


---------59:51----------
future cookie cleanse absolutely present


---------60:02----------
right so I want you guys to think about


---------60:05----------
this if just think about this for a


---------60:09----------
second okay if if anxiety is literally


---------60:15----------
like the definition of anxiety is to


---------60:18----------
have thoughts in the future can anxiety


---------60:21----------
exist if your mind is in the present


---------60:24----------
we're thinking about cognitive anxiety


---------60:25----------
okay literally can anxiety exist if


---------60:29----------
we're focused in the present does shower


---------60:33----------
thoughts count as a relaxed mind


---------60:34----------
absolutely Ezri can't I add gaming to


---------60:38----------
the list absolutely absolutely


---------60:41----------
[Music]


---------60:44----------
so I want you guys to think about this


---------60:46----------
right so now we're gonna talk let's talk


---------60:48----------
about gaming this is sounds crazy


---------60:52----------
so when or games fun and when are games


---------60:56----------
less fun so when you're fully engaged so


---------60:59----------
I started playing this game called deep


---------61:01----------
rock galactic which I think isn't


---------61:02----------
amazing so like yesterday there's this


---------61:05----------
thing where you have a timer and like a


---------61:06----------
timer counts down you have to like get


---------61:08----------
on a ship before the timer runs out and


---------61:10----------
like we were playing this game and like


---------61:12----------
yesterday the timer was ticking down and


---------61:15----------
we had like six seconds left and we


---------61:17----------
weren't sure if we were gonna make it


---------61:18----------
and in that moment my mind was thinking


---------61:21----------
about nothing except this moment and it


---------61:24----------
was like I started cheering it was 11:30


---------61:27----------
at night I started cheering after we


---------61:30----------
made it because one of us made it and so


---------61:32----------
the mission was successful and my wife


---------61:34----------
was like you're being really loud so


---------61:36----------
there are times when gaming makes us


---------61:39----------
live is crazy Scott sounds in the


---------61:42----------
present and I want you all to understand


---------61:45----------
this if gaming did not do this this


---------61:50----------
would not work right so if we think


---------61:54----------
about sleep drugs gaming they're able to


---------61:57----------
bring us to something like the present


---------61:59----------
when is gaming less fun when we're


---------62:02----------
thinking


---------62:03----------
about the future in the game if I'm


---------62:06----------
playing a game of League of Legends or


---------62:07----------
dota and I have someone who's feeding


---------62:09----------
why is that not fun it's because I'm


---------62:12----------
thinking about the next five minutes I'm


---------62:14----------
not thinking about now I'm thinking


---------62:16----------
about oh god they're their ADC or their


---------62:18----------
carries getting fed we're gonna lose or


---------62:21----------
my so-and-so is a [ __ ] we're gonna


---------62:23----------
lose we're gonna lose we're gonna lose


---------62:26----------
we're gonna lose I'm going to have to


---------62:28----------
sit let's look at it I'm going to have


---------62:34----------
to sit in this game for 30 minutes okay


---------62:45----------
guys let's look for where is where are


---------62:50----------
the important words give you guys a


---------62:53----------
little hint let's go back and examine


---------62:56----------
our anxiety words wait where did it go


---------63:00----------
[Music]


---------63:05----------
here we go right so what are the


---------63:09----------
important words future-oriented in self


---------63:12----------
do we see those here future-oriented


---------63:17----------
itself to this crap doesn't matter


---------63:21----------
doesn't matter doesn't matter this is


---------63:31----------
this is unhappiness of the mind so in


---------63:34----------
gaming it's actually a beautiful example


---------63:37----------
because actually if you think about you


---------63:40----------
know if you think about like meeting the


---------63:42----------
deadlines and Deepak galactic if you


---------63:44----------
don't think you're going to make it


---------63:46----------
then that is actually anxiety provoking


---------63:49----------
but there are times there are times when


---------63:51----------
you're playing a video game where your


---------63:52----------
mind is fully focused in the present


---------63:54----------
you're not actually worried about making


---------63:57----------
it you're trying to make it so I want


---------63:59----------
you guys to notice this difference


---------64:00----------
worrying about winning and trying to win


---------64:11----------
what's the difference here where are we


---------64:14----------
with this one what's the time where are


---------64:21----------
we when we're worrying about winning


---------64:25----------
what do you guys think so let's do


---------64:31----------
another poll oh sorry cancel what time


---------64:40----------
frame are you in when you are worrying


---------64:46----------
about winning asked present hey you guys


---------64:57----------
tell me right beautiful so let's do


---------65:10----------
another one


---------65:11----------
okay oh looks like I can't do another


---------65:16----------
one yet oh I can't how do I show poll


---------65:21----------
results okay so it's like 95 percent to


---------65:27----------
4 percent when where is the time frame


---------65:33----------
of your mind


---------65:34----------
when you are trying to win asked present


---------65:41----------
you guys can't see the bowl interesting


---------65:44----------
we have to learn how to do that or


---------65:46----------
display results at the end of poll I see


---------65:47----------
okay


---------65:48----------
got it fixed fixed saved see look at


---------65:54----------
that just think about that for a second


---------65:56----------
when you're trying to win a game it's a


---------65:59----------
lot of fun


---------66:00----------
when you're worried about losing it


---------66:02----------
sucks even when you know that that when


---------66:06----------
you know you've won how fun is that game


---------66:10----------
that's the next question right so let's


---------66:13----------
ask that one so


---------66:22----------
okay so now we're gonna do one more okay


---------66:29----------
what's more fun trying to win a game or


---------66:33----------
knowing that you've basically one time


---------66:38----------
to win knowing you won let's see this


---------66:46----------
one okay


---------66:49----------
see if there's difficult


---------66:52----------
some amount what do you guys think is


---------66:54----------
more fun now interesting huh now I think


---------67:03----------
the interesting thing about knowing


---------67:05----------
you've won is that a lot of times our


---------67:08----------
games have certain outcomes that we want


---------67:11----------
right like we're grinding towards


---------67:13----------
something and even if you're grinding


---------67:17----------
towards something that grinding can be


---------67:21----------
somewhat present focus which is like


---------67:23----------
it's kind of weird and you really have


---------67:24----------
to look at that


---------67:25----------
because in that moment you know the the


---------67:28----------
grind is like what you're doing and


---------67:30----------
that's why you want to win because you


---------67:31----------
want the outcome but even in that moment


---------67:33----------
you're kind of present within the frame


---------67:35----------
of Briony which is complicated but right


---------67:39----------
so there is a little bit there's a


---------67:41----------
little bit more um grinding is in the


---------67:45----------
present right grinding ing so now let's


---------67:55----------
try to kind of wrap things up and see


---------67:58----------
what we've learned okay so we haven't


---------68:00----------
really gotten a chance to talk about


---------68:01----------
physical anxiety that's the first thing


---------68:04----------
but hopefully I've convinced you guys


---------68:08----------
that anxiety first of all so let's go


---------68:10----------
through conclusion okay


---------68:12----------
number one anxiety is a normal part of


---------68:21----------
the mind gone actually let's just go


---------68:28----------
with this


---------68:29----------
I like this gone wild okay number one


---------68:36----------
number two anxiety has two components a


---------68:46----------
cognitive component and a physical


---------68:49----------
component okay


---------68:52----------
so we haven't really talked much about


---------68:54----------
physical anxiety today which is okay


---------68:55----------
we'll get to that number three is that


---------68:59----------
anxiety is future-focused


---------69:05----------
and all oftentimes has rumination or


---------69:11----------
unproductive thinking and grows with


---------69:16----------
attention okay so now my question to you


---------69:21----------
guys is what do we do about this right


---------69:29----------
so for let's think about the structure


---------69:32----------
[Music]


---------69:34----------
Wow my handwriting's man okay dr. K is


---------69:37----------
gonna take a handwriting course


---------69:40----------
structure of the anxious thought which


---------69:47----------
is I me write plus future plus specific


---------70:02----------
content based on your past experience so


---------70:13----------
I want you guys to notice this for a


---------70:15----------
second a lot of times when psychiatrists


---------70:17----------
or therapists try to help someone with


---------70:20----------
their anxiety what they actually focus


---------70:23----------
on is this right Oh tell me about why


---------70:27----------
you're worried about social anxiety just


---------70:29----------
think about this for a second we have


---------70:31----------
social anxieties a different diagnosis


---------70:33----------
from let's say a phobia yeah or a


---------70:36----------
different kind of anxiety health anxiety


---------70:38----------
social anxiety western medicine focuses


---------70:41----------
on different kinds of content in class


---------70:43----------
suffice these anxieties differently


---------70:46----------
right you guys see that this is where


---------70:49----------
western psychiatry or Western medicine


---------70:52----------
is focused what I want you guys to focus


---------70:54----------
on what the Yogi's focus on is these two


---------70:58----------
they focus on these because the cool


---------71:01----------
thing is that you can fix someone's


---------71:03----------
social anxiety and then they'll still


---------71:06----------
have health anxiety or they'll still


---------71:09----------
have impostor syndrome or any number of


---------71:14----------
other things a phobia the phobias are a


---------71:17----------
little bit different to be honest but


---------71:18----------
that's actually not a good example so


---------71:21----------
the nature of a phobia and the content


---------71:22----------
of a phobia is actually different for


---------71:23----------
anxiety No okay so impostor syndrome so


---------71:31----------
like even if we check this off the list


---------71:32----------
that we still have to do these right


---------71:36----------
this is what Western medicine does so


---------71:39----------
now I'm going to ask you guys what is


---------71:41----------
the solution to this how do we fix this


---------71:45----------
one bring mind to present okay second is


---------72:00----------
don't feed the mind so what that means


---------72:06----------
is don't argue don't even go for


---------72:09----------
reassurance no argument no reassurance


---------72:12----------
[Music]


---------72:13----------
because our mind rebelled against that


---------72:15----------
right so we want to avoid these and


---------72:18----------
we'll talk a little bit practically


---------72:20----------
about how to do that in the future the


---------72:24----------
second thing so I want you guys to see


---------72:25----------
this for a second so one is to bring


---------72:28----------
that in mind to the present so if you do


---------72:29----------
something like yoga or you do some


---------72:31----------
centering activity like this is how


---------72:33----------
meditation helps anxiety because


---------72:35----------
meditation brings your mind to the


---------72:37----------
present that's what meditation is and


---------72:39----------
therefore you can't be anxious number


---------72:42----------
two this is the next thing is to get rid


---------72:47----------
decrease the ego


---------72:52----------
this is the real answer to anxiety I


---------72:55----------
want you guys to think about this so


---------73:00----------
this is the self right so do you guys


---------73:04----------
get anxious about things that are like


---------73:06----------
like how much of your anxiety has to do


---------73:10----------
with you if you can remove you from the


---------73:13----------
equation then how much how powerful is


---------73:16----------
your anxiety I'll give you guys an


---------73:17----------
example so let's say that I go to class


---------73:20----------
and I'm ice I start to say something and


---------73:23----------
then I'm afraid that these people are


---------73:25----------
gonna think that I'm an idiot


---------73:26----------
and let's say that you're in a room of


---------73:28----------
random strangers who you're never gonna


---------73:29----------
see again are you less likely to speak


---------73:34----------
with the strangers are more likely to


---------73:36----------
speak with the strangers right so if you


---------73:39----------
can remove your sense of self from the


---------73:42----------
equation if you don't have to worry


---------73:43----------
about your ego and what people are gonna


---------73:45----------
think about you then your anxiety goes


---------73:47----------
down right okay so let's think about


---------73:52----------
this um let me okay if you guys want to


---------73:57----------
pull it that's fine let's pull it let's


---------74:02----------
do this okay are you more worried about


---------74:06----------
[Music]


---------74:09----------
looking stupid in front people you're


---------74:15----------
going to see again or people who you


---------74:18----------
will never see again


---------74:20----------
[Music]


---------74:25----------
[Music]


---------74:28----------
I pull it


---------74:32----------
let's see no gotta hit another button


---------74:57----------
excellent question to poll see so this


---------75:07----------
gets tricky we can explore it further


---------75:16----------
right so like like like or do you feel


---------75:18----------
more comfortable when you're so here's


---------75:20----------
the other way to put it like so to think


---------75:21----------
about the ego is do you feel more


---------75:23----------
comfortable when you're anonymous right


---------75:27----------
why do people with social anxiety


---------75:29----------
function better on the internet and


---------75:31----------
behind computer screens and away from


---------75:32----------
other people it's because they can


---------75:34----------
protect that they can isolate their ego


---------75:36----------
or sense of self this is why anonymity


---------75:39----------
[Music]


---------75:42----------
this is why anonymity is protective so


---------75:50----------
the other thing that you can do is you


---------75:52----------
can so one ways anonymity is a way to


---------75:55----------
like cover the self but the other thing


---------75:57----------
that you can do is you can sort of start


---------75:58----------
to dissolve the ego right and in the way


---------76:02----------
that you dissolve the ego this is when


---------76:03----------
we talk about meditation we're gonna


---------76:04----------
have to have we're gonna have a whole


---------76:05----------
day on ego or more than one day you can


---------76:07----------
do a whole semester on ego if you want


---------76:09----------
to but basically like I want you guys to


---------76:12----------
think about someone who's confident is


---------76:15----------
someone who is less likely to be


---------76:17----------
influenced by the opinion of others and


---------76:19----------
so they actually their ego goes down and


---------76:22----------
as their ego goes down they're less


---------76:24----------
anxious because the opinions of other


---------76:27----------
people's don't kind of matter to them so


---------76:31----------
in terms of what to do about it this is


---------76:32----------
the first thing that I want you guys to


---------76:34----------
focus on is if you can bring your mind


---------76:36----------
to the present literally anxiety cannot


---------76:38----------
exist physical anxiety is different I'm


---------76:42----------
talking about cognitive anxiety so if


---------76:44----------
your mind is in the present you cannot


---------76:46----------
be anxious that is like a fact and I


---------76:49----------
encourage you guys so in my opinion it's


---------76:51----------
not a fact it's my opinion and I


---------76:54----------
encourage you guys to test that and see


---------76:57----------
for yourself whether you can be anxious


---------77:00----------
while you are in the present and if you


---------77:03----------
are in the present because we think


---------77:04----------
about this way right so remember that


---------77:05----------
being in the present is this is what we


---------77:10----------
kind of call


---------77:11----------
all this stuff is relaxing you guys see


---------77:14----------
that anything that is present is going


---------77:16----------
to be relaxing and can you be anxious


---------77:17----------
while you're relaxed it's kind of like


---------77:19----------
an oxymoron so I encourage you guys to


---------77:24----------
examine this and let's even think about


---------77:28----------
eating a cookie like so if I eat a


---------77:29----------
cookie and I can just sit and enjoy the


---------77:32----------
cookie then it's fine if I eat a cookie


---------77:33----------
and I'm worried about gaining weight and


---------77:35----------
that this is gonna make me look fat then


---------77:37----------
it's not fun


---------77:38----------
take whatever example you want to look a


---------77:40----------
sauce salmon yourself see what you


---------77:42----------
discover we're gonna do questions okay


---------77:47----------
so let's start with I don't know how to


---------77:50----------
specify people but we're gonna actually


---------77:52----------
start with questions about how what's


---------77:58----------
your question let's do so okay so


---------78:01----------
Raymond we're gonna start with you buddy


---------78:03----------
let's see if this works I've clicked a


---------78:09----------
checkbox okay so one of the pieces of


---------78:21----------
feedback that we got is that we want one


---------78:23----------
question at a time all right Raymond


---------78:27----------
talk to me buddy hello


---------78:45----------
okay all right I'm gonna fit


---------78:51----------
Felipe Rico and one teen you guys up for


---------78:56----------
questions cuz I don't hear Raymond ah


---------79:03----------
[Music]


---------79:15----------
okay oh I see so I see that there's a


---------79:18----------
button for audio got it hello hey


---------79:24----------
Raymond


---------79:24----------
oh I can't hear Raymond I can't hear you


---------79:31----------
buddy


---------79:32----------
Raymond you have to turn the microphone


---------79:33----------
button on on the top somebody's speaking


---------79:39----------
it's not you all right all right who's


---------79:47----------
speaking do you have a man yeah hello


---------79:50----------
hey food babe oh yeah hi so when we were


---------79:55----------
talking before sorry I have stuff


---------79:57----------
written down you talked about the first


---------79:59----------
two parts about that sorry my webcam


---------80:02----------
messed up we're talking about that I


---------80:04----------
that I will and then we were talking


---------80:07----------
about the part where we're thinking


---------80:09----------
about in the future and you said that we


---------80:12----------
didn't want to seek reassurance about


---------80:14----------
our thoughts because we'd be fighting


---------80:16----------
against that and create more thoughts


---------80:17----------
but how do I fix my assumption about


---------80:21----------
like for example when we were talking


---------80:22----------
about all of this I was thinking about a


---------80:24----------
situation about me thinking that my


---------80:26----------
roommate doesn't like me as much as the


---------80:29----------
other roommates and if I don't get


---------80:31----------
reassurance that my roommate likes me as


---------80:33----------
much which i think is probably true I'm


---------80:34----------
just being very anxious about it how do


---------80:37----------
I fix the anxiety if I don't get


---------80:40----------
reassurance about it so let me ask you


---------80:43----------
something when you get reassurance about


---------80:45----------
it


---------80:45----------
what does it do to your anxiety oh my


---------80:47----------
god my web comes messing up the when I


---------80:51----------
get reassurance about it logically it


---------80:53----------
would help my anxiety because if she


---------80:55----------
says that's not what I'm asking you I'm


---------80:57----------
asking you what does it do to your


---------80:59----------
anxiety what it does to my anxiety is it


---------81:02----------
probably creates more thoughts no I'm


---------81:05----------
asking you so when so you know you're


---------81:06----------
concerned that your roommate doesn't


---------81:08----------
like you yeah have you sought


---------81:10----------
reassurance about this in the past no


---------81:12----------
this is just a thing that came up today


---------81:13----------
so that's why I was relating about it


---------81:15----------
when you okay have you been anxious


---------81:18----------
about something before yes and what when


---------81:22----------
someone reassures you what does that do


---------81:24----------
to your anxiety


---------81:27----------
it depends on the situation I guess in a


---------81:28----------
lot of cases my anxiety doesn't believe


---------81:31----------
them and then I think about reasons why


---------81:33----------
there may be to be telling me this to


---------81:34----------
make me feel better


---------81:35----------
and yeah it's a big thought loop yep I


---------81:38----------
guess it depends on the situation as


---------81:40----------
well I don't think that's the universal


---------81:41----------
thing across anxiety so give me an


---------81:44----------
example of where reassurance helps you


---------81:46----------
like in this room a kiss I feel like


---------81:48----------
that would help not one that could


---------81:50----------
happen like when that has happened maybe


---------81:57----------
me going to a lecturer talking about a


---------82:00----------
grade and saying I'm not I I'm anxious


---------82:04----------
about this exam because I don't think


---------82:05----------
I'm prepared enough and I talked to the


---------82:07----------
lecture and the lecture then explains to


---------82:09----------
me about how according to him I had been


---------82:12----------
prepared and then talks to me through


---------82:13----------
all of that and that maybe helps me has


---------82:16----------
that helped you in the past yes okay


---------82:19----------
so I think that that is different


---------82:21----------
because what that so I know this sounds


---------82:23----------
crazy but when we say reassurance I want


---------82:26----------
you to understand that reassurance is


---------82:28----------
not what the outside world gives you


---------82:31----------
because in both cases you're saying that


---------82:33----------
someone from the outside tries to


---------82:35----------
reassure you right yeah someone says


---------82:37----------
okay you're gonna do fine on the test


---------82:40----------
and someone else says okay you're


---------82:41----------
actually a really smart person even


---------82:44----------
though the signals from the outside are


---------82:45----------
exactly the same in one case it fuels


---------82:48----------
your anxiety and in another case it


---------82:50----------
doesn't feel your anxiety yeah does that


---------82:52----------
make sense so the first thing that we


---------82:54----------
need to understand is that that has


---------82:55----------
nothing to do with the outside because


---------82:57----------
if the outside is giving us the same


---------82:58----------
thing and our response is differential


---------83:00----------
oh that makes that it's not coming from


---------83:03----------
the outside it's coming from here that


---------83:04----------
makes a lot of sense right so then the


---------83:06----------
question is what is different in here


---------83:09----------
and I think in some cases what's


---------83:11----------
different is the way that your mind is


---------83:12----------
okay


---------83:13----------
this makes sense cuz it's it can be like


---------83:15----------
your confidence that is different as


---------83:17----------
well because if I'm not confident like


---------83:19----------
if inside maybe I do think I'm smart I


---------83:22----------
do think I do well in a test and I am


---------83:24----------
more confident about that then when I


---------83:25----------
hear the reassurance it will help me


---------83:28----------
confirm maybe my own thoughts that I was


---------83:30----------
like confirm my confidence but then when


---------83:33----------
other situations maybe if I'm internally


---------83:35----------
not confident and my ego is gonna be


---------83:36----------
damaged maybe if a girl doesn't like me


---------83:38----------
or something then it


---------83:40----------
well it won't actually help because my


---------83:42----------
ego will be fighting against it so I


---------83:44----------
think that that's possible so what I


---------83:46----------
would encourage you to do Felipe is to


---------83:48----------
examine this the main thing so remember


---------83:50----------
we're not talking about I mean we're


---------83:52----------
talking about individual situations as


---------83:54----------
examples to understand principles all


---------83:57----------
right now we're talking about today is


---------83:59----------
not solving for the equation of a


---------84:01----------
particular line we're trying to figure


---------84:04----------
out y equals MX plus B we're trying to


---------84:06----------
figure out one of the variables and I'm


---------84:08----------
telling you that if two people in


---------84:10----------
separate situations give you reassurance


---------84:12----------
and then one that helps your anxiety and


---------84:14----------
in another it doesn't help your anxiety


---------84:16----------
it doesn't have anything to do with the


---------84:17----------
outside it has to do with the inset okay


---------84:19----------
the next thing is is I want you to and I


---------84:23----------
want you to think about remember that


---------84:24----------
there are two problem-solving routes


---------84:26----------
right one is anxiety what's the other


---------84:28----------
one I mean I sort of said it but do you


---------84:30----------
remember the two diagrams well the the


---------84:33----------
oh yeah once the problem solving so it


---------84:35----------
goes from the like you have the problem


---------84:37----------
and you have a solution and then there's


---------84:39----------
anxiety thought loop right so the


---------84:41----------
question is when you sit down with a


---------84:42----------
professor which mode of operation does


---------84:45----------
your mind move into okay I'm going to


---------84:47----------
the problem solving so you have to tell


---------84:50----------
me


---------84:50----------
don't hypothesize yeah any logic go and


---------84:54----------
study it I guess I think what your


---------84:56----------
professor does is walks you through the


---------84:58----------
problem-solving group loca which then


---------85:01----------
relaxes the mind okay great question


---------85:04----------
okay


---------85:05----------
no a thank you so much all right let's


---------85:07----------
see if we've got rain I'm gonna give you


---------85:08----------
the boot okay fully bad how are you by


---------85:11----------
Raymond no one no sorry buddy okay we're


---------85:21----------
gonna invite a couple more people I know


---------85:23----------
you guys say one person at a time but


---------85:25----------
like because of these technical


---------85:26----------
difficulties can you hear me yep who is


---------85:29----------
that


---------85:29----------
this is one okay I'm gonna invite Reece


---------85:32----------
someone else and Victor just why we've


---------85:36----------
got one on the question go ahead one


---------85:39----------
okay so my question is kind of big can a


---------85:42----------
philosophical but I feel like this


---------85:46----------
affects my anxiety my motivation pretty


---------85:50----------
much everything about myself how do I


---------85:53----------
deal with


---------85:54----------
pessimism and like challenging like big


---------85:57----------
worldviews like so I'm a little nervous


---------86:01----------
like a like biological determinism like


---------86:07----------
being afraid that like I'm capable of


---------86:09----------
change okay so so once again I'm not


---------86:16----------
gonna answer the content of your


---------86:18----------
question because like you said that's a


---------86:20----------
big question and instead what I'm gonna


---------86:22----------
do is we're gonna look at the mechanism


---------86:25----------
of your question yeah okay so let's


---------86:28----------
start by a second okay let's let's try


---------86:36----------
to examine your thoughts so tell me a


---------86:39----------
little bit more about what what is that


---------86:40----------
I don't understand what you mean what


---------86:45----------
did you understand like what you say


---------86:47----------
like I have you know this philosophical


---------86:49----------
something rather can you say can you say


---------86:51----------
that again I don't know what that means


---------86:54----------
so what what I mean by pessimism that I


---------87:06----------
am incapable of change and incapable of


---------87:09----------
overcome anxiety I am incapable of


---------87:16----------
change right so let's think about what


---------87:20----------
is the tense of your statement aspirin


---------87:25----------
is incorrect hmm oh I suppose yeah I


---------87:33----------
suppose I'm incapable changed in the


---------87:35----------
teacher exactly right so now we have to


---------87:38----------
be tricky we have to be careful because


---------87:40----------
the mind is tricky and just because


---------87:41----------
you're using a verb in the present tense


---------87:44----------
does not mean that this is in the


---------87:46----------
present tense right are you saying


---------87:49----------
sitting there and you're saying that I


---------87:50----------
am incapable of change that's not what


---------87:54----------
you're saying what you're really I think


---------87:56----------
what this really is is I'm afraid I'm


---------88:02----------
never going to


---------88:07----------
change yeah what do you think is that


---------88:12----------
what that's correct because because


---------88:15----------
here's the thing like I I know this is


---------88:16----------
gonna sound I know this is gonna sound


---------88:19----------
crazy but so sometimes you know I I work


---------88:22----------
with patients with cancer really


---------88:24----------
fascinating in terms of like


---------88:26----------
understanding the mind so I'm going to


---------88:31----------
die how do you think this person feels


---------88:37----------
once when a terminal cancer patient


---------88:40----------
understands that they're going to die


---------88:42----------
how do you think they feel um I guess it


---------88:46----------
depends on how they feel about death


---------88:48----------
right mm-hmm


---------88:51----------
so they could be accepting they could be


---------88:55----------
scared


---------88:55----------
sure so so I know this is gonna sound


---------89:00----------
crazy but what is the tense of this


---------89:04----------
statement future incorrect dammit I know


---------89:11----------
it sounds bizarre but it's not it like


---------89:14----------
it's not it's because this looks like a


---------89:17----------
future statement right so I just I need


---------89:18----------
to explain a little bit so sometimes I


---------89:21----------
talk to a cancer patient who recognizes


---------89:24----------
and accepts that death is inevitable for


---------89:26----------
that and bizarrely when they recognize


---------89:30----------
that truth that is a truth that comes


---------89:32----------
from the present it's not actually like


---------89:34----------
a fear of the future it's not even in


---------89:36----------
the future it's like an acceptance in


---------89:38----------
the now that death is inevitable does


---------89:40----------
that make sense yeah and bizarrely that


---------89:43----------
this leads to peace it's bizarre it's


---------89:47----------
the weirdest thing but when someone


---------89:50----------
accepts in the present that's something


---------89:52----------
that some action is inevitable they


---------89:54----------
actually like relax because it's that


---------89:58----------
boat has sailed


---------89:59----------
you can lament it you can grieve so


---------90:01----------
they're gonna grieve they're gonna be


---------90:03----------
sad they're gonna be filled with lament


---------90:06----------
maybe some amount of regret but


---------90:08----------
underneath it all there's still peace


---------90:10----------
who is bizarre yeah okay so so that's I


---------90:15----------
mean that's sort of a random aside I


---------90:17----------
just I don't know exactly I mean


---------90:19----------
hopefully that was helpful for people I


---------90:20----------
felt like that was


---------90:21----------
I'm not exactly sure why so let's go


---------90:23----------
back to this okay so now you tell me and


---------90:27----------
it's it's is it one yes great okay so


---------90:31----------
one so when you say like what do we do


---------90:32----------
about this you tell me like what there


---------90:34----------
what are our solutions right so like you


---------90:38----------
say like I'm never gonna change you also


---------90:39----------
said some other stuff about the planet


---------90:41----------
right


---------90:41----------
yeah like well I mean I believe that the


---------90:47----------
universe is biologically determined ok


---------90:50----------
biological determinism fine what else


---------90:53----------
what other kind of pessimistic thoughts


---------90:55----------
you have I mean I think it all really


---------90:58----------
stems from there okay sure so oh you


---------91:02----------
know what in the purpose for the purpose


---------91:04----------
of this seminar you know what we're


---------91:06----------
gonna do is we're gonna take this and we


---------91:07----------
don't actually care about that we don't


---------91:09----------
care about that either what are you


---------91:12----------
gonna do so what do you what do you do


---------91:15----------
about fear


---------91:16----------
sure in general like how should you


---------91:19----------
approach this problem right because you


---------91:23----------
get that if I start talking to you about


---------91:24----------
biological determinism this is gonna be


---------91:26----------
intellectual masturbation for an hour


---------91:28----------
and you're not gonna get anywhere yeah


---------91:30----------
does that make sense cuz you've done it


---------91:31----------
before does that make sense


---------91:33----------
right doing that exactly so that's not


---------91:38----------
where your answer lies and this is


---------91:41----------
bizarre because like I said in


---------91:43----------
psychiatry we focus on the content of


---------91:45----------
the mind and in general we think that


---------91:48----------
solutions are external and like


---------91:50----------
content-based like I don't know how else


---------91:52----------
to say that like it's a kind of a weird


---------91:54----------
segment I don't even know how many


---------91:55----------
people are going to understand it but


---------91:56----------
like we think that the solution to you


---------91:59----------
know climate change is in the outside


---------92:00----------
world which obviously it is but also


---------92:03----------
like anxiety about climate change can


---------92:07----------
somewhat come from the outside world but


---------92:09----------
also like I want you to think about this


---------92:10----------
if you're worried about climate change


---------92:12----------
you know you can act like I can go


---------92:15----------
outside and plant a tree every day but


---------92:17----------
that person is not living in the future


---------92:19----------
that person is living in the present


---------92:20----------
they're addressing the problem of


---------92:22----------
climate change even though they don't


---------92:24----------
know if it's going to work they don't


---------92:25----------
know if it's enough or the corporations


---------92:27----------
will screw them or whatever they're


---------92:28----------
going out every day and they're planting


---------92:29----------
a tree they're doing their part there's


---------92:31----------
immense peace and that and there is


---------92:32----------
immense problem-solving about does that


---------92:35----------
make sense


---------92:35----------
yeah totally what am i doing now exactly


---------92:39----------
so that is what I'm saying is that


---------92:41----------
irrespective of what the problem is you


---------92:44----------
know it's not that a particular solution


---------92:45----------
because someone can be worried about


---------92:47----------
climate change and they can be worried


---------92:48----------
about corporate pollution so they can be


---------92:49----------
worried about cruise ships or you know


---------92:52----------
insufficient like carbon like moving to


---------92:54----------
renewable energy or like you know


---------92:56----------
hitting a tipping point of greenhouse


---------92:58----------
gases or like you know sea levels rising


---------93:01----------
or like all kinds of stuff you could be


---------93:03----------
photos or all that crap


---------93:04----------
all that crap can be anxiety provoking


---------93:05----------
you can also get data that's reassuring


---------93:08----------
and those people saying that those


---------93:09----------
people's anxieties will still remain do


---------93:11----------
you see that like it's just what Felipe


---------93:15----------
was saying about the external world can


---------93:17----------
give you reassurance and you can just


---------93:19----------
say screw that reassurance I'm not


---------93:20----------
interested so I'm asking you where does


---------93:22----------
your solution lie yeah incorrect dealing


---------93:34----------
with that fear is wrong hmm right that


---------93:39----------
fear is this do you understand that that


---------93:43----------
fear is a specific fear it's actually


---------93:45----------
incorrect sorry to say so I'm being a


---------93:49----------
little bit blunt with you by the way


---------93:51----------
sure right so we're sir where's our


---------93:54----------
solution man what have we been focusing


---------93:55----------
on what words Oh being the present yes


---------94:03----------
right so in the present so when you


---------94:06----------
worry about biological determinism what


---------94:08----------
are you worried about


---------94:09----------
like his determinism is about the past


---------94:11----------
present or future the future absolutely


---------94:16----------
and then the other thing is I write you


---------94:19----------
feel like I'm incapable so I think what


---------94:21----------
you need to work on is AI and being in


---------94:24----------
the present because determinism is like


---------94:26----------
I'm gonna be screwed down the road like


---------94:28----------
there's nothing I can do about it fine


---------94:30----------
so then why don't you gonna do today


---------94:31----------
like forget about the future what are


---------94:34----------
you gonna do today one


---------94:39----------
try to make changes what are you going


---------94:44----------
to change today what I think about where


---------94:55----------
is a kink in the present how do you do


---------94:58----------
that I'm asking you literally what are


---------95:00----------
you going to do today so what part of


---------95:02----------
the world are you in Washington


---------95:06----------
okay so you're in Washington so it's


---------95:10----------
like what like 8:30 in the morning for


---------95:13----------
you yep


---------95:14----------
so what are you going to do after the


---------95:16----------
webinar ends okay and after meditation


---------95:22----------
what are you gonna do I was gonna rather


---------95:27----------
to-do list okay and then after that what


---------95:30----------
are you gonna do are you gonna study or


---------95:39----------
not study okay so what about biological


---------95:47----------
determinism what is biologic like what


---------95:52----------
is biological determinism have to do


---------95:53----------
about anything that you just said well I


---------95:59----------
think it has everything to do with it


---------96:01----------
why I mean because there are certain


---------96:12----------
factors in my life based on past


---------96:15----------
experiences that bring me to carry out


---------96:18----------
these actions I disagree so you're


---------96:23----------
telling me that you're gonna meditate


---------96:24----------
like yeah I don't I don't see how


---------96:27----------
biological determinism has anything to


---------96:29----------
do with meditation I don't see how


---------96:31----------
biological determinism has anything to


---------96:32----------
do with writing a task list and I don't


---------96:35----------
think I don't see how biological


---------96:36----------
determinism has anything to do with


---------96:39----------
actually sitting down and cracking a


---------96:40----------
textbook in a sense obviously it does


---------96:43----------
because when you study you're gonna have


---------96:45----------
a particular IQ and depending on your IQ


---------96:48----------
and depending on X Y Z and depending on


---------96:50----------
ABC the results


---------96:52----------
your study studying will be different


---------96:54----------
and if you want to say that biological


---------96:56----------
determinism has something to do with the


---------96:58----------
results of your actions by all means if


---------97:00----------
I say that I'm gonna jump if I'm gonna


---------97:04----------
stand up and jump up and down after I'm


---------97:06----------
done with this webinar biological


---------97:08----------
determinism determines how high I jump


---------97:11----------
but it has nothing to do with whether I


---------97:13----------
jump or whether I don't drive does that


---------97:16----------
make sense yeah makes sense but I feel I


---------97:22----------
feel differently I understand that so


---------97:25----------
you need to start trying it this way and


---------97:28----------
see what happens because I don't think


---------97:31----------
that biological determinism has anything


---------97:33----------
to do with making a to-do list that just


---------97:37----------
feels so far-fetched to me


---------97:38----------
okay let's actually let's do this okay


---------97:41----------
let's see so we're gonna do a poll does


---------97:45----------
my illogical determinism have anything


---------97:49----------
to do with making a to-do list let's


---------98:02----------
find out now I think the real question


---------98:05----------
here is how hard am I about to get


---------98:06----------
trolled alrighty so I I know you feel


---------98:25----------
that way I'm not telling you to feel a


---------98:26----------
different way what I'm telling you to do


---------98:28----------
is collect data yeah so don't I can't


---------98:32----------
thank you through to this solution I


---------98:34----------
want you to just stop and just like do


---------98:37----------
the things that you are saying you're


---------98:38----------
gonna do in the moment so meditate make


---------98:40----------
a to-do list and crack open a textbook


---------98:42----------
or whatever you have to do study take


---------98:44----------
those three actions and do that a couple


---------98:48----------
more times a couple more times a couple


---------98:50----------
more times and are you incapable of


---------98:52----------
change I have no [ __ ] idea


---------98:53----------
maybe you're gonna change maybe you


---------98:54----------
won't I don't think that change is


---------98:56----------
actually thing change is impossible


---------98:57----------
change is literally a a fiction of the


---------99:02----------
mind that is philosophy to which we can


---------99:06----------
intellectual


---------99:06----------
masturbate about but I want you to do


---------99:08----------
these things and I think that your


---------99:11----------
answer still remains here in here and as


---------99:15----------
long as you're working over here like


---------99:17----------
nothing is gonna happen yeah if you


---------99:20----------
start acting because action happens in


---------99:22----------
the present if you start predicting the


---------99:24----------
consequences of your actions that's file


---------99:26----------
logical determinism whether I jump or


---------99:29----------
not is not biological determinism how


---------99:32----------
high I jump is biological determinism


---------99:35----------
those are two entirely different things


---------99:37----------
but action happens in the present


---------99:39----------
consequences of action happens in the


---------99:41----------
future it's a really really difficult


---------99:44----------
concept because it's so simple in the


---------99:47----------
mind does not like it the other thing is


---------99:50----------
you know you say that I am incapable so


---------99:53----------
like where do you get your sense of I


---------99:55----------
and I would guess that it comes from


---------99:57----------
your mind instead of like other kinds of


---------99:59----------
experiences so there's the other thing


---------100:00----------
is all we can think about confidence and


---------100:02----------
stuff like that if you wake up and you


---------100:03----------
focus on the action day after day you


---------100:05----------
check things off your to-do list


---------100:06----------
generally speaking your feeling about


---------100:08----------
yourself would change and that we sort


---------100:12----------
of but you can't understand that until


---------100:14----------
you do it so focused on what you're


---------100:16----------
gonna do after the webinar and good luck


---------100:18----------
buddy giving you the boot okay sure


---------100:22----------
thanks all right one more question and I


---------100:26----------

---------100:43----------
peace


---------100:54----------
yeah I mean I just read some comments


---------100:59----------
I'm not trying to be I'm not trying to


---------101:03----------
be hey I mean I realize I come across as


---------101:05----------
arrogant but it's really a pressure of


---------101:07----------
time right so you guys watch twitch


---------101:08----------
streaming and like I have time with


---------101:15----------
people to walk them through things into


---------101:17----------
extreme right so like here I'm a little


---------101:19----------
bit more of a you know I'm like no


---------101:22----------
that's incorrect because we don't have


---------101:24----------
time to walk you through it right let's


---------101:27----------
just get to the right answer so I


---------101:32----------
apologize if I'm hurting anyone's


---------101:33----------
feelings it's really not my intended I


---------101:34----------
wish I had you know another hour to


---------101:36----------
explain I mean that's why I love that's


---------101:38----------
why we started with twitch streaming so


---------101:39----------
we can have like an hour to take someone


---------101:42----------
like Juan and talk him through his ideas


---------101:44----------
of biological determinism and the


---------101:46----------
present and stuff like that yeah we're


---------101:51----------
still streaming in a couple of hours


---------101:52----------
okay I don't know why we can't get


---------101:55----------
anyone else okay


---------101:56----------
Oh max has joined the room beautiful max


---------102:05----------
Raymond has left the room


---------102:09----------
[Music]


---------102:16----------
what is the consensus behind determinism


---------102:19----------
I have no idea yeah III we're gonna do


---------102:25----------
thermo I'm trying to decide between


---------102:27----------
talking about procrastination Dharma


---------102:30----------
meditation or dealing with covin in


---------102:33----------
isolation and how to talk to people who


---------102:36----------
you're isolated with it's tricky ok


---------102:39----------
let's do that let's do Paul while we're


---------102:40----------
waiting I invited it like a bunch of


---------102:43----------
people max are you dzifa dar Viktor Sam


---------102:49----------
we're gonna get one more question


---------102:52----------
let's pull you here me yep what's your


---------102:56----------
question buddy uh thanks for doing this


---------102:59----------
man I've been watching all your stuff


---------103:02----------
for probably a few months now and I love


---------103:06----------
it and I thank you for the yoga this


---------103:08----------
morning too um so I used to be in the


---------103:11----------
military and I got out in 2017 mm-hmm


---------103:16----------
and I'm currently a student but I feel


---------103:20----------
like I'm really struggling with the


---------103:22----------
identity portion and it's it's kind of


---------103:25----------
like preventing me from being present at


---------103:29----------
all times and I also have like a lot of


---------103:33----------
anxiety about because I'm trying to


---------103:34----------
career change um I haven't I just have a


---------103:39----------
like a mountain of like things that are


---------103:42----------
causing anxiety like I'm not gonna be


---------103:45----------
able to pass college or I'm not gonna be


---------103:47----------
able to like right now I I'm fearing


---------103:49----------
that I'm gonna fail this class or like


---------103:51----------
and the next one's gonna be like I'm a


---------103:54----------
I'm applying to jobs and everybody's you


---------103:56----------
know nobody's hiring me um so am I gonna


---------104:00----------
have my next career so it's just like it


---------104:06----------
can be really hard to like be present


---------104:09----------
when you when you're having all those


---------104:11----------
thoughts sure and I want to know like


---------104:15----------
can I Center in on like a new identity


---------104:19----------
for myself because I I was from 18 to 32


---------104:23----------
now I was 30 years old I was always a


---------104:26----------
military guy and that was my


---------104:29----------
was my identity and now my my kind of


---------104:32----------
world is like completely dissolved kind


---------104:37----------
of yeah so you know max I think my


---------104:44----------
answer may be a little bit unsatisfying


---------104:46----------
to you but I'll do the best that I can


---------104:49----------
in the time that we have left okay so


---------104:52----------
the first thing is that you know I think


---------104:53----------
so this is why this is exactly why I


---------104:59----------
structured this talk on anxiety in this


---------105:02----------
way because here's the the basic problem


---------105:05----------
is that when you look at your anxiety


---------105:06----------
you say I'm worried about X Y Z I'm


---------105:08----------
worried about ABC I'm worried about de f


---------105:11----------
other people are worried about GHI


---------105:14----------
people are worried about all kinds of


---------105:16----------
things you're worried about are you


---------105:17----------
gonna be able to find a job are you


---------105:19----------
gonna be able to like land in this new


---------105:21----------
world with this new identity you know


---------105:25----------
those are all of the questions that you


---------105:27----------
have and the reason that I think that


---------105:29----------
talking about the process of how anxiety


---------105:32----------
works is because the content actually


---------105:34----------
doesn't matter because if you can learn


---------105:36----------
how to be in the present and you can


---------105:39----------
focus on on dissolving your ego which we


---------105:41----------
can talk more about then it doesn't


---------105:43----------
matter what's on the other side of the


---------105:45----------
equation it doesn't matter what you're


---------105:46----------
actually anxious about because you can


---------105:48----------
literally learn how to turn off your


---------105:50----------
anxiety and like function on that day


---------105:53----------
and I think that's ultimately what you


---------105:56----------
have to do because the other thing to


---------105:57----------
think about is that you don't have the


---------106:00----------
capability and I know this sounds


---------106:01----------
bizarre you don't have the capability of


---------106:04----------
actually determining whether you're


---------106:06----------
gonna be successful in the world or not


---------106:09----------
what do you think about that um yeah I


---------106:14----------
feel like that's probably true so tell


---------106:17----------
me what you are what is yours to control


---------106:19----------
and what is not yours to control my


---------106:26----------
actions I can control my actions and


---------106:32----------
what can you not control


---------106:35----------
the results of those actions okay so


---------106:39----------
you're afraid that you're not going to


---------106:41----------
be able to make the transition to a


---------106:43----------
civilian right yeah and have a second


---------106:48----------
career and have a second career can you


---------106:50----------
control whether you have a second career


---------106:52----------
or not no how does that make you feel


---------106:58----------
um well I really value the ability you


---------107:04----------
know I love working I loved working in


---------107:07----------
the military and I really I guess I


---------107:13----------
wouldn't I feel like it would be not


---------107:17----------
living up to potential type of deal if I


---------107:22----------
didn't get another job or a career sure


---------107:27----------
right so I want you to notice those are


---------107:29----------
that so there therein lies the problem


---------107:31----------
so there's a part of you that worries


---------107:34----------
about living up to your potential so


---------107:36----------
I'll tell you another thing potential is


---------107:37----------
false it's a false concept of the mind


---------107:40----------
so I want you guys to think about this


---------107:42----------
for a second okay


---------107:43----------
so what exists and that's the kind of


---------107:50----------
weird question what exists yes or I


---------107:59----------
don't know our present mind and body


---------108:02----------
absolutely perfectly correct so


---------108:06----------
potential is not a real thing right the


---------108:08----------
only thing that exists is reality


---------108:10----------
in reality is now regular right now if I


---------108:15----------
were to ask you like if I were to take a


---------108:17----------
measurement anywhere in the world of


---------108:19----------
anything that measurement could only be


---------108:22----------
taken in the present does that make


---------108:23----------
sense the only thing that we can measure


---------108:27----------
is this this world this moment this


---------108:32----------
reality and and so you you're getting


---------108:36----------
caught up about the future and you're


---------108:37----------
worried about not living up to your


---------108:38----------
potential where it's like you actually


---------108:40----------
have no control over what your potential


---------108:42----------
is potential is a falsity the only thing


---------108:44----------
that exists is what is right right so


---------108:48----------
like it when it


---------108:49----------
like become having a successful career I


---------108:51----------
hate to break it to you buddy that is


---------108:52----------
not that is not your choice and that is


---------108:55----------
not something you can control what you


---------108:58----------
can control is like going back to school


---------109:00----------
so you said you're a student right yes


---------109:02----------
so that I think is wonderful right


---------109:06----------
because you're actually huh um being


---------109:10----------
online though it's very hard to be have


---------109:14----------
that identity though it's like for me I


---------109:17----------
have to be around people that share the


---------109:20----------
same you know mind set and like goals so


---------109:26----------
I was thinking about this yesterday's


---------109:28----------
like maybe I just need to force myself


---------109:30----------
to get on campus more even though I'm


---------109:31----------
I'm pretty much 100% oh I am now because


---------109:34----------
of coronavirus but I'm always a hundred


---------109:38----------
percent online but I I mean yeah I


---------109:42----------
wouldn't right down the road from the


---------109:44----------
campus so so I want you to just notice


---------109:46----------
the tense of that statement right so you


---------109:49----------
say like I need to be around people who


---------109:51----------
like share a common goal with me yeah


---------109:54----------
that's not about future or present I


---------109:57----------
mean or past it's about present that's


---------109:59----------
just an attribute of who you are that is


---------110:01----------
part of your identity your identity is


---------110:04----------
not military or student your identity is


---------110:06----------
like human being who enjoys sharing in


---------110:09----------
goals with other human beings yes India


---------110:12----------
like that's true yeah and so as long as


---------110:14----------
you're not living in alignment to that


---------110:17----------
you're gonna feel like you don't even


---------110:19----------
have an identity it's not that you don't


---------110:21----------
have an identity it's that you're not


---------110:22----------
aligned with who you are yes and as long


---------110:26----------
as you're not doing something that's


---------110:27----------
aligned with who you are like if you're


---------110:28----------
an artist and someone sticks you in an


---------110:30----------
accounting firm you're gonna feel like


---------110:32----------
you don't know what your identity is


---------110:34----------
even though you know what your identity


---------110:34----------
is you're just not aligned with it so I


---------110:36----------
think you need to live a life that is


---------110:38----------
aligned with who you are and I think you


---------110:40----------
know more about who you are than you


---------110:41----------
realize and who you are is not


---------110:43----------
determined by your profession it does


---------110:47----------
it's not determined by your career


---------110:48----------
career is just like something that you


---------110:49----------
slap on your resume and it's a way that


---------110:51----------
hopefully money gets into your bank


---------110:52----------
account right so like there's a


---------110:55----------
difference between being a graphic


---------110:56----------
designer and like being someone who


---------110:58----------
creates things that are cool to look at


---------111:00----------
like one is a job and one


---------111:03----------
like who you are so in my case like I'm


---------111:07----------
someone who talks with people and tries


---------111:09----------
to help them that's who I am you guys


---------111:12----------
can call it whatever you want you I


---------111:13----------
could have been a priest I could have


---------111:14----------
been a psychiatrist I could have been


---------111:16----------
whatever doesn't matter


---------111:19----------
like am i a psychiatrist right now not


---------111:22----------
really no you're talking to me yeah


---------111:25----------
that's who I am


---------111:27----------
and who are you right now yeah I'm


---------111:31----------
realizing that I just need to align with


---------111:34----------
who are you right now I'm talking to you


---------111:38----------
right now yeah that's it that's all you


---------111:40----------
are


---------111:40----------
Yeah right so what I see is someone who


---------111:44----------
wants to be a better person someone who


---------111:48----------
wants to understand themselves and


---------111:50----------
someone who wants to live a life that is


---------111:52----------
like aligned with who they are that your


---------111:55----------
move your striving towards growth your


---------111:56----------
striving towards in a bizarre way being


---------111:58----------
who you are which is sort of growth but


---------112:00----------
is also not growth and that's where we


---------112:02----------
get into like Zen paradoxes and that you


---------112:06----------
also have noticed a couple of things


---------112:07----------
that like you need to be around other


---------112:09----------
people and I'm sure there are all kinds


---------112:11----------
of reasonable reasons why you're a sense


---------112:15----------
of identities under assault because


---------112:16----------
you're an undergrad yes you're a 30 year


---------112:20----------
old in undergrad yeah


---------112:21----------
that's not easy no you will be surprised


---------112:25----------
by how amazing it is once you get used


---------112:27----------
to it yes I have noticed I've become a


---------112:31----------
better student in the last two years but


---------112:33----------
yeah and then you will you'll begin to


---------112:36----------
realize that you have advantages over


---------112:37----------
these children Yeah right like you'll


---------112:43----------
realize they're kids like they actually


---------112:44----------
haven't like lived life yet and you've


---------112:47----------
really come of life and and try to take


---------112:49----------
some comfort in that but I think overall


---------112:51----------
it still comes down to you know taking


---------112:53----------
actions in the present it sounds like


---------112:55----------
you've figured out kind of who you are


---------112:56----------
and I think your sense of identity this


---------112:59----------
is the thing your sense of identity once


---------113:01----------
again is like the content side of things


---------113:03----------
we don't need to address that you just


---------113:05----------
need to start going to campus and


---------113:06----------
hanging out with people and things like


---------113:08----------
that and your sense of identity will


---------113:09----------
become like less important it's bizarre


---------113:11----------
your anxieties will just like literally


---------113:13----------
like start to melt away it's the


---------113:15----------
weirdest thing in the world


---------113:17----------
when I work with people in this way


---------113:18----------
they're like yeah it just doesn't bother


---------113:19----------
like people with anxiety for 15 years


---------113:21----------
will be like and I'll check in with them


---------113:23----------
because we'll talk about spirituality


---------113:25----------
and meditation stuff and then I'm like


---------113:26----------
by the way how's your anxiety are you


---------113:28----------
still worried about X Y Z and they're


---------113:29----------
like it just doesn't bother me as much


---------113:31----------
yeah it's weird


---------113:33----------
you were what so when you start to focus


---------113:36----------
on the ego and you start to focus on the


---------113:39----------
present you literally remove food and


---------113:42----------
drink in sustenance for your anxiety you


---------113:45----------
don't fix your anxiety that's what's so


---------113:47----------
[ __ ] confusing to everyone


---------113:48----------
everyone's like but what about my sense


---------113:50----------
of identity what about my sense of


---------113:52----------
biological determinism what about this X


---------113:54----------
Y Z what about people what about my nose


---------113:55----------
what about my hair what about my my


---------113:58----------
weight what about that and I'm like yeah


---------114:00----------
I don't really care


---------114:03----------
doesn't matter it's just all of that


---------114:07----------
stuff feeds your mind feeds off of the


---------114:11----------
thoughts of others and just think about


---------114:13----------
this for a second your anxiety is like


---------114:15----------
addictive does that make any sense to


---------114:18----------
you yeah well as various it comes in


---------114:20----------
cycles like you said like I I go into


---------114:22----------
cycles and it can be very dark like it


---------114:26----------
can get very dark and your mind even


---------114:29----------
though you suffer your mind loves to be


---------114:31----------
in that place yes it's like a kid in a


---------114:34----------
candy store it's like thoughts thoughts


---------114:35----------
thoughts lot thoughts and think about


---------114:38----------
what is the mind hate the mind hates no


---------114:40----------
thoughts and this is why boredom is so


---------114:42----------
hard for us we hate the mind the thing


---------114:45----------
that hates that we hate the most and the


---------114:47----------
mind hates the most is boredom because


---------114:49----------
boredom is a place with no stimulation


---------114:51----------
and with no stimulation thoughts are


---------114:53----------
hard to come up with and then the mind


---------114:57----------
starts to die if it has no thoughts so


---------114:59----------
when you're bored your mind starts to


---------115:00----------
wander it grasps like I want you guys to


---------115:03----------
really think about this for a second

when you're bored your mind is like a


---------115:07----------
starving something and it's gasping for


---------115:10----------
air it's thinking this thought that's


---------115:12----------
thinking that thought anything to like


---------115:14----------
get the chain of thoughts flow does that


---------115:16----------
make sense yeah and anything to like


---------115:20----------
start feeding itself because once it


---------115:22----------
gets interested in something then you


---------115:23----------
can think think think think think and


---------115:25----------
you're no longer bored and then the mind


---------115:27----------
is at ease because it's like oh thank


---------115:28----------
god we're thinking again


---------115:31----------
so is you step away from the process of


---------115:33----------
thinking it can be kind of difficult but


---------115:35----------
over time your anxiety won't have food


---------115:37----------
and water and it'll start to wither away


---------115:39----------
and then eventually it'll die and then


---------115:42----------
as you think anxious thoughts as you


---------115:44----------
engage in the world that's gonna add


---------115:45----------
food and water so this is why I like


---------115:48----------
conquering anxiety takes like really


---------115:50----------
like months or even years and then yeah


---------115:55----------
so good luck man thank you thanks for


---------115:58----------
you guys we're gonna have to stop


---------116:00----------
because we're actually like about 45


---------116:02----------
minutes overtime and I'll do a better


---------116:05----------
job of time management and meditation


---------116:07----------
next time okay


---------116:07----------
