thank you very much for coming on stream


---------00:28----------

---------00:32----------
pleasure so can can you help me and


---------00:35----------
twitch at understand a little bit about


---------00:38----------
why you're coming on today how we can be


---------00:40----------
helpful and what we're talking about


---------00:43----------
yeah absolutely


---------00:45----------
well originally I decided to reach out


---------00:52----------
to you because I was having a lot of


---------00:54----------
trouble with motivation okay and I'd


---------00:59----------
actually recently overcome that pretty


---------01:03----------
good on my own and I've been kind of


---------01:06----------
moving forward and awesome in doing my


---------01:08----------
thing with that and it comes and goes


---------01:10----------
like yeah I know there's a there's a big


---------01:13----------
problem with depression and anxiety in


---------01:15----------
in a lot of not just gamers Internet


---------01:18----------
users in general right yeah and I've


---------01:22----------
never really subscribed to the notion


---------01:24----------
that I think that I have you know any


---------01:27----------
kind of clinical depression or anxiety


---------01:30----------
or anything like that I see myself as a


---------01:32----------
pretty happy guy okay I'm happy I'm a


---------01:35----------
happy dude I'm not really anxious about


---------01:37----------
many things but you know we all get sad


---------01:41----------
we all have bad days bad things happen


---------01:44----------
it's natural to be sad about stuff but


---------01:49----------
so


---------01:52----------
walking on my own motivation and things


---------01:54----------
like that recently I've shifted to


---------01:58----------
something that I consider to be more


---------01:59----------
important to me and something that I've


---------02:01----------
been trying to figure out for most of my


---------02:03----------
life which is


---------02:07----------
I've always been able to pick things up


---------02:09----------
and be quite good at them off the rip


---------02:12----------
and then I don't know what causes this I


---------02:17----------
don't know if I get comfortable at a


---------02:19----------
certain spot but I don't ever get much


---------02:24----------
better than what I originally start with


---------02:28----------
yep so I can always be good but I've


---------02:34----------
never been able to be what I would


---------02:37----------
consider great or someone that you know


---------02:41----------
exceeds expectations I guess I don't


---------02:45----------
know yeah but you either wear that


---------02:47----------
correctly okay so what I want to do here


---------02:52----------
for a second okay so I'm just gonna take


---------02:55----------
a couple of notes about talking points


---------02:57----------
okay so and can you tell us so I think


---------03:00----------
that's a that's a great a couple of


---------03:02----------
really great things to talk about it you


---------03:05----------
know a lot of people are surprised to


---------03:06----------
discover this but I think I fall in the


---------03:08----------
same camp as you in terms of I tend to


---------03:12----------
hit my peak performance relatively


---------03:15----------
easily and then top out pretty quickly


---------03:17----------
and so I think that there's actually


---------03:20----------
there's in our perceptions of success


---------03:22----------
tend to be skewed towards a certain kind


---------03:25----------
of person and we think about success is


---------03:27----------
something that's like built day after


---------03:30----------
day after day in terms of like you put a


---------03:31----------
break and then you put the next brick


---------03:32----------
and you put the next brick whereas I


---------03:34----------
think that for some people the structure


---------03:37----------
and model of success should be viewed as


---------03:40----------
a little bit different so we can talk


---------03:41----------
about that but I think based on your bio


---------03:44----------
I thought you had a really interesting


---------03:46----------
story and stuff that you were sharing


---------03:48----------
can you tell us a little bit about what


---------03:50----------
you've been up to and kind of how you


---------03:52----------
got to where you are yeah gaming in


---------03:55----------
general because like I set up and I've


---------03:57----------
done a lot of things I've been you know


---------04:01----------
I've always I've I have ADHD uh-huh


---------04:07----------
and I never was medicated for it I tried


---------04:14----------
I tried therapy and all these other


---------04:17----------
different things for it and and nothing


---------04:19----------
ever seemed to work but


---------04:21----------
um I I jumped from thing to thing to


---------04:26----------
thing pretty rapidly and it's actually


---------04:29----------
not until the last year or so that I


---------04:31----------
started medication for it because I'm


---------04:35----------
terrified of medicines or I'm terrified


---------04:38----------
of what are they called knock-knock


---------04:42----------
simulants yes yeah I'm terrified yeah


---------04:46----------
you and me both man but yes so I've


---------04:52----------
lived most of my life jumping from


---------04:54----------
subject to subject to subject and and


---------04:56----------
doing stuff and excelling at it and


---------04:58----------
they're just like shooting off to the


---------04:59----------
next thing and with gaming I'm


---------05:03----------
originally British by the way I grew up


---------05:05----------
in England and and then I moved up here


---------05:07----------
and when I moved over here I got almost


---------05:09----------
immediately into counter-strike 1.6 okay


---------05:12----------
and I played it just about every single


---------05:13----------
day and I you know I got what i would


---------05:17----------
consider quite good at it and i joined a


---------05:20----------
local team that was that we did quite


---------05:23----------
good at it any there was there were very


---------05:30----------
few people in


---------05:34----------
public games or public servers or people


---------05:37----------
that live like around me or people I


---------05:39----------
went to school with that were better


---------05:42----------
than me like I didn't have a problem


---------05:46----------
stomping people out though one casuals


---------05:50----------
there you go people that were casuals


---------05:52----------
yeah so I got quite good at that and I


---------05:57----------
recognized that I was quite good at that


---------05:59----------
so I decided that you know I kind of


---------06:00----------
wanted to do more I wanted to challenge


---------06:04----------
myself a little bit more so I started to


---------06:06----------
look more towards doing like lands and


---------06:08----------
competitive stuff and there was a land


---------06:11----------
center that opened up in my town


---------06:14----------
conveniently right around that time and


---------06:16----------
I started to go there very often and


---------06:18----------
they started the team for 1.6 and I


---------06:21----------
started playing for that team and it


---------06:24----------
kind of like took off from there


---------06:26----------
and 1.6 went really well for me and then


---------06:30----------
I went to and then source came out and I


---------06:33----------
decided to want to keep playing through


---------06:34----------
Counter Strike sauce but when


---------06:37----------
counter-strike source came out there was


---------06:39----------
a big upset in


---------06:44----------
professional I'm gonna use air quotes


---------06:46----------
professional counter-strike at the time


---------06:49----------
because sauce wasn't widely accepted by


---------06:52----------
all of the players and all the


---------06:53----------
professional players and I wouldn't like


---------06:55----------
the only reason I would say that I


---------06:58----------
consider myself a professional is


---------06:59----------
because twitch accepted it and they gave


---------07:01----------
me a pot in a badge don't know why the


---------07:03----------
heck they did that but you know let's


---------07:04----------
not question I don't want to take it


---------07:06----------
away and I got winnings for playing for


---------07:13----------
a team oh cool we're looking at jerseys


---------07:20----------
okay I was particularly intrigued with


---------07:24----------
the underwear oh yeah that was my sub


---------07:27----------
mail a couple of months back it was a


---------07:30----------
weird stuff oh yeah Chad Booma absolute


---------07:35----------
boomer


---------07:36----------
dude I'm more Boomer than dr. K over


---------07:39----------
here trust nice so anyway when when


---------07:43----------
source came out it wasn't widely


---------07:45----------
accepted by the counter-strike community


---------07:46----------
and or at least the pro counter-strike


---------07:50----------
community and a lot of players decided


---------07:53----------
not to just not to play it and not like


---------07:55----------
competitively so and I was still a


---------07:57----------
teenager so the you know there wasn't


---------08:01----------
much money in it for me as it was to


---------08:03----------
begin with and I never saw it as a job


---------08:09----------
I never sort of like I saw it as like um


---------08:14----------
like if you're on like a little league


---------08:16----------
team when you're a kid and you just you


---------08:19----------
just playing you're having fun and


---------08:20----------
you're and you're competing at except


---------08:21----------
for I was getting like a couple hundred


---------08:24----------
bucks if I did really well and that was


---------08:27----------
like my pocket money like I bought my


---------08:29----------
first car off of counter-strike winnings


---------08:31----------
Wow


---------08:31----------
oh no it's a piece of crap so so yeah


---------08:37----------
that that that happens sauce came out


---------08:39----------
everybody kind of just dissipated and as


---------08:42----------
did I so I went to trade school to


---------08:45----------
become a welder I did welding for a


---------08:47----------
little bit I was a mechanic for eight


---------08:50----------
years figs and whole bunch of cars


---------08:53----------
and then a friend of mine that is a


---------09:00----------
streamer is a one-percent streamer had


---------09:05----------
which that we main said 1% streamer a 1%


---------09:09----------
streamer Chad help me out I won't be


---------09:16----------
said streamer would be someone like


---------09:17----------
Moomin I'm trying not to name drop but


---------09:21----------
what does that mean what a 1% over no no


---------09:25----------
what is what 1% what does that mean a 1%


---------09:27----------
streamer would be the the top earnings


---------09:30----------
or top viewers streamers on the platform


---------09:34----------
product which yes okay so I was


---------09:39----------
contacted by this person and they said


---------09:41----------
hey you know if you're still if you


---------09:43----------
still into video games and stuff like


---------09:45----------
that and you're still wanting to you


---------09:47----------
know play you should start up a stream


---------09:51----------
and see see where it takes you okay and


---------09:53----------
I was like okay so that I did that and


---------09:55----------
it went really well at the beginning


---------09:57----------
okay I'm very well at the beginning


---------09:59----------
because I had this friend and we were


---------10:01----------
working together and we were working


---------10:02----------
together relatively close and then


---------10:05----------
things kind of fell off and and you know


---------10:10----------
the fever ship fell off and all that


---------10:12----------
other stuff so I kind of went down from


---------10:14----------
like a 200 viewer Andy all the way down


---------10:17----------
to like a 20 50 viewer Andy okay


---------10:20----------
so around in around that time I was like


---------10:24----------
okay well maybe it's all falling off


---------10:27----------
because I'm not as good as I was because


---------10:30----------
I'm getting older and the shelf life of


---------10:32----------
a player is relatively short like it's


---------10:36----------
not like a traditional sport where most


---------10:39----------
people hit like their peak in their 30s


---------10:41----------
mm-hmm so I decided maybe I just don't


---------10:46----------
practice enough you know cuz I'd spend


---------10:48----------
all this time doing you know traditional


---------10:51----------
jobs and stuff like that so maybe I just


---------10:52----------
I just don't practice enough so I


---------10:54----------
started practicing and practicing and


---------10:55----------
practicing and trying to change things


---------10:57----------
here and there and do all these


---------10:58----------
different things and I I never got any


---------11:01----------
better in fact I would argue that I


---------11:04----------
started to get worse


---------11:06----------
in some aspects what I was doing like I


---------11:10----------
started to like regress a little bit


---------11:12----------
okay and that dad worked me a little bit


---------11:16----------
it kind of made me mad and it made me


---------11:18----------
more competitive and I've always been a


---------11:20----------
really competitive person mm-hmm


---------11:22----------
[Music]


---------11:24----------
so yeah when I started to go to go


---------11:27----------
backwards a little bit I thought about


---------11:29----------
you know well maybe I need to exercise


---------11:31----------
more maybe I need to eat better maybe I


---------11:33----------
need to do this maybe you need to do


---------11:34----------
that and I went through almost every


---------11:37----------
single thing that I could think of to


---------11:39----------
get rid of this skill ceiling like to


---------11:41----------
shatter this ceiling and and get better


---------11:45----------
and I just haven't been able to do it


---------11:49----------
and it's this the ceilings been there


---------11:52----------
for almost everything like playing


---------11:53----------
guitar driving cars like all sorts of


---------11:55----------
different things it's it so it's always


---------11:57----------
been there


---------11:58----------
yeah and I've never known how to destroy


---------12:01----------
it don't get past it okay thank you so


---------12:04----------
much for sharing I think you know and I


---------12:09----------
think maybe that this is kind of like


---------12:11----------
the place that I would go to look for


---------12:14----------
the the answer yeah so what kind of


---------12:19----------
answer are you looking for


---------12:20----------
let's say Ramona


---------12:27----------
[Music]


---------12:30----------
are we good


---------12:32----------
Chad if we're good say bacon say okay I


---------12:35----------
don't know what exactly happened but


---------12:37----------
okay okay so I'm sorry about that so I


---------12:42----------
think I think they left off with I'm not


---------12:44----------
sure you're gonna get exactly what you


---------12:46----------
want so this is what I was saying chat


---------12:48----------
so I I think that this is one of the


---------12:50----------
rare cases where I can actually so we


---------12:52----------
can talk about and we probably should


---------12:55----------
missus like feelings around various


---------12:58----------
things like where he's kind of coming


---------12:59----------
from you know I see something about this


---------13:03----------
conception that you have about a ceiling


---------13:06----------
and that you're kind of relentlessly


---------13:08----------
moving forward in one direction but I


---------13:11----------
think oddly enough you know so so if I


---------13:14----------
you know you were kind of saying that


---------13:16----------
you sort of missed the boat on some


---------13:18----------
eSports opportunities you're like a


---------13:19----------
little bit too old to like sort of


---------13:21----------
really catch that boom and then you kind


---------13:24----------
of fell out of it for a while and you


---------13:26----------
sort of made a second chance but I think


---------13:28----------
part of your problem is that you're


---------13:29----------
viewing success very narrowly so you're


---------13:32----------
like someone who sort of says like no


---------13:34----------
matter how hard I try I can't jump jump


---------13:37----------
above three feet whereas like it like


---------13:40----------
let's say there's like an apple that


---------13:41----------
you're trying to reach above you and


---------13:43----------
you're just jumping and you can't reach


---------13:44----------
the Apple you can't reach the Apple you


---------13:45----------
can't reach the Apple and you're kind of


---------13:47----------
saying like okay I tried to exercise I


---------13:49----------
tried to like get on medication for ADHD


---------13:51----------
and no matter even though I'm doing all


---------13:53----------
of these things right no matter how hard


---------13:55----------
I jump I'm not able to reach the Apple


---------13:57----------
and so you're coming here and you're


---------14:00----------
saying like okay maybe if we talk things


---------14:02----------
through I'll be able to jump high enough


---------14:03----------
to reach the Apple whereas what I'm


---------14:05----------
gonna tell you is go find a ladder right


---------14:09----------
I I think you can get to where you want


---------14:11----------
to go I think you just have a very


---------14:12----------
narrow focus in terms of how you're


---------14:15----------
trying to achieve your goal mm-hmm the


---------14:18----------
other thing that I think is going on is


---------14:20----------
that I think some of that narrow focuses


---------14:22----------
by like not really understanding not


---------14:25----------
having realistic expectations about


---------14:27----------
certain things so I think that you need


---------14:29----------
to start making decisions based on data


---------14:31----------
as opposed to like thoughts and feelings


---------14:35----------
and sort of what you see around you and


---------14:37----------
this is why I'm kind of asking some of


---------14:39----------
these questions so the question that I


---------14:41----------
was asking is so it is is that I mean


---------14:44----------
make sense that just like jet narrow


---------14:48----------
expectation of success yeah yeah I mean


---------14:51----------
it's my fence okay so like I'm just


---------14:54----------
gonna give you guys an example so I'm


---------14:55----------
actually hopefully gonna publish a paper


---------14:58----------
about this because there's no research


---------14:59----------
on this so I've started to do actual


---------15:02----------
like research on this stuff and I'd like


---------15:03----------
to publish this data cuz I don't think


---------15:05----------
anyone knows this stuff so news was


---------15:07----------
saying you know he used this phrase like


---------15:09----------
top 1% in terms of like twitch streamers


---------15:13----------
so I was asking is how many people


---------15:14----------
stream on Twitch is about 2.5 million


---------15:18----------
okay last I sorry yeah fine


---------15:20----------
so how much do you think the top 500


---------15:23----------
streamers what do they make on average


---------15:25----------
per year on to about a million about a


---------15:27----------
million eeeh okay top 300 so I think I


---------15:31----------
think like that's one times ten to the


---------15:34----------
minus fifth so I think one three are


---------15:36----------
what what is this let's do some ten to


---------15:39----------
the fifth or ten to the six so if you


---------15:40----------
have 2.2 million people


---------15:42----------
five hundred is gonna be like you know


---------15:45----------
is gonna be like you know one in 10,000


---------15:49----------
mm-hmm right so like this like okay so


---------15:53----------
that so the top one in 10,000 is gonna


---------15:58----------
be a top 500 streamer roughly mm-hmm


---------16:01----------
so and you think that the top 500


---------16:03----------
streamers on Twitch make about 1 1


---------16:05----------
million or so how much do you think the


---------16:07----------
top 300 streamers make on Twitch


---------16:11----------
probably about 1.5 million maybe maybe


---------16:15----------
touching 2 million okay how much do you


---------16:18----------
think the top 100 streamers make on


---------16:20----------
twitch uh 3 million and up okay and what


---------16:24----------
about the top 10 streamers in the 10


---------16:29----------
best scores on switch yeah so over time


---------16:32----------
Alania easily okay


---------16:34----------
and how confident are you in your


---------16:37----------
answers


---------16:44----------
I would say pretty confident Martin 80%


---------16:48----------
a person okay so let's ask chat so


---------16:50----------
twitch at how much do you think the top


---------16:52----------
500 streamers make on twitch so chat


---------16:59----------
seems to think that 10 million is keep


---------17:01----------
in mind Chad Devin Nash just did a video


---------17:04----------
on this like two or three days ago and


---------17:06----------
what did he say 10 million is is a


---------17:11----------
pretty reasonable expectation for the


---------17:14----------
top the very tippity tip-top okay so of


---------17:18----------
tour streamers I'd be curious about


---------17:20----------
where he's getting his data so I don't


---------17:22----------
know where to get good data about this


---------17:24----------
but my analysis has been different you


---------17:26----------
know so top 500 like what are people


---------17:29----------
saying like people are saying like 50k


---------17:32----------
or so right 50k for a person


---------17:39----------
yeah okay so what do you guys think


---------17:41----------
about top 300 streamers


---------17:46----------
way more than 50


---------17:49----------
top 300 is one mil to 500k okay so maybe


---------17:53----------
I was up yeah


---------17:55----------
and that tots alright so like I don't


---------17:57----------
know where to get good data about this


---------17:59----------
cuz I'm new to twitch but based on the


---------18:01----------
data that I've what I did is look at


---------18:03----------
twitch aggregators and looked at the


---------18:06----------
total amount of subs then twitch people


---------18:09----------
have and then looked at a few articles


---------18:11----------
and compared so there are some articles


---------18:13----------
that are in depth about topstreamers and


---------18:15----------
sort of say that this is how much they


---------18:17----------
make from subs I don't know how accurate


---------18:19----------
the state is this is how much they make


---------18:21----------
from donations this is how they make


---------18:22----------
from sponsorships this is how much they


---------18:24----------
make from like like advertising yeah and


---------18:28----------
sort of I took the top ten streamers I'm


---------18:31----------
not talking about YouTube I'm just


---------18:32----------
talking about twitch income are you


---------18:33----------
talking about total income are you


---------18:34----------
talking about income from twitch I was


---------18:35----------
actually just talking about substance


---------18:37----------
subscribers alone okay so I'd be really


---------18:41----------
curious and I could be wrong about this


---------18:43----------
stuff but based on some of the twitch


---------18:45----------
aggregators which so this is publicly


---------18:47----------
available data in terms of subscribers


---------18:49----------
right subscribers is publicly available


---------18:51----------
and then what I did is I took the top


---------18:54----------
ten streamers and found articles about


---------18:56----------
them and compared how much they make


---------18:58----------
from subs to how much they make from


---------19:01----------
everything else and based on my analysis


---------19:04----------
the top 300 streamers make at least 10


---------19:08----------
grand a year the top 300 yes so my data


---------19:14----------
could be wrong this is the data source


---------19:16----------
that I'm using so I'm really curious


---------19:17----------
about you know where other people are


---------19:19----------
getting their data the top 300 people on


---------19:23----------
twitch make a hundred grand a year and


---------19:26----------
the top ten make over a million no I'm


---------19:30----------
thinking more more chat how many how


---------19:35----------
many streamers do you think on this


---------19:37----------
platform have over 20,000 subscribers


---------19:41----------
yes so so 10k subs so yeah let's so I


---------19:49----------
mean I'm curious about this right so


---------19:51----------
twitch


---------19:53----------
scriber aggregator right so let's find


---------20:01----------
you guys are saying who so 10,000 subs


---------20:13----------
yes so like I'm looking at this twitch


---------20:17----------
tracker calm I don't know how good this


---------20:19----------
data is support according to this the


---------20:25----------
top 30 streamers on Twitch have about


---------20:29----------
10,000 subs that's top 30 out of 2.5


---------20:32----------
million right so like I think there's a


---------20:37----------
big drop off between 30 and 100 and yeah


---------20:44----------
so like according to Devin Nash so that


---------20:46----------
I'd be curious about where Devin Nash is


---------20:48----------
getting his data because I'm just


---------20:50----------
talking about twitch some so I don't


---------20:51----------
know about other things but like this


---------20:53----------
website I don't know how good this


---------20:55----------
website is but it seems to aggregate


---------20:56----------
twitch data and they have api's and


---------20:59----------
stuff so if you use this sub sir monthly


---------21:03----------
right yeah yes so I get more of a split


---------21:09----------
at certain yep amount some subscribers


---------21:12----------
yeah you can renegotiate your split with


---------21:15----------
with twitch at certain points go to so


---------21:21----------
uh let's just do some back of the napkin


---------21:23----------
math right now I don't know if this kind


---------21:26----------
of stuff is like what y'all are looking


---------21:27----------
for but so 3,500 times it's five bucks


---------21:31----------
per sub right and you get thirty percent


---------21:33----------
of that so that's three point five yeah


---------21:37----------
so is so you get three point five


---------21:40----------
dollars per sub once you're a partner


---------21:42----------
right no no you get you start out with


---------21:49----------
the initial 5050 and put for just tier


---------21:53----------
ones to two and three work differently


---------21:55----------
on the split but we'll go into that and


---------21:57----------
then yes you have 500 for a certain


---------22:01----------
amount of time then you can renegotiate


---------22:02----------
to 275 and then three and then yeah so


---------22:05----------
I'm assuming that your


---------22:07----------
70% rate so let's just do this back of a


---------22:10----------
napkin math twitch so I'm looking at the


---------22:12----------
top one so the 100 the 100th person on


---------22:16----------
twitch has 3500 subs right according to


---------22:22----------
this website so I don't know maybe this


---------22:23----------
website is wrong if you have 3500 subs


---------22:26----------
and you're making three point five


---------22:27----------
dollars per sub that's $12,000 a month


---------22:30----------
so from subs this making this guy is


---------22:33----------
gonna make about a hundred and fifty


---------22:35----------
grand a year wait and that's the average


---------22:39----------
Patna that's what that's the one hunt


---------22:42----------
number 100 the what number 100 on the


---------22:45----------
subscriber count so this guy has is at


---------22:47----------
the bottom he's number 100 in terms of


---------22:50----------
number of subs


---------22:51----------
[Music]


---------22:53----------
hmm yeah so yes he is 3500 subs so if


---------23:01----------
you guys have better data I'm open to


---------23:03----------
listen to it I don't I don't really talk


---------23:05----------
much about about money on twitch so I'm


---------23:09----------
I'm yeah so but I know it here is that


---------23:13----------
like I think I don't know so I think


---------23:16----------
what's going on so I tried to look for


---------23:18----------
data on this stuff and I think that the


---------23:20----------
numbers are way inflated based on what I


---------23:22----------
can find


---------23:22----------
so there may be a lot of income that I'm


---------23:24----------
not considering like YouTube and like


---------23:26----------
patreon and like all these other income


---------23:29----------
streams like I'm not sure but based on


---------23:32----------
the actual data that I can find I think


---------23:34----------
this is a huge problem because I think


---------23:37----------
like when you say top 1% the top 1% of


---------23:40----------
streamers I think makes [ __ ] because


---------23:42----------
there are two point five million


---------23:44----------
streamers so the top 1% of streamers on


---------23:47----------
twitch is the top 25,000 streamers on


---------23:50----------
twitch okay yeah you're much better at


---------23:56----------
math than I am right so so I think the


---------23:58----------
first thing is like I and like I said


---------24:01----------
I'm gonna publish a paper about this and


---------24:02----------
I'm glad you guys told me about Devin


---------24:04----------
and things like that because I think


---------24:05----------
that you know I'll talk to Devon about


---------24:08----------
it personally and I'll watch this this


---------24:10----------
disguised toast video and I think that


---------24:13----------
YouTube in a lot of ways is more


---------24:14----------
lucrative than twitch but I don't know


---------24:17----------
like these guys are the experts in this


---------24:18----------
stuff I'm not an expert I'm


---------24:20----------
to scientists and I found whatever data


---------24:22----------
I could get my hands on and I analyzed


---------24:23----------
it but the first thing is that when


---------24:25----------
you're kind of thinking about your


---------24:27----------
success


---------24:28----------
you should understand like what you're


---------24:30----------
actually comparing it to because if


---------24:32----------
you're comparing it to you know like if


---------24:34----------
you're expecting to make like you said


---------24:36----------
you bought a car and you said like


---------24:37----------
that's not that big of a deal based on


---------24:39----------
my analysis that probably makes you


---------24:41----------
quite successful on twitch like you're


---------24:43----------
probably in the top 1% you're in the top


---------24:45----------
25,000 if you're making well it was hard


---------24:49----------
it wasn't from streaming that that that


---------24:51----------
income was from from tournament winnings


---------24:53----------
and stuff like that it wasn't it wasn't


---------24:55----------
from streaming I didn't stop streaming


---------24:57----------
like regularly until about 2016 but I've


---------25:02----------
I've it's really hard to explain but


---------25:06----------
I've been on Twitch since it was just in


---------25:09----------
TV yeah but I didn't start like taking


---------25:14----------
streaming seriously until about 2016


---------25:17----------
yeah so so so it sounds like that was


---------25:20----------
from your tournament winnings but the


---------25:22----------
first thing I think is that we've got to


---------25:24----------
do is take a step back and think about


---------25:25----------
what your what your goals are and what


---------25:28----------
your expectations are for success so the


---------25:31----------
first paper that I'm going to publish is


---------25:33----------
going to be about percentage of eSports


---------25:35----------
players like I'm curious if you guys


---------25:37----------
want to know this like what percentage


---------25:39----------
of people become professionals in a


---------25:41----------
particular eSport what percentage of


---------25:44----------
professionals earn what percentage of


---------25:46----------
prize pools so this is the first paper


---------25:49----------
that I'm gonna publish it's gonna look


---------25:51----------
at five or six eSports and tell you what


---------25:54----------
percentage of people go pro what


---------25:55----------
percentage of people who go pro earn a


---------25:58----------
significant amount of money what


---------26:00----------
percentage of the player base do you


---------26:02----------
need to be in to make a hundred grand a


---------26:04----------
year and the numbers I think are gonna


---------26:06----------
shock a lot of people because I have


---------26:08----------
this this impression that there's a huge


---------26:11----------
bias going on in the minds of like


---------26:14----------
streamers and youtubers which is that we


---------26:16----------
see we have a huge bias towards seeing


---------26:19----------
the most successful people so we somehow


---------26:21----------
think that that's common whereas like as


---------26:24----------
people are noticing 2.5 million people


---------26:27----------
are streaming on Twitch like most of


---------26:29----------
them get like less than 5 views per


---------26:32----------
stream


---------26:34----------
for the lifetime of their stream so


---------26:36----------
there's like this huge community of like


---------26:39----------
and that's where we need to think about


---------26:41----------
ourselves so so my sense just the short


---------26:43----------
conclusion to my paper is gonna be that


---------26:46----------
your likelihood of becoming earning a


---------26:49----------
salary where you make at least a hundred


---------26:50----------
or not even the salary a total lifetime


---------26:53----------
winnings in an esport of a hundred grand


---------26:56----------
is the same percentage chance as you


---------26:59----------
playing basketball in high school and


---------27:02----------
ending up in the NBA


---------27:05----------
then so you were long if you were on the


---------27:08----------
high school basketball team your chances


---------27:11----------
of entering the NBA are the same as if


---------27:14----------
you play an eSport making a hundred


---------27:16----------
grand of lifetime earnings and I think


---------27:21----------
sorry yeah go for a job there's a lot of


---------27:25----------
professional counter-strike players now


---------27:27----------
who's after their entire career spanning


---------27:30----------
from like spanning from one point six to


---------27:34----------
csgo and they're on massive


---------27:36----------
organizations that their total winnings


---------27:39----------
is for their entire careers like a


---------27:42----------
hundred and fifty thousand some of them


---------27:44----------
yeah not all of them but some of them so


---------27:47----------
I think like the first thing is that if


---------27:49----------
you're interested in making it in this


---------27:51----------
business I think you've got to be really


---------27:52----------
realistic and don't set yourself up for


---------27:54----------
a false standard I don't think it's my I


---------27:59----------
don't think my problem here is or my my


---------28:02----------
ask here is like like monetary success


---------28:07----------
or stream success or or anything like


---------28:10----------
that I think I'm too competitive


---------28:14----------
I'm way too competitive and I don't know


---------28:18----------
how to dial it back and I've never been


---------28:21----------
able to frickin dial it back what do you


---------28:23----------
mean by waiting oh sorry go ahead


---------28:25----------
oh it's ruining my content because when


---------28:29----------
I play a game that I don't care about or


---------28:32----------
when I play a game strictly for fun my


---------28:36----------
streams are way more fun to watch I'm


---------28:39----------
I'm more laid-back I'm more funny I do


---------28:41----------
also like I do like you know more sub


---------28:44----------
games and stuff like that but if if it


---------28:47----------
bites me and I get competitive about it


---------28:51----------
then everything makes me upset when


---------28:55----------
things don't go the way I like the way I


---------28:58----------
expect them to or if I'm you know if I


---------29:01----------
get outplayed or something like that


---------29:02----------
which happens often now because I'm 30


---------29:04----------
I'm an old man so I get outplayed all


---------29:07----------
all the damn time but the but it it


---------29:11----------
makes me mad and it makes me more mad


---------29:13----------
than it should because I know that that


---------29:16----------
part of my life is over


---------29:18----------
I'm not a professional player I'm not a


---------29:21----------
professional player in even this era of


---------29:24----------
eSports like I just want to make content


---------29:28----------
and I just want to be happy making that


---------29:30----------
content and I just want to make the


---------29:32----------
people that enjoy that content happy


---------29:34----------
okay that we can definitely so now we're


---------29:37----------
gonna switch gears okay so thank you for


---------29:39----------
sharing that is because I think that


---------29:41----------
this is going in a direction that I


---------29:43----------
don't know if that's going to help you


---------29:45----------
but I think what I'm hearing from you is


---------29:47----------
that you make your best content when


---------29:49----------
you're free from expectations and when


---------29:51----------
your expectations get dashed that's when


---------29:54----------
you sort of get into a funk and the funk


---------29:57----------
in turn negatively impacts your content


---------29:59----------
yes so I think that so the reason I sort


---------30:03----------
of mentioned all the the the twitch data


---------30:06----------
is because I think it starts with


---------30:07----------
expectation


---------30:09----------
right so you're saying that the crocs is


---------30:11----------
when your expectations are dashed that's


---------30:15----------
when you start to tilt and when you


---------30:17----------
start to tilt the content that you


---------30:19----------
produce in the way that you play the


---------30:20----------
game gets negatively impacted when when


---------30:23----------
I take the game too seriously as soon as


---------30:25----------
the game goes from being fun to being


---------30:28----------
like whatever whatever switch pops in my


---------30:32----------
brain and it says oh now you got to be


---------30:34----------
the best that's when it gets ruined and


---------30:37----------
that's when I completely agree so let's


---------30:39----------
let's understand that switch right so


---------30:41----------
what is that switch


---------30:46----------
you


---------30:49----------
probably my ego getting dashed from


---------30:51----------
somebody bet being better than me okay


---------30:54----------
even though I tried to tell myself you


---------30:57----------
don't care about this game you don't


---------30:58----------
care about being good at this game like


---------31:00----------
it doesn't matter don't worry about it


---------31:02----------
it still happens so so what what what


---------31:05----------
hurts once when someone is better than


---------31:08----------
you like you tell yourself that it


---------31:10----------
doesn't matter but it clearly does right


---------31:12----------
yes it does what you tell yourself is


---------31:15----------
that it shouldn't matter but if you want


---------31:17----------
it to not matter telling yourself it


---------31:19----------
shouldn't matter is not the way that you


---------31:20----------
do it if you want it to not matter


---------31:23----------
anymore you have to understand why it


---------31:25----------
matters okay so I want you to think


---------31:29----------
about it this way like if a dog is


---------31:31----------
barking and I tell the dog hey there's


---------31:33----------
nothing going on there's no reason to


---------31:36----------
bark is that dog gonna stop barking no


---------31:40----------
so why is the dog barking to begin with


---------31:47----------
it feels like that there's something


---------31:50----------
exactly right so so how do we get the


---------31:53----------
dog to stop barking


---------31:57----------
let it outside to see for itself sure I


---------32:00----------
think that's a great answer right we


---------32:02----------
have to address we have to address the


---------32:05----------
underlying source of the dogs anxiety


---------32:08----------
and letting it go look outside and see


---------32:10----------
oh there's nothing there we'll do it or


---------32:13----------
we can somehow calm it down so then the


---------32:15----------
question becomes it's not that it


---------32:16----------
shouldn't matter because it clearly does


---------32:17----------
but what does it feel to you like like


---------32:20----------
what does it feel like when these people


---------32:22----------
like beat you in a game you're playing


---------32:25----------
you're having fun someone out plays you


---------32:27----------
and then how do you feel I don't know I


---------32:33----------
just I just don't feel like


---------32:36----------
I feel like I'm kind of like riding on


---------32:39----------
this on this on this boat or this wave


---------32:45----------
that I'm still good and then it's just


---------32:50----------
the realization that I mean I may still


---------32:54----------
be good I don't know but the generation


---------32:57----------
that's coming up now are just better


---------33:00----------
they're faster they're more in tune they


---------33:04----------
practice harder like they're just


---------33:07----------
they're just brought up better than when


---------33:10----------
I grew up but you're playing these games


---------33:12----------
I'm just there it's trying harder the


---------33:15----------
Train how does that make you feel it


---------33:17----------
makes me feel like I haven't done enough


---------33:18----------
to stay relevant to stay good in these


---------33:25----------
games like I haven't I haven't put the


---------33:27----------
time in


---------33:27----------
like I'm older than these people I've


---------33:30----------
been playing these games for so much


---------33:32----------
longer you know you would think X amount


---------33:35----------
more hours into these games than these


---------33:37----------
other people I should be you know at


---------33:40----------
this level but I'm just not so there's


---------33:43----------
something that I'm not like that I'm not


---------33:45----------
doing that they're doing and it just


---------33:47----------
gets into my head and it makes me think


---------33:48----------
like what are these people doing what


---------33:51----------
well so I think this is this is the


---------33:54----------
problem this because you think that


---------33:56----------
there's something that you can do that


---------33:58----------
will make you that good yes I believe


---------34:02----------
that anybody that any one human can do


---------34:06----------
what any other human can do I truly


---------34:10----------
believe that that if you have able-body


---------34:13----------
enabled minds that you can be just as


---------34:16----------
great as anybody else and I don't think


---------34:18----------
that it age means anything I don't think


---------34:21----------
if you if you could put your mind to


---------34:23----------
something you can do it that's how I


---------34:25----------
feel okay where did you get that belief


---------34:31----------
thing that was something that my


---------34:33----------
grandfather told me when I was when I


---------34:35----------
was probably about 10 or 11 okay and


---------34:43----------
that sounds very encouraging yeah yeah


---------34:49----------
yeah how does that belief make you feel


---------34:55----------
I guess it depends on when I think about


---------34:58----------
it okay so so if I think about it first


---------35:03----------
thing when I wake up I feel like yeah I


---------35:05----------
could be just as good as anybody else I


---------35:07----------
can be just as as as good as the next


---------35:11----------
guy


---------35:11----------
or just as good as the person I see you


---------35:13----------
know slaying out and doing really good I


---------35:15----------
could be that guy but if it's if it's


---------35:17----------
right after I just got you know rail by


---------35:22----------
somebody and I think about that that I'm


---------35:24----------
just like if that's if that's the case


---------35:29----------
why am i you know what am I doing wrong


---------35:32----------
why am I still not you know doing better


---------35:36----------
so I see that is sort of inspirational


---------35:39----------
on the one hand and it's also the way


---------35:41----------
that you beat yourself up on the other


---------35:43----------
hmm what do you think about that I mean


---------35:52----------
there's no arguing it I mean it sounds


---------35:55----------
reasonable it sounds logical yeah but I


---------35:59----------
mean is that what you do do you beat


---------36:01----------
yourself up with that belief like


---------36:03----------
sometimes it inspires you and other


---------36:06----------
times you use that to blame yourself for


---------36:09----------
your failures and you say that if you


---------36:12----------
had if you had worked harder you could


---------36:14----------
have accomplished more so you [ __ ]


---------36:17----------
need to work harder and why can't you


---------36:19----------
work harder yeah I suppose I do beat


---------36:23----------
myself up but with it sometimes I don't


---------36:26----------
go out my way to do it but it I guess no


---------36:28----------
I don't think you go out of your way I


---------36:29----------
think it's reflexive I think it's habit


---------36:34----------
right like every time you get outplayed


---------36:36----------
not maybe not every time but when you


---------36:38----------
get outplayed it's really easy to think


---------36:40----------
like man like I should be able to do


---------36:43----------
this like I should be able to do this


---------36:44----------
mm-hmm does that make sense yes yes and


---------36:48----------
it's exactly what goes through my mind


---------36:49----------
yeah and I don't even think I think the


---------36:51----------
the problem here is that when I say beat


---------36:54----------
yourself up it's hard for you too


---------36:57----------
think about it like that because it's


---------36:59----------
become so automatic like you they just


---------37:00----------
think that that's true it's just does


---------37:04----------
that sort of make sense like you say


---------37:06----------
yeah I do this all the time but you


---------37:07----------
don't consider it beating yourself up um


---------37:12----------
I think I think if I could put a little


---------37:17----------
I could put a little context to this


---------37:19----------
sure because my coach like when I was 17


---------37:25----------
or 18 years old told me that there is


---------37:27----------
absolutely no excuse for failure and


---------37:30----------
it's like I don't think that he was a


---------37:32----------
very good coach I don't think that I


---------37:37----------
think he he he led me and and and taught


---------37:42----------
me through anger so and looking back on


---------37:48----------
it now that's that's almost exactly what


---------37:50----------
he did so like if I if if I lost and I


---------37:54----------
sat there and I thought oh man I just


---------37:55----------
got out play but you know he was so much


---------37:57----------
better than me he would come up and be


---------37:59----------
like you shouldn't be this comfortable


---------38:04----------
being being bested like that you


---------38:08----------
shouldn't feel comfortable getting beat


---------38:12----------
like that it should it should inspire


---------38:14----------
you it should make you you know it


---------38:16----------
should make you want to be better than


---------38:18----------
that person there's you know you


---------38:20----------
shouldn't be happy in losing you


---------38:21----------
shouldn't be content in losing and


---------38:23----------
that's what he would drill into my mind


---------38:25----------
all the time do you think that got


---------38:27----------
drilled in yes absolutely do you think


---------38:31----------
that your mind operates that way now yes


---------38:34----------
and what do you think about that belief


---------38:39----------
I know logically that it's it's crap and


---------38:43----------
it's not sports been like and it's not


---------38:46----------
realistic it's I mean it's sad you


---------38:51----------
should be able to appreciate somebody's


---------38:54----------
skill when they beat you always yeah so


---------38:58----------
at the beginning of this you remember


---------39:01----------
when I told you that I'm I'm sorry to


---------39:04----------
say this news but I don't think I'm


---------39:06----------
gonna give you the answer that you're


---------39:07----------
gonna look that you're looking for


---------39:09----------
because I think your your app


---------39:11----------
you're the answer that you're looking


---------39:12----------
for is something that'll let you break


---------39:14----------
through that skill ceiling whereas I


---------39:16----------
think the basic problem here is that


---------39:17----------
like your premise about the ceiling is


---------39:19----------
wrong right that you're you're telling


---------39:22----------
me that he led you through anger and you


---------39:24----------
started to believe that there's like you


---------39:26----------
should you should want to be able to


---------39:29----------
beat them and you should find you should


---------39:31----------
start with the belief that it is


---------39:32----------
possible to beat them because if you


---------39:34----------
don't start with the belief that it's


---------39:36----------
possible to beat them then there's like


---------39:38----------
that's what fuels you to go forward and


---------39:40----------
I think this is the pattern that you've


---------39:42----------
kind of count like you've reinforced


---------39:44----------
time and time and time again and I think


---------39:47----------
the reason that you give up is because


---------39:49----------
in a weird way like you lose heart


---------39:52----------
because you don't live up to your own


---------39:54----------
expectations so then you quit but you


---------39:58----------
set such a high standard for yourself


---------40:00----------
that the only option is failure so like


---------40:04----------
let me ask you this is I know that


---------40:07----------
sounds weird but we'll get there so like


---------40:09----------
when when you switched from one when you


---------40:11----------
were playing 1.6 how did you feel about


---------40:13----------
yourself


---------40:15----------
great


---------40:17----------
I felt worried about that there was a


---------40:22----------
number of things I did at that age that


---------40:25----------
I would that you know I was competitive


---------40:27----------
in I used to race motocross and I did


---------40:34----------
combat sports and stuff like that but


---------40:37----------
they were always like things that felt


---------40:40----------
like hobbies like the racing motocross


---------40:42----------
was my dad's idea and it was kind of


---------40:44----------
like what he wanted me to pursue so I


---------40:48----------
did that to make him happy


---------40:49----------
the the the combat sports felt like just


---------40:53----------
kind of something to do after school so


---------40:57----------
and but the the gaming was something


---------41:01----------
that I like I was passionate about and


---------41:04----------
that I drove myself to get better at so


---------41:09----------
let's pause for a second what was the


---------41:12----------
goal that were you were driving yourself


---------41:14----------
towards when you were playing 1.6 to


---------41:17----------
have fun okay cuz back then there was I


---------41:22----------
mean eSports was cyber athletics League


---------41:24----------
it was basically a forum okay so so what


---------41:29----------
I'm hearing you saying is that your goal


---------41:30----------
was to have fun and get better yeah so


---------41:33----------
let's talk about the transition to


---------41:34----------
source how did you feel when when source


---------41:36----------
came out when sauce came out I've been


---------41:40----------
competing for a little bit and I'd kind


---------41:44----------
of like knew there was something there


---------41:45----------
but I didn't see the future in it


---------41:47----------
because the the game was like so


---------41:51----------
horribly accepted that I was like okay


---------41:55----------
well that's it then that no one's gonna


---------41:59----------
play this game professionally there's no


---------42:00----------
like there's no point in me staying here


---------42:02----------
like I'm just gonna go to school so


---------42:05----------
that's why I would you trade school and


---------42:06----------
I went to university and that happens


---------42:07----------
like a lot in eSports like games will go


---------42:10----------
up and and you'll you'll work your butt


---------42:12----------
off to get really good at that game and


---------42:13----------
then that game will kind of like fall


---------42:15----------
off and then a new game will pop up and


---------42:17----------
then you've got a you know you've got a


---------42:18----------
can constantly be chasing different


---------42:20----------
games all the time if you constantly be


---------42:22----------
chasing different games for what though


---------42:24----------
why are you chasing that game


---------42:28----------
if you're making a career out of it then


---------42:30----------
you know so then so then why are you


---------42:33----------
okay so you say they go to make a living


---------42:36----------
out of it so so would you say that the


---------42:37----------
reason that you were tried to get good


---------42:40----------
at source and ultimately the reason that


---------42:42----------
you left source was because you felt


---------42:44----------
like you couldn't make a career out of


---------42:45----------
it or that winning was insufficient to


---------42:48----------
make a career yeah I mean I saw the


---------42:53----------
community breaking up and I saw people


---------42:55----------
like just not interested in it and I I


---------42:57----------
too thought you know and I I need to I


---------43:01----------
need a real job I need a real job I need


---------43:03----------
real education like this doesn't make


---------43:07----------
any money so I'm not hearing anything


---------43:09----------
about this sort of drive to succeed


---------43:11----------
drive to be better than everyone else


---------43:13----------
drive to win drive that if you put in


---------43:15----------
enough enough time that you will be


---------43:17----------
successful I'm not hearing any of that


---------43:19----------
when it comes to source


---------43:20----------
well source falling apart didn't have


---------43:23----------
anything to do with my personal Drive


---------43:25----------
like I could still be good at the game


---------43:28----------
but if the game doesn't have the the


---------43:32----------
competitive following like that there's


---------43:35----------
there's nothing I can do about that


---------43:37----------
yeah of course so I saw I put that


---------43:40----------
passion into school okay yeah but that's


---------43:43----------
all I'm saying right is is that I'm not


---------43:45----------
saying that it wasn't warranted for you


---------43:47----------
to think what you did I'm just noting a


---------43:49----------
distinct difference between your


---------43:51----------
attitude between one-point-six and


---------43:53----------
source no like it in one it was about


---------43:56----------
having fun it was about getting better


---------43:58----------
and in the other it was about a career


---------44:00----------
and there's no career so let's forget it


---------44:02----------
so let's talk about becoming a welder


---------44:05----------
how did you feel about that


---------44:08----------
I felt really really proud of myself


---------44:10----------
like unbelievably proud of myself okay I


---------44:14----------
liked working with my hands I liked like


---------44:18----------
yeah I liked building things I liked


---------44:20----------
feeling like you know what's the word


---------44:24----------
I'm looking for uh the phrase or word


---------44:26----------
I'm looking for here like I felt pretty


---------44:30----------
accomplished but I I had made that


---------44:34----------
somehow I had made that competitive as


---------44:37----------
well like I've always wanted my welds to


---------44:39----------
be better I always wanted you know else


---------44:41----------
to be better than what other welders


---------44:44----------
that like I worked at a shipyard for a


---------44:46----------
while as a bulkhead welder and there was


---------44:48----------
other bulkhead welders and you know we'd


---------44:51----------
get done with a day's work and you know


---------44:53----------
weld inspection would come around and I


---------44:55----------
would always want from mine to be as


---------44:58----------
flawless as a weld could be you know


---------45:01----------
just so Isis feels oh hold on a second


---------45:03----------
this is important there's a difference


---------45:06----------
between your welds being better than


---------45:07----------
other people's welds and your welds


---------45:09----------
being as flawless as they can be


---------45:20----------
what's the distinction though exactly


---------45:24----------
exactly


---------45:26----------
okay so let's say that I enter a chili


---------45:32----------
cook-off okay and getting the first


---------45:36----------
prize in the chili cook-off


---------45:39----------
is different from making really good


---------45:41----------
chili


---------45:44----------
so I can make really really good chili


---------45:47----------
hmm and I can be from Texas or I can be


---------45:51----------
in New England and win a chili cook-off


---------45:53----------
and it's still gonna be shitty chili so


---------45:59----------
it Madison the total that you're up


---------46:02----------
against absolutely


---------46:04----------
so comparison so let me just have you


---------46:06----------
listen to the language okay you think


---------46:09----------
it's competition but I don't think it's


---------46:10----------
competition against others so this is


---------46:13----------
just the language that you used when you


---------46:16----------
were playing 1.6 you are happier when


---------46:18----------
you were playing source I think you are


---------46:19----------
less happy when you were welding you


---------46:21----------
were more happy so let's see and right


---------46:23----------
now you're not happy you're discontent


---------46:25----------
and what I'm noticing is there's a


---------46:27----------
subtle thread there's a subtle theme in


---------46:30----------
the times that you're happy and the


---------46:31----------
times that you're unhappy when when


---------46:34----------
you're happy it's about having fun and


---------46:36----------
getting better when you're happy it's


---------46:38----------
about making the most flawless weld that


---------46:40----------
you can hmm when you're unhappy it's not


---------46:44----------
about playing a good game it's not about


---------46:45----------
having fun it's not even about playing


---------46:47----------
the perfect game it's playing a game


---------46:50----------
that isn't as good as someone else's


---------46:51----------
playing one is about you and one is


---------46:54----------
about other people


---------46:56----------
one is about a comparison of your worth


---------46:59----------
related to other people and one is about


---------47:02----------
just your work and the work that you put


---------47:04----------
out


---------47:05----------
when you stream and you create good


---------47:08----------
content you're not thinking about other


---------47:10----------
people you're thinking about having fun


---------47:12----------
and playing the game and when you create


---------47:14----------
bad content you're thinking about other


---------47:16----------
people mm-hmm that's all coming full


---------47:20----------
circle now yeah I mean that I am the


---------47:23----------
happiest what I'm just enjoying


---------47:26----------
streaming and I'm enjoying like being


---------47:31----------
sunny and having fun absolutely and I


---------47:33----------
think that you you do you are


---------47:34----------
competitive and that competitiveness can


---------47:37----------
manifest towards yourself or towards


---------47:39----------
other people and what I mean by that is


---------47:42----------
you can weld one day and you can say


---------47:44----------
this weld was not perfect tomorrow I'm


---------47:46----------
gonna do better that's what I think what


---------47:49----------
you mean by by being competitive and I


---------47:52----------
do think that you get enjoyment out of


---------47:54----------
having your welds be better than other


---------47:55----------
people's but something tells me that if


---------47:58----------
you were surrounded by shitty welders I


---------48:00----------
would hope that you continued to try to


---------48:03----------
improve your welding yes that there's a


---------48:07----------
difference between creating like a good


---------48:09----------
product and creating the best product


---------48:12----------
like there's a difference between being


---------48:13----------
the best and being better than other


---------48:15----------
people


---------48:16----------
oh my dog that's okay does that well


---------48:25----------
he's doing exactly what you were talking


---------48:28----------
about a minute ago yeah


---------48:30----------
[Music]


---------48:36----------
so I have I have a question what is


---------48:39----------
forsen CD what does that mean I see


---------48:41----------
people posting about fours in CD a lot


---------48:48----------
so he's gonna hang out with me now


---------48:50----------
that's what the chat and dr. K means


---------48:52----------
zerah


---------48:53----------
he likes to buy said nothing he likes to


---------48:57----------
what barking okay okay so so tell me


---------49:04----------
about so does that make sense


---------49:06----------
Nate um yes yes it does it makes an


---------49:10----------
overwhelming amount of sense and tell me


---------49:12----------
what you understand what I understand is


---------49:17----------
what I understand is that I'm I'm


---------49:23----------
focusing too much on on being better


---------49:31----------
than somebody else and not focusing


---------49:34----------
enough on being better than myself


---------49:39----------
absolutely so now we're gonna go to one


---------49:41----------
last example okay how did you feel when


---------49:45----------
this 1% streamer reached out to you and


---------49:47----------
said hey let's start working together um


---------49:52----------
well I didn't know how popular he was at


---------49:57----------
the time I just felt like an old friend


---------50:00----------
was reaching out to me and I felt like


---------50:02----------
good and how did you feel then misuk


---------50:06----------
like like good you know like how you


---------50:11----------
feel when any old friend reaches out to


---------50:13----------
you absolutely what 10 years generally


---------50:15----------
positive and how did your feelings


---------50:17----------
change when you started to discover how


---------50:20----------
popular they were


---------50:27----------
I mean I didn't I didn't resent him I


---------50:30----------
didn't feel like jealous of him like not


---------50:34----------
genuinely happy that he was that he was


---------50:36----------
doing well I genuinely believed that how


---------50:40----------
did you feel about yourself I felt


---------50:45----------
excited that there was something for me


---------50:47----------
to like try and something for me to try


---------50:50----------
to excel at okay and then what happened


---------50:54----------
and then I got back into shooter games


---------51:01----------
and I mean it's it's so weird because at


---------51:06----------
the beginning I didn't do it to be the


---------51:10----------
best I just did it to be to be funny and


---------51:14----------
have fun and then you know it got out of


---------51:17----------
hand but did when it got out of hand I


---------51:19----------
switched games almost immediately hold


---------51:20----------
on hold on so what is out of hand this


---------51:23----------
is important out of control what is that


---------51:26----------
in what way what got out of hand


---------51:28----------
I got too competitive by okay okay much


---------51:32----------
on trying to get to the top of


---------51:34----------
leaderboards and and prove to everybody


---------51:37----------
who was who was essentially nobody that


---------51:40----------
I was so dang good like yeah so what do


---------51:43----------
you think like who are you thinking


---------51:44----------
about at that point yourself or other


---------51:49----------
people I was thinking about the other


---------51:52----------
people that were on the leaderboard that


---------51:53----------
I'm sighs yeah right so at that point


---------51:56----------
it's no longer about like welding for


---------51:59----------
the sake of welding it's about like


---------52:00----------
comparison to other people and I want


---------52:02----------
you to watch the shift and really think


---------52:04----------
about it because you use the word


---------52:05----------
regression when you were describing this


---------52:08----------
scenario mm-hmm that everything started


---------52:10----------
out great but then you regressed and I


---------52:12----------
think we see it right here we see that


---------52:15----------
when he reached out to you you didn't


---------52:17----------
know when you weren't thinking about


---------52:18----------
other people it's just a friend reaching


---------52:20----------
out and saying hey man let's do


---------52:21----------
something fun and you were like [ __ ] it


---------52:22----------
yeah let's do something fun mm-hmm and


---------52:24----------
then you started out and you had good


---------52:26----------
viewership and everything was fantastic


---------52:27----------
and you were having fun and they were


---------52:29----------
having fun you didn't realize how big of


---------52:31----------
a deal they were and I don't I didn't


---------52:33----------
mean to imply that I thought you were


---------52:35----------
jealous of them or anything like that


---------52:36----------
because I don't think that's what it is


---------52:37----------
I think all it is is you start to


---------52:39----------
compare your


---------52:40----------
self it's not that you're jealous of


---------52:43----------
them it's just that you look at their


---------52:44----------
success and you look at your success and


---------52:46----------
you look at other people's success and


---------52:48----------
the more you start to compare it no


---------52:50----------
longer becomes about am i proud of what


---------52:53----------
I created it becomes how does what I


---------52:57----------
create compared to what other people


---------52:58----------
create and the more that you move in


---------53:03----------
that direction the more you feel like a


---------53:05----------
failure and then you have this [ __ ]


---------53:08----------
belief which i think is adaptive and


---------53:11----------
toxic that if you put your mind to


---------53:13----------
something you can accomplish whatever


---------53:15----------
you want you I do not believe that at


---------53:17----------
all because I don't believe that you


---------53:21----------
control what happens in this world I


---------53:24----------
think all you control is what you do I


---------53:26----------
do not believe that I can become


---------53:28----------
President of the United States and that


---------53:30----------
anyone who puts their mind to it can


---------53:32----------
become President of the United States I


---------53:33----------
don't believe that I think it's [ __ ]


---------53:34----------
ridiculous I don't think anyone can


---------53:37----------
become a doctor I don't think anyone can


---------53:39----------
become a TI winner or anyone become can


---------53:42----------
become a professional eSports player I


---------53:44----------
don't think anyone can become anything


---------53:47----------
that they put their mind to I don't


---------53:50----------
think that anyone can cause someone else


---------53:52----------
to fall in love with them I think all


---------53:56----------
you control in this life is what you do


---------53:59----------
you don't control what you get hmm I can


---------54:02----------
wake up and I can I can do research and


---------54:05----------
I can practice and I can create a Chile


---------54:07----------
that involves beans and three kinds of


---------54:09----------
bacon and six kinds of peppers and I can


---------54:11----------
make the best chili that I can make but


---------54:13----------
I have no control over whether I win the


---------54:16----------
contest


---------54:25----------
I don't know if I necessarily like full


---------54:27----------
and it might just be because I've sat


---------54:30----------
here and believed it for so long


---------54:32----------
absolutely I don't I don't undo make


---------54:35----------
more beliefs about life in a day yeah


---------54:38----------
it's gonna take me some time to like get


---------54:40----------
over it but in the back of my head all


---------54:43----------
I'm hearing myself like all I'm hearing


---------54:46----------
myself my subconscious say is but we're


---------54:49----------
all human so why is that saying that


---------54:53----------
limits


---------54:54----------
I agreed I don't know it's like it's on


---------54:58----------
loop yeah but so you're damn it on loop


---------55:01----------
on my life you're damn right we're all


---------55:03----------
human and that's that's what you that's


---------55:04----------
actually what you have trouble accepting


---------55:06----------
because you believe you're superhuman


---------55:08----------
you believe that you're not just human


---------55:10----------
that if you work hard enough and you


---------55:13----------
keep working that you will achieve that


---------55:15----------
you can achieve anything that you put


---------55:18----------
your mind you that's not human


---------55:21----------
so I think the really tricky thing about


---------55:23----------
your your belief system is that it like


---------55:28----------
you're preserving some kind of control


---------55:30----------
over your life that I don't think you


---------55:32----------
really have like I think that in a weird


---------55:35----------
way like you always consider yourself to


---------55:37----------
be responsible for everything that


---------55:39----------
happens to you and I'd be really curious


---------55:41----------
like where you got that idea because


---------55:44----------
you're kind of thinking like it's almost


---------55:45----------
like you're thinking about like the


---------55:46----------
world is a vacuum where your effort


---------55:49----------
creates a result and that nothing else


---------55:51----------
influences that I don't believe that any


---------55:56----------
person who puts their mind to it will


---------56:00----------
you know can win a particular sporting


---------56:03----------
event I just don't think that's possible


---------56:05----------
like I think they're gonna hold it in


---------56:07----------
the time to practice and learn and and


---------56:10----------
and and develop the skill set you you


---------56:15----------
can be the person that overcomes and


---------56:17----------
wins you know a sporting event you a


---------56:21----------
hand win but I don't think you're


---------56:23----------
guaranteed to win so I had this problem


---------56:26----------
so I did some consulting for a Korean


---------56:28----------
eSports organization and this is


---------56:31----------
something that though like the head of


---------56:32----------
the organization just did not understand


---------56:34----------
he was like no if we practice and we


---------56:36----------
practice harder then we can win and I


---------56:39----------
was like yeah you can win but you're not


---------56:40----------
guaranteed to win yeah because that


---------56:43----------
makes sense you know you're not


---------56:45----------
guaranteed anything but that's not the


---------56:47----------
way you think right you say that if I if


---------56:50----------
I had worked harder if I had if I had


---------56:52----------
grinded more then I would be able to be


---------56:54----------
better than that guy


---------56:56----------
yes I yes I believe that I believe that


---------57:00----------
if I'd put in the same amount of time


---------57:01----------
and the same amount of effort and tried


---------57:04----------
to change the things about or changed


---------57:08----------
the bad habits that I'd built years


---------57:10----------
before and and build in a different way


---------57:13----------
that I could possibly yes yes partner oh


---------57:16----------
hold on hold on hold on hold on there's


---------57:17----------
a difference between possibly and


---------57:19----------
guaranteed because I think in your mind


---------57:22----------
it's not actually possibly I think in


---------57:24----------
your mind you believe that if you had


---------57:26----------
lived a different life you were


---------57:28----------
guaranteed to win a particular event or


---------57:30----------
a particular match a lot like me in my


---------57:33----------
head I don't think that I'm not talking


---------57:35----------
about logic I'm talking about this that


---------57:38----------
when you lose there's a part of you that


---------57:40----------
says if I had done this better this


---------57:42----------
would not have happened I believe that


---------57:47----------
what's in here is not possible it's


---------57:49----------
definitive hmm that's what I hear you


---------57:53----------
saying


---------57:56----------
I'm talking about the way that you feel


---------57:57----------
that when you look at your life and you


---------57:59----------
say I can't break out of the ceiling and


---------58:01----------
then what happens is the reason you


---------58:02----------
can't break out of the ceiling is


---------58:03----------
because you [ __ ] up at some point or


---------58:05----------
you didn't do enough at some point hmm


---------58:07----------
and I think that whole thing like needs


---------58:10----------
to be dismantled I don't know exactly


---------58:13----------
how we're gonna do it but that that - so


---------58:15----------
I mean I think this is where like you


---------58:17----------
know you're setting a particular goal


---------58:18----------
for yourself and you're beating yourself


---------58:20----------
up because you don't achieve that goal


---------58:21----------
whereas I don't think you can achieve


---------58:23----------
that goal I don't think it's yours to


---------58:24----------
achieve I think it's it as a human being


---------58:27----------
you can practice and you can dedicate


---------58:29----------
yourself and you can work really hard


---------58:31----------
and that oddly enough success is more


---------58:34----------
likely then but it's not guaranteed and


---------58:36----------
when I look at the story of your life


---------58:38----------
the times in which you didn't shoot for


---------58:43----------
something particular or the times where


---------58:45----------
you've been the most successful and the


---------58:47----------
time that the times that you've been


---------58:48----------
most content because when you were


---------58:50----------
playing 1.6 you weren't necessarily


---------58:52----------
trying to reach the Apple you're like


---------58:54----------
I'm gonna play this [ __ ] game I'm


---------58:55----------
gonna get as good as I can I'm gonna see


---------58:57----------
how many noobs I can own hmm and when


---------58:59----------
you weld it you were like I'm gonna put


---------59:01----------
this [ __ ] together I'm gonna weld and


---------59:02----------
I'm gonna make it is damn close to a


---------59:04----------
perfect weld as I can mm-hmm you didn't


---------59:07----------
say I'm going to make the perfect weld


---------59:09----------
you said I'm gonna make as close to a


---------59:12----------
flawless weld as I can your words no


---------59:16----------
guarantee effort Direction hope but


---------59:22----------
humility a lack of control


---------59:27----------
I'm gonna make as close to a flawless


---------59:29----------
weld as I can it wasn't I'm gonna make a


---------59:31----------
fall as well


---------59:32----------
and I think you're you're absolutely


---------59:34----------
right that you have this belief that


---------59:36----------
anything you can put your mind to you


---------59:37----------
can accomplish and that that belief can


---------59:40----------
be inspirational at some times but when


---------59:42----------
your ego gets activated and you have the


---------59:44----------
comparative mindset then it becomes


---------59:46----------
toxic and then you compare yourself to


---------59:49----------
other people and then you say why am I


---------59:52----------
not good enough why the [ __ ] like I


---------59:54----------
should be able to do this because that's


---------59:55----------
what you're really telling yourself it's


---------59:57----------
not I can put anything I can put do


---------59:59----------
anything that I put my mind to the real


---------60:01----------
thought so this is a it becomes a


---------60:03----------
different thought sounds like the same


---------60:04----------
thing and at the beginning of the


---------60:05----------
morning I can do anything that I put my


---------60:07----------
mind to when you're feeling bad the


---------60:09----------
thought changes subtly but it changes


---------60:12----------
too I should be able to do this hmm


---------60:15----------
that's the thought right do you


---------60:18----------
understand that like that those are


---------60:19----------
different yes it's it's like it went


---------60:22----------
from being hopeful to being feeling like


---------60:29----------
I'm owed something yes yeah


---------60:32----------
entitlement yes the other thing the


---------60:35----------
other thing is that you beat yourself up


---------60:37----------
for it


---------60:40----------
I think so entitlement is a little bit


---------60:44----------
different but you think you're owed


---------60:45----------
something in life and you're not owed


---------60:47----------
[ __ ] in life man sorry to tell you that


---------60:48----------
like this is this is the problem right


---------60:51----------
so like earlier I was talking about


---------60:52----------
putting the 140 like rejections up on my


---------60:56----------
wall from medical schools like I'm not


---------60:58----------
old like it took me a long time to get


---------60:59----------
it through my [ __ ] head that I'm not


---------61:01----------
owed [ __ ] from any of them like I can


---------61:05----------
work really hard and I can have a really


---------61:06----------
good score and I can have a really good


---------61:08----------
GPA but at the end of the day I do not


---------61:10----------
get to control whether someone accepts


---------61:12----------
me in a medical school you do not get to


---------61:14----------
control like you can play really hard


---------61:17----------
and you can work really hard and you


---------61:19----------
were saying this yourself that you


---------61:20----------
should be able to appreciate that like


---------61:22----------
someone is better than you you should be


---------61:24----------
able to like walk on to a field and play


---------61:26----------
a game and say I gave it my all but damn


---------61:29----------
they just played better and sometimes I


---------61:32----------
hear when I work with eSports athletes


---------61:33----------
who are very successful most of them


---------61:36----------
have actually bad attitude


---------61:38----------
the ones that are the most successful


---------61:39----------
are the ones that say that like and you


---------61:41----------
can watch like eSports interviews and


---------61:43----------
some people will say like they just


---------61:44----------
played better that day it's not I'm not


---------61:46----------
good enough it's not that I didn't play


---------61:48----------
well enough it's just they played the


---------61:50----------
better game that day that's what happens


---------61:52----------
when you work with professional athletes


---------61:53----------
that's how it is and the ones who


---------61:55----------
recognize that or I think the ones that


---------61:57----------
like they focus on playing the best game


---------61:59----------
that they can and I want to genuinely


---------62:01----------
feel that every single time and I would


---------62:04----------
be lying if I said that I felt that way


---------62:09----------
every single time good 100% honesty I


---------62:13----------
get I get that toxic feeling where I'm


---------62:16----------
just I just feel like I messed up


---------62:20----------
somewhere yeah man so so I'm glad I'm


---------62:23----------
glad you are honest with yourself about


---------62:26----------
that and I don't want you to start


---------62:28----------
deluding yourself into believing what


---------62:30----------
you should believe instead of what you


---------62:31----------
do believe what I want you to do is


---------62:33----------
notice it right as that toxicity comes


---------62:37----------
up ask yourself Who am I thinking about


---------62:40----------
now am I thinking about me or am I


---------62:42----------
thinking about them did I play


---------62:46----------
the best game that I could have played


---------62:47----------
or was I distracted or did I not


---------62:49----------
exercise or whatever and I think that


---------62:53----------
like that's really where you need to


---------62:54----------
pivot like you need to catch yourself as


---------62:56----------
you start to tilt and you start to think


---------62:58----------
about other people try to bring the


---------63:00----------
focus back to yourself and you can do


---------63:04----------
that through have you have you watched


---------63:06----------
any of our meditation stuff I have


---------63:09----------
literally watched every single YouTube


---------63:11----------
video that you've put out and okay


---------63:12----------
single stream I've double watched


---------63:14----------
everything okay so I think we're gonna


---------63:18----------
do a little bit of meditation right now


---------63:19----------
and then we're gonna do questions if


---------63:21----------
that's okay should I go get a dog no


---------63:26----------
that's okay I think the dog being a


---------63:27----------
distraction is actually a good thing


---------63:29----------
okay so so first of all this do you have


---------63:33----------
questions I do but I like ADHD brain


---------63:45----------
they've escaped me and I'll have to find


---------63:47----------
him again let me ask you kind of just


---------63:49----------
one last question


---------63:51----------
so through healthy game or we've had


---------63:54----------
some obscene we've had some downs so


---------63:57----------
we've done some stuff that's worked


---------63:58----------
really well on some stuff that hasn't


---------64:00----------
worked really well this is what I'll


---------64:03----------
tell you just about my own experience


---------64:05----------
there are some times that sometimes we


---------64:07----------
think about how to make successful


---------64:09----------
content and how do you think that works


---------64:11----------
out could you repeat that just yeah the


---------64:16----------
end of it so we sometimes try to make


---------64:18----------
successful content we think about like


---------64:20----------
how are we gonna make something that's


---------64:22----------
gonna be successful how are we gonna get


---------64:24----------
a lot of views on YouTube and twitch


---------64:26----------
okay and and what do you think happens


---------64:29----------
when we think about that um you probably


---------64:35----------
overanalyze it maybe and you and you


---------64:39----------
overthink it and it doesn't perform the


---------64:41----------
way you think it should because it's


---------64:43----------
actually way simpler than then it seems


---------64:47----------
so how do we what's what's that


---------64:49----------
simplicity how do we make successful


---------64:51----------
content make it digestible make it make


---------64:55----------
it something that's so simple everybody


---------65:00----------
when it in yeah anybody from any mindset


---------65:04----------
from any education level can see it and


---------65:06----------
desire to click on and watch okay that


---------65:09----------
is exactly the kind of thinking that


---------65:10----------
leads us to failure oh so here's what we


---------65:14----------
do do you think when I when I started


---------65:17----------
interviewing you and when I interview


---------65:19----------
people do I do you think I think about


---------65:22----------
making it digestible for everyone no no


---------65:28----------
I don't think you do what do I think


---------65:29----------
about in the actual videos itself the in


---------65:35----------
the actual content I think you're


---------65:36----------
thinking about the situation I had the


---------65:39----------
person that you're talking to you


---------65:41----------
absolutely yeah so I have no idea if


---------65:43----------
this is gonna get up votes or down votes


---------65:45----------
and frankly I don't [ __ ] care mmm


---------65:48----------
we make our best content when we stay


---------65:50----------
true to our mission which is building


---------65:52----------
the best piece of like welding equipment


---------65:54----------
we can which is to get on an interview


---------65:56----------
with you and all I care about is you


---------66:00----------
that's what happens that's all I care


---------66:03----------
about is like serving you and helping


---------66:06----------
you and I think that's what resonates


---------66:09----------
with people it's like if you make chili


---------66:12----------
if you just you don't try to win the


---------66:14----------
chili contest that's exactly what you're


---------66:16----------
talking about earlier which is all this


---------66:17----------
marketing stuff which I know that a lot


---------66:19----------
of people are way more successful than I


---------66:21----------
am understand which is like how to make


---------66:23----------
digestible stuff you know we have people


---------66:25----------
editing or YouTube so I know that that's


---------66:27----------
an important part but at its core it's


---------66:29----------
to play the best game that I can it's


---------66:32----------
not to play the game better than anyone


---------66:34----------
else I don't want to beat anyone on


---------66:35----------
YouTube


---------66:36----------
anytime I think about that I get [ __ ]


---------66:38----------
gets in my head and then like I'm not


---------66:40----------
thinking about you and then I can't help


---------66:42----------
you it's to do the task at hand and do


---------66:45----------
that task as best as you can


---------66:47----------
I feel like there should be and I always


---------66:58----------
have trouble coming up with the right


---------66:59----------
words I know what I want to say up here


---------67:01----------
it's there I just say a shitty version


---------67:04----------
of it I feel like there should be


---------67:11----------
milestones as to how I can get myself to


---------67:16----------
change that thought pattern I feel like


---------67:20----------
there should be yes like things that I


---------67:22----------
can practice and things that I can


---------67:24----------
tangibly see and do to stop myself from


---------67:28----------
thinking like that because I don't want


---------67:30----------
to think like that yeah what I'm see I'm


---------67:32----------
like I said at the beginning I am a


---------67:34----------
genuinely happy person I do have like


---------67:36----------
like I'm a happy guy and and I do


---------67:40----------
genuinely scream for chat in fact i


---------67:42----------
watch most streams for chat like I get


---------67:45----------
my entire entertainment out of twitch.tv


---------67:49----------
from chat because chats reactions are


---------67:52----------
hilarious to just about everything and


---------67:53----------
it's just like yeah but just think about


---------67:57----------
that for a second right so when you


---------67:58----------
watch chat there are two ways to watch


---------68:01----------
chat one way to watch chat is for your


---------68:04----------
enjoyment and to create like a good


---------68:06----------
interaction for yourself and for chat


---------68:08----------
the other way to watch chat is to see if


---------68:10----------
chat likes what you're doing or doesn't


---------68:12----------
like what you're doing right like do you


---------68:17----------
see the difference there one is about


---------68:19----------
like you being there in the moment and


---------68:21----------
just creating a fun experience for


---------68:22----------
yourself and for them and the other is


---------68:25----------
like oh let me try to do whatever chat


---------68:26----------
likes mm-hm


---------68:28----------
pogchamp five head fours and CD while


---------68:31----------
all-all-all


---------68:32----------
cat cafe hands like if I kick out of it


---------68:35----------
even if they hate me exactly exactly


---------68:39----------
but so but see that's the just think


---------68:41----------
about that for a second right because


---------68:43----------
what you're thinking about is their


---------68:44----------
opinions of you and your comparison


---------68:46----------
doesn't matter it's about you focusing


---------68:48----------
on yourself and you're absolutely right


---------68:50----------
that there are milestones and there's a


---------68:52----------
path to move from this way of thinking


---------68:55----------
to a better way of thinking and I think


---------68:58----------
that path starts with meditation the


---------69:00----------
other thing it starts with is for you to


---------69:01----------
notice within yourself and try to see


---------69:04----------
like what are you zooming in on are you


---------69:06----------
zooming on in on the act are you zooming


---------69:09----------
in on the outcome are you trying to


---------69:12----------
fulfill an expectation or you just are


---------69:15----------
you trying to just play the best game


---------69:17----------
that you can right like every time I


---------69:19----------
load up a game I can play to win


---------69:23----------
or I can play the best game that I know


---------69:25----------
how to play those are two very different


---------69:28----------
things I want to stop being competitive


---------69:32----------
like that


---------69:33----------
I want to instead of think about how can


---------69:35----------
I play the best game that I can play I


---------69:37----------
want to think how can I be the most


---------69:40----------
entertaining person that I can be


---------69:41----------
instead of worrying about the game at


---------69:44----------
all because yeah this is some of the


---------69:46----------
best most entertaining streamers that


---------69:48----------
I've ever seen could care less how


---------69:52----------
they're doing in the game in fact most


---------69:54----------
of the time they're intentionally


---------69:55----------
playing bad because it's funnier that


---------69:57----------
way yeah so I want that so I think this


---------70:01----------
is where you start so we'll do


---------70:02----------
meditation in a second but what I want


---------70:05----------
you to see what I want you to see is is


---------70:09----------
just notice so it starts with noticing


---------70:11----------
so this is like a big thing that I


---------70:13----------
believe that many people like don't


---------70:15----------
believe I believe that noticing and


---------70:17----------
understanding is actually enough to


---------70:19----------
change behavior mm-hmm this is different


---------70:22----------
from having information but noticing I


---------70:24----------
think once you have true noticing or


---------70:27----------
awareness of something it's gonna change


---------70:30----------
so that like if you get burned by


---------70:32----------
something you're not you're gonna


---------70:34----------
continue like if I get burned by a hot


---------70:36----------
stove in my hand is numb I'm gonna


---------70:38----------
continue getting burned by the hot stove


---------70:40----------
but if I know if I notice that this is


---------70:43----------
this is the source of my pain if I


---------70:45----------
notice and become aware of my thoughts


---------70:47----------
then I get control over them I think the


---------70:49----------
problem is that you don't know how you


---------70:52----------
shift from one mindset to another so the


---------70:55----------
first thing you've got to do is just


---------70:56----------
notice the shift then you'll get control


---------70:59----------
over as crazy as that sounds I believe


---------71:02----------
so this is the other big thing as people


---------71:04----------
think that like I made some magical


---------71:06----------
transformation that I was like a


---------71:07----------
caterpillar and I became a butterfly


---------71:09----------
like I was failing out of college and


---------71:11----------
now I'm super successful they don't


---------71:12----------
understand I'm the same [ __ ] that I


---------71:14----------
used to be I'm just as lazy I


---------71:16----------
procrastinate just as much and they're


---------71:19----------
like how does that happen it's just I


---------71:20----------
just noticed stuff about myself it's not


---------71:22----------
that I've changed it's just I just see


---------71:24----------
that [ __ ] I understand a little bit


---------71:26----------
better about why I procrastinate and


---------71:28----------
sometimes that's enough so start with


---------71:31----------
the noticing so when you have a good day


---------71:32----------
like take a step back and like ask


---------71:35----------
yourself why am I having fun when you


---------71:36----------
start


---------71:37----------
not have fun noticed that to say oh [ __ ]


---------71:39----------
I'm not feeling good about myself and


---------71:41----------
then ask yourself what am I thinking


---------71:42----------
about am I thinking about other people


---------71:45----------
or am I thinking about myself how do I


---------71:48----------
get the game back on me like how do I


---------71:50----------
focus on myself again how do I stop


---------71:53----------
looking out the window and start looking


---------71:55----------
in a mirror


---------71:58----------
you know like that's what you need to do


---------72:00----------
just start with that and then meditate


---------72:02----------
so we're gonna do the we're gonna do the


---------72:06----------
alternate nostril breathing you remember


---------72:08----------
this one yeah yep so I was buying this


---------72:10----------
right before we uh right before the


---------72:12----------
cofán tastic yeah so what we'll do it a


---------72:14----------
little bit more okay


---------72:15----------
so this is the practice for those of


---------72:17----------
y'all who haven't seen it so take your


---------72:19----------
we're gonna do alternate nostril


---------72:21----------
breathing so take your thumb and block


---------72:22----------
your right nostril and breathe in


---------72:23----------
through your left and then switch to the


---------72:33----------
other side and then breathe out breathe


---------72:38----------
in through the same side don't switch


---------72:44----------
switch it breathe out breathe in switch


---------73:02----------
breathe out


---------73:10----------
breathe in switch breathe out breathe in


---------73:31----------
switch


---------73:32----------
breathe out and now continue at your own


---------73:36----------
pace we'll practice for about two


---------73:38----------
minutes


---------73:59----------
you


---------74:16----------
you


---------74:21----------
you


---------74:30----------
you


---------74:55----------
you


---------75:00----------
you


---------75:03----------
you


---------75:09----------
go ahead and finish the round that


---------75:11----------
you're on let your eyes remain closed


---------75:16----------
[Music]


---------75:22----------
you


---------75:25----------
you


---------75:27----------
you


---------75:48----------
[Music]


---------75:50----------
alright go ahead and come on back so


---------76:01----------
I want you to take a snapshot of how you


---------76:04----------
feel right now


---------76:09----------
you


---------76:11----------
how do you feel


---------76:13----------
determined


---------76:15----------
hungry to do what


---------76:18----------
- to do


---------76:20----------
to


---------76:22----------
you better


---------76:25----------
[Music]


---------76:28----------
to think more without the restraints of


---------76:36----------
competitiveness because that's what I


---------76:39----------
feel that's what that's how it feels it


---------76:41----------
feel it feels like I'm being tied to a


---------76:44----------
radiator in a basement yeah that's how


---------76:47----------
competitiveness feels to me now yeah so


---------76:49----------
you used to feel good so now it feels


---------76:52----------
like a gross those thoughts I think are


---------76:56----------
actually another radiator so I'm chained


---------77:01----------
to two radiators on it


---------77:02----------
yeah I don't mean to and I think that's


---------77:06----------
okay you're on one step but eventually


---------77:08----------
you need to let go of that too


---------77:12----------
so as you breathe as you focus on


---------77:16----------
yourself your goal is to actually be


---------77:19----------
completely content with where you are


---------77:21----------
hmm but I think we'll settle so you're


---------77:25----------
right that there are milestones involved


---------77:27----------
the first milestone is to step away from


---------77:32----------
comparing yourself to other people and


---------77:34----------
then eventually this milestone needs to


---------77:37----------
be shed as well but this is a great


---------77:39----------
place to start and I think that you're


---------77:41----------
very competitive and goal-oriented by


---------77:44----------
nature so I think that that's fine but


---------77:48----------
eventually we want to take that away too


---------77:50----------
but we'll we'll work on that my goals


---------77:53----------
yes so I think your your way to goal


---------77:56----------
focused and I think the challenge here


---------77:59----------
so I'll leave one last thing with you I


---------78:00----------
think the reason that you shift too much


---------78:02----------
is because you get highly highly


---------78:04----------
determined and it's that determination


---------78:07----------
that you rely on to move forward and


---------78:09----------
then one day when you wake up and the


---------78:11----------
determination is gone it's very


---------78:13----------
difficult to move forward so oddly


---------78:17----------
enough what you need to do is learn how


---------78:18----------
to move forward without determination


---------78:24----------
which is like tricky yeah but that I


---------78:32----------
mean at this point in time makes a


---------78:35----------
little sense to me but but you but you


---------78:38----------
understand the pattern right like you


---------78:39----------
wake up and you're like gung-ho today's


---------78:41----------
the day like we're gonna do it and


---------78:42----------
you're motivated and you're optimistic


---------78:44----------
and you drive forward and then what


---------78:46----------
happens when you wake up and you don't


---------78:48----------
have that because that feeling goes away


---------78:50----------
right


---------78:51----------
I feel mad at myself yeah Amen I'm


---------78:56----------
missing an important part of myself one


---------78:58----------
point-six source welder mechanic back to


---------79:01----------
twitch because that determination wanes


---------79:06----------
and then you blame yourself for not


---------79:08----------
being determined


---------79:09----------
whereas what you really need to do is


---------79:11----------
learn how to operate without


---------79:12----------
determination that your motivation


---------79:16----------
motivation is going to fade over time


---------79:20----------
like you just have to understand that


---------79:24----------
this is maybe a conversation for a


---------79:27----------
different day let's start well it's the


---------79:30----------
whole yeah so I think like like how to


---------79:32----------
how to act without that internal sense


---------79:35----------
of determination I think some people in


---------79:36----------
twitch at understood I'm very impressed


---------79:38----------
with twitch chat by the way because I


---------79:40----------
think they're picking up a lot I love


---------79:42----------
you good said I love you never change


---------79:45----------
news I think it's it's awesome that you


---------79:48----------
came on um I know that I'm sorry I


---------79:50----------
wasn't able to quite give you what you


---------79:52----------
want to but I really do believe that


---------79:55----------
your this is gonna help you move forward


---------79:57----------
so start feel like I've actually got a


---------79:59----------
look III feel like I got a lot from this


---------80:02----------
and I think actually the really cool


---------80:04----------
thing is that you did such a good job of


---------80:06----------
moving to a new place that we are


---------80:10----------
opening up an entire new can of worms


---------80:12----------
but you can't open up you've actually


---------80:14----------
hit a milestone and what I'm telling you


---------80:16----------
is I see a whole other plateau that you


---------80:18----------
need to climb and move down but that's


---------80:21----------
for another day okay


---------80:23----------
absolutely strong work man thank you for


---------80:26----------
coming on it was an absolute pleasure


---------80:28----------
thank you so much for having me thank


---------80:30----------
you and hopefully we'll be able to check


---------80:33----------
it with you again in a few weeks or a


---------80:34----------
few months or something okay right on


---------80:37----------
okay we're gonna have a great day
