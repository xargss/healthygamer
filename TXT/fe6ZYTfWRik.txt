---------00:03----------
oh no this is good that's great okay


---------00:06----------
perfect


---------00:07----------
so now I'm gonna ask you guys so we're


---------00:09----------
so a big question is how do I figure out


---------00:11----------
my thermal right so people are asking


---------00:13----------
that and and so I want you guys to tell


---------00:16----------
me we're gonna start with like what is


---------00:17----------
what do you guys think my Darla's your


---------00:22----------
Dharma is to help other people figure


---------00:23----------
out their Dharma okay what do you guys


---------00:27----------
think Jake you're you're typing with


---------00:29----------
them sorry my brother so what do you


---------00:33----------
guys think is is my Dharma to help other


---------00:35----------
people figure out their Dharma I mean


---------00:37----------
you also have a duty to your family


---------00:39----------
right at this point I'd like to raise


---------00:40----------
your children too


---------00:41----------
yeah absolutely your wife absolutely


---------00:44----------
okay so and then someone else said


---------00:50----------
something like like before you know the


---------00:52----------
n-bomb started flying somebody said


---------00:55----------
something about I do you guys remember


---------00:57----------
what that other dude said because that


---------00:59----------
that was like I thought a pretty good


---------01:00----------
answer no okay that's okay


---------01:05----------
so what other people do other people


---------01:07----------
think that there's like an additional


---------01:09----------
Dharma about AoE hewing right and and


---------01:18----------
you've talked before about your your


---------01:22----------
particular mission to help people who


---------01:24----------
have suffered from video game addiction


---------01:26----------
because you feel like other


---------01:28----------
psychologists and particularly experts


---------01:31----------
in the field have not been able to


---------01:32----------
address the problem hey sorry you guys


---------01:34----------
hear me yep okay finally my mic was


---------01:37----------
malfunctioning yeah I was the one


---------01:38----------
speaking with you about Dharma early and


---------01:41----------
what did you say so I think it's


---------01:43----------
essentially again I'm really new to all


---------01:45----------
the vocabulary especially with you I


---------01:47----------
don't really know much about like can do


---------01:49----------
spiritualism


---------01:50----------
but it's effectively like your greater


---------01:52----------
sense of purpose in life your meaning


---------01:54----------
your sort of spiritual essence as well


---------01:56----------
yeah sure great


---------01:57----------
very good inference so you said


---------02:00----------
something else like what do you think my


---------02:01----------
Dharma is so I think that you have this


---------02:06----------
place in society now where we're


---------02:08----------
encountering a lot of problems right now


---------02:10----------
especially with people being like very


---------02:12----------
hedonistic in an irrational way people


---------02:14----------
being very not nihilistic but just like


---------02:16----------
irrationally


---------02:17----------
considering like all the opportunities


---------02:18----------
they have in life and not really being


---------02:19----------
capable of dealing with the modern world


---------02:22----------
and you're sort of here to help people


---------02:24----------
sort that out because you've done it


---------02:25----------
yourself how to deal with the modern


---------02:28----------
world and its lack of meaning okay so


---------02:33----------
now we're gonna check in with twitch at


---------02:35----------
what do you guys think you guys think


---------02:36----------
these guys have a good sense of my


---------02:38----------
Dharma can we get like a thumbs up if


---------02:39----------
you think it's okay I know yeah so so


---------02:50----------
then the question becomes like how do


---------02:52----------
you guys think I got into this Tarbell


---------02:55----------
like how did I discover my Dharma


---------02:58----------
um well going in line with what I was


---------03:01----------
saying I think you have a lot of


---------03:02----------
personal experience with this and you'd


---------03:03----------
like to mirror it onto other people it's


---------03:05----------
just a natural empathy response you know


---------03:07----------
so you struggled a lot I'm assuming in


---------03:09----------
the earlier life you've talked about


---------03:10----------
your struggles in college and such and


---------03:11----------
so overcoming those experiences was


---------03:13----------
really fulfilling and you want other


---------03:15----------
people to experience it it's kind of


---------03:16----------
like how xqc everyone likes him when he


---------03:19----------
reacts to videos and you know you like


---------03:21----------
sharing your ideas your thoughts your


---------03:23----------
Joy's with other people it the same way


---------03:24----------
so that's my idea yeah so okay so you're


---------03:28----------
saying that at the beginning there was


---------03:31----------
personal experience right and that these


---------03:37----------
are related and that I had right so in


---------03:42----------
the past but how did I so at what point


---------03:46----------
like how did I get from personal


---------03:49----------
experience to my current Dharma so like


---------03:52----------
I started playing video games like I


---------03:53----------
failed out and almost failed out of


---------03:55----------
college you know when I was like 18 and


---------03:59----------
it's been not that was 19 years ago so


---------04:03----------
like how did I get from here to here


---------04:06----------
you're spot-on dude that like my


---------04:09----------
personal experience is central to what I


---------04:14----------
do now so


---------04:18----------
that maybe we could conceptualize us as


---------04:21----------
as your personal experience plus the


---------04:24----------
recognition of a need for sort of a hole


---------04:27----------
to be filled okay


---------04:30----------
so I I agree so wreck it all got how do


---------04:33----------
I even boomer okay so recognition of a


---------04:43----------
need to be filled right so how does that


---------04:46----------
happen how does this happen so what with


---------04:49----------
you you said something more along the


---------04:51----------
lines of your parents or your dad sort


---------04:54----------
of kicked you to go to India yeah well


---------04:57----------
there yeah so was it that sort of like


---------04:59----------
support structure that kicked you and


---------05:00----------
made you do that sort of the start of


---------05:02----------
your journey to transition absolutely


---------05:04----------
right so that falls under personal


---------05:06----------
experience though right that has nothing


---------05:08----------
to do with recognizing that the the


---------05:12----------
modern world has its has a lack of


---------05:15----------
meaning you with me yeah you're spot on


---------05:19----------
that that was crucial to my journey but


---------05:21----------
that was part of like making me who I am


---------05:24----------
so then ones are the meditation itself


---------05:27----------
nope


---------05:28----------
right so meditation falls under this too


---------05:30----------
so so you guys are saying that like okay


---------05:33----------
now I'm trying to help other people


---------05:34----------
that's my Dharma I agree a Oh a healing


---------05:37----------
lack of like someone said something


---------05:39----------
about how young men are directionless in


---------05:41----------
life right now and so that might harm us


---------05:44----------
to help them but how did I get from


---------05:46----------
meditating to in India to all of this


---------05:49----------
stuff right so you can even say med


---------05:52----------
school Harvard and II it's a truth right


---------05:57----------
those are all personal experiences how


---------06:00----------
do this is this is the key thing you're


---------06:02----------
all are spot-on recognition of a need to


---------06:05----------
be fulfilled yeah I'm sorry I really


---------06:10----------
don't understand the question that sorry


---------06:12----------
did you really I used to talk about how


---------06:14----------
your Dharma has changed and how you know


---------06:16----------
so this is good I'm glad you cuz this is


---------06:18----------
what everyone is missing when they think


---------06:20----------
about Dharma right so I want you guys to


---------06:22----------
think about so I was this person right


---------06:25----------
this is me like five years ago


---------06:28----------
I was oh I know I know


---------06:32----------
so for one I'm sure that you absorbed a


---------06:34----------
lot of media and like from there you


---------06:36----------
sort of derive like a lot of yourself so


---------06:38----------
like maybe you identified with


---------06:39----------
characters in certain games maybe you


---------06:40----------
identified with like certain motifs and


---------06:42----------
movies and stuff and then like from


---------06:44----------
there you sort of derived like oh this


---------06:45----------
is who I ought to be in life you know


---------06:47----------
maybe I want to be like this healer


---------06:48----------
character oh he'll be like this I don't


---------06:50----------
know that's nope that's actually


---------06:51----------
incorrect right so the and it's it's a


---------06:54----------
weird question I'm not trying to get you


---------06:56----------
guys to feel stupid I'm really not but


---------06:58----------
it's it's something that we've never


---------06:59----------
talked about on stream before and it's


---------07:01----------
something that's a gaping hole when it


---------07:03----------
comes to Dharma so I'll tell you guys in


---------07:07----------
the moment that I realized that this is


---------07:08----------
a need that needs to be fulfilled so I


---------07:11----------
did I posted on reddit and I did an AMA


---------07:13----------
like back in 2000 19 or 18 I forget now


---------07:16----------
because it's blurry I think September of


---------07:17----------
2018 and after that AMA I decided oh


---------07:23----------
there's a need that needs to be


---------07:25----------
fulfilled so what do you guys think like


---------07:28----------
how does doing an AMA result in my


---------07:32----------
recognition that a need has to be


---------07:35----------
fulfilled you get a lot of response to


---------07:37----------
that AMA in both itself and in personal


---------07:41----------
messages afterwards and you realize it


---------07:45----------
that so you've talked about your


---------07:47----------
experience with a mentor of yours saying


---------07:50----------
that that the need to play video games


---------07:55----------
is similar to they need to get a tattoo


---------07:57----------
and that didn't make any sense to you so


---------07:59----------
and then that combined with the fact


---------08:03----------
that gamers seem to mmm seem to mostly


---------08:09----------
be searching for some sort of help okay


---------08:12----------
so spot-on right so like what do you


---------08:16----------
guys think so from the other people who


---------08:17----------
heard capture God's answer what do you


---------08:20----------
guys think is the most important thing


---------08:22----------
out of everything he said in terms of


---------08:24----------
helping me discover my Dharma didn't


---------08:27----------
know no people reaching out to you and


---------08:28----------
your your site into how many people


---------08:32----------
needed help so this is very important


---------08:35----------
this is karma okay so karma is karma


---------08:40----------
which is the principle of cause and


---------08:41----------
effect so in its simplest form is if I


---------08:45----------
throw up all


---------08:45----------
up in the air the ball is gonna come


---------08:47----------
down that's just all that karma says but


---------08:49----------
the big thing that most people are


---------08:51----------
missing when it comes to their Dharma is


---------08:53----------
that Dharma is not a sole endeavor if no


---------08:57----------
one upvoted the ama and it just never


---------09:00----------
got any traction we would literally not


---------09:01----------
be here right now


---------09:02----------
the world has to give me something to


---------09:05----------
let me know what it wants you guys get


---------09:08----------
that like without this critical step if


---------09:12----------
we take this away this never gets


---------09:14----------
connected these two things never get


---------09:16----------
connected in addition to that in


---------09:20----------
addition to that isn't there the the


---------09:22----------
reckful interview which should give that


---------09:25----------
a lot of people want which specifically


---------09:28----------
wanted to hear what you had absolutely


---------09:30----------
right so just think about this for a


---------09:33----------
second so if I'm sitting at home and I'm


---------09:36----------
trying to figure out my Dharma how


---------09:38----------
successful am I gonna be probably very


---------09:42----------
unsuccessful but why


---------09:44----------
well because you know it's this


---------09:46----------
principle of karma that you're talking


---------09:47----------
about now you're not getting positive


---------09:49----------
outreach not getting any feedback that


---------09:51----------
will allow you to change anything here


---------09:52----------
yes so now I'm gonna give you guys


---------09:55----------
another question so if I'm a doctor and


---------09:57----------
I'm working in the emergency room how do


---------10:01----------
I know what my Dharma on that shift is


---------10:04----------
what's my time on that shift to have a


---------10:08----------
more firm and actually to serve other


---------10:09----------
people and help me so serve other people


---------10:11----------
abstractly like am i sitting there and


---------10:13----------
I'm saying specifically that you're


---------10:15----------
assigned and how do but how do I know


---------10:17----------
like how do I figure out my Dharma huge


---------10:20----------
eat


---------10:21----------
like by their responses by what they


---------10:23----------
tell somebody comes in and needs Oh


---------10:25----------
exactly Jake exactly so you guys have to


---------10:29----------
understand that Dharma is not a sole


---------10:31----------
pursuit right Dharma is about what the


---------10:35----------
world tells you it needs so if someone


---------10:38----------
comes in after a motor vehicle accident


---------10:40----------
that is a different Dharma from someone


---------10:42----------
coming in because they're having an


---------10:43----------
allergic reaction


---------10:44----------
my daughter Maude depends on what the


---------10:46----------
world sends my way and this is the thing


---------10:49----------
that everyone is currently missing


---------10:50----------
because I haven't explained it because


---------10:52----------
we just haven't gotten that far but it's


---------10:53----------
amazing that we're able to get here


---------10:55----------
because I get thousands of questions


---------10:56----------
about how do I find my Dharma and I'm


---------10:58----------
trying to I don't know how to explain to


---------11:00----------
people besides doing something like this


---------11:01----------
that you guys understand so my Dharma is


---------11:03----------
clear but who discovered my Dharma was


---------11:07----------
it something that I found out like by


---------11:08----------
myself world discovery Dharma for you


---------11:12----------
yes right that my Dharma is is a is a a


---------11:17----------
meeting between who I am and what the


---------11:22----------
world asks of me that's Donna so if you


---------11:25----------
think about Rosa Parks or MLK or Mahatma


---------11:28----------
Gandhi right these are people that were


---------11:31----------
just like certain like or relatively


---------11:33----------
like normal people because at the end of


---------11:35----------
the day we're all normal people and then


---------11:37----------
the world shows up and ask something of


---------11:39----------
you and then the question is are you


---------11:42----------
prepared to actually do it yes so what


---------11:47----------
if you're not prepared so then what do


---------11:50----------
you got where do you think you should


---------11:51----------
start now let's go back in time and you


---------11:55----------
guys be my teacher and you take 18 year


---------11:58----------
old me who's failing out of college and


---------12:00----------
I come to you guys and I say what is my


---------12:03----------
Dharma and what do you tell me it's


---------12:08----------
impossible to know honestly can I like


---------12:11----------
pose a question because I don't know if


---------12:12----------
I fully understand the concept here sure


---------12:15----------
do you think that like your purpose in


---------12:18----------
life your Dharma is what you call it is


---------12:20----------
necessarily dependent on what society


---------12:22----------
demands of you and like what people like


---------12:24----------
and the reason I say this is because so


---------12:26----------
many of the people that I admire and


---------12:27----------
look up to especially in history they're


---------12:29----------
they seem to be like totally independent


---------12:31----------
from their time right so like so many


---------12:33----------
great artists and stuff they weren't


---------12:34----------
making art to make other people happy


---------12:36----------
they made it to make their like own


---------12:37----------
Souls fulfilled I don't know yeah that's


---------12:40----------
a great question so I think that that it


---------12:42----------
I don't think that your Dharma has to


---------12:44----------
cater to what society wants I think that


---------12:48----------
in that moment they were doing their


---------12:51----------
Dharma because actually what society


---------12:53----------
needed especially if you look at


---------12:54----------
something like art the whole point about


---------12:56----------
why important art is important is


---------12:58----------
because it changes and pushes society


---------13:01----------
forward right it's not accepting where


---------13:03----------
society is it's pushing things forward


---------13:05----------
if we think about what my Dharma is it's


---------13:09----------
pushing things forward and karma doesn't


---------13:11----------
have to be grandiose because you guys


---------13:14----------
like you know I'm glad someone mentioned


---------13:15----------
this because at the end of the day if I


---------13:18----------
had to rank my Dharma this is how I do


---------13:21----------
it right and then this is two plus so


---------13:28----------
like so what about the people that


---------13:30----------
hundreds of millions of people that we


---------13:33----------
are not going to have a huge impact on


---------13:35----------
the world so that's the thing is people


---------13:40----------
are confusing Dharma with like grand


---------13:42----------
things but karma is not grandiose and


---------13:45----------
that's just because the examples that we


---------13:47----------
use tend to be grandiose like Rosa Parks


---------13:49----------
or MLK or whatever right like AoE


---------13:52----------
healing but you guys have to understand


---------13:54----------
that like that doesn't my first term Oz


---------13:57----------
to my family and the only reason that my


---------14:00----------
Dharma got big is because the world


---------14:03----------
asked it of me but at the end of the day


---------14:06----------
like this in this if we take this out


---------14:09----------
and we delete all this that's enough


---------14:16----------
right it's enough for me to just be a


---------14:18----------
doctor and try to help people who come


---------14:20----------
into my office with depression every day


---------14:23----------
it's enough to like raise my kids and


---------14:25----------
raise them to be decent human beings


---------14:27----------
it's enough that's something you're


---------14:30----------
gonna have to figure out on your own but


---------14:32----------
I don't want to I don't want to keep


---------14:34----------
butting in but go for it I'm just like


---------14:36----------
very concerned that this all seems like


---------14:39----------
too much like adherent to society in a


---------14:41----------
way that I think could be really


---------14:42----------
negative like for instance you put like


---------14:44----------
family up there's number one I don't


---------14:45----------
have a very strong connection to my


---------14:47----------
family and I think disconnecting myself


---------14:49----------
from my family has actually been like


---------14:51----------
one of the best things that I've had to


---------14:52----------
do in my life so instead of like


---------14:55----------
developing my sense of meaning from


---------14:56----------
other people around me ask of me I think


---------14:59----------
rationally like about like oh what are


---------15:01----------
the things I enjoy to do most in life


---------15:02----------
what do I think people need the most in


---------15:04----------
life I don't let other people make that


---------15:06----------
failing for me


---------15:06----------
I sort of like derive it on my own using


---------15:09----------
like logic and reason is that like I


---------15:10----------
don't know you might be saying the same


---------15:12----------
thing but phrasing it differently just


---------15:13----------
tell me about it yeah so I think that's


---------15:15----------
a great thing because here's the thing I


---------15:17----------
had a loving family right digital


---------15:20----------
dystopia you did not so like how many


---------15:23----------
people out there do you think have a


---------15:24----------
loving family like what percent on


---------15:27----------
people


---------15:27----------
it depends obviously on the location but


---------15:30----------
I mean like half the people are divorced


---------15:32----------
now right I'm pretty sure like that's


---------15:35----------
way less than what it should so we


---------15:37----------
talked earlier about how my personal


---------15:39----------
experience


---------15:39----------
helps me do a Oh a healing at this point


---------15:42----------
so when it comes to someone who has a


---------15:45----------
broken family who do you think has a


---------15:48----------
better


---------15:49----------
garma in order to help them me or you I


---------15:54----------
don't know I really can answer


---------15:57----------
use I mean you because you're more


---------15:59----------
established in your in a situation in


---------16:01----------
your life where you can't help them


---------16:02----------
comfortably right so I think that if


---------16:07----------
digital dystopia thinks that like so I


---------16:09----------
I'm not saying that family should be at


---------16:11----------
the top of everyone's Therma that's just


---------16:13----------
that what's at the top of mine because


---------16:14----------
I've chosen to have a family and in your


---------16:17----------
case your experiences are different and


---------16:19----------
if you don't want to live based on


---------16:21----------
society what society is telling you I


---------16:23----------
think that's fantastic I think that's


---------16:24----------
part of your Dharma I think part of your


---------16:26----------
Dharma is to figure out okay for all the


---------16:29----------
people out there for whom society's


---------16:31----------
formulas do not work you can be an


---------16:34----------
example to those people yeah you can


---------16:38----------
help me those people it's not Dharma


---------16:39----------
that's bothering me it's Karma because


---------16:41----------
you were telling me you have to derive


---------16:43----------
your Dharma from like what other people


---------16:45----------
are demanding what other people are


---------16:46----------
telling you and sometimes what other


---------16:48----------
people demand is wrong and it's not


---------16:50----------
actually good and right absolutely right


---------16:54----------
so when Rosa Parks was sitting at the


---------16:56----------
front of the bus sorry I don't know how


---------16:57----------
much you guys know about like the


---------16:58----------
American civil rights movement garma was


---------17:01----------
telling her you got to go sit at the


---------17:03----------
back of the bus because you're black


---------17:04----------
that's what society was asking her what


---------17:06----------
did she do


---------17:08----------
yes she sat in the front because


---------17:10----------
obviously it was better for society in


---------17:12----------
the long term it's irrational in the


---------17:13----------
service so she decided that I'm gonna


---------17:15----------
say I'm gonna flip the middle finger to


---------17:17----------
society and I'm gonna do what I want


---------17:19----------
because I think it is your I think it is


---------17:21----------
right and what I'm hearing you say


---------17:23----------
digital dystopia is that like you are


---------17:25----------
doing that same thing you are not


---------17:27----------
trusting society you are not trusting


---------17:29----------
society's values and you are figuring


---------17:31----------
out your own way forward and that is an


---------17:33----------
incredibly important journey not only


---------17:35----------
for yourself but I suspect for other


---------17:37----------
people should karma show up one day and


---------17:40----------
someone is gonna ask you for help you're


---------17:42----------
gonna open your mouth one day and people


---------17:44----------
are gonna be listening and then


---------17:45----------
someone's gonna be like hey man I really


---------17:47----------
liked what you said can you tell me a


---------17:49----------
little bit about like how you learned


---------17:50----------
how you figured that out


---------17:52----------
that's your so your your suggestion to


---------17:55----------
people who are in very toxic situations


---------17:58----------
with their family or with their loved


---------18:00----------
ones or whatever is to just focus on


---------18:03----------
themselves and and be as morally right


---------18:07----------
as they can be and the people in their


---------18:10----------
life will eventually


---------18:11----------
come along no no I mean so I think I


---------18:14----------
agree with everything except for the


---------18:15----------
last part right so doing your Dharma if


---------18:17----------
you're in a family situation that sucks


---------18:19----------
I think it is important to do your


---------18:21----------
Dharma in that family situation but this


---------18:23----------
is where doing your Dharma in the family


---------18:25----------
situation doesn't mean repairing the


---------18:27----------
family sometimes like you have a Dharma


---------18:29----------
to yourself and you haven't ARMA to your


---------18:30----------
family and there's a difference between


---------18:32----------
doing the best that you can and then


---------18:34----------
letting them go if they're not willing


---------18:36----------
to meet you halfway and like sacrificing


---------18:41----------
everything that you are to make your


---------18:43----------
family happy which I don't think is a


---------18:44----------
good idea


---------18:45----------
right so I think doing your Dharma is


---------18:47----------
not about a particular outcome it's like


---------18:49----------
okay I gave so my family is [ __ ] up


---------18:51----------
and I did the best that I could to like


---------18:54----------
really try to make a relationship with


---------18:56----------
them but my dad is narcissistic and my


---------18:58----------
mom has borderline personality disorder


---------19:00----------
and they're just not willing to meet me


---------19:02----------
halfway then you let them go and you go


---------19:04----------
on and you live your own life and you


---------19:06----------
find someone that you care about and you


---------19:08----------
build your own family of people that


---------19:09----------
you're loyal to you cannot fix your


---------19:12----------
family dynamics and it is not karma is


---------19:14----------
not about an outcome it's about your


---------19:16----------
actions right did you do enough and if


---------19:19----------
you did enough you should be able to


---------19:20----------
walk away without regret you walk away


---------19:23----------
with peace you say you know I did the


---------19:24----------
best that I could but like it takes it


---------19:26----------
takes two to make a relationship work


---------19:29----------
antara is about doing your part and once


---------19:32----------
you walk away for the next five years


---------19:34----------
you tell yourself okay on Christmas in


---------19:36----------
their birthday I'm gonna call them and


---------19:38----------
I'm gonna send them a card and you you


---------19:40----------
set that up in your mind you say that's


---------19:41----------
what I'm gonna do and over the next five


---------19:44----------
years you do that thing and you stick to


---------19:46----------
your Dharma and they never call you on


---------19:47----------
your birthday and they never send you a


---------19:49----------
card on year six done you did your part


---------19:52----------
and you walk away with it peacefully


---------19:54----------
that makes okay I have a slight question


---------19:57----------
and this is gonna be controversial go


---------20:00----------
for it


---------20:01----------
so so what about how do you know that


---------20:05----------
your Dharma is right so the the


---------20:09----------
situation I'm thinking of is a person


---------20:10----------
who believes that their Dharma is to


---------20:15----------
convince the world that races should not


---------20:19----------
be equal something like that right which


---------20:21----------
is going to be very controversial but


---------20:23----------
somebody could potential


---------20:25----------
believe that and believe it very


---------20:27----------
strongly and believe that that is their


---------20:28----------
Dharma so how can you tell if that's the


---------20:33----------
wrong thing to be doing great question


---------20:35----------
so let me put it to you this way uh when


---------20:41----------
whenever we think things we think we're


---------20:43----------
right right like so like I wouldn't say


---------20:48----------
that okay so I think you're in the


---------20:50----------
minority but generally speaking when our


---------20:52----------
mind comes to a conclusion most people


---------20:56----------
respond to that conclusion as if it's


---------20:59----------
correct like when I walk to the bathroom


---------21:01----------
I have the assumption that if I flood


---------21:04----------
like pull the handle on the flush that


---------21:06----------
the toilet will flush and I operate


---------21:09----------
through my day in most of the time like


---------21:10----------
my mind is like giving me off like


---------21:12----------
hypotheses which I just sort of trust to


---------21:15----------
be correct and most human beings think


---------21:18----------
that their thoughts are correct I'd say


---------21:22----------
it depends but in general I'll follow


---------21:24----------
you and say yeah yeah so I think it's


---------21:26----------
good for you to say that you don't think


---------21:28----------
that way because but I think that's rare


---------21:30----------
I think if you just like go on Reddit


---------21:32----------
and you post an opinion most of the


---------21:34----------
responses that you're gonna get on


---------21:36----------
reddit are not gonna have like some


---------21:37----------
degree of self reflection they're gonna


---------21:39----------
have people telling you that that you're


---------21:41----------
wrong in there right right and to be


---------21:43----------
clear my question is oriented towards


---------21:46----------
the direction of how do you convince


---------21:48----------
those people who you believe are clearly


---------21:51----------
in the wrong but they believe they're


---------21:53----------
clearly in the that okay so I'm their


---------21:55----------
Dharma correct because it applies to


---------21:58----------
them like if they honestly believe that


---------22:00----------
they should pursue this like racist


---------22:02----------
ideal is that actually their Dharma even


---------22:04----------
though it's objectively bad for society


---------22:06----------
but they okay if it's correct you're


---------22:08----------
changing the question Captagon


---------22:09----------
the question that you asked is if I


---------22:12----------
believe something how do I know that my


---------22:14----------
Dharma is correct that's different from


---------22:16----------
if I believe if someone else believes


---------22:18----------
something is correct how do I convince


---------22:20----------
them otherwise those are two separate


---------22:21----------
questions right no I don't think they


---------22:24----------
are I think they are so I think figuring


---------22:26----------
out your Dharma is very different from


---------22:29----------
convincing someone else of their Dharma


---------22:32----------
one is subjective one relates to another


---------22:34----------
human being do you with me um I think it


---------22:40----------
depends on how you classify ideas that's


---------22:43----------
not bullying you if you treat all ideas


---------22:46----------
as equal to begin with and then evaluate


---------22:50----------
them sort of depending on their validity


---------22:52----------
they're the result they give then you


---------22:58----------
can come to different different


---------23:00----------
conclusions than if you try to take a


---------23:02----------
moral stance okay I I don't know what


---------23:05----------
you just said you just lost me but I'm


---------23:07----------
gonna try to I'm not sure either so okay


---------23:09----------
so so this is what I understood your


---------23:10----------
first question to be let's say that I


---------23:13----------
believe I haven't ARMA and that that


---------23:15----------
adharma is negative or positive how do I


---------23:18----------
know whether like my Dharma how do I


---------23:20----------
objectively reflect upon whether my


---------23:23----------
Dharma is correct or incorrect that's


---------23:25----------
what I understood your first question to


---------23:27----------
be it wasn't about changing anyone's


---------23:29----------
mind about anything it was about like


---------23:30----------
introspection and figuring out your own


---------23:32----------
karma right I guess it's that there are


---------23:37----------
different sets of ideas which appear to


---------23:39----------
be self-evident if you believe in them


---------23:42----------
and if you fall within one of these sets


---------23:47----------
of ideas then you can believe one thing


---------23:49----------
to be morally right sure whereas another


---------23:53----------
set of ideas will have that thing to be


---------23:56----------
morally abhorrent fine so capture God


---------23:58----------
the question that so you're talking


---------24:00----------
about something that sounds a little bit


---------24:01----------
philosophical my main question for you


---------24:04----------
is I heard two separate questions one is


---------24:07----------
about within you and one is you


---------24:09----------
interacting with another human being


---------24:11----------
whatever constructive ideas or whatever


---------24:13----------
you want to talk about is fine but like


---------24:15----------
do you see that those are fundamentally


---------24:16----------
different things that when I figure out


---------24:19----------
for myself and be trying to convince the


---------24:21----------
world of something else


---------24:22----------
those are like different endeavors sort


---------24:28----------
of I seem is different


---------24:31----------
okay so like what I'm talking about is


---------24:34----------
is figuring something out for yourself


---------24:36----------
and trying to convince another human


---------24:38----------
being are like two completely different


---------24:40----------
things like to me those are


---------24:43----------
fundamentally different and I'm just


---------24:44----------
trying to get a sense of whether yeah


---------24:46----------
it's it's a two-way relationship you


---------24:48----------
know like right there's a but this way


---------24:52----------
capture God there's a difference between


---------24:53----------
me figuring out what do I want to eat


---------24:56----------
for dinner tonight and me convincing my


---------24:58----------
wife that we should eat something else


---------25:00----------
right right so I guess my my my main


---------25:06----------
thing that I'm latching on to for no


---------25:09----------
particular reason is that there are


---------25:11----------
different sets of ideas in the world and


---------25:12----------
not necessarily that you should try and


---------25:14----------
convince someone else of their ideas or


---------25:17----------
not not that usually convince someone


---------25:19----------
else that your ideas are correct over


---------25:21----------
theirs but rather how do you how do you


---------25:26----------
make those ideas fit with each other how


---------25:29----------
how is there some sort of one dharma


---------25:31----------
whereas there are a lot of different


---------25:35----------
ideas in the world there isn't one


---------25:38----------
Dharma okay so I I really don't I think


---------25:40----------
you're you're I don't know what you're


---------25:43----------
so I hear what you're saying I think


---------25:45----------
it's it's a slightly separate direction


---------25:49----------
from when where I was hoping to go sure


---------25:54----------
I'm just raising questions that I think


---------25:56----------
will be relevant yeah I appreciate you


---------25:58----------
raising the questions but I mean I think


---------26:02----------
the first question you asked was the


---------26:03----------
closest to the relevance of what we're


---------26:05----------
talking about is like which i think is


---------26:06----------
like how do you know whether your dharma


---------26:08----------
is correct dr. kay can I ask a very


---------26:12----------
essential question to this sure okay


---------26:15----------
this is like really the crux to my my


---------26:18----------
discussion here at all I might be


---------26:20----------
jumping the gun here but like what's the


---------26:22----------
utility of the karma aspect I think


---------26:24----------
that's a prime aspect where you get the


---------26:26----------
admiration of other people because like


---------26:27----------
I've lived my life thinking that I have


---------26:29----------
to make up my goal is totally


---------26:30----------
independently from the others around me


---------26:32----------
and that's like what I seem to hear from


---------26:33----------
basically everyone right that you want


---------26:35----------
to derive your own purpose from reality


---------26:37----------
not that like you want to let other


---------26:38----------
people influence you but that you use


---------26:40----------
your mind your reasoning your logic to


---------26:41----------
figure out what you enjoy most and then


---------26:43----------
you pursue that what's the utility of


---------26:45----------
like


---------26:45----------
allowing other people to determine that


---------26:46----------
for you partially yes so I I don't I I


---------26:50----------
don't I sort of disagree with the


---------26:51----------
premise of your question so the first


---------26:53----------
thing is use the word admiration as a


---------26:55----------
correlation with government right karma


---------26:58----------
is not about admiration as nothing that


---------27:00----------
admiration is about ego so I don't think


---------27:02----------
that you should develop your Dharma


---------27:03----------
based on the admiration of others I


---------27:05----------
think you should develop your Dharma


---------27:07----------
based on Karma which is your


---------27:09----------
circumstance so in my case you know when


---------27:12----------
I did the reddit AMA like people said


---------27:14----------
like hey so I mean I definitely got an


---------27:17----------
ego boost from it but then I noticed


---------27:19----------
that ego and I was kind of like okay at


---------27:21----------
the end of the day like let's just set


---------27:23----------
the ego aside a lot of people think I'm


---------27:25----------
smart that's kind of cool but if I stop


---------27:29----------
and really think and I set my ego aside


---------27:31----------
the bigger issue is that a lot of people


---------27:33----------
need help and I don't think that has


---------27:34----------
anything to add narration I think it's


---------27:36----------
just like they need help and so that


---------27:39----------
drove me feel like you're determining


---------27:41----------
that on your own you're not determining


---------27:43----------
that because you're like because you


---------27:45----------
know like you're determining whether


---------27:47----------
people actually have a demand for


---------27:48----------
something totally independently right so


---------27:50----------
Rosa Parks made the decision


---------27:52----------
independently that racism yes and even


---------27:54----------
has a sequencer did okay but you're


---------27:56----------
still saying that I mean what if someone


---------27:59----------
this might sound crazy but like what if


---------28:01----------
someone doesn't really find much


---------28:02----------
pleasure in like serving others in this


---------28:05----------
way yeah that's fine that's that's okay


---------28:08----------
like I'm not trying to attribute a value


---------28:10----------
judgement towards doing something I


---------28:13----------
think we're getting a little bit I


---------28:14----------
appreciate y'all's questions I'm I love


---------28:15----------
these kinds of discussions but I'm


---------28:17----------
wondering if like we're going a little


---------28:19----------
bit too far afield of the main topic


---------28:21----------
which is how good and yes let me just a


---------28:25----------
little cab on screen yeah sure so let me


---------28:27----------
just try to let me try to just summarize


---------28:30----------
because I think you guys basically gave


---------28:32----------
I mean I'm not trying to say y'all are


---------28:34----------
allowed to give me the answers that I


---------28:36----------
don't want but I think you guys you guys


---------28:41----------
filled in the main gap which I think you


---------28:42----------
guys did a good job of okay see that


---------28:47----------
helps a lot now it's duty it's not I


---------28:49----------
thought it was purpose in like your


---------28:50----------
individual sense no so so and I think


---------28:53----------
here's the main thing to remember so if


---------28:55----------
you're looking for your Dharma the first


---------28:57----------
phase is to prepare


---------28:58----------
right so this is what brahmacari ashram


---------29:01----------
means it's like to be a student so you


---------29:03----------
don't know what life is gonna throw at


---------29:04----------
you you don't know what life is gonna


---------29:06----------
demand a view or in digital dystopias


---------29:09----------
case you don't know what you're gonna


---------29:10----------
demand of yourself right and so you


---------29:13----------
don't know like ten years from now if


---------29:15----------
you come to a particular conclusion that


---------29:17----------
a certain thing is good or a certain


---------29:18----------
thing is bad you need to prepare


---------29:20----------
yourself for that eventualities so


---------29:23----------
everyone's first thought MA is to


---------29:24----------
themselves that you should learn and


---------29:27----------
grow and understand how you work and


---------29:28----------
formulate thoughts about who you believe


---------29:31----------
who you are what you believe the rest of


---------29:33----------
the world is and to prepare and this


---------29:37----------
isn't just this doesn't mean getting a


---------29:39----------
degree it doesn't mean becoming a doctor


---------29:40----------
it doesn't like I'm not trying to put a


---------29:42----------
value judgment on helping other people


---------29:44----------
or things like that


---------29:45----------
because at the end of the day there are


---------29:46----------
people who become monks and go and sit


---------29:49----------
in a cave in the Himalayas for their


---------29:50----------
entire life and that's their hanuman


---------29:54----------
they're not helping anyone they're just


---------29:55----------
hanging out there because that's what


---------29:56----------
they've determined they need to do in


---------29:57----------
their life I do not judge them I do not


---------29:59----------
say that my Dharma is better than theirs


---------30:00----------
so your Dharma does change over time


---------30:03----------
though absolutely because okay just like


---------30:06----------
I said no it didn't and so I was


---------30:08----------
confused and then I had to listen for a


---------30:10----------
while to see like why house yeah I was


---------30:13----------
okay but I'm back on it and then what


---------30:16----------
happens as you prepare life is gonna


---------30:19----------
send you some stuff right if you


---------30:21----------
interact with the world life is gonna


---------30:23----------
send you things like it's gonna give you


---------30:26----------
bosses it's gonna give you job


---------30:28----------
opportunities it's gonna give you family


---------30:30----------
members it's gonna give you friends and


---------30:32----------
sometimes in my case it's gonna give you


---------30:34----------
the Internet that wants to know more


---------30:36----------
about what you think and then you have


---------30:39----------
to rise to that challenge but that's


---------30:41----------
determined by karma and everyone's got


---------30:46----------
amaz different right so my Dharma is


---------30:48----------
determined by my Karma but digital


---------30:50----------
dystopias karma is different his family


---------30:52----------
is different his upbringing is different


---------30:54----------
his skills are different that's all


---------30:55----------
encapsulated with Dharma that


---------30:56----------
circumstance that is your Karma


---------30:59----------
yes chad is my karma oh and then what


---------31:02----------
happens is if you're thoughtful you come


---------31:05----------
up with your Dharma


---------31:07----------
so this Terramax I had before I had this


---------31:09----------
one right so so like a Oh a healing is


---------31:13----------
like a relatively recent thing but I had


---------31:14----------
it when I first came back in 2015 and


---------31:16----------
then the reddit was in 2018 and so your


---------31:19----------
thought about changes over time


---------31:21----------
and so absolutely so I'd say that the


---------31:24----------
first thing that you guys need to do if


---------31:26----------
you're looking for your entitlement is


---------31:28----------
prepare just understand that it doesn't


---------31:31----------
matter what life throws at you if you're


---------31:33----------
physically fit you're gonna be better at


---------31:35----------
it if you're mentally fit you're gonna


---------31:36----------
be better at it that you should learn as


---------31:38----------
much as you can you want to learn coding


---------31:40----------
go for it because if you learn coding


---------31:42----------
that may influence your government and


---------31:44----------
one day you may have the opportunity to


---------31:45----------
develop an app but that's only gonna


---------31:47----------
work if you learned how to code and the


---------31:51----------
other way to think about it is like now


---------31:52----------
people are asking me for help and like


---------31:56----------
that depends on this if I had not done


---------32:00----------
these things I wouldn't be able to help


---------32:02----------
anyone


---------32:02----------
or maybe I would but the capacity that I


---------32:05----------
have to help is determined by my


---------32:07----------
experiences and is determined by what I


---------32:09----------
do and also the shortcomings that I have


---------32:12----------
because I'm not able to help everyone


---------32:14----------
right there are some people that are not


---------32:16----------
gonna understand what I'm saying or not


---------32:18----------
gonna agree with what I'm saying and


---------32:19----------
that's perfectly fine I'm not saying I'm


---------32:22----------
right but that I'm gonna have


---------32:23----------
limitations too because I can't do


---------32:25----------
everything and that's determined because


---------32:27----------
when I was in India at the end of the


---------32:29----------
day like after I came back from India


---------32:30----------
and I was in the u.s. I still played


---------32:32----------
Warcraft 3 I still play dota if I had


---------32:34----------
studied harder maybe I would be able to


---------32:36----------
like do a better job today on stream if


---------32:38----------
I had studied harder at any point I


---------32:40----------
could have done a better job with any of


---------32:42----------
the people that I've talked to it's


---------32:43----------
possible but at this point I think the


---------32:46----------
main thing you need to do is prepare


---------32:48----------
prepare the third strength-building for


---------32:51----------
the raid and it doesn't because here's


---------32:53----------
the thing if you guys are playing the


---------32:55----------
game of life it doesn't matter


---------32:57----------
like what you are like ultimately when


---------32:59----------
you play a game you have to play the


---------33:01----------
character that you're playing so like


---------33:03----------
level up your character because the rest


---------33:05----------
of it is all circumstance whether you're


---------33:07----------
a doctor an engineer a monk a father


---------33:11----------
a truck driver it doesn't matter at the


---------33:13----------
end of the day you still are like


---------33:15----------
controlling player1 right so we're gone


---------33:17----------
player 1 that's Dharma number 1 it's


---------33:20----------
like make player 1 level up player 1 the


---------33:22----------
best that you can and then yes yeah so I


---------33:31----------
recently found myself in a situation


---------33:33----------
where I think my Dharma has changed or


---------33:35----------
I've gotten a new responsibility per se


---------33:37----------
I don't have the background to deal with


---------33:41----------
that is it now my like responsibility if


---------33:45----------
this is something that I want to do to


---------33:47----------
prepare to go through those steps or


---------33:50----------
should I push them off to someone who


---------33:52----------
you know might have uh who might be able


---------33:55----------
to help them now I'm gonna let the rest


---------33:57----------
of the people in the in in this


---------33:58----------
discordant I'll try okay so I mean this


---------34:01----------
is from a totally outside perspective


---------34:03----------
with like no connection to like Hindu


---------34:04----------
spiritualism or anything just like


---------34:06----------
whenever you encounter a new challenge


---------34:08----------
in life right you want to gradually


---------34:09----------
build up your strength so that you can


---------34:11----------
overcome it eventually right so take


---------34:13----------
incremental steps to like improve your


---------34:16----------
ability to cope with it right now and


---------34:18----------
obviously don't expect perfection of


---------34:20----------
yourself immediately so I don't know for


---------34:21----------
instance if you're putting like a huge


---------34:23----------
social environment like maybe you go to


---------34:24----------
college and you're struggling to be


---------34:26----------
outgoing well maybe the first day you


---------34:28----------
should look and you smile and wave at


---------34:30----------
people but that's it and then the next


---------34:32----------
day or like a few days later you can


---------34:34----------
move that up to like starting new


---------34:36----------
conversations with people and eventually


---------34:37----------
you can become totally socially that


---------34:39----------
it's just self-improvement


---------34:41----------
does that answer your question flapjack


---------34:43----------
uh yeah a little bit I mean it does have


---------34:47----------
an answer and passion what was that what


---------34:52----------
do you say I'm just wondering if someone


---------34:54----------
else has an answer for flapjacks


---------34:55----------
question I think flap said something but


---------34:57----------
I cut off oh I was just talking you know


---------35:01----------
that this this is a background I think I


---------35:03----------
would want to pursue so what you're


---------35:04----------
saying makes sense just like slowly


---------35:06----------
level up but I'm wondering if it's worth


---------35:08----------
it to just sort of drop what I'm doing


---------35:09----------
and really try to go that well what do


---------35:14----------
you want do you want to achieve it or


---------35:15----------
not that's what you have to determine


---------35:19----------
and you can only determine that like


---------35:21----------
through really really critical thinking


---------35:23----------
maybe meditation you know I'm like more


---------35:26----------
of a secular person this so I don't


---------35:27----------
really suggest that stuff as much but


---------35:29----------
just like you know consider the things


---------35:31----------
you value most figure out what you like


---------35:33----------
in life what you don't like and it's


---------35:35----------
it's a tough decision but you have to


---------35:37----------
take risks like this in life so either


---------35:39----------
yes or no either you know I'm going to


---------35:40----------
pursue this goal or not


---------35:41----------
let's see you so I said go for it


---------35:45----------
capture gun well I think it depends on


---------35:49----------
exactly what we're talking about but it


---------35:52----------
sounds like there's sort of a family


---------35:54----------
members in need or someone closer yours


---------35:58----------
in need who you feel like you could help


---------36:02----------
but if you do so it might be at the cost


---------36:05----------
of your own personal development is that


---------36:08----------
sound correct at all yes I mean that's


---------36:11----------
actually pretty spot-on and I've


---------36:13----------
actually already taken steps I think I


---------36:15----------
had contacted dr. K on reddit earlier


---------36:19----------
this week asking like how to become a


---------36:21----------
recovery coach just say well I want to


---------36:22----------
like take steps toward down that path if


---------36:25----------
I can and the only thing I'm not a


---------36:31----------
psychologist and I'm not qualified to


---------36:33----------
talk about this but I think the only


---------36:34----------
thing that really matters is helping


---------36:37----------
people understand themselves and sort of


---------36:40----------
in order to do that you have to be able


---------36:42----------
to understand them okay I think that


---------36:47----------
necessarily confliction I want to just


---------36:49----------
jump in for a second because I need to


---------36:51----------
get going first in a few minutes but


---------36:53----------
first of all I think this is great that


---------36:54----------
you guys are have


---------36:55----------
this discussion and I think this is why


---------36:57----------
we built this discord right so like for


---------36:59----------
people to work through their Dharma to


---------37:02----------
ask questions of each other to help


---------37:04----------
support each other I'll sort of offer


---------37:07----------
one or two kind of last thoughts and


---------37:09----------
then I'm gonna bounce but you guys by


---------37:11----------
all means can continue the discussion


---------37:12----------
the first talking on stream no I'm gonna


---------37:16----------
stop the stream but you guys the first


---------37:20----------
thing is that you know if you're not in


---------37:22----------
a position to help someone cut yourself


---------37:25----------
some slack


---------37:25----------
but at the same time that maybe your


---------37:27----------
karma telling you that you should


---------37:30----------
prepare in a particular way right so I


---------37:33----------
think if you want to like do something


---------37:34----------
and you feel like okay I really do want


---------37:36----------
to help this person but I'm not able to


---------37:37----------
that's not your fault that you can't


---------37:39----------
help them the last thing is I generally


---------37:42----------
tend to avoid statements like drop


---------37:44----------
things entirely because I think usually


---------37:46----------
there's some middle road so I just be


---------37:48----------
careful about that like you could


---------37:49----------
probably do more than one thing at once


---------37:52----------
and sacrifice is oftentimes you know it


---------37:56----------
should be the last resort not the first


---------37:57----------
resort but I think it's great that you


---------38:01----------
guys are thinking about this the last is


---------38:03----------
there was one question that people were


---------38:04----------
asking about like how do you know if


---------38:06----------
your Dharma is right or comes from a


---------38:07----------
good place and I thought capture or my


---------38:09----------
interpretation of capture God's question


---------38:12----------
I thought was a good one which doesn't


---------38:14----------
mean that his wasn't a good one it's


---------38:15----------
just I liked his question because it's


---------38:17----------
one that I wanted to answer we need to


---------38:19----------
misinterpret but I was trying to be yeah


---------38:21----------
so how do you know whether your Dharma


---------38:24----------
is like right or wrong like if I'm a


---------38:26----------
racist and I think that like you know


---------38:28----------
genocide needs to happen for a


---------38:30----------
particular race how do I know whether


---------38:33----------
that Dharma is correct or incorrect and


---------38:35----------
I think this is an excellent question


---------38:37----------
because it comes down to how do you know


---------38:41----------
when to trust your mind or to not trust


---------38:44----------
your mind so your mind comes up with


---------38:46----------
conclusions all the time about what you


---------38:48----------
should or shouldn't do but how do you


---------38:50----------
know whether that like whether to trust


---------38:53----------
what your mind is telling you or not


---------38:54----------
trust what your mind is telling you and


---------38:56----------
I think the short answer is you have to


---------38:59----------
figure out like where you got that


---------39:00----------
belief and for a lot of people who want


---------39:03----------
to hurt the world or do damage to other


---------39:06----------
people


---------39:07----------
their beliefs about inequality or that


---------39:10----------
things should be a particular way or


---------39:12----------
rooted an anger and in turn that anger


---------39:15----------
is oftentimes rooted in hatred I'm sorry


---------39:17----------
the angers we didn't hurt so people who


---------39:20----------
I've noticed that a lot of people who


---------39:22----------
hate in the world have liked like the


---------39:26----------
source of their hatred is some kind of


---------39:30----------
hurt and until you fully understand and


---------39:32----------
explore that I don't think that you can


---------39:34----------
really understand your karma and


---------39:36----------
generally speaking I think people who


---------39:38----------
determined that they're their course in


---------39:40----------
life is based out of being hurt in some


---------39:43----------
way you've got to be really careful with


---------39:45----------
that because I don't think that's a calm


---------39:46----------
or clear mind that's making that


---------39:48----------
decision okay I was just gonna say like


---------39:53----------
it's not necessarily true I think you


---------39:56----------
actually said this yourself that like


---------39:57----------
something rooted in hate is necessarily


---------39:59----------
like irrational because I think like a


---------40:01----------
lot of the things in my life that are


---------40:03----------
rooted in I mean not hatred for other


---------40:04----------
people but like hatred of some aspect of


---------40:06----------
reality like those are some of the


---------40:08----------
things I'm most proud than that like


---------40:09----------
give me the greatest sense of purpose in


---------40:11----------
life so it's not just the source but


---------40:13----------
like it's whether it's rationally


---------40:14----------
developed from that source of what


---------40:15----------
you're saying yeah so you should reflect


---------40:17----------
and understand I mean I I think I think


---------40:20----------
digital to Sophie I think you know


---------40:22----------
you're you're you you sort of set up a


---------40:24----------
circumstance or you're describing a


---------40:26----------
circumstance of your life in the way


---------40:27----------
that you approach things that I think


---------40:28----------
are a little bit unique which is cool


---------40:30----------
but I think in general what I would tell


---------40:34----------
people is if you're trying to understand


---------40:36----------
whether your Dharma is correct or


---------40:38----------
incorrect try to try to find like the


---------40:40----------
the origin of where you got the idea


---------40:43----------
that you're thinking about pursuing and


---------40:45----------
if you reflect upon that goes if you


---------40:48----------
reflect on it and then you decide okay


---------40:50----------
this is like this is the result of like


---------40:52----------
hatred or this is the result of like


---------40:53----------
rational thought or this is the result


---------40:55----------
of X Y or Z then then you'll kind of


---------40:58----------
know how to move forward and this is


---------41:00----------
something that even I struggle with


---------41:01----------
because I'm trying to understand like


---------41:02----------
what is my Dharma to like the people on


---------41:05----------
Street like what should I do with my


---------41:06----------
life now because I have a job I have a


---------41:08----------
family how do i reconcile the Dharma's


---------41:11----------
that I clearly have to my patience with


---------41:13----------
the Dharma's that I have for like twitch


---------41:15----------
and streaming and helping all these


---------41:17----------
people because there's ego and what I've


---------41:19----------
discovered is that there's ego there


---------41:21----------
right so part of when I say oh I want to


---------41:23----------
quit my job and I went stream full time


---------41:24----------
ego is a big part of that because I get


---------41:26----------
loved through stream in a way and by


---------41:30----------
many more people than I get loved in


---------41:32----------
regular life and so I should be careful


---------41:34----------
about what I determine my Dharma to be


---------41:36----------
as long as that ego is active so what's


---------41:38----------
the calculation or whatever you do to


---------41:40----------
figure out what you ought to do then I


---------41:42----------
mean so I think so I use a systematic


---------41:45----------
process of you know things like


---------41:47----------
meditation to reflect within myself and


---------41:49----------
see where the origin of things are


---------41:51----------
coming from and the more that I align


---------41:54----------
with helping an individual person or


---------41:57----------
just doing the best that I can on a day


---------41:59----------
that's what I really go for so it's not


---------42:02----------
about whether a streamer is big or small


---------42:03----------
like we struggle with this um in terms


---------42:05----------
of like okay if a big streamer comes on


---------42:08----------
like what do we do do we bump someone


---------42:10----------
else who is on our schedule do we push


---------42:12----------
them back like how do we do that like


---------42:14----------
what feels good about that what feels


---------42:15----------
bad about that how much of that has to


---------42:17----------
do with like you know ego and all kinds


---------42:19----------
of things so I think it's an ongoing


---------42:21----------
process there isn't a simple answer I


---------42:23----------
think the main thing is that you kind of


---------42:25----------
go back to this which is training


---------42:27----------
yourself right training yourself to


---------42:29----------
understand things training yourself to


---------42:31----------
understand yourself studying different


---------42:33----------
kinds of texts whether they be man's


---------42:35----------
search for meaning by Viktor Frankl or


---------42:36----------
the Mahabharat or a Harry Potter to like


---------42:39----------
go and learn from different places and


---------42:41----------
things and like try to like figure out


---------42:43----------
how what your compass is gonna be based


---------42:45----------
on and the more that you learn about


---------42:47----------
yourself and the more that you acquire


---------42:49----------
from the rest of the world like lead


---------42:51----------
counter Montecristo if you want to talk


---------42:53----------
about Dharma and the struggles with what


---------42:55----------
you should do like read count of


---------42:57----------
Montecristo it's an amazing book read


---------42:59----------
the maha part learn about this stuff


---------43:01----------
because it is an individual journey for


---------43:03----------
everyone and no one has all the answers


---------43:05----------
least of all me yeah exactly yeah


---------43:08----------
exactly I think that's something really


---------43:09----------
important to mention I don't want to be


---------43:13----------
rude but like it seems like in a lot of


---------43:15----------
times I'm like discordant which it seems


---------43:17----------
like a lot of people are developing this


---------43:18----------
sort of like I don't want to be rude but


---------43:20----------
like cult of personality sort of around


---------43:21----------
you we're like oh what you're saying is


---------43:24----------
the necessary and proper guide to them


---------43:25----------
it's like what happened with Jordan


---------43:26----------
Peterson I think it can be really toxic


---------43:28----------
so I'm glad you're taking steps to kind


---------43:29----------
of that


---------43:30----------
okay thanks for the feedback all right


---------43:34----------
so thank you guys very much I'm gonna go


---------43:38----------
ahead and sign off discord but thank you


---------43:40----------
guys for hopping on and appreciate the


---------43:42----------
discussion and you know I'm curious what


---------43:47----------
people thought like how did that go


---------43:50----------
is that good do you guys want to do that


---------43:53----------
[Music]


---------43:57----------
like do you guys want to hop on discord


---------43:59----------
from time to time like if it seems like


---------44:01----------
a good thing to do
