---------00:00----------
um let's talk about some scars for a


---------00:02----------
second so a some scar is a ball of


---------00:05----------
undigested emotion and what I mean by


---------00:08----------
that is like generally speaking we have


---------00:10----------
experiences in life and we have some


---------00:13----------
capacity to digest emotions and we have


---------00:15----------
some capacity to not digest emotions and


---------00:18----------
then what happens as a result of like


---------00:23----------
undigested emotions is they kind of like


---------00:25----------
they continue to affect us so I'm gonna


---------00:28----------
give you guys okay thank you guys very


---------00:34----------
much for rating and thanks direct full


---------00:39----------
for the rate but I'm gonna keep talking


---------00:40----------
I'm gonna just plow for it cuz I it's


---------00:42----------
hard for me to engage with chat so I'm


---------00:44----------
gonna give you guys my classic example


---------00:45----------
to understand the some scar so let's say


---------00:48----------
um I don't know how do I do this chat in


---------00:51----------
slow mode I don't even know how to do


---------00:53----------
that okay I don't know how to use twitch


---------00:55----------
guys I'm a Boomer like absolutely boomer


---------00:58----------
millennial boomer so I'll give you guys


---------01:03----------
an example so let's say like I'm walking


---------01:05----------
a side of a four-year-old kid and let's


---------01:08----------
say that I walk I'm walking down the


---------01:10----------
street with my four-year-old and she


---------01:11----------
sees a dog and she goes out and Pat's


---------01:14----------
the dog and then the dog like gives her


---------01:16----------
a little nip so she starts to cry and


---------01:18----------
she gets like really really scared and


---------01:20----------
the first thing that happens in her mind


---------01:22----------
is she gets like very afraid right


---------01:24----------
that's the first emotional response and


---------01:26----------
that emotion sort of creates like she


---------01:29----------
has this ball of fear around a dog and


---------01:31----------
then I kind of check her out make sure


---------01:33----------
she's okay sort of calm her down a


---------01:35----------
little bit and then what happens is I I


---------01:38----------
take her like let's say there's an ice


---------01:40----------
cream store so I take her and get some


---------01:41----------
ice cream and then she's eating her ice


---------01:44----------
cream and after eating her ice cream she


---------01:46----------
feels way better and so like where did


---------01:50----------
that fear go like all of that fear that


---------01:52----------
she had seems to disappear and she is


---------01:53----------
completely happy she's laughing she's


---------01:55----------
eating her ice cream and then what


---------01:57----------
happens is she's walking down the street


---------01:59----------
and she sees a dog the next day and then


---------02:02----------
she starts to cry because when she sees


---------02:04----------
that dog all of that fear which had


---------02:08----------
lived within her the day before


---------02:09----------
re-emerges and she kind of had this


---------02:12----------
traumatic experience


---------02:13----------
right that's the way that we think about


---------02:14----------
trauma and so that fear like pops back


---------02:18----------
up and then she starts crying again and


---------02:20----------
then I have to calm her down and maybe


---------02:22----------
the next day if she sees another dog


---------02:23----------
she'll get she'll get re triggered so we


---------02:27----------
think about that as trauma and so that


---------02:31----------
that ball of undigested emotion is in


---------02:33----------
sanskrit the yogis called that' some


---------02:35----------
scar so let's pretend that i'm walking


---------02:39----------
down the street and i reach out to pet a


---------02:40----------
dog and it bites me so i too will feel


---------02:43----------
fear but there are other parts of my


---------02:46----------
mind like my intellect my


---------02:48----------
rationalization capability that step in


---------02:51----------
and are able to like help me metabolize


---------02:54----------
that emotion i don't need ice cream to


---------02:56----------
help me forget i can actually think


---------02:59----------
through stuff and as i think through


---------03:04----------
that stuff i start to think to myself oh


---------03:06----------
man like that was kind of stupid maybe i


---------03:07----------
shouldn't have you know talked to like


---------03:09----------
maybe I shouldn't have pet that dog


---------03:12----------
maybe I should ask people if they're


---------03:14----------
friendly it's okay like I was kind of a


---------03:16----------
stupid thing to do and about half an


---------03:19----------
hour later I feel fine and the next day


---------03:22----------
when I see a dog like I don't get


---------03:24----------
triggered I may get a little bit of an


---------03:25----------
emotional response and may get a little


---------03:27----------
bit of adrenaline may get a little bit


---------03:28----------
anxious but I'm good I don't get


---------03:30----------
triggered the same way that a


---------03:31----------
four-year-old does so what's the


---------03:33----------
difference between a four-year-old and


---------03:35----------
me it's because my mind is more well


---------03:37----------
developed and I'm able to metabolize


---------03:39----------
that emotion instead of distracting from


---------03:42----------
it and the more that I digest that


---------03:44----------
emotion the less the some scar exists


---------03:46----------
the more to the some scar gets dissolved


---------03:48----------
so what we saw with reckful today is


---------03:51----------
that he still has that some scar right


---------03:54----------
it doesn't take like I mean you have to


---------03:56----------
ask the right kind of question you have


---------03:57----------
to get to the some scar so like part of


---------04:00----------
what I do is like I've been trained in


---------04:01----------
this stuff so I sort of know how to ask


---------04:02----------
questions to get to the some scar and we


---------04:05----------
get to that some scar and there's that


---------04:07----------
five-year-old that's still like


---------04:09----------
traumatized by losing his brother and so


---------04:12----------
he can distract himself with ice cream


---------04:14----------
he can distract himself with photography


---------04:15----------
he can distract himself with video games


---------04:17----------
but that emotional block is still there


---------04:20----------
and that needs to be metabolized that


---------04:22----------
debuff is still there the debuff has to


---------04:25----------
be cleansed right you've got to heal


---------04:26----------
that ship


---------04:27----------
and the way that you cleanse it is by


---------04:30----------
first diagnosing it because let's


---------04:32----------
remember that good diagnosis precedes


---------04:34----------
good treatment so the first thing you


---------04:36----------
have to do is like understand that


---------04:37----------
that's what the problem is and that's


---------04:38----------
what we help direct full do today we


---------04:40----------
helped him diagnose it so now at least


---------04:42----------
he's got a clue like he thought that his


---------04:43----------
life was full of depression and his life


---------04:45----------
had no meaning and that's because it's


---------04:48----------
true in a sense he lost his meaning when


---------04:52----------
he was when he was like six like his


---------04:55----------
life lost meaning because that's what it


---------04:57----------
was his meaning was to go home and like


---------05:00----------
play games with his brothers and then


---------05:02----------
one of his brothers left forever and he


---------05:04----------
says that he's forgiven but I don't know


---------05:06----------
if he's fully forgiven to be honest I


---------05:08----------
think that the 30 year old reckful has


---------05:10----------
forgiven I don't know if the


---------05:11----------
six-year-old reckful has I'd be very


---------05:15----------
surprised if there wasn't like some part


---------05:17----------
of the the six year old or the ten year


---------05:19----------
old who still blames his brother I don't


---------05:21----------
doubt that the 30 year old one has but I


---------05:25----------
think that's tough tough worth worth


---------05:29----------
having another conversation about
