let's say you meet two people i haven't


---------00:01----------
asked you about your sexuality or


---------00:03----------
anything but i'm just gonna assume a


---------00:04----------
heteronormative


---------00:05----------
perspective for a second so let's say


---------00:06----------
you meet two guys and like


---------00:08----------
one of them genuinely cares about you


---------00:11----------
and one of them is an [ __ ] who


---------00:13----------
pretends to care about you


---------00:14----------
and the interesting thing that can


---------00:15----------
happen is that sometimes


---------00:18----------
the genuine caring actually makes you


---------00:20----------
feel so uncomfortable that you pull away


---------00:22----------
from it


---------00:23----------
and you kind of pick the devil that you


---------00:28----------

i ask you anything that you don't feel


---------02:02----------
comfortable answering you're


---------02:04----------
welcome to not answer it um but i think


---------02:07----------
a lot of people


---------02:07----------
are curious about you know how to get


---------02:10----------
into therapy what it does for you things


---------02:12----------
like that can you


---------02:13----------
tell us a little bit about what your


---------02:15----------
experience with therapy has been like


---------02:17----------
for sure um so i've been


---------02:20----------
into i was in psych wards that was the


---------02:23----------
first experience i had when i was


---------02:26----------
with with therapy when i was very young


---------02:28----------
i got admitted into a psych ward


---------02:31----------
and that's how i started my first


---------02:32----------
therapy that's where i got diagnosed the


---------02:34----------
first time and


---------02:36----------
how i started to how i started to work


---------02:39----------
with


---------02:40----------
antidepressants and different kinds of


---------02:42----------
therapy


---------02:43----------
um and i actually went through dbt


---------02:47----------
twice um which really helped me


---------02:51----------
yeah um can can you explain to us what


---------02:55----------
dbt


---------02:56----------
is um oh god what is it


---------02:59----------
i'm not quite sure what it is in english


---------03:00----------
because i did it in german


---------03:02----------
but it's basically um like


---------03:05----------
i think it's behavioral therapy it's to


---------03:08----------
um um so


---------03:13----------
it's it's basic it's like impulse


---------03:15----------
control i would say


---------03:16----------
um yeah i think your experience of it is


---------03:18----------
perfect i i don't know that people need


---------03:20----------
like a technical definition but


---------03:22----------
can you just kind of tell us about what


---------03:24----------
it's been like for you and


---------03:27----------
so uh the first time i went through it i


---------03:30----------
i thought it was


---------03:31----------
i i didn't i i didn't quite you know i


---------03:34----------
wasn't ready for it yet


---------03:35----------
um but it's it's basically they taught


---------03:37----------
me how to


---------03:39----------
um i i did self harm when i was younger


---------03:42----------
it's not it's not a secret you can say


---------03:43----------
it


---------03:44----------
um i don't do it anymore um but they


---------03:47----------
taught me how to


---------03:48----------
get that into like how to control that


---------03:50----------
how to


---------03:51----------
um kind of um like kind of learn


---------03:54----------
different


---------03:54----------
things that i can do instead of uh


---------03:56----------
harming my body harming myself


---------03:59----------
and we did a lot of i'm not quite sure


---------04:02----------
what it is in english but we did


---------04:04----------
quite a lot of like meditation and like


---------04:07----------
being aware of your surroundings and of


---------04:09----------
yourself


---------04:10----------
uh which i think really helps and this


---------04:13----------
is really good


---------04:14----------
what is it in german um


---------04:22----------
yeah yeah is there a way to literally


---------04:25----------
translate that


---------04:26----------
like awareness like awareness practice


---------04:30----------
i would say beautiful that's yeah that's


---------04:33----------
that's a that's a beautiful way to


---------04:35----------
describe it


---------04:36----------
describe what it is um and feel free to


---------04:39----------
just use the german word if you can't


---------04:41----------
come up with anywhere


---------04:42----------
okay okay yeah i you know


---------04:45----------
so it's funny because a lot of people um


---------04:48----------
so


---------04:48----------
early on when i was training to become a


---------04:50----------
psychiatrist i had a patient whose


---------04:53----------
english was not their first language and


---------04:56----------
everyone just sort of assumed that that


---------04:57----------
would mean that the therapy wouldn't go


---------04:59----------
well


---------05:00----------
but i actually found that um that was


---------05:02----------
actually like one of my


---------05:04----------
best sort of therapy experiences because


---------05:08----------
uh since we didn't speak the same


---------05:09----------
language like we didn't assume


---------05:11----------
anything so we were like defining terms


---------05:14----------
that like


---------05:14----------
normally you know i would say oh like


---------05:16----------
how was your childhood and someone would


---------05:17----------
say good


---------05:18----------
and then we just moved past it even


---------05:19----------
though it may not have been good or i


---------05:21----------
interpreted things one way


---------05:22----------
and so i actually think working with


---------05:24----------
people who don't speak your language or


---------05:25----------
like you guys just have a little bit of


---------05:27----------
a


---------05:28----------
you know language gap can actually be


---------05:30----------
really really good


---------05:31----------
um because you don't fall into


---------05:32----------
assumptions yeah no i think i think


---------05:35----------
that's a really good way to see it


---------05:37----------
um so yeah because i also love the way


---------05:41----------
that you


---------05:41----------
you translated


---------05:54----------
yeah good job good job


---------05:57----------
thank you thank you


---------06:00----------
um and so so how how does


---------06:03----------
what did they teach you that helped you


---------06:05----------
control your impulses


---------06:07----------
um i think


---------06:11----------
i think for me it was mostly i


---------06:14----------
need it wasn't it wasn't mostly about


---------06:18----------
my impulses it was most mostly about


---------06:21----------
needing like something that i can rely


---------06:24----------
on


---------06:24----------
because growing up i didn't have that


---------06:26----------
much how i have it that much


---------06:28----------
and therapy actually helped me um in a


---------06:31----------
way where it's like hey


---------06:32----------
if you ever need something and you don't


---------06:34----------
know where to go


---------06:35----------
you have the therapy that you can go to


---------06:38----------
if you don't know who to talk to you


---------06:40----------
have your therapist you can talk to


---------06:42----------
um in the psych ward i had people to


---------06:46----------
take care of me


---------06:47----------
i think that was a big thing i'm very


---------06:49----------
bad with


---------06:50----------
like looking for help because i always


---------06:52----------
i'm like i'm so self-aware i know what


---------06:54----------
i'm doing i can do this by myself


---------06:57----------
so even like going to therapy now it's


---------06:59----------
like it's a very big step um


---------07:02----------
but i think i need it where where like i


---------07:04----------
need something to rely on and i need


---------07:06----------
something to fall back on


---------07:07----------
and that's i think that's what therapy


---------07:09----------
was for me and what helped me


---------07:12----------
yeah so sort of like a like a home base


---------07:14----------
or


---------07:15----------
kind of retreat or yeah can you tell me


---------07:18----------
a little bit about what growing up was


---------07:20----------
like for you


---------07:21----------
um i moved a lot ever since i was young


---------07:24----------
i moved every half a year


---------07:26----------
um i also grew up with all the f without


---------07:28----------
a father


---------07:30----------
um my mom i i


---------07:33----------
there is addiction running in my family


---------07:34----------
and my mom sadly suffered from it from


---------07:37----------
for the most part


---------07:38----------
um which i back then didn't understand


---------07:42----------
um and it was sort of like uh


---------07:46----------
i got thrown into new situations and


---------07:48----------
then pulled out of it without


---------07:50----------
me having a saying in it and then and


---------07:53----------
then


---------07:53----------
um not knowing where to go or what to do


---------07:56----------
um


---------07:57----------
and then once i moved out at 17 i had to


---------08:00----------
grow up really early because i had to


---------08:02----------
take care of my mom


---------08:03----------
um so i wow yeah i kind of just


---------08:07----------
i kind of just uh started to be more


---------08:09----------
independent and that really helped me


---------08:12----------
streaming really helped me i was a very


---------08:13----------
insecure kid


---------08:15----------
i was very shy and very very um


---------08:18----------
quiet growing up so


---------08:21----------
yeah streaming helped me a lot moving


---------08:24----------
out by myself helped me a lot because i


---------08:25----------
had that distance


---------08:27----------
from my from my child like childhood


---------08:30----------
from my family


---------08:31----------
and that helped me understand everything


---------08:33----------
that


---------08:34----------
i didn't understand when i was younger


---------08:37----------
and what are some of the things that you


---------08:39----------
gained understanding about


---------08:41----------
like what did you come to understand


---------08:43----------
that was confusing as a kid


---------08:45----------
i for example saw the sight of my mom


---------08:48----------
my mom always struggled with her current


---------08:51----------
boyfriends with her ex-boyfriends


---------08:53----------
with money we didn't have much money


---------08:55----------
growing up


---------08:57----------
um and i sort of started to understand


---------08:59----------
that


---------09:00----------
as my like as much as addiction is and


---------09:04----------
can be seen as an illness it's not her


---------09:07----------
fault


---------09:08----------
she did not mean to treat me the way


---------09:10----------
that she wanted to she maybe just didn't


---------09:12----------
know any better


---------09:13----------
um and i actually really really love my


---------09:16----------
mom now and


---------09:17----------
we're really like like tight and and


---------09:20----------
good with each other so yeah yeah


---------09:23----------
and and why did you move every six


---------09:25----------
months


---------09:26----------
um mostly uh so there's one thing that i


---------09:31----------
can't talk about on the internet which


---------09:32----------
i'm sure which i can't tell


---------09:34----------
um but mostly it was because of my mom


---------09:37----------
and her boyfriend she always moved to


---------09:39----------
her boyfriend's because she didn't have


---------09:40----------
money


---------09:41----------
um but my mom is a very pretty woman and


---------09:44----------
so she got to date


---------09:47----------
men that are rich i don't know


---------09:51----------
yeah um so we always moved to them


---------09:54----------
really quickly


---------09:55----------
and it really quickly didn't work out so


---------09:57----------
we had to move away


---------09:59----------
okay yeah um thanks for sharing that


---------10:01----------
there's something that you know we want


---------10:03----------
to steer clear of


---------10:04----------
i'm still not quite sure what to avoid


---------10:06----------
so i may need your guidance


---------10:08----------
i'm not trying to ignore i just don't


---------10:10----------
know what it is that we can't talk about


---------10:13----------
quite yet so apologies if i stumble


---------10:15----------
towards it


---------10:16----------
okay just let me know yeah of course of


---------10:18----------
course


---------10:20----------
and and so you mentioned that you didn't


---------10:23----------
grow up


---------10:24----------
kind of knowing your father is that


---------10:26----------
something that's still the case or


---------10:27----------
it sounds like you've really repaired


---------10:29----------
your relationship with your mom you all


---------10:30----------
become really close you all love each


---------10:32----------
other support each other a lot


---------10:33----------
um do you mind if i just ask quickly


---------10:35----------
like if that


---------10:37----------
oh yeah um i i had a father figure


---------10:40----------
when i was very young um but very


---------10:43----------
quickly


---------10:43----------
that turned that's what i can talk about


---------10:46----------
um


---------10:47----------
yeah and then i found out that he's not


---------10:50----------
my father when i was nine years old


---------10:52----------
um and my real father actually


---------10:56----------
he knows me like he my mom showed him my


---------10:59----------
twitch he knows


---------11:01----------
nia um but i have never known him and he


---------11:05----------
always said that i'm not his daughter


---------11:07----------
until we did a father


---------11:08----------
like a test like that he's my father


---------11:11----------
um but yeah he he's not in my life


---------11:16----------
i don't i don't really mind it either


---------11:17----------
though


---------11:20----------
yeah i i can i can see how you know it's


---------11:22----------
sort of like


---------11:23----------
you know never sort of he was never in


---------11:25----------
your life to begin with so it's not like


---------11:27----------
you lost anything


---------11:28----------
yeah exactly at the same time i can


---------11:31----------
imagine that


---------11:32----------
you know it can it may be hurtful


---------11:35----------
for him to say things like you're not it


---------11:37----------
was at first


---------11:38----------
definitely i i definitely at first was


---------11:41----------
very hurtful


---------11:42----------
um but i got over it very quickly


---------11:46----------
yeah do you mind if i ask how you did


---------11:48----------
that because that does seem remarkable


---------11:51----------
i i i feel like i i don't want to blame


---------11:54----------
it on that but i feel like because i've


---------11:56----------
moved so many times because i've dealt


---------11:58----------
with


---------11:58----------
getting over people losing people


---------12:00----------
getting thrown away like


---------12:01----------
thrown out of the situation um i feel


---------12:04----------
like because of that i've gotten


---------12:05----------
really really good at just getting over


---------12:08----------
people in general


---------12:11----------
like as much as i am hurt for the first


---------12:13----------
few days or for the first


---------12:15----------
for the first time i i quickly move on


---------12:19----------
from that


---------12:20----------
i just yeah


---------12:23----------
um nikki you seem just


---------12:26----------
incredibly resilient


---------12:29----------
thank you and i almost feel a little bit


---------12:32----------
sad saying that because i think it's


---------12:34----------
been rough that you've had to be so


---------12:35----------
resilient


---------12:36----------
you know i sometimes wish that people


---------12:39----------
had lives where they didn't have to be


---------12:40----------
quite as resilient and bounce back quite


---------12:42----------
as much as you had to


---------12:44----------
it sounds kind of rough um


---------12:48----------
it makes me the person i am today i um i


---------12:52----------
actually want to become a psychiatrist


---------12:54----------
um so i feel like because of all the


---------12:57----------
things that i have


---------12:58----------
um that i've been through i don't want


---------13:00----------
to say like oh i've been through so much


---------13:02----------
but like all of the things that i have


---------13:03----------
been through


---------13:04----------
uh because of that


---------13:10----------
yeah i um i learned how to um i


---------13:13----------
have a lot of empathy and i i i know how


---------13:16----------
a lot of people feel


---------13:17----------
and also i am pretty resilient so if


---------13:19----------
someone tells me that i i take it in but


---------13:22----------
it's not like weighing on me so much


---------13:26----------
can you help me understand um you


---------13:29----------
wanting to become a psychiatrist


---------13:30----------
why on earth um


---------13:34----------
save yourself nikki before it's too late


---------13:37----------
i just want to help people um at first i


---------13:40----------
wanted to become a psychiatrist


---------13:42----------
in a children's and adolescence psych


---------13:45----------
ward because that's what i've been


---------13:46----------
through and i think that helped me a lot


---------13:48----------
um but the more i am here as a streamer


---------13:52----------
and content creator i feel like a lot of


---------13:53----------
content creators could really use


---------13:55----------
um some professional help so i would


---------13:59----------
really like to


---------13:59----------
to do something in in this area as a


---------14:02----------
professional


---------14:04----------
mental health professional and um


---------14:07----------
okay look can i just think for a second


---------14:10----------
yeah for sure


---------14:11----------
i'm trying to understand the boundaries


---------14:13----------
of this conversation and


---------14:15----------
and i'm trying to mostly very open i am


---------14:18----------
fine with talking about


---------14:19----------
um mental health about my issues i talk


---------14:23----------
about it a lot on my own stream


---------14:25----------
um if there's anything that i don't want


---------14:27----------
to talk about


---------14:28----------
i will tell you and i won't feel


---------14:30----------
offended or anything so


---------14:32----------
don't worry at all yeah that i figured


---------14:34----------
out


---------14:35----------
the boundaries that i i need a moment to


---------14:37----------
think about are my own


---------14:39----------
oh okay oh okay i'm sorry


---------14:42----------
so there's there's all part you know


---------14:43----------
there i'm having all these thoughts


---------14:45----------
about supporting you in your goal like


---------14:47----------
in terms of


---------14:48----------
you know you know how can we


---------14:52----------
you know what because i love to support


---------14:54----------
you but i i think that that's not really


---------14:56----------
the relationship that we have


---------14:58----------
in terms of of you know if you want to


---------15:01----------
talk to people


---------15:02----------
or want research opportunities or


---------15:04----------
whatever which we just talked about a


---------15:05----------
little bit


---------15:06----------
um you know i know a lot of people in a


---------15:08----------
lot of places


---------15:11----------
and and i think you'd be a wonderful fit


---------15:12----------
just having talked to you for five or


---------15:14----------
ten minutes


---------15:15----------
in in a lot of the clinical settings


---------15:17----------
i've seen and so there's a part of me


---------15:19----------
that


---------15:19----------
very strongly wants to support you in a


---------15:21----------
very like much more like practical way


---------15:23----------
like i want to


---------15:24----------
introduce you to you know are


---------15:27----------
like the person who runs the adolescent


---------15:32----------
um you know i'm going to steer clear of


---------15:35----------
a particular diagnosis


---------15:36----------
but there's a there's a particular uh


---------15:39----------
you know residential unit where people


---------15:41----------
will come and stay for 30 or 60 days


---------15:43----------
most of them are women


---------15:44----------
they teach a lot of dbt there and and i


---------15:48----------
think that that could be like a really


---------15:49----------
wonderful place for you to


---------15:51----------
work clinically if you ever became a


---------15:53----------
psychiatrist so i'm personally just


---------15:55----------
restraining all of that energy to try to


---------15:57----------
support you and your goal


---------15:59----------
um and just thinking about what's


---------16:01----------
appropriate and what isn't to say


---------16:03----------
i see i see it and so like


---------16:07----------
so help me understand a little bit so i


---------16:08----------
mean i hear this a lot from streamers


---------16:10----------
too because you know we work with a lot


---------16:11----------
of


---------16:12----------
streamers here at hg um and so you're a


---------16:15----------
streamer


---------16:16----------
you're a good streamer you're a


---------16:18----------
successful streamer


---------16:20----------
and and how do you how do you think


---------16:22----------
about


---------16:23----------
you know potentially becoming like a


---------16:25----------
licensed mental health professional


---------16:27----------
versus like your streaming career


---------16:30----------
um so i i never intended


---------16:34----------
to become a big streamer um i don't


---------16:37----------
think


---------16:37----------
many people do i don't think many people


---------16:39----------
start and are like oh i'm going to be


---------16:41----------
this big streamer


---------16:43----------
so it has always been my goal and my


---------16:45----------
dream to become a psychiatrist


---------16:48----------
and i will not just throw that away just


---------16:49----------
because i have a different career path


---------16:51----------
now


---------16:52----------
um i feel like as much as streaming is a


---------16:56----------
wonderful job and i would love to do it


---------16:57----------
forever


---------16:58----------
it is not a secure job that that you


---------17:01----------
know you can do forever


---------17:03----------
so i think i will just do streaming for


---------17:04----------
as long as i can for as long as i have


---------17:06----------
fun


---------17:07----------
for as long as it's you know i can pay


---------17:10----------
my rent with it and i can pay my uni and


---------17:12----------
everything with it


---------17:13----------
um but i i feel like


---------17:17----------
at some point everyone just falls off


---------17:21----------
um so or most people so


---------17:24----------
um and like i will i will still work


---------17:27----------
towards


---------17:28----------
my plan a which is psychiatrist um


---------17:31----------
even though i but i will not i don't


---------17:34----------
know i really know how to say it but


---------17:35----------
like i will not give up streaming


---------17:37----------
um but i will still work towards


---------17:39----------
becoming a psychiatrist because you


---------17:40----------
never know


---------17:41----------
i could go live today and have zero


---------17:43----------
viewers


---------17:44----------
so yeah um


---------17:48----------
you know i know this sounds weird but


---------17:49----------
you may be able to become a psychiatrist


---------17:52----------
and a streamer


---------17:55----------
it is actually possible which i didn't


---------17:58----------
i i didn't i didn't realize you know i i


---------18:00----------
don't i don't know how true that was


---------18:02----------
maybe a year or two ago but it appears


---------18:04----------
to be true now


---------18:05----------
yeah yeah you're right


---------18:10----------
so and so it sounds like you're in uni


---------18:12----------
you're doing


---------18:14----------
uh i took this year off because of covet


---------18:16----------
i just couldn't handle it totally


---------18:18----------
but uh after like once everything comes


---------18:20----------
down


---------18:21----------
i will definitely go go back to uni yeah


---------18:24----------
i wasn't here once i just start again


---------18:26----------
and do you nikki do you mind if i ask


---------18:28----------
just estimate of how old you are


---------18:31----------
i'm 19. oh wow okay


---------18:34----------
yeah how long have you been streaming


---------18:37----------
two years oh wow


---------18:41----------
it's been my job for one year now you


---------18:44----------
seem


---------18:44----------
older i hear that a lot yeah


---------18:48----------
how do you how do you interpret that


---------18:50----------
when people say things like that


---------18:52----------
um i agree because i had to grow up very


---------18:54----------
very quickly


---------18:56----------
so and i have very i have a lot of


---------18:58----------
friends that are


---------18:59----------
in their early mid to late 20s


---------19:03----------
so i don't i don't have many friends


---------19:05----------
that are in like 18 19


---------19:07----------
18 19 17 18 19. so i think


---------19:11----------
um yeah i think i think that makes sense


---------19:15----------
yeah it's sad that you had to grow up


---------19:18----------
early


---------19:18----------
[Laughter]


---------19:20----------
yeah but it made me the person i am


---------19:22----------
today and i'm actually as much as i


---------19:24----------
still struggle with myself


---------19:25----------
um pretty happy with who i am and who


---------19:28----------
are you


---------19:30----------
um i'm nikki i am here to help people


---------19:33----------
and make people laugh and smile and as


---------19:36----------
long as i can do that i'm happy


---------19:39----------
i did a lot of um volunteering growing


---------19:42----------
up


---------19:42----------
and that's definitely also what i want


---------19:44----------
to do continuing on


---------19:46----------
i couldn't do it during culvert but yeah


---------19:50----------
yeah this may sound like a weird


---------19:53----------
question why is it important to you to


---------19:55----------
make people happy


---------19:57----------
i think because i know what it feels


---------20:00----------
like to be at your lowest


---------20:03----------
and i don't i don't wish that upon


---------20:04----------
anyone not even my


---------20:07----------
enemies i don't have anyways but the


---------20:09----------
people that i don't like i just don't


---------20:11----------
want


---------20:11----------
i just yeah


---------20:16----------
you know i'm really curious who has


---------20:18----------
enemies nowadays


---------20:20----------
i don't know yeah i know right it's like


---------20:24----------
i mean i'm sure they're out there but


---------20:26----------
i'm sure some people do and i


---------20:28----------
you know right i yeah i have people i


---------20:30----------
don't like and people


---------20:32----------
who don't like me but we're not enemies


---------20:35----------
i'm not making


---------20:36----------
anything to to make their life miserable


---------20:38----------
or anything


---------20:41----------
and and you said that you you enjoy


---------20:43----------
making people happy because you know


---------20:44----------
what it's like


---------20:45----------
to be unhappy can you tell us a little


---------20:48----------
bit more about that


---------20:50----------
um i don't know i


---------20:53----------
i just had a lot of


---------20:57----------
bad experiences in my life i would say


---------20:59----------
like i'm not i always whenever i do this


---------21:02----------
um i i'm like oh i'm just i'm just


---------21:05----------
trying to talk about myself and i come


---------21:08----------
off as oh i'm just talking about myself


---------21:10----------
here and making myself feel


---------21:12----------
seem i don't know i don't like talking


---------21:15----------
about myself in that way much i don't


---------21:17----------
like


---------21:17----------
telling people that i've had bad


---------21:19----------
experiences in my life but i definitely


---------21:21----------
did and i definitely


---------21:22----------
um had


---------21:26----------
i don't know just very low points


---------21:30----------
yeah yeah it's time for me to talk about


---------21:33----------
that


---------21:34----------
yeah how do how do you why is it hard


---------21:36----------
for you to talk about that


---------21:40----------
i don't know maybe because i


---------21:45----------
um i am not at a position


---------21:49----------
right now where


---------21:52----------
my life's good i don't have to you know


---------21:55----------
as much as i still have a lot of


---------21:56----------
struggles


---------21:57----------
and especially with myself i


---------22:00----------
am financially stable and i am doing a


---------22:02----------
job that i love and i


---------22:04----------
have many friends and and and out of


---------22:07----------
that


---------22:07----------
that i feel like i am not allowed to


---------22:10----------
talk about the bad times in my life


---------22:12----------
because it's


---------22:13----------
you know it's not like that anymore so


---------22:14----------
why should i talk about it


---------22:16----------
um so i i think i think that's what


---------22:19----------
makes me struggle


---------22:22----------
can i think for a second for sure


---------22:36----------
so nikki i think you know it's it's


---------22:39----------
i really enjoy talking to you i think


---------22:42----------
we're having a very lovely conversation


---------22:44----------
um i think it could help a lot of people


---------22:46----------
to hear your story and at the same time


---------22:49----------
i'm not hearing anything that we're


---------22:50----------
talking about that will actually be


---------22:52----------
helpful to you


---------22:54----------
yeah and and something very


---------22:57----------
sneaky is happening which is that you're


---------23:00----------
you're


---------23:00----------
coming on here and you're helping other


---------23:03----------
people


---------23:04----------
you're sharing your experiences for the


---------23:06----------
sake of


---------23:07----------
educating other people but we're not


---------23:10----------
we're really steering away from


---------23:12----------
anything that could be helpful to you


---------23:14----------
does that make sense


---------23:16----------
yes that makes sense okay so you're


---------23:19----------
you're a sneaky one so let's think a


---------23:21----------
little bit about that for a second


---------23:23----------
okay we can we can respect that boundary


---------23:26----------
right if you don't want to talk about


---------23:27----------
things that could help you and i think


---------23:29----------
by the way there's a theme running here


---------23:30----------
which is that you don't like reaching


---------23:32----------
out for help


---------23:33----------
you don't like showing people and now


---------23:34----------
everything's better there's that


---------23:37----------
right yeah yeah so so


---------23:40----------
but we can we can actually choose to


---------23:42----------
respect that right like we can just


---------23:44----------
acknowledge that that thing is there


---------23:45----------
that you


---------23:46----------
don't want you don't want us to throw


---------23:48----------
you a pity party


---------23:49----------
right yeah you don't want us to like


---------23:51----------
think like oh like


---------23:52----------
nikki's had like such a hard time


---------23:54----------
exactly


---------23:56----------
like you're happy sharing your your


---------23:57----------
story of triumph like yeah it was really


---------23:59----------
hard but


---------24:00----------
you can do it too like you're happy


---------24:02----------
saying that you're having


---------24:03----------
an inspiration if it helps other people


---------24:06----------
but yeah


---------24:07----------
you don't want us to be worried about


---------24:09----------
you exactly


---------24:10----------
100 yeah right which is fine


---------24:15----------
if we decide that so i'm i see you're


---------24:18----------
getting emotional i've maybe


---------24:20----------
taught you a little bit sorry but you


---------24:23----------
are


---------24:23----------
so you are so incredibly self-aware


---------24:26----------
nikki you understand yourself so well


---------24:28----------
you've grown so much


---------24:30----------
so i'm just i'm putting it out there


---------24:31----------
normally i'd like skirt around it i


---------24:33----------
won't you know i wouldn't like pin you


---------24:34----------
like i feel like i've


---------24:35----------
trapped you so that's all right so how


---------24:38----------
what do you think about that like um


---------24:42----------
no i i do agree um i do agree with that


---------24:45----------
especially


---------24:46----------
the oh i don't we don't want to throw


---------24:47----------
you a pity party because


---------24:50----------
um i do get babied on the internet a lot


---------24:55----------
um where it's like oh poor nikki and


---------24:58----------
oh she's she's she's doing this and but


---------25:02----------
for her


---------25:03----------
well um well i'm sitting here and i'm


---------25:05----------
like yeah but


---------25:06----------
it's all right like you know i


---------25:10----------
i'm fine so i feel like i feel like


---------25:13----------
if i if i would talk about how right now


---------25:16----------
i struggle with a lot of anxiety which


---------25:17----------
is true


---------25:18----------
i feel like people would then again be


---------25:20----------
like oh poor her


---------25:21----------
i hope she's okay which is fair enough


---------25:23----------
but i i don't want that


---------25:26----------
like i want to be here for my chat and i


---------25:28----------
want to make my chat laugh


---------25:30----------
they don't have to be there for me


---------25:31----------
because i am just their source of


---------25:33----------
entertainment


---------25:40----------
can i think for a second yes


---------25:47----------
i'm gonna need a long second maybe like


---------25:48----------
a minute that's okay


---------25:50----------
i'm so sorry no no no it's it's not i


---------25:54----------
i think so i need to think more when


---------25:56----------
people


---------25:58----------
are more insightful because usually like


---------26:00----------
if people are slow


---------26:02----------
with how how they progress it gives me


---------26:04----------
plenty of time i mean not like people


---------26:05----------
are slow but like


---------26:06----------
the more insightful you are the more i


---------26:08----------
have to like take a step back and


---------26:10----------
you know just hold on okay


---------26:22----------
okay


---------26:27----------
subtle there's a lot going on here


---------26:29----------
that's okay i'm


---------26:30----------
okay i'm i'm here okay so the first


---------26:33----------
thing is that


---------26:34----------
i think i i want to kind of toss


---------26:36----------
something out to you


---------26:37----------
maybe you can help me think through it


---------26:40----------
so


---------26:41----------
one is that people baby you right i


---------26:43----------
think that can be insulting and


---------26:45----------
demeaning


---------26:46----------
but i would suspect that when you get


---------26:49----------
babied there's a


---------26:50----------
when there's a subtle difference between


---------26:53----------
people


---------26:53----------
babying you and caring about you


---------26:58----------
and i i think that you probably dislike


---------27:01----------
both


---------27:03----------
yeah probably and one of those is fair


---------27:06----------
right because we don't want a baby


---------27:08----------
we don't want to we don't want to like


---------27:10----------
say like oh like oh nikki does it like


---------27:12----------
poor thing she's so hurt she's so


---------27:14----------
incapable of


---------27:15----------
no because you're very capable yeah


---------27:17----------
exactly


---------27:19----------
financially independent at the age of 19


---------27:21----------
in university


---------27:22----------
have career aspirations you you spawned


---------27:25----------
in a really really


---------27:26----------
bad location when you were born on this


---------27:29----------
earth


---------27:30----------
and with a lot of challenges and despite


---------27:32----------
this the fact that you had like a crappy


---------27:34----------
spawn


---------27:35----------
you have managed to accomplish at the


---------27:37----------
age of 19 just a ridiculous amount


---------27:39----------
and we're just getting started so i


---------27:42----------
think that babying you is not fair


---------27:44----------
yeah i agree at the same time


---------27:49----------
i think that you don't it makes you


---------27:52----------
uncomfortable when people


---------27:54----------
choose to care about you


---------28:00----------
i agree what's up with that um


---------28:04----------
maybe maybe i'm just not


---------28:08----------
used to i don't want to again oh you're


---------28:10----------
just not used to


---------28:11----------
people caring about me there's that


---------28:13----------
voice you see that voice yeah i know


---------28:20----------
um but yeah i i have an example for


---------28:23----------
example


---------28:24----------
an example for example um i i'm in this


---------28:27----------
group


---------28:28----------
in this friend group and um


---------28:31----------
they are streamers they're all streamers


---------28:32----------
all content creators and they


---------28:34----------
talk over me a lot and it's a thing it's


---------28:37----------
it's a thing um and


---------28:41----------
i've recently gotten into this into like


---------28:44----------
i talked to like two of the people or


---------28:46----------
three other people and then they


---------28:47----------
they suddenly let me talk and as much as


---------28:51----------
i was always like oh i wish i could talk


---------28:53----------
i wish i could say my mind


---------28:54----------
oh you know um once i actually could


---------28:58----------
i didn't know what to say because i was


---------29:01----------
so used to being talked over


---------29:02----------
and not finishing my sentences not being


---------29:05----------
heard that once i actually got heard


---------29:07----------
once people actually listened to me i


---------29:09----------
did not know what to say


---------29:11----------
and i think that is the same thing with


---------29:13----------
people caring about me


---------29:14----------
where it's like as much as i always


---------29:17----------
wanted it and as much as i always


---------29:19----------
wanted to feel safe and feel secure and


---------29:21----------
have people care about me


---------29:23----------
now that i have people care about me i


---------29:26----------
just don't know what to do with it


---------29:28----------
yeah beautifully said and


---------29:32----------
what i'm hearing from you is that it's


---------29:34----------
sad but you sort of didn't learn


---------29:38----------
how to be cared for


---------29:42----------
and and so i think what i'm hearing from


---------29:45----------
you is that you've really like


---------29:47----------
adapted to surviving on your own


---------29:52----------
you know because like you don't need


---------29:54----------
other people to take care of you because


---------29:55----------
that voice in your head doesn't


---------29:57----------
yeah it's always [ __ ] up yeah


---------30:01----------
it really is yeah interesting huh


---------30:05----------
can you tell us about that voice in your


---------30:07----------
head


---------30:08----------
oh that voice it does not like me


---------30:12----------
it does not want me to succeed um


---------30:16----------
and i think it helps me to be more


---------30:18----------
self-aware but at the same time it just


---------30:20----------
makes me sound hypocritical a lot of the


---------30:22----------
times


---------30:24----------
yeah so what kinds of things does it say


---------30:26----------
to you


---------30:27----------
um i think


---------30:31----------
it started i had an eating disorder


---------30:33----------
throughout


---------30:34----------
my entire life my mom's a model so she


---------30:37----------
kind of


---------30:37----------
put that down on me and that voice


---------30:40----------
started


---------30:41----------
when i was very young and at first it


---------30:44----------
was just the thing it repeated the


---------30:45----------
things that


---------30:46----------
people in school told me that my mom


---------30:48----------
showed me um


---------30:50----------
it it repeated my own insecurities


---------30:53----------
and the older i got the more it just


---------30:56----------
repeated


---------30:58----------
um it kind of just


---------31:03----------
made me feel like i don't deserve


---------31:08----------
good things happening to me you know


---------31:13----------
yep so let me ask you a weird question


---------31:17----------
does the voice help your success


---------31:20----------
or hinder your success that's the


---------31:23----------
question


---------31:24----------
i don't know and certain things i would


---------31:27----------
say


---------31:28----------
definitely it hinders it on the surface


---------31:30----------
i would say it hinders it but


---------31:32----------
on the other hand i think i


---------31:36----------
i need to i need that voice to tell


---------31:38----------
myself i can overcome it


---------31:40----------
i think i think i just constantly need


---------31:42----------
that challenge of something else


---------31:44----------
working against me and working against


---------31:46----------
what i want


---------31:47----------
so i yeah


---------31:51----------
if that makes sense makes a lot of sense


---------31:54----------
and now i'm gonna


---------31:55----------
because this is the thing nikki you make


---------31:56----------
too much sense


---------31:58----------
right so i asked you the hard question


---------32:00----------
which usually it takes us an


---------32:02----------
hour and a half to get to oh actually


---------32:04----------
the voice isn't all bad


---------32:06----------
but you get there right away so i i need


---------32:08----------
to


---------32:10----------
i feel like it's a therapy um a little


---------32:14----------
bit i know the normal


---------32:15----------
one so like you know i feel like i'm i'm


---------32:17----------
like in an anime where like we've caught


---------32:19----------
up with the manga and now i need to make


---------32:20----------
filler


---------32:21----------
and right it's quite a sneak to pause


---------32:23----------
for a second because this is gonna be a


---------32:25----------
filler


---------32:25----------
i'm sorry no no no it's it's on the


---------32:28----------
contrary so


---------32:31----------
um


---------32:40----------
man you understand so much


---------32:45----------
thank you


---------33:00----------
okay how would you feel if chat


---------33:04----------
cared about you


---------33:08----------
i would feel


---------33:13----------
at one point at one hand i would feel


---------33:19----------
um like thankful and i would be like


---------33:21----------
that's very sweet that's very nice


---------33:24----------
and on the other hand i would feel like


---------33:26----------
that's not your place to be


---------33:27----------
and then on the other hand i would


---------33:29----------
probably feel like


---------33:31----------
please don't okay


---------33:34----------
so we're gonna pay attention to on one


---------33:37----------
hand and on the other hand okay any time


---------33:39----------
you say that or anytime you think that


---------33:42----------
so for example the voice in your head


---------33:43----------
does it help your success or hinder your


---------33:45----------
success


---------33:49----------
on the one hand it's toxic and on the


---------33:50----------
other hand it's a challenge that drives


---------33:52----------
me forward


---------33:54----------
yeah right so yeah


---------33:57----------
so and when we go back to chat and when


---------34:00----------
we ask like you know


---------34:01----------
do they how would you feel about them


---------34:03----------
caring about you like there's a part of


---------34:05----------
you that can feel


---------34:06----------
gratitude there's a part of you that


---------34:08----------
says


---------34:09----------
no no it works the other way around


---------34:12----------
and yeah what's that third part of you


---------34:15----------
um


---------34:16----------
like it's not their place to be


---------34:20----------
like they have their own


---------34:23----------
things to care about i guess maybe yeah


---------34:27----------
so whose place is it to care about you


---------34:32----------
um my friends


---------34:36----------
and my family


---------34:41----------
that's a good answer is that actually


---------34:43----------
how you feel


---------34:46----------
yeah i think i mean


---------34:51----------
i guess chad that's a very hard question


---------35:00----------
i i do feel thankful that chad cares


---------35:02----------
about me


---------35:03----------
of course i do i i love my audience my


---------35:05----------
audience is the sweetest audience


---------35:08----------
yeah yeah um


---------35:12----------
but maybe maybe they should care about


---------35:15----------
me in a different way than my friends


---------35:17----------
and family should care about me because


---------35:19----------
we we didn't establish the word care


---------35:21----------
what is the word care what does the word


---------35:23----------
care say


---------35:24----------
and intel i think it's like chat should


---------35:26----------
care about me in a way of


---------35:28----------
oh is nikki happy doing the work that


---------35:31----------
she does is nikki have been


---------35:32----------
happy providing us with the content that


---------35:34----------
she that she does is she


---------35:36----------
safe and happy no no safe and healthy


---------35:39----------
like


---------35:39----------
those things but they can't actually


---------35:42----------
change much about it as


---------35:44----------
like like i said i'm very happy with my


---------35:45----------
audience and that is because


---------35:47----------
they act the way that they do and i


---------35:50----------
think


---------35:50----------
i think if they care about me in a way


---------35:53----------
of i want to make this community safe


---------35:55----------
because i care about my streamer


---------35:58----------
then i'm very happy and i think that's


---------36:00----------
what they should do


---------36:01----------
but they should not care about me on a


---------36:04----------
personal level where they will


---------36:06----------
reach out to me on my business email and


---------36:08----------
ask me if i am okay and if i want to


---------36:10----------
talk to them because that is not their


---------36:12----------
place to be


---------36:13----------
yeah so that sounds like very good


---------36:14----------
boundaries so now i'm gonna ask you


---------36:17----------
do you sometimes find yourself


---------36:20----------
um well said


---------36:24----------
no i'm gonna have to pause


---------36:29----------
this is gonna be the stream that we call


---------36:30----------
the battle of pauses


---------36:33----------
and i think you're winning right now the


---------36:34----------
score is like eight to one


---------36:41----------
okay so how


---------36:44----------
how do you feel about yourself when


---------36:47----------
you're making your chat happy


---------36:50----------
i feel good about myself i


---------36:54----------
if when when i have a good stream where


---------36:56----------
i see that my chat is having fun


---------36:58----------
i call that a successful stream and a


---------37:01----------
good stream


---------37:03----------
okay seems like


---------37:07----------
give me a second that's totally fine i'm


---------37:10----------
so sorry i feel so bad


---------37:12----------
why because you keep having to pause


---------37:15----------
so what's why do you feel bad about that


---------37:18----------
i'm not sure


---------37:22----------
i don't know what would make you feel


---------37:24----------
good


---------37:27----------
that's a hard question


---------37:30----------
um i don't know


---------37:40----------
i'm i'm happy to be here i feel good to


---------37:43----------
be here


---------37:44----------
i'm very thankful that i got invited to


---------37:46----------
this i


---------37:47----------
i am too i'm i'm i'm doing well right


---------37:50----------
now


---------37:51----------
are you concerned that i'm not doing


---------37:52----------
well yeah


---------37:54----------
yeah and so when you get concerned that


---------37:57----------
i'm not doing well how does that make


---------37:58----------
you feel


---------38:01----------
not not well yeah right because you're


---------38:04----------
not


---------38:05----------
maybe you're not making me happy and


---------38:08----------
when you don't make me happy how do you


---------38:09----------
how do you feel unhappy


---------38:13----------
like like guys like i didn't succeed


---------38:16----------
yeah


---------38:18----------
what does it feel like to not succeed


---------38:25----------
like that voice that told me i won't


---------38:28----------
will


---------38:28----------
will be louder yeah absolutely and


---------38:30----------
remind me of that


---------38:32----------
so the voice is telling you oh you


---------38:33----------
shouldn't be this difficult you should


---------38:35----------
be simpler


---------38:36----------
exactly and you should let dr k work you


---------38:39----------
to a revelation


---------38:41----------
and that everybody can watch the


---------38:42----------
revelation and then you can have


---------38:44----------
you can cry and you can have learned


---------38:46----------
something new about yourself


---------38:48----------
and that it's going to be exactly what


---------38:50----------
it's supposed to be everyone will be


---------38:51----------
happy


---------38:52----------
exactly but the voice telling you no no


---------38:55----------
don't


---------38:56----------
don't disrupt the boat right so


---------38:59----------
so


---------39:05----------
i think i'm gonna stop asking you some


---------39:06----------
questions and i'm just gonna tell you


---------39:09----------
okay so like but so nikki that's a


---------39:12----------
problem


---------39:14----------
right because you've got to be really


---------39:15----------
really careful about


---------39:18----------
oh i don't even know how to say this um


---------39:21----------
do you see how that's a problem


---------39:23----------
i do see how that's help us out


---------39:27----------
um i have learned especially in the last


---------39:32----------
year and a half that that is a problem


---------39:34----------
because


---------39:35----------
i have met certain people that told me


---------39:40----------
one thing and i would believe that thing


---------39:42----------
and i would adapt to that thing


---------39:44----------
and then they would act a different way


---------39:46----------
and i would try to


---------39:47----------
act that way and adapt to that way but


---------39:50----------
in the end i could not


---------39:52----------
because i couldn't steer the boat and


---------39:54----------
the die in the correct direction


---------39:56----------
um because i didn't get any directions


---------39:59----------
um


---------39:59----------
and because i constantly need to


---------40:03----------
um from from my end i need to succeed i


---------40:07----------
need to


---------40:09----------
be i don't know i i don't


---------40:12----------
know how to explain it but i feel like


---------40:16----------
i feel like i see myself as something


---------40:19----------
that


---------40:20----------
everyone can fall back on i will adapt


---------40:23----------
myself to everyone and everything around


---------40:25----------
me


---------40:26----------
whether or not it's beneficial or good


---------40:28----------
for me


---------40:29----------
um and because i


---------40:33----------
get these different directions and no


---------40:35----------
directions at all


---------40:37----------
i feel very very lost a lot of the times


---------40:42----------
yeah so now we're going to come back to


---------40:44----------
another question or a question that


---------40:46----------
we've asked before


---------40:47----------
so who are you


---------40:52----------
wow um


---------41:10----------
um i am


---------41:12----------
[Music]


---------41:14----------
i'm still nicki you're damn right you


---------41:18----------
are


---------41:20----------
i i still am a person with ambitions and


---------41:23----------
um goals in life and who is independent


---------41:27----------
by themselves


---------41:29----------
um i just maybe sometimes um


---------41:34----------
try to adapt myself too much


---------41:38----------
to other people


---------41:41----------
well set so now we get into a tricky


---------41:43----------
situation because


---------41:44----------
as as you give the right answers


---------41:48----------
and i said as i say things like well


---------41:50----------
said


---------41:51----------
that may calm down the voice do you see


---------41:53----------
that yeah


---------41:55----------
yeah because now you're being vulnerable


---------41:56----------
enough like oh like that's a hard


---------41:58----------
question like


---------41:58----------
oh dr k yeah and then and like so the


---------42:02----------
more that you like struggle like the


---------42:03----------
more the voice is like


---------42:04----------
good job nikki you're being what they


---------42:07----------
want you to be


---------42:10----------
right and so this is tricky because like


---------42:15----------
like you said


---------42:16----------
you know you adapt yourself a little bit


---------42:19----------
too much you're very good you're a


---------42:20----------
chameleon


---------42:22----------
you can be what people need you to be


---------42:25----------
and and this is the tricky thing is that


---------42:27----------
like you know when you're like i think


---------42:28----------
that there's a lot of genuineness but


---------42:30----------
there's like


---------42:31----------
a lot of um dialectic actually


---------42:35----------
so so the the d and dbt stands for


---------42:38----------
dialectical


---------42:40----------
and and what dialectical means i think


---------42:43----------
you understand


---------42:44----------
it very well i mean it's clear so the


---------42:46----------
dialectic is like the two


---------42:48----------
sides of the argument so on the one hand


---------42:51----------
i'm nikki


---------42:52----------
and on the other hand i actually am a


---------42:54----------
little bit confused about who i am at


---------42:55----------
times


---------42:57----------
and and or maybe another way to put it i


---------42:59----------
think as you have started to learn who


---------43:00----------
you are


---------43:01----------
is i give up who i am for what people


---------43:03----------
want me to be


---------43:07----------
and and so like i think that that's


---------43:09----------
challenging


---------43:11----------
um


---------43:14----------
any thoughts i agree


---------43:18----------
yeah i think i think that sounds


---------43:21----------
very accurate yeah so so


---------43:24----------
i i this is going to sound kind of weird


---------43:26----------
but you know the voice in your head


---------43:28----------
when other people tell you the same


---------43:31----------
thing that the voice in your head tells


---------43:33----------
you how do you respond to that


---------43:37----------
yeah you're right i um


---------43:41----------
i have learned oh sorry um i have


---------43:44----------
learned


---------43:44----------
growing up and going through therapy


---------43:46----------
i've learned how to take compliments i


---------43:47----------
we


---------43:48----------
had a whole therapy session group


---------43:49----------
session about how to


---------43:51----------
take compliments so whenever someone


---------43:53----------
gives me a compliment i say thank you


---------43:55----------
i yeah that's really nice of you um but


---------43:58----------
it


---------43:58----------
it is only when someone says something


---------44:00----------
negative about me that i actually take


---------44:02----------
it in


---------44:03----------
and i i


---------44:06----------
process it and it actually reaches me


---------44:09----------
i think that's that's why it's very hard


---------44:11----------
to be a streamer because i do see a lot


---------44:13----------
of negative things


---------44:15----------
yeah so so i and i think this is where


---------44:18----------
maybe you know maybe we can try to like


---------44:20----------
i'd like to help you swim in the water


---------44:24----------
of like why you do that right so like


---------44:28----------
you've got this negative voice in you


---------44:30----------
part of it


---------44:33----------
you know feels like it's like hurts you


---------44:36----------
because it does hurt you and at the same


---------44:38----------
time it also like


---------44:40----------
helps you succeed right and and so then


---------44:43----------
there


---------44:44----------
are times where you know i think that


---------44:45----------
like you have to be careful


---------44:47----------
i mean we haven't talked about your


---------44:48----------
romantic relationships but i think


---------44:50----------
sometimes


---------44:51----------
people for whom negativity resonates


---------44:55----------
with them


---------44:56----------
can open themselves up to abusive


---------44:58----------
relationships


---------44:59----------
or abusive dynamics and we can kind of


---------45:02----------
hear this a little bit because you had


---------45:03----------
that group of friends that always talked


---------45:04----------
over you


---------45:05----------
and you're like resenting it on the one


---------45:07----------
hand but it feels right


---------45:09----------
on the other and then you've got like


---------45:11----------
these two or three people who actually


---------45:12----------
give you the space to speak


---------45:14----------
and that's what you've always wanted and


---------45:16----------
you're really uncomfortable


---------45:18----------
and this is the dialectic it's like i


---------45:21----------
want to speak


---------45:23----------
but boy does it feel good when i get


---------45:25----------
talked over because then your voice is


---------45:26----------
like you see that he's


---------45:28----------
you don't have anything good to say


---------45:29----------
anyway exactly you don't know how to


---------45:31----------
talk


---------45:32----------
anyways yeah yeah so it's kind of tricky


---------45:35----------
and so then the question becomes like


---------45:38----------
what


---------45:39----------
what makes you like and then when people


---------45:41----------
compliment you


---------45:42----------
i think this is tricky so i know you had


---------45:44----------
a therapy session where you learned how


---------45:46----------
to act


---------45:50----------
how to accept a compliment you practice


---------45:53----------
acting


---------45:55----------
you don't actually accept it what gets


---------45:59----------
in the way


---------46:04----------
i


---------46:07----------
probably that voice not wanting me to


---------46:11----------
succeed not wanting me to feel good


---------46:13----------
about myself and feel good about


---------46:15----------
things that people compliment me on


---------46:18----------
yeah and and what's your understanding


---------46:21----------
of why your voice


---------46:22----------
doesn't want you to feel good what is it


---------46:25----------
doing there why is it doing that


---------46:28----------
it's trying to keep me in the place


---------46:30----------
where i have been for the majority of my


---------46:32----------
life because that's


---------46:34----------
comforting because that is the safety


---------46:36----------
net that i


---------46:37----------
that i have i um


---------46:41----------
i fall and like when we talk about


---------46:43----------
romantic relationships i fall in love


---------46:45----------
with people who make me feel safe


---------46:47----------
um and that might be me trying to get


---------46:51----------
out of that place that the voice is


---------46:53----------
keeping me in that safety net


---------46:55----------
um but that also like you said opens me


---------46:58----------
up to a lot of abusive relationships


---------47:00----------
because that is then the safety net that


---------47:02----------
i try to fall back on


---------47:03----------
um and a lot of the times it doesn't


---------47:05----------
work out um


---------47:07----------
so i think i think that is what the


---------47:10----------
voice is doing it's trying to keep me in


---------47:12----------
that place where i have been


---------47:13----------
my entire life where it is easy to stay


---------47:16----------
because i don't have to work


---------47:17----------
to get out of it well said


---------47:20----------
so so here's here's what i kind of heard


---------47:22----------
so i think i know it sounds


---------47:24----------
weird but i think the voice is


---------47:25----------
protecting you


---------47:27----------
right and this is is actually like


---------47:29----------
devastating but


---------47:31----------
it happens to be true that you have


---------47:34----------
survived abuse and neglect


---------47:39----------
and like there's a very interesting


---------47:41----------
adaptation


---------47:42----------
to like surviving abuse and neglect


---------47:44----------
which is like this idea that


---------47:46----------
you don't deserve any better because


---------47:48----------
then at least it makes sense right


---------47:50----------
if i'm like fundamentally oh you want to


---------47:53----------
finish


---------47:54----------
yeah like human beings try to make sense


---------47:57----------
of everything


---------47:58----------
everything we need to we need to make


---------48:00----------
sense of it so


---------48:01----------
i totally agree i've heard that a lot of


---------48:03----------
times i've learned that while i did


---------48:04----------
psychology myself


---------48:06----------
i know that that is the thing i i need


---------48:08----------
to make sense of it why did i get abused


---------48:10----------
why did i get neglected what


---------48:12----------
what made me like what made people want


---------48:15----------
to do that to me


---------48:17----------
and the thing that that voice tells me


---------48:20----------
it's


---------48:21----------
because you deserve it because whatever


---------48:23----------
you did you deserve it


---------48:24----------
and i say okay right that makes sense i


---------48:26----------
deserve it


---------48:27----------
um yeah yeah so i'm gonna point


---------48:30----------
something out i think we're gonna skirt


---------48:32----------
close to the area that we're not going


---------48:34----------
to talk about


---------48:35----------
so you don't have to talk about it but


---------48:36----------
i'm just going to illustrate something


---------48:37----------
right so if we go back to like


---------48:39----------
early on and if you can share something


---------48:42----------
i think it could be illustrative but


---------48:43----------
it's enough for you to just think it you


---------48:45----------
don't actually have to answer my


---------48:46----------
question


---------48:49----------
i forgot what i was going to say with


---------48:50----------
that oh no


---------48:53----------
okay so so


---------48:56----------
when you're growing up and you're moving


---------48:58----------
around a lot and things are bad


---------49:00----------
right your mind comes up with like


---------49:04----------
some kind of way to help you survive


---------49:07----------
that right and you so you come up with


---------49:10----------
like this adaptation


---------49:12----------
and then the interesting thing is that


---------49:14----------
like that adaptation makes sense like


---------49:16----------
it's sort of like your mind comes up


---------49:17----------
with this idea and there's


---------49:18----------
interesting stuff about cognitive


---------49:19----------
development stuff that we can talk about


---------49:21----------
but


---------49:21----------
essentially your mind like comes up with


---------49:23----------
a formula for the way that the world


---------49:25----------
works you have to make sense of the way


---------49:26----------
the world works


---------49:27----------
and to grow up the way that you did the


---------49:29----------
only logical conclusion that a smart


---------49:32----------
insightful person like yourself can come


---------49:33----------
to


---------49:34----------
is that you don't deserve to be treated


---------49:36----------
well


---------49:37----------
because clearly you know


---------49:40----------
you had lots of data to suggest that you


---------49:43----------
don't deserve to be treated well


---------49:45----------
and then something really important


---------49:47----------
happens which is that voice in your head


---------49:49----------
says that you know what as long as you


---------49:51----------
don't deserve to be treated well and


---------49:53----------
we're all on the same page


---------49:54----------
as long as we know the final boss that


---------49:56----------
we're dealing with we can win


---------49:58----------
we can survive you're completely okay if


---------50:01----------
you don't rely on anyone else if no one


---------50:02----------
cares about you


---------50:04----------
i can take care of you i will protect


---------50:06----------
you i will make you succeed


---------50:08----------
i will help you become a psychiatrist


---------50:10----------
that transforms and enriches the lives


---------50:12----------
of many many people


---------50:14----------
and it's going to be a shell that you


---------50:17----------
show the rest of the world and i'm going


---------50:18----------
to be with you on the inside and we're


---------50:20----------
not going to let anyone else in


---------50:22----------
[Music]


---------50:25----------
and so it can become terrifying because


---------50:27----------
that's it's a safety net i think you


---------50:28----------
used a beautiful phrase there


---------50:31----------
and now things get really really


---------50:33----------
dangerous because


---------50:34----------
if people start to care about you and


---------50:37----------
you


---------50:38----------
let them in what does that say about you


---------50:42----------
that i'm vulnerable


---------50:46----------
sure that i i think i think that is also


---------50:49----------
like a


---------50:50----------
big thing i have tried to let people in


---------50:52----------
and then


---------50:53----------
that trust that i've gave given that


---------50:56----------
people got abused


---------50:57----------
so then the voice gets louder um


---------51:00----------
and tells me to see see that's that's


---------51:03----------
why you shouldn't trust people that's


---------51:04----------
why


---------51:05----------
we are in here you and me but everyone


---------51:08----------
else is out there


---------51:09----------
um yeah so now i'm going to say


---------51:12----------
something this may not make a whole lot


---------51:13----------
of sense


---------51:13----------
i think the thing you've got to be


---------51:14----------
really careful about nikki is i think


---------51:16----------
that


---------51:17----------
voice knows how to pick the right people


---------51:21----------
to let them in and convince you


---------51:24----------
that i i was right all along i agree


---------51:28----------
100 my mom has the same issue well yeah


---------51:31----------
my mom and i actually talked about that


---------51:33----------
a lot i agree can you can you help us


---------51:35----------
understand


---------51:36----------
that a little bit because i know we know


---------51:37----------
what we're talking about i'm not sure


---------51:38----------
that everyone can follow


---------51:40----------
um so i think it is


---------51:46----------
so people in your life as a person that


---------51:49----------
has met many people in their lives


---------51:51----------
uh growing up and moving a lot um


---------51:54----------
have certain patterns of how to get to


---------51:57----------
know you


---------51:58----------
how to talk to you what their hobbies


---------52:00----------
are


---------52:01----------
the way they approach other people


---------52:04----------
and i think i don't do it


---------52:08----------
consciously but subconsciously i see


---------52:11----------
those patterns and i take


---------52:13----------
the toxic patterns and i blend them out


---------52:15----------
they're not there for me


---------52:17----------
but subconsciously i know that these are


---------52:20----------
toxic patterns and


---------52:21----------
these patterns will hurt me um but


---------52:24----------
i will still i because i don't see them


---------52:27----------
consciously


---------52:28----------
i will let these people in and then once


---------52:30----------
i get hurt by them


---------52:32----------
on one hand i'm surprised and i tell


---------52:34----------
myself why did i deserve that and on the


---------52:36----------
other hand i tell myself


---------52:37----------
yeah but these you you you knew that you


---------52:40----------
you knew that that was


---------52:41----------
that was what you wanted that that was


---------52:43----------
what you what you needed


---------52:45----------
i guess yeah it's it's tricky right


---------52:48----------
because i i think there's a part of it


---------52:49----------
because like


---------52:50----------
nikki you are very you will be a very


---------52:52----------
good psychiatrist if you'd be


---------52:54----------
thank you so i think you're really good


---------52:57----------
at reading people


---------52:59----------
and i think you're really good at like


---------53:00----------
knowing what they are and what they're


---------53:02----------
going to give you and i think there's a


---------53:03----------
part of you that


---------53:06----------
now we're really getting into


---------53:07----------
hypothetical territory but i'd say that


---------53:09----------
there's a part of you that


---------53:11----------
sees all of the stuff on the surface


---------53:13----------
that you want from those people


---------53:15----------
and also detects like everything


---------53:17----------
underneath the surface


---------53:19----------
and it also reassures you because it


---------53:22----------
says hey look at all this beautiful


---------53:23----------
stuff on the surface


---------53:24----------
this person is going to be the right


---------53:26----------
person for you and then underneath


---------53:28----------
they know that that person is going to


---------53:30----------
make you


---------53:31----------
feel about yourself the way that you


---------53:33----------
sometimes do when you listen to that


---------53:35----------
voice


---------53:37----------
yeah definitely it's hard


---------53:41----------
so now we get to


---------53:45----------
yeah so let me just let me think for a


---------53:46----------
second


---------53:53----------
do you do you have a sense of how to


---------53:56----------
change this


---------54:00----------
um i mean like i said trying to let


---------54:03----------
people in as much as i will


---------54:05----------
i know i will get hurt in the future um


---------54:09----------
trying to let people in trying to


---------54:13----------
let people understand me and my


---------54:15----------
vulnerabilities


---------54:17----------
um yeah i'm not sure


---------54:21----------
yeah so so i think that's that's a good


---------54:23----------
that's a good strategy


---------54:25----------
i think it could be bumpy mm-hmm um so


---------54:28----------
what


---------54:29----------
as everything is as as every recovery


---------54:32----------
process


---------54:32----------
is well said also very resilient of you


---------54:37----------
so


---------54:38----------
but you know nikki i i'd actually prefer


---------54:41----------
if it's okay with you to try to like


---------54:42----------
lead you down a path now that's a little


---------54:44----------
bit different


---------54:45----------
yeah for sure and the thing is uh trying


---------54:47----------
stuff i don't think is actually your


---------54:49----------
strong suit


---------54:51----------
i i think you're very insightful and so


---------54:53----------
what i'd love to do is actually try to


---------54:55----------
leverage


---------54:56----------
your ability to understand your capacity


---------54:59----------
for awareness


---------55:00----------
and actually it has nothing to do with


---------55:02----------
anything outside of you


---------55:03----------
it has everything to do with what goes


---------55:05----------
on inside you


---------55:07----------
so the first thing is that recognize


---------55:09----------
that the voice in your head


---------55:11----------
is what his is your survivor


---------55:14----------
right like you've you've you are a


---------55:17----------
survivor


---------55:19----------
and and i think the really terrifying


---------55:20----------
thing is that like


---------55:22----------
you have concluded that you're not like


---------55:24----------
a good person on the inside


---------55:26----------
now i know that you don't there are


---------55:27----------
parts of you that has come to realize


---------55:28----------
that that's not true and stuff like that


---------55:29----------
so totally fine


---------55:30----------
but this goes back to like if someone


---------55:32----------
compliments you you're like you know it


---------55:33----------
bounces right off


---------55:35----------
or you learn how to pretend to take it


---------55:36----------
in and then if someone's like really


---------55:38----------
nasty to you they're like


---------55:40----------
you know it kind of sinks in and you're


---------55:41----------
like yes that's correct so that's what


---------55:43----------
we're talking about okay


---------55:46----------
and and the only way that the world can


---------55:49----------
make sense


---------55:50----------
if you grow up with the history that you


---------55:53----------
have


---------55:53----------
which once again we don't need to go


---------55:55----------
into is it okay that i just reference it


---------55:56----------
like that yeah yeah


---------55:57----------
okay so like you know i and if you feel


---------56:00----------
like i think it could be illustrated but


---------56:01----------
you don't have to if you can feel your


---------56:03----------
if you can share your experience of like


---------56:05----------
a particular memory you don't have to


---------56:06----------
tell us what happened


---------56:07----------
but just how you learn to believe that


---------56:10----------
about yourself


---------56:11----------
you know something like that not not


---------56:14----------
quite yet but let me just keep going but


---------56:17----------
i think it could be helpful


---------56:19----------
so so the world makes sense because you


---------56:22----------
don't deserve to be cared for


---------56:25----------
and and then what happens is like


---------56:28----------
something in there as you're navigating


---------56:30----------
those protective mechanisms we see


---------56:32----------
a lot of these coping mechanisms like


---------56:34----------
eating disorders


---------56:36----------
um you know self-injurious behavior


---------56:38----------
substance use we see all these different


---------56:40----------
things


---------56:40----------
and if you really look at those i i you


---------56:42----------
know i i'd bet money and you can answer


---------56:44----------
this if you want to


---------56:45----------
that when you were engaging in


---------56:46----------
self-injurious behavior it would shut up


---------56:48----------
the voice in your head


---------56:51----------
and this is the really interesting thing


---------56:53----------
about self-injurious behavior is that a


---------56:55----------
lot of times it's not


---------56:56----------
any intention to harm yourself it's


---------56:58----------
actually a very powerful


---------57:00----------
almost meditative technique that brings


---------57:02----------
your awareness to the present


---------57:04----------
and all of the voices in your head shut


---------57:07----------
up


---------57:07----------
because there is something incredibly


---------57:10----------
painful that demands a hundred percent


---------57:11----------
of your attention


---------57:13----------
yeah hence why dbt absolutely right so


---------57:17----------
what what dbt does is it trains you to


---------57:19----------
replace


---------57:21----------
that injurious behavior with another


---------57:24----------
meditative technique or awareness


---------57:26----------
technique or grounding technique


---------57:27----------
that causes your mind to like let go of


---------57:30----------
those thoughts and focus on one thing


---------57:35----------
and so i think the real challenge is


---------57:37----------
going to be and i feel like i want to


---------57:39----------
build up to this better


---------57:40----------
is that if you are worth caring for


---------57:44----------
it rewrites your history because that


---------57:47----------
means that like everything that happened


---------57:49----------
to you really


---------57:51----------
shouldn't have happened to you


---------57:55----------
yeah wow


---------58:01----------
um that's just wrong


---------58:05----------
that's just yeah i just realized that


---------58:09----------
that's way that's crazy um


---------58:13----------
because i always tell myself yeah no


---------58:15----------
it's okay that it happened because it


---------58:16----------
made me the first name today but


---------58:18----------
if you say it like that you're right oh


---------58:21----------
god


---------58:27----------
oh god


---------58:37----------
yeah right it's it's hard


---------58:41----------
because here's the thing nikki it's not


---------58:43----------
okay that i think that stuff happened to


---------58:45----------
you


---------58:47----------
but that you know


---------58:50----------
[Laughter]


---------58:54----------
damn it nikki


---------59:03----------
so you know what is that we can just


---------59:06----------
take a second


---------59:09----------
oh god


---------59:23----------
wow i've never i've never looked at it


---------59:25----------
that way actually


---------59:28----------
it was always like oh i'm so strong


---------59:31----------
for getting over it and telling myself


---------59:33----------
it's okay that it happened


---------59:34----------
but in reality i i know that it


---------59:38----------
shouldn't have happened


---------59:42----------
so what is it like to


---------59:46----------
have that thought


---------59:52----------
i still wanna i still just wanna do good


---------59:55----------
with it


---------59:56----------
like as much as it shouldn't have


---------59:58----------
happened


---------59:59----------
it i can i learn from it and i can take


---------60:03----------
so much experience from it that i can


---------60:06----------
use to help people and i think i think


---------60:09----------
if i can


---------60:10----------
manage to either and


---------60:14----------
and do this for someone else like that


---------60:16----------
it doesn't happen for someone else or


---------60:18----------
help someone else to


---------60:20----------
to deal with it and and to cope with


---------60:22----------
what happened


---------60:24----------
i think as long as i can do that it's


---------60:26----------
gonna be worth it


---------60:34----------
i know i'm just like projecting it on


---------60:36----------
other people again


---------60:38----------
but i feel like that's all i can do so


---------60:40----------
so here's


---------60:42----------
sure so i i think you're it the voice in


---------60:45----------
your head is struggling now okay which


---------60:47----------
is good


---------60:48----------
but you're saying like if i can turn


---------60:51----------
some


---------60:51----------
turn it into something good then it


---------60:53----------
makes it worth it


---------60:54----------
nikki no it doesn't


---------61:01----------
nothing is gonna make it work nothing


---------61:03----------
isn't gonna make it okay


---------61:04----------
right that like and i i don't mean to


---------61:06----------
bludgeon you i feel like


---------61:08----------
no yeah no i'm not gonna let you sneak


---------61:11----------
away


---------61:12----------
right because you're doing like your


---------61:13----------
mind's trying to do it like oh then


---------61:14----------
it'll be


---------61:15----------
okay if i can if i can protect a hundred


---------61:19----------
people's


---------61:20----------
pain by sacrificing myself then that


---------61:22----------
makes the sacrifice worth it


---------61:24----------
and this is what i'm telling you this is


---------61:25----------
why i think you're not going to be able


---------61:27----------
to let people care about you


---------61:29----------
until you recognize that fixing no


---------61:31----------
amount of people's lives


---------61:33----------
makes it okay what happened to you


---------61:35----------
there's no amount of self-sacrifice


---------61:38----------
that like i'm not going to let you do


---------61:41----------
that


---------61:43----------
saving a thousand lives doesn't make it


---------61:44----------
okay


---------61:48----------
right like worth it that's what you've


---------61:50----------
got to get rid of


---------61:54----------
because that's once again like that's


---------61:56----------
you putting other people ahead of


---------61:58----------
yourself


---------62:01----------
i tend to do that yes you do


---------62:05----------
and so if you really want to be able to


---------62:08----------
let people care about you


---------62:09----------
you have to let yourself come


---------62:13----------
first sometimes and i think you're


---------62:16----------
learning that


---------62:18----------
you know and i think you're right that


---------62:20----------
chat there are boundaries that are


---------62:22----------
important but when it comes to your


---------62:23----------
friends and your family and when it


---------62:24----------
comes to other people like wanting to


---------62:26----------
listen to your opinion


---------62:28----------
like you actually have it and here's a


---------62:31----------
crazy thing


---------62:33----------
so you think that your value is


---------62:35----------
determined on the number of people that


---------62:37----------
you help


---------62:39----------
like i believe you have value no matter


---------62:44----------
what you accomplish like that core thing


---------62:46----------
there's nothing


---------62:48----------
there's nothing you can do that just


---------62:50----------
like that counteracts that voice in


---------62:52----------
sight like that's like you see what i'm


---------62:54----------
saying there's like there's like the


---------62:56----------
like you don't have to do [ __ ]


---------63:01----------
you have intrinsic value nikki has


---------63:03----------
intrinsic value she doesn't have to


---------63:04----------
prove anything


---------63:05----------
she doesn't have to make it and like


---------63:06----------
what happened to her was bad


---------63:09----------
there's nothing that will make it worth


---------63:14----------
it


---------63:16----------
i'll have to think about like days after


---------63:22----------
penny for your thoughts


---------63:25----------
what are you thinking right now


---------63:30----------
[Laughter]


---------63:38----------
i think also insightful that i i


---------63:40----------
encourage you to continue to think about


---------63:42----------
those things but i think maybe


---------63:44----------
we're short-circuited for the day


---------63:56----------
wow


---------63:59----------
yeah so i don't know what to do now


---------64:04----------
so


---------64:09----------
yeah um questions do you have any


---------64:13----------
you don't have to have anything in your


---------64:14----------
mind because i think this is sort of


---------64:15----------
what we go for right i think it's fine


---------64:17----------
to


---------64:18----------
process this maybe talk to your


---------64:19----------
therapist next week about it whatever


---------64:25----------
um no i don't think i have any questions


---------64:28----------
about


---------64:28----------
that now but um like i said i


---------64:32----------
i really like what you do like what you


---------64:34----------
work do you


---------64:35----------
want to tell me or i know a lot of my


---------64:37----------
viewers are in chat right now do you


---------64:38----------
want to tell us like more about your


---------64:40----------
work and what you do


---------64:43----------
[Laughter]


---------64:46----------
yes we can we can we can certainly go to


---------64:49----------
safe ground


---------64:51----------
and the safety net of telling people


---------64:52----------
about what we do


---------64:54----------
because i i i don't think i can talk


---------64:56----------
much about myself anymore


---------64:57----------
i think we're done i think it's it's a


---------65:00----------
gigi


---------65:02----------
uh so yeah sure i'm i'm happy to do that


---------65:05----------
so my name is ola i'm a i'm a


---------65:08----------
psychiatrist that


---------65:09----------
practices in boston i spent about seven


---------65:12----------
years studying to become a monk


---------65:15----------
and then met my wife and fell in love


---------65:19----------
and then she wanted to be married to a


---------65:20----------
doctor


---------65:22----------
and so i went to medical school she


---------65:25----------
wanted to be married to a neurosurgeon


---------65:27----------
but i decided that wasn't for me so i


---------65:29----------
picked the next best thing which is


---------65:30----------
psychiatry


---------65:33----------
and then what i really found is that


---------65:35----------
there are a lot of


---------65:36----------
uh you know mental health the child the


---------65:40----------
mental health challenges that people


---------65:41----------
face nowadays are


---------65:43----------
are expanding changing very rapidly


---------65:46----------
and that some of these perspectives that


---------65:49----------
psychiatry


---------65:50----------
has are like missing something so and i


---------65:52----------
think nikki actually you illustrate this


---------65:53----------
really well where


---------65:55----------
man you are incredibly resilient


---------65:57----------
incredibly insightful i'm sure you'd be


---------65:58----------
a wonderful


---------65:59----------
clinician um you have a very high eq


---------66:02----------
which is emotional quotient so i think


---------66:04----------
your ability to read


---------66:05----------
other people and understand what they


---------66:06----------
need is like really high


---------66:10----------
and at the same time despite all of the


---------66:11----------
therapy despite all of the intelligence


---------66:13----------
there's a perspective


---------66:15----------
here about what is the self


---------66:18----------
that i think is missing from kind of


---------66:22----------
like psychiatric treatment


---------66:24----------
because at the end of the day like we


---------66:26----------
can you know you could do therapy and


---------66:27----------
you can make these


---------66:28----------
uncoveries in therapy but sort of really


---------66:30----------
grappling with this like


---------66:32----------
of who am i and do i have worth as a


---------66:34----------
human being and being taught


---------66:37----------
that i don't have worth as a human being


---------66:39----------
overcoming that


---------66:41----------
being resilient and being positive and


---------66:43----------
sacrificing yourself for the rest of the


---------66:45----------
world


---------66:46----------
is noble and wonderful and makes the


---------66:50----------
world a better place


---------66:52----------
and is also unfair to you


---------66:56----------
right so these kinds of perspectives is


---------66:58----------
what we try to help people with


---------67:00----------
is that there's definitely a mental


---------67:01----------
health or mental treatment component i


---------67:03----------
think seeing a therapist is a wonderful


---------67:05----------
thing


---------67:06----------
and and i think you're just a really


---------67:07----------
fantastic example of someone who's


---------67:09----------
really internalized


---------67:10----------
i think it is amazing that you know


---------67:11----------
you're saying that you don't really


---------67:12----------
engage in self-injurious behavior


---------67:14----------
anymore we haven't really talked about


---------67:16----------
it but it sounds like some of your


---------67:17----------
eating behaviors are probably better


---------67:19----------
under control


---------67:20----------
things like that and so i think you're


---------67:23----------
a wonderful example of what we try to


---------67:25----------
balance in people which is that there's


---------67:27----------
like a mental


---------67:28----------
health comp or like mental treatment


---------67:29----------
component right


---------67:31----------
which is like the clinical psychiatry


---------67:32----------
and then there's almost like


---------67:34----------
a more spiritual component understanding


---------67:36----------
yourself component


---------67:38----------
finding your purpose in life trying to


---------67:40----------
figure out you know what is the root of


---------67:42----------
these patterns


---------67:43----------
of who you engage in relationships with


---------67:45----------
how can we understand those things


---------67:48----------
uh so that's really what we try to do


---------67:50----------
and we started in the gaming community


---------67:52----------
because i'm a degenerate gamer


---------67:54----------
and um what i really found is that a lot


---------67:57----------
of people


---------67:57----------
in this community like need help and


---------67:59----------
need support and the other really


---------68:01----------
interesting thing is that


---------68:03----------
i found that the standard psychiatry


---------68:04----------
stuff part of the reason it doesn't work


---------68:06----------
ideally is because we actually don't


---------68:08----------
play to the gamer's strengths


---------68:10----------
and in your case nikki like i think


---------68:12----------
playing directly to the strength of your


---------68:14----------
insight like going out and trying stuff


---------68:15----------
like you don't need to do that


---------68:17----------
you can actually figure most of it out


---------68:19----------
up here and i think that's what you've


---------68:20----------
managed to do your entire life


---------68:23----------
right like you've learned how to survive


---------68:25----------
and adapt like


---------68:27----------
all in here and so that's kind of the


---------68:30----------
approach that we take


---------68:33----------
i like that now i'm curious whenever i


---------68:36----------
i say you're insightful like do you does


---------68:38----------
that sink in or do you swat it


---------68:40----------
uh no it doesn't get i i i i take


---------68:43----------
i appreciate that a lot yeah like


---------68:45----------
hearing that from especially you as


---------68:47----------
you know a psychiatrist a trained


---------68:49----------
professional i do appreciate that


---------68:51----------
actually a lot


---------68:52----------
yeah you're you're sneaky enough to be a


---------68:54----------
good psychiatrist


---------68:56----------
thank you


---------68:59----------
um yeah so that's what we do


---------69:03----------
you know we can wrap up now if you want


---------69:05----------
to we can talk about meditation a little


---------69:07----------
bit


---------69:08----------
um if i think this is going to be old


---------69:10----------
news to you but


---------69:12----------
i was thinking about maybe taking a


---------69:14----------
moment to explain a couple of things we


---------69:16----------
haven't talked much about


---------69:17----------
diagnosis and and stuff like that i'm


---------69:19----------
purposely not asking you that question


---------69:20----------
because i don't want to


---------69:22----------
but if people are curious you know i can


---------69:24----------
share some information that may or may


---------69:26----------
not


---------69:27----------
relate to nikki but i think is just


---------69:28----------
useful information to know


---------69:31----------
does that feel safe to you yeah for sure


---------69:33----------
okay


---------69:34----------
so the first thing is that you know what


---------69:36----------
we're hearing from nikki and this


---------69:37----------
happens to a lot of people is that


---------69:40----------
when we grow up in situations where um


---------69:43----------
sometimes we deal with things like abuse


---------69:45----------
and neglect


---------69:46----------
we have to learn like almost as a


---------69:47----------
survival mechanism like


---------69:49----------
how to


---------69:53----------
read other people so there's a lot of


---------69:55----------
evidence that shows there's a really


---------69:57----------
interesting study


---------69:58----------
on people who have borderline disorder


---------70:02----------
which is um a diagnosis that relates to


---------70:05----------
early childhood trauma


---------70:07----------
where if someone's smiling if i'm


---------70:09----------
smiling


---------70:11----------
and then i get mad if you look at that


---------70:13----------
like if if we were to like


---------70:15----------
pause or like take a recording of that


---------70:17----------
video and watch that transition like i'm


---------70:19----------
smiling and then maybe this is like


---------70:20----------
halfway


---------70:21----------
and then i'm mad you know if we look at


---------70:23----------
that transition and we break it up into


---------70:25----------
a hundred still photos


---------70:27----------
where photo number one is 100 smile in


---------70:29----------
photo number two


---------70:30----------
i mean photo number hundred is a hundred


---------70:32----------
percent angry


---------70:34----------
most of us have to cross the halfway


---------70:37----------
point before we can tell that


---------70:38----------
someone isn't smiling anymore we have to


---------70:41----------
be at like 70 percent towards


---------70:42----------
anger people with bpd


---------70:46----------
can detect anger when people are like 80


---------70:49----------
smiling so something happens in our


---------70:52----------
brains when we grow up in environments


---------70:54----------
that are traumatic


---------70:56----------
where when everyone else is smiling we


---------70:58----------
are actually able to pick out


---------71:01----------
like negative things and so it changes


---------71:04----------
the way that we think it's absolutely


---------71:05----------
adaptive mechanism there's an interview


---------71:07----------
that we did with coco b


---------71:08----------
a couple maybe about almost a year ago


---------71:10----------
now where


---------71:12----------
you know he grew up in an abusive house


---------71:14----------
household and i asked him like


---------71:16----------
how many seconds did it take from when


---------71:18----------
your dad walked into the door


---------71:19----------
whether you knew like you know today is


---------71:22----------
a bad day or today is a good day


---------71:24----------
and he's like less than two less than


---------71:27----------
three like you know right away


---------71:29----------
so your brain is actually wiring to


---------71:31----------
detect


---------71:32----------
negative sentiment from other people and


---------71:34----------
that can be really really challenging


---------71:36----------
because like even people who like you


---------71:38----------
eighty percent of the way there


---------71:40----------
all you're gonna see is the 20


---------71:42----------
frustration that they have


---------71:44----------
and that can be very hard for you to


---------71:45----------
like interact with other people because


---------71:47----------
even though


---------71:48----------
most of the people are happy all you're


---------71:49----------
seeing is people being angry


---------71:52----------
and so you know i think that's something


---------71:55----------
that we see a lot with trauma


---------71:57----------
the other interesting thing is that when


---------71:58----------
people you know go through traumatic


---------72:00----------
experiences you develop this voice in


---------72:02----------
your head that kind of


---------72:04----------
talks about how you're a bad person that


---------72:06----------
voice gets reinforced by seeing the 20


---------72:09----------
frustration in every person you meet


---------72:10----------
because it's like you see i told you so


---------72:12----------
i told you so


---------72:13----------
sometimes we also get into weird


---------72:15----------
patterns and we didn't talk too much


---------72:17----------
about this but i'll leave this for you


---------72:19----------
for later but that


---------72:20----------
let's say you meet two people i haven't


---------72:22----------
asked you about your sexuality or


---------72:23----------
anything but i'm just gonna assume a


---------72:24----------
heteronormative perspective for a second


---------72:26----------
so let's say you meet two guys


---------72:28----------
and like one of them genuinely cares


---------72:30----------
about you


---------72:31----------
and one of them is an [ __ ] who


---------72:33----------
pretends to care about you


---------72:34----------
and the interesting thing that can


---------72:36----------
happen is that sometimes


---------72:38----------
the genuine caring actually makes you


---------72:41----------
feel so uncomfortable that you pull away


---------72:43----------
from it


---------72:45----------
and you kind of pick the devil that you


---------72:46----------
know and so this is where like


---------72:49----------
that awareness of that discomfort


---------72:52----------
it becomes really really important and


---------72:54----------
and sort of not giving in to that


---------72:56----------
discomfort or at least


---------72:57----------
noticing okay am i giving into this like


---------72:59----------
why do i not like this guy


---------73:01----------
like what is my mind telling me which


---------73:03----------
voice in my head is the one telling me


---------73:05----------
that this is not the right guy


---------73:08----------
and what what is it that like why am i


---------73:10----------
so enamored with this person


---------73:12----------
oh they're so caring they're willing to


---------73:13----------
drop everything for me


---------73:16----------
you know they met me three days ago and


---------73:18----------
they're gonna move across the country to


---------73:19----------
be with me


---------73:21----------
and it can you can feel so loved but the


---------73:23----------
problem is like that same guy


---------73:25----------
six months later is gonna move across


---------73:27----------
the country for someone else


---------73:30----------
and then the voice in your head is like


---------73:31----------
see i told you so i told you you were


---------73:34----------
unlovable


---------73:35----------
he just got to know you and you couldn't


---------73:38----------
keep up the act for so


---------73:39----------
so long oh you got it


---------73:41----------
[Laughter]


---------73:55----------
see that stuff about you know you being


---------73:58----------
unlovable great because that's what


---------74:00----------
we're talking about


---------74:02----------
is that sometimes that voice tells you


---------74:03----------
that you're fundamentally unlovable


---------74:05----------
because if you are lovable it changes


---------74:07----------
everything


---------74:09----------
and so a lot of times when we deal with


---------74:11----------
those voices we also get into


---------74:14----------
you know our bodies our minds our brains


---------74:16----------
have to cope they have to survive


---------74:18----------
they have to adapt so the voice itself


---------74:21----------
is one adaptation and then we also find


---------74:23----------
i i basically have seen three things


---------74:25----------
consistently one is substance use


---------74:27----------
one is self-harm and third is eating


---------74:29----------
disorder


---------74:32----------
eating disorder is the way that we get


---------74:33----------
control over our life


---------74:35----------
i'm not in control i don't get to choose


---------74:37----------
i'm moving every six months


---------74:39----------
i don't get to choose who my mom hangs


---------74:41----------
out with but i get to control what i put


---------74:43----------
into my body


---------74:45----------
and even when there are lots of signals


---------74:47----------
from your body that are telling you


---------74:49----------
you should eat something you are going


---------74:51----------
to say no despite how hard things get


---------74:53----------
oddly enough


---------74:54----------
the harder things get the more out of


---------74:56----------
control your world is


---------74:58----------
the more empowered you feel by taking


---------75:01----------
control


---------75:02----------
of like all of these sensations from


---------75:04----------
your body you are gonna win


---------75:06----------
at least in this temple that is my body


---------75:08----------
i get to decide what happens


---------75:11----------
and so we see this really interesting


---------75:13----------
like correlation between the eating


---------75:15----------
disorder gets worse


---------75:17----------
when your circumstances get worse and


---------75:20----------
it's like you trying to internally


---------75:22----------
balance stuff


---------75:23----------
self-injurious behavior we talked about


---------75:25----------
a little bit sometimes self-injurious


---------75:27----------
behavior can be


---------75:29----------
the result of like you actually like


---------75:30----------
wanting to hurt yourself


---------75:32----------
but for some people for a lot of people


---------75:34----------
it actually seems to be almost like a


---------75:36----------
meditative technique when i hear people


---------75:37----------
talk about it when i ask them like


---------75:39----------
how do you feel before you do it how do


---------75:40----------
you feel when you do it how do you feel


---------75:41----------
after you do it


---------75:42----------
sounds to me like meditating because you


---------75:44----------
enter this no mind state where your mind


---------75:46----------
is fully focused on the cutting or the


---------75:48----------
burning or the whatever


---------75:50----------
right and then substance use is sort of


---------75:52----------
the easy oblivion


---------75:55----------
this is one that we do gaming to


---------75:58----------
i'm just gonna load up this particular


---------76:00----------
game and i'm gonna forget about all my


---------76:04----------
problems


---------76:06----------
yeah so so kind of like wrapping things


---------76:09----------
up


---------76:09----------
you know here's what i'd say um if


---------76:12----------
anyone is struggling with either


---------76:13----------
substance use eating disorder behaviors


---------76:15----------
or self-harm you guys should really do


---------76:17----------
yourself the benefit i think nikki is


---------76:19----------
the nikki that we're seeing today who's


---------76:20----------
incredibly adaptive and has managed to


---------76:22----------
be like really successful at the age of


---------76:23----------
19 and all that good stuff


---------76:25----------
i think that she's accomplished through


---------76:26----------
like doing a lot of hard work on your


---------76:28----------
own but also having some


---------76:30----------
expert guidance so i encourage anyone to


---------76:32----------
go see a licensed mental health


---------76:33----------
professional


---------76:34----------
if you guys are dealing with any of that


---------76:35----------
stuff um


---------76:37----------
and also to try to understand like the


---------76:38----------
fundamentals of sort of like who you are


---------76:41----------
you know and and at some point nikki i


---------76:44----------
know it's terrifying but


---------76:46----------
at some point no i'm


---------76:49----------
you're gonna push that back let me think


---------76:50----------
about this


---------76:54----------
i was about to say at some point i hope


---------76:56----------
you realize that you are worth caring


---------76:58----------
for


---------76:59----------
intrinsically and and i know that


---------77:01----------
there's a part of you that can get on


---------77:02----------
board with that but there's a part of


---------77:04----------
you that may be pushed that way so i'm


---------77:05----------
going to say something else which is


---------77:06----------
going to be a little bit more terrifying


---------77:08----------
and a little bit more defiant


---------77:09----------
i'm going to choose to care about you


---------77:10----------
whether you like it or not now you think


---------77:16----------
the baseball bat again i'm gonna just


---------77:17----------
care you can


---------77:20----------
go [ __ ] yourself i don't well that


---------77:22----------
doesn't mean that you care about me


---------77:24----------
though


---------77:24----------
huh that doesn't mean you care about me


---------77:26----------
though yeah it's a little bit of a joke


---------77:29----------
i know i'm gonna choose to care about


---------77:31----------
you no matter what you do whether you


---------77:33----------
become a psychiatrist and you save


---------77:34----------
thousands of lives


---------77:35----------
good for you and if you choose not to do


---------77:38----------
that


---------77:38----------
i still think you're a worthwhile person


---------77:40----------
who deserves


---------77:42----------
a place on this earth and deserves


---------77:45----------
happiness


---------77:50----------
sinking in somewhere everyone how much


---------77:53----------
you're swatting


---------78:01----------
yeah enough for today


---------78:06----------
i would say so i think normally i would


---------78:10----------
offer to teach you meditation but i


---------78:11----------
think today is a day where we're not


---------78:13----------
going to do that i think


---------78:14----------
we're going to just let you i've learned


---------78:16----------
a lot about medica


---------78:17----------
meditation that's the other thing and


---------78:20----------
and and maybe what i would yeah so i


---------78:23----------
think we're just going to let you go now


---------78:25----------
okay thank you so much for coming on


---------78:28----------
thank you so much for having me i


---------78:30----------
