today is november 9th which means our


---------00:02----------
coaching program is now live


---------00:04----------
even though our program isn't designed


---------00:05----------
to treat depression or anxiety our


---------00:07----------
clients experience about a 15 to 20


---------00:09----------
reduction in depression and about a 15


---------00:12----------
to 16


---------00:13----------
reduction in anxiety for more

---------00:18----------
hey guys dr k here now i want to talk a


---------00:20----------
little bit about anxiety and hopefully


---------00:22----------
help you all understand a little bit


---------00:24----------
more about


---------00:24----------
what is anxiety how does it actually


---------00:27----------
function


---------00:28----------
and once we understand what it is and


---------00:30----------
what it's supposed to be doing we can


---------00:32----------
start to get a sense of how to overcome


---------00:34----------
it


---------00:35----------
so anxiety is essentially our brain's


---------00:37----------
capacity to predict


---------00:39----------
danger and warn us about it it gives us


---------00:41----------
the opportunity to look into the future


---------00:44----------
see or anticipate problems therefore we


---------00:46----------
can take corrective actions now


---------00:49----------
to prevent bad outcomes that's


---------00:51----------
essentially what anxiety is


---------00:53----------
consider being worried about looking


---------00:55----------
stupid at a party


---------00:56----------
or afraid that you're going to fail a


---------00:58----------
test or being afraid that you're going


---------01:00----------
to get rejected from a job interview


---------01:02----------
all of these things are examples of our


---------01:04----------
mind looking into the future


---------01:08----------
examining things analyzing things and


---------01:10----------
warning us about danger so that we can


---------01:12----------
do something about it


---------01:14----------
and so essentially what happens when our


---------01:16----------
mind worries is it's making predictions


---------01:18----------
of bad outcomes in the future


---------01:20----------
in a hope that it can warn us about it


---------01:22----------
we can kind of do something to correct


---------01:24----------
or prevent it so anxiety is essentially


---------01:27----------
our ability to see


---------01:28----------
problems and consider consequences


---------01:30----------
anxiety is when our mind has thoughts of


---------01:32----------
the future


---------01:33----------
usually associated with negative


---------01:35----------
consequences it involves predicting the


---------01:37----------
impact of current


---------01:38----------
actions into the future and specifically


---------01:41----------
how


---------01:42----------
painful the future will be if we in a


---------01:44----------
particular way now


---------01:47----------
we tend to talk about anxiety like an


---------01:49----------
illness but if we look at the


---------01:50----------
fundamental function of worry


---------01:53----------
let's not forget that most of the time


---------01:55----------
worry isn't a bad thing it's actually a


---------01:56----------
good thing we're wired for it it's


---------01:58----------
something that our brain is telling us


---------02:00----------
to


---------02:00----------
to do so let's try to unpack anxiety a


---------02:04----------
little bit further and we're going to go


---------02:06----------
through


---------02:06----------
two examples kind of as we sort of


---------02:08----------
analyze anxiety


---------02:10----------
and those two examples are going to be


---------02:12----------
being afraid of looking dumb


---------02:14----------
or offending people at a party or being


---------02:16----------
afraid that what we're going to do


---------02:18----------
poorly on a test


---------02:20----------
so the first thing that we need to look


---------02:22----------
at is both of these examples


---------02:23----------
involve you right so anxiety involves


---------02:26----------
thinking about you and the consequences


---------02:28----------
that


---------02:28----------
you may or may not take usually


---------02:32----------
you start with yourself and you look


---------02:33----------
into the future the reason you do this


---------02:35----------
is you try to figure out all the


---------02:37----------
possible


---------02:38----------
solutions to prevent bad outcomes


---------02:41----------
and so anxiety tends to focus on some


---------02:44----------
kind of insecurity


---------02:45----------
oftentimes with you but it could be an


---------02:47----------
insecurity about someone else


---------02:49----------
your sense of your own capability or


---------02:52----------
what you're not good at


---------02:54----------
so in the case of looking dumb or


---------02:55----------
offending people you may not have


---------02:57----------
confidence in yourself as a person


---------02:59----------
somewhere along the way you discover


---------03:00----------
that people may not like you very much


---------03:02----------
or that the only time they like you is


---------03:05----------
if you kind of put on a particular mask


---------03:07----------
or you put on a show


---------03:08----------
and that they they like that version of


---------03:10----------
you but not the real version of you


---------03:12----------
you may believe that you're just not as


---------03:14----------
as charismatic as other people


---------03:16----------
you may find yourself comparing yourself


---------03:19----------
to a lot of other people


---------03:20----------
but at the end of the day there's an


---------03:22----------
insecurity about your likability as a


---------03:24----------
person


---------03:26----------
in the case of studying you may be


---------03:28----------
afraid of failing or


---------03:29----------
fear that you haven't studied enough you


---------03:31----------
may recognize that other people can be


---------03:33----------
confident once again there's going to be


---------03:35----------
comparison there


---------03:36----------
but something just makes you worried


---------03:37----------
that you're not going to do good enough


---------03:39----------
or you're afraid of doing good enough or


---------03:41----------
you're afraid of being good enough


---------03:44----------
sometimes people consider anxiety as


---------03:47----------
stemming from the past


---------03:48----------
now i sort of say that anxiety is the


---------03:50----------
future focused mind


---------03:52----------
but people will say but i have anxiety


---------03:54----------
about the past let's just tunnel down


---------03:56----------
into that tangent for a second


---------03:59----------
people will say oh i messed up last


---------04:00----------
night and if people


---------04:02----------
you know people are gonna dislike me


---------04:04----------
today because i was dumb


---------04:05----------
yesterday at the party or yesterday in


---------04:07----------
class i asked a stupid question


---------04:09----------
so now everyone is gonna think i'm


---------04:10----------
stupid and so they pause for a second


---------04:13----------
and they kind of look back and they say


---------04:14----------
oh i made a mistake yesterday i'm


---------04:16----------
anxious about that


---------04:18----------
but if you really look at it what


---------04:19----------
they're doing is they're looking at an


---------04:21----------
event in the past


---------04:22----------
and they're still projecting the


---------04:24----------
consequences into the future


---------04:27----------
so all anxiety involves looking into the


---------04:30----------
future


---------04:31----------
and even though you can be worried about


---------04:33----------
something that happened in the past if


---------04:35----------
you


---------04:35----------
really pay attention what you're what


---------04:36----------
you're really looking at is you're


---------04:38----------
worried about the consequences


---------04:40----------
that could evolve from actions that


---------04:43----------
happen in the past


---------04:45----------
so we see that anxiety is about


---------04:46----------
predicting possible problems that


---------04:48----------
arise and now we get into another


---------04:51----------
interesting tidbit about anxiety is that


---------04:53----------
since anxiety is about making


---------04:55----------
predictions the smarter you are the more


---------04:58----------
computing power you have to make


---------05:00----------
predictions


---------05:01----------
and this is really really unfortunate


---------05:02----------
because what i find time and time again


---------05:05----------
as a clinician


---------05:06----------
is that the smarter you are the worse or


---------05:08----------
more crippling your anxiety can be


---------05:10----------
the more that your mind is able to


---------05:12----------
compute potential futures the more


---------05:15----------
potential problems that your mind will


---------05:17----------
tell you to worry about


---------05:18----------
and so it's really unfortunate but


---------05:20----------
generally speaking the smarter you are


---------05:22----------
the worse your anxiety is and so now


---------05:25----------
that we kind of sort of


---------05:26----------
dug into a little bit about the you


---------05:28----------
component of anxiety


---------05:30----------
let's look at what the mind does with


---------05:32----------
responding to anxiety


---------05:34----------
so what does the mind do when we


---------05:35----------
actually experience anxiety


---------05:37----------
how do we deal with these worries in the


---------05:39----------
future the short answer is that


---------05:41----------
uncertainty is really frightening so


---------05:43----------
what we try to do is to remove the


---------05:45----------
uncertainty


---------05:46----------
most of anxiety involves an if then sort


---------05:49----------
of statement so we see the then portion


---------05:52----------
so if i say this then people are going


---------05:54----------
to think this right if i go to the party


---------05:56----------
and i speak up people are going to


---------05:57----------
dislike me


---------05:58----------
if i don't study enough i'm going to


---------05:59----------
fail the test and so


---------06:01----------
it's kind of like an if then statement


---------06:03----------
and so what we try to do is we try to


---------06:04----------
fix


---------06:05----------
the then right we try to alleviate


---------06:08----------
our anxiety by essentially controlling


---------06:10----------
something in the future


---------06:12----------
and we may think a little bit about


---------06:14----------
overcompensating


---------06:16----------
so let's take the example of you know i


---------06:17----------
cracked a joke about someone and maybe


---------06:19----------
they're upset


---------06:20----------
by it let me just apologize just in case


---------06:23----------
even if you


---------06:24----------
didn't say anything offensive a lot of


---------06:26----------
times people with with anxiety are so


---------06:28----------
concerned about it that they'll


---------06:29----------
overcompensate


---------06:30----------
and try to control that future in the


---------06:32----------
event that this person is offended


---------06:34----------
let me remove that uncertainty and just


---------06:37----------
apologize just in case


---------06:39----------
the other thing that we try to do to


---------06:41----------
sort of control the future


---------06:43----------
or remove the uncertainty is to not


---------06:46----------
trigger it at all right so if we avoid


---------06:48----------
the situation entirely


---------06:50----------
then we can control any potential


---------06:52----------
negative outcomes that happen


---------06:54----------
so if i don't even show up at the party


---------06:56----------
i can't misspeak


---------06:58----------
i won't people won't think i'm stupid


---------07:00----------
and so how about i just don't go


---------07:02----------
i can control that worry completely by


---------07:04----------
avoiding the situation


---------07:06----------
entirely and for people who are worried


---------07:08----------
about failing a test


---------07:09----------
they'll study extra hard because we're


---------07:12----------
they're so afraid of failing


---------07:14----------
and so they kind of do as much as they


---------07:15----------
can to control the uncertainty of the


---------07:18----------
future


---------07:18----------
by sort of changing something in the


---------07:20----------
here and now


---------07:22----------
and this may sound like sort of a good


---------07:24----------
thing in a sense right like if i'm


---------07:25----------
studying


---------07:26----------
extra for a test like isn't that a good


---------07:28----------
thing the problem is that oftentimes our


---------07:30----------
solutions for anxiety our desire to


---------07:33----------
exert control


---------07:34----------
is very restrictive and actually causes


---------07:36----------
us to suffer


---------07:37----------
so if we think about the social example


---------07:39----------
like sure if i don't go to the party


---------07:41----------
you know no one can think i'm dumb


---------07:42----------
because i'm not there but then i never


---------07:44----------
go to parties


---------07:45----------
and so i actually narrow the scope of my


---------07:48----------
life and i start to restrict


---------07:50----------
the kind of things that i can do and


---------07:52----------
even in the case of studying we're so


---------07:54----------
paranoid that that


---------07:55----------
we're going to fail a test that we skip


---------07:57----------
parties or social events or don't hang


---------07:59----------
out with friends


---------08:00----------
or we stay up way too late or we wake up


---------08:03----------
way early in the morning


---------08:04----------
we miss out on a lot of fun that you can


---------08:06----------
have when you're a student


---------08:07----------
by studying way too hard and this is the


---------08:10----------
really damnable thing which is that


---------08:12----------
anxiety oftentimes has positive benefits


---------08:15----------
let's not forget that anxiety is


---------08:16----------
actually there for a reason and the


---------08:18----------
reason it exists is because generally


---------08:20----------
speaking it helps us out


---------08:22----------
so for example if you look at medical


---------08:23----------
students


---------08:25----------
a lot of medical students have high


---------08:26----------
levels of anxiety and that's part of the


---------08:28----------
reason they got into medical school in


---------08:29----------
the first place


---------08:30----------
because when everyone was out partying


---------08:32----------
they were the ones who were on a friday


---------08:33----------
night


---------08:34----------
at 10 p.m in the library studying for a


---------08:36----------
test


---------08:37----------
and so even though it the event anxiety


---------08:41----------
could be


---------08:41----------
advantageous for us at times generally


---------08:44----------
speaking we want to be really careful


---------08:45----------
because if we give into it and we try to


---------08:47----------
control those


---------08:48----------
uncertainties it actually restricts us


---------08:51----------
or causes us to suffer


---------08:53----------
even though it may give us some kind of


---------08:54----------
material advantage in life


---------08:57----------
the other issue is that oftentimes with


---------09:00----------
anxiety since we're so


---------09:01----------
concerned we actually end up over


---------09:04----------
compensating which can make the problem


---------09:06----------
worse


---------09:07----------
right so if we're concerned that people


---------09:08----------
don't like us and we apologize to


---------09:11----------
profusely


---------09:12----------
then what can happen is we can actually


---------09:13----------
be kind of annoying and make people not


---------09:15----------
like us because we're afraid


---------09:17----------
or we're trying to fix the fact that


---------09:19----------
we're they don't like us that creates a


---------09:22----------
really dangerous loop


---------09:24----------
i'm afraid someone doesn't like me let


---------09:26----------
me apologize


---------09:28----------
since i'm apologizing too much and


---------09:29----------
inappropriately


---------09:31----------
i annoy them and then they end up not


---------09:33----------
liking me right it's this


---------09:35----------
weird self-fulfilling prophecy or


---------09:37----------
vicious cycle


---------09:38----------
and so it's our solution to the anxiety


---------09:41----------
that actually causes our suffering


---------09:43----------
makes our life a little bit more


---------09:44----------
restricted and actually creates problems


---------09:47----------
and the last really really sad and


---------09:49----------
unfortunate thing about anxiety is that


---------09:52----------
sometimes if we give into it other


---------09:54----------
people can take advantage of our


---------09:55----------
insecurity


---------09:56----------
so if you if you are super anxious


---------09:58----------
sometimes you can behave a little bit


---------10:00----------
like a doormat right you're apologizing


---------10:02----------
all the time


---------10:03----------
and sometimes you're going to run across


---------10:04----------
people who never want to


---------10:06----------
admit that they did anything wrong and


---------10:08----------
so they're more than happy to have


---------10:10----------
someone around


---------10:11----------
who is always apologizing for


---------10:14----------
things that aren't their fault makes it


---------10:16----------
a super convenient bearing


---------10:18----------
so it can be really dangerous because


---------10:19----------
sometimes our anxiety


---------10:21----------
results in people taking advantage of us


---------10:24----------
and so how do we deal with this right so


---------10:26----------
sure we've got this issue of okay


---------10:27----------
anxiety is our mind


---------10:29----------
our predictive capability focusing


---------10:32----------
on particular problems in the future


---------10:35----------
based on our on


---------10:36----------
a sense of uncertainty and insecurity


---------10:39----------
usually in ourselves


---------10:41----------
so what do we do about that right so i'm


---------10:43----------
insecure in myself and i'm predicting


---------10:45----------
all these problems and i'm a smart


---------10:46----------
person so i


---------10:47----------
make a lot of predictions and then i try


---------10:49----------
to control that uncertainty by


---------10:52----------
avoiding parties or restricting what i


---------10:54----------
do so how do we break out of this what


---------10:56----------
do we do about it


---------10:58----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------11:00----------
anxiety is literally the mind thinking


---------11:02----------
in the future


---------11:03----------
if we can bring the mind to the present


---------11:06----------
it's it's literally impossible to be


---------11:08----------
anxious i know it sounds completely


---------11:09----------
crazy


---------11:10----------
but if you look at the experience of


---------11:13----------
anxiety your mind


---------11:14----------
is thinking about the future and so


---------11:16----------
anytime you're thinking about the


---------11:17----------
present or focused in the present


---------11:19----------
you can't be anxious good examples of


---------11:22----------
this are like let's say you take a bath


---------11:23----------
or like a nice hot shower


---------11:25----------
and if you're immersed in the experience


---------11:27----------
of taking the shower or the bath


---------11:29----------
you won't be thinking about other things


---------11:31----------
and you can't experience


---------11:32----------
anxiety and we deal with anxiety in all


---------11:35----------
kinds of ways by bringing our mind to


---------11:37----------
the present some of these can actually


---------11:39----------
be harmful but we can


---------11:40----------
see this in things like games or


---------11:42----------
watching videos or watching tv shows or


---------11:45----------
movies


---------11:45----------
or even substances when we play video


---------11:48----------
games for example like our mind stops


---------11:50----------
thinking


---------11:51----------
in that future and starts focusing on


---------11:53----------
the game and then what happens to our


---------11:54----------
anxiety it melts away


---------11:56----------
if we get engrossed in a tv show or


---------11:58----------
something like that


---------11:59----------
then once again we're not thinking in


---------12:01----------
the future and we're not thinking about


---------12:03----------
ourselves we're thinking about something


---------12:04----------
else


---------12:05----------
and so the anxiety falls away sometimes


---------12:08----------
people will use substances like


---------12:10----------
marijuana or alcohol and those certainly


---------12:12----------
help with anxiety as well


---------12:14----------
and how do they help with it they sort


---------12:16----------
of keep our mind it's a biological


---------12:18----------
substance that helps our mind focus a


---------12:20----------
little bit more in the present


---------12:22----------
right and so i'm not advising that these


---------12:24----------
things are actually good in fact i think


---------12:26----------
all three of these are poor choices to


---------12:29----------
deal with anxiety


---------12:30----------
but let's try to map out a full spectrum


---------12:32----------
of how we do deal with anxiety and then


---------12:34----------
we can sort of


---------12:35----------
start to shift gears a little bit


---------12:37----------
towards healthier methods of coping with


---------12:39----------
anxiety


---------12:41----------
so the key thing still remains that


---------12:43----------
anxiety literally cannot exist


---------12:45----------
if you're not thinking about the future


---------12:47----------
and


---------12:48----------
a good example of this is sometimes


---------12:49----------
people will have you know anxiety about


---------12:51----------
let's say going to a party or failing a


---------12:53----------
test


---------12:54----------
and if you really look at people's


---------12:55----------
experience once they sit down and they


---------12:57----------
start to study right once you get


---------12:59----------
engrossed in the act of studying


---------13:01----------
then the anxiety sort of melts away once


---------13:04----------
you actually show up to the party and


---------13:06----------
you stop kind of thinking about it and


---------13:08----------
you start engaging with people


---------13:10----------
for those of you that are a little bit


---------13:11----------
lucky and can focus in those


---------13:13----------
experiences then the anxiety disappears


---------13:16----------
right we can also use like stage anxiety


---------13:18----------
or performance anxiety


---------13:20----------
is a good example that you're really


---------13:22----------
really worried when you go up on stage


---------13:24----------
but once you actually get up on stage


---------13:26----------
hopefully you start to feel way better


---------13:28----------
another great example of that is jumping


---------13:30----------
into a cold swimming pool


---------13:32----------
where before you jump into the water oh


---------13:34----------
my god oh my god it's gonna be so cold


---------13:36----------
it's gonna be so cold it's gonna be so


---------13:37----------
cold it's paralyzing you


---------13:39----------
but once you actually jump into the


---------13:40----------
water generally speaking the anxiety was


---------13:43----------
far more paralytic


---------13:45----------
than the reality of jumping into the


---------13:47----------
water


---------13:48----------
and so if we can sort of engage in the


---------13:50----------
activity


---------13:51----------
then the anxiety will actually start to


---------13:53----------
melt away


---------13:55----------
so the second thing to kind of think


---------13:57----------
about so just to summarize you know if


---------13:58----------
we can bring our mind to the present if


---------14:01----------
we can actually go ahead


---------14:02----------
and jump in the water if we can engage


---------14:04----------
in an activity


---------14:05----------
if we can move away from the future if


---------14:07----------
we can train our mind


---------14:09----------
to focus in the present then anxiety


---------14:11----------
literally cannot exist


---------14:14----------
staggering okay the next thing to think


---------14:17----------
about


---------14:17----------
is that remember anxiety is rooted in


---------14:19----------
some kind of insecurity


---------14:21----------
right so if we think about the cases in


---------14:23----------
which we're not anxious


---------14:25----------
so you may not be anxious hanging out


---------14:27----------
with your dog well


---------14:29----------
why is that it's because you know you


---------14:31----------
have confidence that your dog likes you


---------14:33----------
as a person


---------14:34----------
if you think about even like playing a


---------14:35----------
competitive video game


---------14:37----------
why aren't you anxious when you go into


---------14:38----------
the game it's because you have


---------14:40----------
confidence in your skill


---------14:41----------
in the video game even that you may win


---------14:44----------
or you may lose but you're kind of


---------14:45----------
confident with your ability to face that


---------14:47----------
uncertainty


---------14:48----------
it's kind of weird right because in a


---------14:50----------
game you don't really know whether


---------14:52----------
you're going to win you don't know


---------14:52----------
whether you're going to lose but you


---------14:54----------
have faith in yourself or your skill in


---------14:56----------
the game


---------14:57----------
and so therefore you can face that


---------14:59----------
uncertainty


---------15:00----------
so the second big way to focus on or fix


---------15:03----------
anxiety is not just to kind of bring the


---------15:06----------
mind to the present but it's to focus on


---------15:07----------
the insecurity itself


---------15:09----------
and what do i mean by that it's to


---------15:11----------
develop confidence


---------15:12----------
so let's think about what confidence


---------15:14----------
really means


---------15:16----------
so confidence is literally believing


---------15:18----------
that you have the capacity


---------15:19----------
to deal with the unknown and


---------15:22----------
let's kind of think about that for a


---------15:24----------
second right because if we think about


---------15:25----------
how anxiety functions


---------15:27----------
normally what we do is there's


---------15:28----------
uncertainty in the future


---------15:30----------
and so what we try to do is we try to


---------15:32----------
control that uncertainty right


---------15:35----------
we don't face the uncertainty we try to


---------15:37----------
remove the uncertainty


---------15:38----------
and so every time that you remove the


---------15:41----------
uncertainty you


---------15:42----------
lose the chance to build confidence


---------15:44----------
because confidence comes from


---------15:46----------
when you face something and overcoming


---------15:48----------
the challenge not


---------15:49----------
taking the challenge away and so a lot


---------15:52----------
of our solutions to our anxiety


---------15:54----------
about controlling our future actually


---------15:56----------
prevent us from developing the


---------15:58----------
confidence that we need to really


---------16:00----------
overcome anxiety


---------16:01----------
and i know this sounds absolutely crazy


---------16:03----------
but when we start to control


---------16:05----------
certain circumstances of our life we


---------16:07----------
actually make our anxiety worse


---------16:10----------
because we decrease our confidence


---------16:11----------
because we're never actually facing


---------16:13----------
anything


---------16:13----------
we just avoid playing the game entirely


---------16:17----------
and so the other big solution really is


---------16:20----------
to


---------16:21----------
sort of learn how to develop some


---------16:23----------
confidence and we can go into more


---------16:24----------
detail with that down the road


---------16:26----------
but essentially resolve that personal


---------16:29----------
insecurity that you have um and then as


---------16:33----------
you resolve that personal insecurity


---------16:34----------
you're able to face


---------16:36----------
uncertainty without needing to control


---------16:38----------
it


---------16:39----------
and when you don't need to control your


---------16:41----------
life then your life becomes


---------16:43----------
less restrictive and you become more


---------16:45----------
free


---------16:46----------
so to summarize anxiety is essentially


---------16:49----------
the future focused mind


---------16:52----------
that revolves around a particular


---------16:54----------
insecurity


---------16:55----------
and the smarter you are the more


---------16:57----------
problems you begin to see


---------16:58----------
out in the future and generally speaking


---------17:01----------
what people do with anxiety is they


---------17:03----------
they try to distract themselves or they


---------17:05----------
try to control


---------17:06----------
their future they try to remove


---------17:08----------
uncertainty from the equation


---------17:11----------
and so generally speaking what we want


---------17:13----------
to do is be really really careful


---------17:14----------
because a lot of our solutions


---------17:17----------
for anxiety actually make our anxiety


---------17:19----------
worse


---------17:20----------
and what we want to wind up doing


---------17:21----------
instead is actually learn how to focus


---------17:24----------
our mind in the present


---------17:25----------
right so if we can bring our mind to the


---------17:27----------
task at hand


---------17:29----------
then anxiety literally can't exist


---------17:32----------
because anxiety by definition is us


---------17:34----------
thinking about the future


---------17:35----------
so you can unplug into anxiety entirely


---------17:37----------
by focusing on the present


---------17:39----------
the second thing that you can do is


---------17:42----------
develop confidence


---------17:43----------
in relation to your insecurities and


---------17:46----------
what that


---------17:46----------
helps us do is the more confident we


---------17:48----------
become the more that we can face the


---------17:50----------
uncertainty of anxiety


---------17:51----------
because remember anxiety is if then


---------17:53----------
statements if happens then what am i


---------17:55----------
going to do


---------17:55----------
if this happens then what am i going to


---------17:56----------
do this happens in what i'm going to do


---------17:59----------
and if you become confident yourself


---------18:00----------
you're like okay if that happens


---------18:02----------
i'll handle it if this happens we'll


---------18:04----------
cross that bridge when we come to it


---------18:06----------
and if i offend someone and they don't


---------18:08----------
like me well then they don't like me and


---------18:09----------
if i did something wrong i'll apologize


---------18:11----------
and if i didn't then no big deal


---------18:13----------
not everyone has to like me terrifying


---------18:15----------
thoughts for someone


---------18:16----------
with anxiety but our goal here is to try


---------18:19----------
to help you guys learn a little bit more


---------18:21----------
about


---------18:22----------
anxiety and a little bit more about how


---------18:24----------
to develop these solutions


---------18:26----------
so that you can ultimately conquer it


---------18:27----------
and it doesn't have to plague you


---------18:29----------
all the time so i hope that was helpful


---------18:31----------
thanks for listening


---------18:32----------
and adios from dr k


---------18:44----------
you
